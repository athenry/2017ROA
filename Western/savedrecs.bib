Abstract = {{Redox-active organic compounds have been studied as corrosion inhibitors
   for steel. Even though it is clear that chemical interactions at the
   organic metal oxide interface are behind this inhibitive process, the
   detailed mechanism is not yet fully understood. Using phenyl-capped
   aniline tetramer (PCAT), we have elucidated the interactions at the
   interface with iron oxide. We demonstrate the partial reduction of fully
   oxidized PCAT and the partial oxidation of fully reduced PCAT upon
   interaction with iron oxide. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals
   the appearance of charged nitrogen structures in PCAT deposited on
   hematite. Iron oxide films in contact with reduced PCAT show a higher
   conductance due to the introduction of defects, resulting in n- doping.
   In contrast, the iron oxide film in contact with oxidized PCAT shows a
   lower conductance, indicating that defects in the film are removed via
   oxidation, thus reducing the doping level. This is consistent with
   accepted models for corrosion inhibition, in which PCAT assists in the
   formation of a passive oxide film. These results are indicative of
   interfacial charge transfer between PCAT and iron oxide. The extent of
   the charge transfer and the direction of redox processes depend on the
   oxidation state of the molecules, enabling the construction of
   redox-active devices, including sensors and switches.}},

Abstract = {{Cultivating anodic respiring bacteria (ARB) on anodes doped with
   metal-enhanced biological growth and affected higher electocatalytic
   activity (ECA). The anode doped with calcium sulfide (CaS) proved more
   favorable for ARB than the magnetite (Fe3O4) or iron(II) sulfide (FeS).
   Average anodic current densities of 8.4 Am2- (Fe3O4), 11.1 Am2- (FeS),
   and 22.0 Am2- (CaS) were achieved as compared to that of nondoped carbon
   (5.1 A m(-2)). Thus, CaS-doped graphite represents a promising anode
   material which is suitable for highly efficient bioelectrochemical
   systems (BES). Electrochemical evaluation during turnover and starvation
   using simple cycle voltammetry (CV) and derivative cycle voltammetry
   (DCV) indicated several extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathways
   characterized with lower potentials for biofilms. However, despite the
   high affinity of bacteria to iron, their lower ECA was kinetically
   attributed to the accumulation of self-produced mediators on iron-doped
   anodes.}},

Abstract = {{Polymers that undergo end-to-end depolymerization in response to the
   cleavage of a stimuli-responsive end-cap are promising for diverse
   applications from drug delivery to responsive coatings and plastics. It
   is critical that the end-cap is designed to respond to an appropriate
   stimulus for the application. In the current work, end-caps for
   triggering the depolymerization of poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) were
   explored. First, a phenylboronate, a disulfide, and an azobenzene were
   utilized to impart redox-responsive properties to PEtG. Then,
   methoxy-substituted trityl groups were used to provide, sensitivity to
   mild acid. A multiresponsive platform was also introduced, allowing PEtG
   to respond to multiple stimuli, either simultaneously or independently.
   Incorporation of a cross-linkable trialkene end-cap enabled the
   preparation of networks that could subsequently be depolymerized.
   Finally, high molar mass PEtG could be depolymerized by mechanical
   stimulation independent of the end-cap. It is anticipated that the
   versatility in end-capping strategies and potential depolymerization
   stimuli will not only expand PEtG's utility for different applications
   but also be useful for other classes of end-to-end depolymerizable
   polymers.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{A systematic investigation is presented for the magnetization dynamics
   in trilayer nanowires, consisting of two permalloy (Ni80Fe20) layers
   separated by a nonmagnetic Ru spacer layer. The width of the wires
   ranges from 90 to 190 mm By varying the Ru thickness between 0.7 and 2.0
   nm, the interlayer coupling can be effectively controlled, modifying the
   corresponding magnetic ground state and the spin-wave dynamics. By
   contrast with previous work on coupled trilayer nanowires with larger
   widths (270 nm and more), the focus here is on nanowire arrays where the
   strong shape anisotropy competes with the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida
   interactions and biquadratic exchange interactions across the Ru
   interface, as well as dipolar interactions and Zeeman energy. As a
   result, the spin-wave spectrum is found to be drastically modified.
   Ferromagnetic resonance and hysteresis loop measurements are reported
   over a wide range of applied magnetic fields, showing that the overall
   magnetization alignment between the permalloy layers may be parallel,
   antiparallel, or in a spin-flop state, depending on the overall
   interlayer coupling. The experimental results for different stripe
   widths are successfully analyzed using a microscopic dipole-dipole
   theory and micromagnetic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated in single-stage and two-stage batches, the
   anaerobic digestibility of hydrolysates obtained from poplar wood
   biomass pretreated using the twin screw extrusion (TSE) process. The TSE
   process produced two distinct sugar-rich streams i.e. the liquid and
   solid streams. The liquid streams showed significantly higher hydrogen
   production potential and rates, comparable methane production potential
   and yields, but higher methane production rates than the solid streams
   in the single-stage BMP tests. This study revealed that the two-stage
   process for separate acidogenic and methanogenic processes, maximized
   both COD removal efficiencies and energy recovery as well as enhanced
   the overall process efficiency. Energy yields of 11.6 kJ/gCOD(feedstock)
   and 9.8 kJ/gCOD(feedstock) were obtained from the liquid and solid
   streams respectively in the two-stage anaerobic digestion process
   compared with 8.7kJ/gCOD(feedstock) and 8.3 kJ/gCOD(feedstock) obtained
   in the single stage BMP process which are a 33\% and 18\% increase
   respectively. Feedstock COD removal efficiency was enhanced in the
   second-stage BMP process after acidification by 16\% and 14\% for the
   liquid and solid streams respectively compared to the single-stage BMP
   process. This work demonstrated the overall potential of poplar wood
   hydrolysates for sequential hydrogen and methane production. (C) 2016

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Efficiencies in photocatalytic reactors for air treatment have to be
   established on the basis of Quantum Yields (QY) and Photochemical
   Thermodynamic Efficiency Factors (PTEFs) using rigorous methods. This
   involves the evaluation of absorbed photons on the TiO2 using
   macroscopic balances. These balances have to account for the incident,
   the reflected and the transmitted radiation. Moreover, hydroxyl radical
   formation enthalpy is required for PTEF calculations. This proposed
   methodology is illustrated in the present study using a spray
   immobilized photocatalyst in a Photo-CREC-Air unit. The operation of
   this unit with acetaldehyde model compounds provides high and promising
   maximum QYs of 124\%. These experimentally measured QYs are close to the
   133\% QY anti cipated theoretical limit. Regarding maximum PTEFs, they
   were 24\%, for acetaldehyde, showing a high degree of photonic energy
   utilization. Results obtained also allow one to establish the energy
   required for reacting hydroxyl radical formation, key species for
   converting organic molecules in photocatalysis. These energy demands
   affect photoconversion rates and efficiency factors, as observed for
   acetone and acetaldehyde. Results obtained also demonstrate the special
   value of experimentally established macroscopic balances. Macroscopic
   balances allow decoupling photocatalyst efficiency and photoreactor
   efficiency. This approach is critical to clarify key engineering issues
   for scaling up photocatalytic reactors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   Additive performance under FCC conditions}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates a new Zn-OFF additive (3.5 wt\% of Zn in an
   offretite zeolite) to reduce sulfur in gasoline range hydrocarbons. The
   additive is contacted with Thiophene (Th), 2-methyl-thiophene (2MTh) and
   2,5-dimethyl-thiophene (25DMTh) which are used to represent sulfur
   species. These species are concurrently fed with 1,3,5 trimethylbenzene
   (TMB) into a CREC Fluidized Reactor Simulator. Selected temperatures,
   partial pressures, reaction times and C/Os (catalyst/oil) are
   representative of operating conditions in FCC industrial units. It is
   proven that the Zn-OFF additive displays an excellent performance for
   2MTh selective adsorption. The best sulfur removal using the Zn-OFF
   additive was found using the 2MTh at 530 degrees C and 5 s. It is
   hypothesized that the selective sulfur adsorption on the Zn-OFF additive
   involves dominant Lewis acid sites. On the basis of the results
   reported, it is anticipated that the Zn-OFF additive can provide a
   valuable ``in situ{''} sulfur selective adsorption for the thiophene
   compounds. It is also found that the used Zn-OFF additive while blended
   with a FCC commercial catalyst mixture reduces coke production, in
   particular sulfur in coke. It is thus, demonstrated that under typical
   FCC unit operating conditions, the Zn-OFF additive can decrease sulfur
   in coke with this leading to a mitigation of SO,, emissions in the FCC
   regenerator, where coke is combusted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel fluidizable K-doped HAc-Li4SiO4 sorbent using an incipient
   impregnation method was prepared in this work. The produced sorbent
   displayed an excellent CO2 sorption capacity and stability under
   expected reaction conditions. Glacial acetic acid treatment was first
   used to modify the Li4SiO4 sorbent microstructure. Following this step,
   an incipient impregnation method was applied to dope potassium onto the
   sorbent in order to further enhance the sorbent sorption capacity. This
   novel K doped HAc-Li4SiO4 sorbent was characterized using X-ray
   diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption, CO2 temperature-programmed
   carbonation (CO3-TPC), and CO2 temperature programmed decarbonation
   (CO2-TPDC) analyses. The experimental results showed that the CO2
   sorption capacity of the K doped HAc-Li4SiO4 sorbent is approximately
   100 cm(3) STP CO2/g sorbent. This was five times that of the Li4SiO4
   sorbent. Furthermore, the cyclic test of the K-doped HAc-Li4SiO4 sorbent
   demonstrated it to be high and stable for CO2 capture.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the critical importance of the particle state in TiO2
   immobilized photocatalysis. To address this, TiO2 coatings are prepared
   using two methods: an Air Assisted Spray with an Automatized Spinning
   Coating (TiO2-AAS-ASC) and a Spread Coating (TiO2-SCM). The state of the
   TiO2 particles is investigated using SEM and local gravimetry. It is
   proven that the TiO2-AAS-ASC displays homogeneity, limited particle
   agglomeration, close to optimum thickness and stability under flow.
   Furthermore, the prepared coatings are evaluated in terms of
   photoactivity using acetone in air mineralization in the 24-49 mu moI/L
   initial concentration range. This allows Quantum Efficiency evaluations
   based on absorbed photons and hydroxyl radical consumed. It is proven
   that the TiO2-AAS-ASC exhibits a close to expected optimum photoactivity
   and QYs in the 0.4-0.5 range. Furthermore, when the TiO2-AAS-ASC is
   assessed in terms of QY per unit weight of photocatalyst (QY/W), it
   shows a value 3 times higher than the TiO2-SCM. This high photon
   utilization is close to the best possible level expected for an
   optimized TiO2 coating. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: With the tremendous advances in the field of brain computer
   interfaces (BCI), the literature in this field has grown exponentially;
   examination of highly cited articles is a tool that can help identify
   outstanding scientific studies and landmark papers. This study examined
   the characteristics of 100 highly cited BCI papers over the past 10
   years.
   Methods: The Web of Science was searched for highly cited papers related
   to BCI research published from 2006 to 2015. The top 100 highly cited
   articles were identified. The number of citations and countries, and the
   corresponding institutions, year of publication, study design, and
   research area were noted and analyzed.
   Results: The 100 highly cited articles had a mean of 137.1(SE: 15.38)
   citations. These articles were published in 45 high-impact journals, and
   mostly in TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (n=14). Of the 100
   articles, 72 were original articles and the rest were review articles.
   These articles came from 15 countries, with the USA contributing most of
   the highly cited articles (n =52). Fifty-seven institutions produced
   these 100 highly cited articles, led by Duke University (n = 7).
   Conclusions: This study provides a historical perspective on the
   progress in the field of BCI, allows recognition of the most influential
   reports, and provides useful information that can indicate areas
   requiring further investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The compressibility of the spinel solid solutions, (Mg1-xMnx) Cr2O4 with
   x = 0.00 (0), 0.20 (0), 0.44 (2), 0.61 (2), 0.77 (2) and 1.00 (0), has
   been investigated by using a diamond-anvil cell coupled with synchrotron
   X-ray radiation up to similar to 10 GPa (ambient T). The second-order
   BircheMurnaghan equation of state was used to fit the P-V data, yielding
   the following values for the isothermal bulk moduli (K-T), 198.2 (36),
   187.8 (87), 176.1 (32), 168.7 (52), 192.9 (61) and 199.2 (61) GPa, for
   the spinel solid solutions with x = 0.00 (0), 0.20 (0), 0.44 (2), 0.61
   (2), 0.77 (2) and 1.00 (0), respectively (K'T fixed as 4). The K-T value
   of the MgCr2O4 spinel is in good agreement with existing experimental
   determinations and theoretical calculations. The correlation between the
   K-T and x is not monotonic, with the K-T values similar at both ends of
   the binary MgCr2O4-MnCr2O4, but decreasing towards the middle. This
   non-monotonic correlation can be described by two equations, K-T = -49.2
   (11)x + 198.0 (4) (x <= similar to 0.6) and K-T - 92 (41) x + 115 (30)
   (x >= similar to 0.6), and can be explained by the evolution of the
   average bond lengths of the tetrahedra and octahedra of the spinel solid
   solutions. Additionally, the relationship between the thermal expansion
   coefficient and composition is correspondingly reinterpreted, the
   continuous deformation of the oxygen array is demonstrated, and the
   evolution of the component polyhedra is discussed for this series of
   spinel solid solutions. Our results suggest that the correlation between
   the K-T and composition of a solid solution series may be complicated,
   and great care should be paid while estimating the K-T of some
   intermediate compositions from the K-T of the end-members. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Temporal upscaling of surface urban heat island by incorporating an

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{186}},

Abstract = {{Satellite thermal remote sensing potentially provides a new way to
   monitor local climate change due to urbanization, especially changes in
   surface temperatures that result in the surface urban heat island
   (SUHI). However, this technique is restricted to clear-sky conditions.
   Because of this limitation, satellite-derived land surface temperature
   (LST) records are frequently interrupted, sometimes even becoming
   temporally sparse and, accordingly, climatically less representative.
   Given this challenge, we propose a strategy that incorporates an annual
   temperature cycle (ATC) model to perform temporal upscaling of the SUHI
   from a climatic perspective. Using two mega-cities (Beijing and
   Shanghai) as case studies, our major findings include: (1) urbanization
   tends to enlarge the amplitude of annual daytime LST series for both
   cities; (2) urbanization in Beijing narrows the diurnal LST range on
   annual average but broadens it in Shanghai; (3) within an annual cycle,
   the daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) reaches its maximum one month later
   than the daytime LST maximum for Beijing, whereas this time difference
   is negligible for Shanghai; and (4) compared with the observation-based
   and moving-window-based temporal aggregations, the ATC-based temporal
   aggregation allows to produce a clear-sky SUHI climatology that is more
   representative and becomes potentially valuable for prediction or
   application purposes. From a climatic perspective, the temporal
   upscaling of the SUHI, therefore, provides insights into the impacts on
   local thermal environments that are induced by urbanization. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new design technique and analysis for a microstrip
   Rotman lens which is feeding a wide bandwidth series-fed microstrip
   patch antenna array. In the proposed Rotman lens method, the length of
   the transmission lines does not affect the progressive phase delay. This
   reduces the complexity of the design and improves the performance
   parameters. An antenna array is utilized using open ended lambda/4 stubs
   to support high gain, directivity, and a wide bandwidth. The Rotman lens
   and antenna arrays are fabricated on the top layer of a multilayer low
   temperature cofired ceramic substrate. The Rotman lens has been designed
   based on the presented technique, which has five beam ports, five array
   ports, four dummy ports, and a footprint as small as 11 mm x 10.7 mm at
   60 GHz operation frequency. The implemented lens and antenna array
   exhibits good insertion loss, return loss, and wide bandwidth and shows
   phase error as small as 0.45 degrees in the worst case scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Unstable intertrochanteric fractures are commonly treated with a
   cephalomedullary nail due to high failure rates with a sliding hip
   screw. The Omega3 Trochanteric Stabilizing Plate is a relatively new
   device that functions like a modified sliding hip screw with a proximal
   extension; however, its mechanical properties have not been evaluated.
   This study biomechanically compared a cephalomedullary nail, that is,
   Gamma3 Nail against the Omega3 plate. Unstable intertrochanteric
   fractures were created in 24 artificial femurs. Experimental groups were
   as follows: Nail (i.e. Gamma3 Nail) (n = 8), Plate A (i.e. Omega3 plate
   with four distal non-locking screws and no proximal locking screws) (n =
   8), Plate B (i.e. Plate A plus five proximal locking screws) (n = 8),
   Plate C (i.e. Omega3 plate with three distal locking screws and no
   proximal locking screws) (n = 8), and Plate D (i.e. Plate C plus five
   proximal locking screws) (n = 8). All specimens were stiffness tested,
   while the Nail and Plate D groups were also strength tested. For lateral
   bending, Plate B was less stiff than the Nail (p = 0.001) and Plate A (p
   = 0.009). For torsion, Plate A was less stiff than Plate D (p = 0.020).
   For axial compression, the Nail was less stiff than Plate A (p = 0.036)
   and Plate B (p = 0.008). Axial strength for the Nail (5014 +/- 308 N)
   was 66\% higher than the Plate D construct (2940 +/- 411 N) (p < 0.001).
   All Nails failed by partial or complete cutout through the femoral head
   and neck, but Plate D failed by varus collapse and deformation of the
   lag screw. When the cephalomedullary nail is clinically
   contra-indicated, this study supports the use of the Omega3 plate, since
   it had similar stiffness in three test modes to the Gamma3 Nail, but had
   lower strength. Stability of Omega3 plate constructs was not improved
   with locked fixation proximally or distally.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the gap achieved
   to the medial and lateral compartments following sectioning and release
   of the relevant soft tissues in preparation for a total knee
   arthroplasty.
   Methods: A custom-designed knee tensioner allowed the application of
   forces to the medial and lateral compartments of 12 cadaveric knee
   specimens. Loads of 100 N and 200 N were applied to each compartment,
   and the resulting displacement was measured in the following conditions:
   (1) All soft tissues intact, (2) an arthrotomy, (3) anterior cruciate
   ligament (ACL) sectioned, (4) posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
   sectioned, and (5) release of the anterior aspect of the deep medial
   collateral ligament (MCL) fibers. Tensions were applied for all
   conditions from 90 degrees to 0 degrees of knee flexion in 30 degrees
   increments.
   Results: No differences were found in medial or lateral displacement
   after the arthrotomy or releasing the ACL or PCL at either 100 N or 200
   N. At the 100 N load application, there was a significant increase in
   gap width when the anterior portion of the deep MCL was released (7.49
   mm) compared to the intact (5.28 mm) and arthrotomy (5.75 mm)
   conditions. With respect to the 200 N load application, there were
   statistically significant differences detected between the deep MCL
   fiber release (11.09 mm) and intact conditions (8.05 mm) and release of
   the deep MCL and arthrotomy conditions (8.77 mm).
   Conclusion: The medial parapetellar arthrotomy, ACL and PCL sectioning
   did not result in medial or lateral displacement changes. The release of
   the anterior fibers of the deep MCL as part of the surgical exposure
   increased the medial gap magnitude. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Detection of Sensor Abnormalities in a Pressurizer by Means of
   Analytical Redundancy}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2925-2933}},

Abstract = {{To improve the reliability of pressurizer level measurement channels
   against sensor common cause failures (CCFs), a sensor fault detection
   scheme has been developed based on analytical redundancy in this paper.
   The fault detection mechanism has been transformed into statistical
   tests on a Kalman filter generated innovation sequence. An exponentially
   weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme has been developed to work with
   other sensor channels to ensure that the abnormality can be detected and
   isolated as quickly as possible. Because analytical redundancy does not
   share the same failure modes as existing sensor channels, the overall
   reliability of the measurement system has been improved. The paper
   provides a detailed procedure for formulating analytical redundancy,
   generating the corresponding innovation sequence, and detailing the
   design and implementation of the proposed detection scheme. Finally, the
   performance of the proposed scheme has been evaluated in a CANDU (Canada
   deuterium uranium) pressurizer to demonstrate its potential benefits.
   The speed of the fault detection is also evaluated against that of the
   average run length of the Shewhart control chart. It can be concluded
   that the proposed scheme is significantly more sensitive to sensor
   abnormalities at an earlier stage in their development. Even though
   level measurement channels in a pressurizer are considered, the
   methodology and design techniques can easily be extended to other
   systems/applications.}},

Abstract = {{Email spam is one of the biggest threats to today's Internet. To deal
   with this threat, there are long-established measures like supervised
   anti-spam filters. In this paper, we report the development and
   evaluation of SENTINEL-an anti-spam filter based on natural language and
   stylometry attributes. The performance of the filter is evaluated not
   only on non-personalized emails (i.e., emails collected randomly) but
   also on personalized emails (i.e., emails collected from particular
   individuals). Among the non-personalized datasets are CSDMC2010,
   SpamAssassin, and LingSpam, while the Enron-Spam collection comprises
   personalized emails. The proposed filter extracts natural language
   attributes from email text that are closely related to writer stylometry
   and generate classifiers using multiple learning algorithms.
   Experimental outcomes show that classifiers generated by meta-learning
   algorithms such as ADABOOSTM1 and BAGGING are the best, performing
   equally well and surpassing the performance of a number of filters
   proposed in previous studies, while a random forest generated classifier
   is a close second. On the other hand, the performance of classifiers
   using support vector machine and Naive Bayes is not satisfactory. In
   addition, we find much improved results on personalized emails and mixed
   results on non-personalized emails.}},

Abstract = {{Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is one of the main tasks
   in software project management. It is crucial for a project manager to
   efficiently predict the effort or cost of a software project in a
   bidding process, since overestimation will lead to bidding loss and
   underestimation will cause the company to lose money. Several SDEE
   models exist; machine learning models, especially neural network models,
   are among the most prominent in the field. In this study, four different
   neural network models-multilayer perceptron, general regression neural
   network, radial basis function neural network, and cascade correlation
   neural network-are compared with each other based on: (1) predictive
   accuracy centred on the mean absolute error criterion, (2) whether such
   a model tends to overestimate or underestimate, and (3) how each model
   classifies the importance of its inputs. Industrial datasets from the
   International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) are used to
   train and validate the four models. The main ISBSG dataset was filtered
   and then divided into five datasets based on the productivity value of
   each project. Results show that the four models tend to overestimate in
   80 \% of the datasets, and the significance of the model inputs varies
   based on the selected model. Furthermore, the cascade correlation neural
   network outperforms the other three models in the majority of the
   datasets constructed on the mean absolute residual criterion.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The laminar flow over a concave surface may undergo transition to a
   turbulent state driven by secondary instabilities initiated by the
   longitudinal vortices known as Gortler vortices. These vortices distort
   the boundary layer structure by modifying the streamwise velocity
   component in both spanwise and wall-normal directions. Numerical
   simulations have been conducted to identify the role of the external
   pressure gradients in the development and saturation of the vortices.
   The results show that flows with adverse pressure gradients reach

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the effects of urban geometry on retrieval
   of emissivity and surface temperature in urban areas. An improved urban
   emissivity model based on sky view factor (IUEM-SVF) was further
   enhanced to consider all radiance contributions leaving the urban
   canopy, including (i) emission by all facets within an instantaneous
   field of view (IFOV); (ii) reflection by all facets of emission from
   surrounding facets; and (iii) propagation of emitted and reflected
   radiation with multiple reflections (scattering) within a complex 3D
   array of urban objects. The effective emissivity derived from IUEM-SVF
   was evaluated with a microscale radiative transfer and energy balance
   model: Temperatures of Urban Facets in 3-D (TUF-3D). IUEM-SVF performs
   well when urban facets have uniform emissivity and temperature; e.g.,
   root mean square deviations (RMSD) are less than 0.005 when material
   emissivity is larger than 0.80 (epsilon >= 0.80). However, when material
   emissivities are variable within the observed target, differences of
   effective emissivity between IUEM-SVF and TUF-3D become larger, e.g.,
   RMSD of 0.010. When the effect of geometry is not considered and a mixed
   pixel emissivity is defined, the difference is even much larger (i.e.
   0.02) and this difference increases with the decrease of sky view
   factor. Thus, the geometry effect should be considered in the
   determination of effective emissivity. Effective emissivity derived from
   IUEM-SVF was used to retrieve urban surface temperature from a nighttime
   ASTER thermal infrared image. Promising results were achieved in
   comparison with standard LST products retrieved with the Temperature and
   Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. IUEM-SVF shows promise as a means
   to improve the accuracy of urban surface temperature retrieval. The
   effect of thermal heterogeneity on the effective emissivity was also
   evaluated by TUF-3D, and results show that the thermal heterogeneity
   cannot be neglected since the RMSD between the effective emissivity
   based on TUF-3D and IUEM-SVF is relatively large. (C) 2016 International

Abstract = {{The two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is an extremely
   polyphagous crop pest. Alongside an unparalleled detoxification
   potential for plant secondary metabolites, it has recently been shown
   that spider mites can attenuate or even suppress plant defenses.
   Salivary constituents, notably effectors, have been proposed to play an
   important role in manipulating plant defenses and might determine the
   outcome of plant-mite interactions. Here, the proteomic composition of
   saliva from T. urticae lines adapted to various host plantsbean, maize,
   soy, and tomatowas analyzed using a custom-developed feeding assay
   coupled with nano-LC tandem mass spectrometry. About 90 putative T.
   urticae salivary proteins were identified. Many are of unknown function,
   and in numerous cases belonging to multimembered gene families. RNAseq
   expression analysis revealed that many genes coding for these salivary
   proteins were highly expressed in the proterosoma, the mite body region
   that includes the salivary glands. A subset of genes encoding putative
   salivary proteins was selected for whole-mount in situ hybridization,
   and were found to be expressed in the anterior and dorsal podocephalic
   glands. Strikingly, host plant dependent expression was evident for
   putative salivary proteins, and was further studied in detail by
   micro-array based genome-wide expression profiling. This meta-analysis
   revealed for the first time the salivary protein repertoire of a
   phytophagous chelicerate. The availability of this salivary proteome
   will assist in unraveling the molecular interface between phytophagous
   mites and their host plants, and may ultimately facilitate the
   development of mite-resistant crops. Furthermore, the technique used in
   this study is a time- and resource-efficient method to examine the
   salivary protein composition of other small arthropods for which saliva
   or salivary glands cannot be isolated easily.}},

Abstract = {{Spent K-Cups were liquefied into crude bio-oil in a water-ethanol
   co-solvent mixture and reaction conditions were optimized using response
   surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD). The
   effects of three independent variables on the yield of crude bio-oil
   were examined, including the reaction temperature (varied from 255
   degrees C to 350 degrees C), reaction time (varied from 0 min to 25 min)
   and solvent/feedstock mass ratio (varied from 2:1 to 12:1). The optimum
   reaction conditions identified were 276 degrees C, 3 min, and
   solvent/feedstock mass ratio of 11:1, giving a mass fraction yield of
   crude bio-oil of 60.0\%. The overall carbon recovery at the optimum
   conditions was 93\% in mass fraction. The effects of catalyst addition
   (NaOH and H2SO4) on the yield of crude bio-oil were also investigated
   under the optimized reaction conditions. The results revealed that the
   presence of NaOH promoted the decomposition of feedstock and
   significantly enhanced the bio-oil production and liquefaction
   efficiency, whereas the addition of H2SO4 resulted in a negative impact
   on the liquefaction process, decreasing the yield of crude bio-oil. (C)

Abstract = {{The down-regulation of CD3 protein present on the surface of a T-cell
   triggers the process of activation. A rapid decrease of CD3 from the
   surface is required to reach the threshold that is necessary for the
   continuation of the activation process. Using the flow cytometry
   technique, it is well established that an amount of down-regulated CD3
   proteins recycle and may appear on the surface of T-cell. This article
   studies the impact of recycled CD3 protein that is recruited into the
   immune synapse at different rates. The population density of T-cells is
   distributed over surface protein (CD3) concentration under the framework
   of population balance models by using a coupled system of PDEs. Such
   problems need non-conventional population balance modelling so that
   classical numerical techniques can be applied. A recently developed
   efficient numerical method is validated against the analytical and
   numerical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{We present new spatially resolved astrometry and photometry from the
   Gemini Planet Imager of the inner binary of the young multiple star
   system V343 Normae, which is a member of the beta Pictoris (beta Pic)
   moving group. V343 Normae comprises a K0 and mid-M star in a similar to
   4.5 year orbit (AaAb) and a wide 10 `' M5 companion (B). By combining
   these data with archival astrometry and radial velocities we fit the
   orbit and measure individual masses for both components of M-Aa = 1.10
   +/- 0.10M(circle dot) and M-Ab= 0.290 +/- 0.018 M-circle dot. Comparing
   to theoretical isochrones, we find good agreement for the measured
   masses and JHK band magnitudes of the two components consistent with the
   age of the beta Pic moving group. We derive a model-dependent age for
   the beta Pic moving group of 26 +/- 3 Myr by combining our results for
   V343 Normae with literature measurements for GJ. 3305, which is another
   group member with resolved binary components and dynamical masses.}},

Journal = {{BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{491-517}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate how application of the stochastic estimation method can
   be employed to combine spatially well-resolved wind-tunnel particle
   image velocimetry measurements with instantaneous velocity signals from
   a limited number of sensors (six sonic anemometers located within the
   canyon in the present case) to predict full-scale flow dynamics in an
   entire street-canyon cross-section. The investigated configuration
   corresponds to a street-canyon flow in a neutrally stratified
   atmospheric boundary layer with the oncoming flow being perpendicular to
   the main canyon axis. Data were obtained during both full-scale and
   1:200-scale wind-tunnel experiments. The performance of the proposed
   method is investigated using both wind-tunnel data and signals from five
   sonic anemometers to predict the velocity from the sixth one. In
   particular, based on analysis of the influence of the high-frequency
   velocity fluctuations on the quality of the reconstruction, it is shown
   that stochastic estimation is able to correctly reproduce the
   large-scale temporal features of the flow with the present set-up. The
   full dataset is then used to spatially extrapolate the instantaneous
   flow measured by the six sonic anemometers and perform detailed analysis
   of instantaneous flow features. The main features of the flow, such as
   the presence of the shear layer that develops over the canyon and the
   intermittent ejection and penetration events across the canyon opening,
   are well predicted by stochastic estimation. In addition, thanks to the
   high spatial resolution made possible by the technique, the
   intermittency of the main vortical structure existing within the canyon
   is demonstrated, as well as its meandering motion in the canyon
   cross-section. It is also shown that the canyon flow, particularly its
   spanwise component, is affected by large-scale fluctuations of low
   temporal frequency along the canyon axis. Finally, the proposed
   techniques based on wind-tunnel data can prove useful for a priori
   design of field experiments to determine the optimum location of sensors
   beforehand.}},

Title = {{Iodine potassium iodide improves the contrast-to-noise ratio of
   micro-computed tomography images of the human middle ear}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{264}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution imaging of middle-ear geometry is necessary for
   finite-element modeling. Although micro-computed tomography (microCT) is
   widely used because of its ability to image bony structures of the
   middle ear, it is difficult to visualize soft tissues - including the
   tympanic membrane and the suspensory ligaments/tendons - because of lack
   of contrast. The objective of this research is to quantitatively
   evaluate the efficacy of iodine potassium iodide (IKI) solution as a
   contrast agent. Six human temporal bones were used in this experiment,
   which were obtained in right-left pairs, from three cadaveric heads. All
   bones were fixed using formaldehyde. Three bones (one from each pair)
   were stained in IKI solution for 2 days, whereas the other three were
   not stained. Samples were scanned using a microCT system at a resolution
   of 20 m. Eight soft tissues in the middle ear were segmented: anterior
   mallear ligament, incudomallear joint, lateral mallear ligament,
   posterior incudal ligament, stapedial annular ligament, stapedius
   muscle, tympanic membrane and tensor tympani muscle. Contrast-to-noise
   ratios (CNRs) of each soft tissue were calculated for each temporal
   bone. Combined CNRs of the soft tissues in unstained samples were 6.1
   3.0, whereas they were 8.1 +/- 2.7 in stained samples. Results from
   Welch's t-test indicate significant difference between the two groups at
   a 95\% confidence interval. Results for paired t-tests for each of the
   individual soft tissues also indicated significant improvement of
   contrast in all tissues after staining. Relatively large soft tissues in
   the middle ear such as the tympanic membrane and the tensor tympani
   muscle were impacted by staining more than smaller tissues such as the
   stapedial annular ligament. The increase in contrast with IKI solution
   confirms its potential application in automatic segmentation of the
   middle-ear soft tissues.
   Lay description Micro-computed tomography (microCT) is a high resolution
   X-ray based imaging technique that can be used to visualize small
   structures in 3 dimensions. It is often used to image the small
   structures of the middle ear. Although microCT provides superb contrast
   for the bony structures of the middle ear, soft tissues such as the
   eardrum, muscles, tendons and ligaments are difficult to visualize
   because of poor contrast. The objective of this work was to investigate
   the efficacy of iodine potassium iodide (IKI) solution as a
   contrast-enhancement agent. Three cadaveric human middle ears were
   imaged after staining them with IKI, and another three were imaged
   without staining. Results indicate that IKI staining enhanced contrast
   of all middle-ear soft tissues, but it was most effective for larger
   tissues than smaller ones. In conclusion, IKI staining is useful for
   visualizing both the bony and soft-tissue structures of the middle ear.}},

Abstract = {{LiFePO4 was prepared from low-cost iron ore concentrate (containing 4.48
   wt.\% SiO2 and MgO, CaO and Al2O3 below 0.5 wt.\% as contaminant) using
   a melt synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinement associated with
   Mossbauer spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy-energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) analyses are used to track the
   location of Si in the material. It is shown that the iron content in the
   melt can be used as a means to control the doping rate of elements from
   iron ore concentrate (IOC) precursor according to the formula (Li1 - z A
   (z) )(Fe1 - y M (y) )(P1 - x Si (x) )O-4. Electrochemical behavior of
   the material is affected by the doping of LiFePO4. While capacity is
   decreased in doped material, the cycling stability is much improved.
   When dopants are out of LiFePO4 structure, capacity retention
   dramatically drops as well as capacity due to the gravimetric impact of
   impurity phases. A trade-off between high capacity and best cycling
   performance is necessary. For instance, slight lack of iron in the melt
   (6 \% deficiency) leads to a capacity only 2 \% lower than that of pure
   Fe2O3-based material for the same stoichiometry and fairly good capacity
   retention.}},

Abstract = {{The ground snow load is used as the reference snow load to estimate the
   design snow load on roofs. The ground snow load is recommended in
   Chinese load code for the design of building structures in the
   applicable jurisdiction; this load needs to be updated regularly by
   integrating new available snow measurements and new analysis techniques.
   This study is concentrated on the estimation of extreme snow depth and
   ground snow load and on snow hazard mapping in China by using historical
   snow measurement data. A probabilistic model of the snowpack bulk
   density was developed. For the extreme value analysis of annual maximum
   snow depth, both the at-site analysis and region of influence approach
   were applied. Also, several commonly used probabilistic models and
   distribution fitting methods were considered for the extreme value
   analysis. For the annual maximum snow depth, it was identified from the
   at-site analysis results that the number of sites where the lognormal
   distribution is preferred is greater than that where the Gumbel
   distribution is preferred. The 50-year return period value obtained from
   the ROI approach is insensitive to whether the three-parameter lognormal
   distribution or the generalized extreme value distribution is adopted.
   Maps of annual maximum snow depth and ground snow load were developed.
   Comparison of the estimated ground snow load to that recommended in the
   design code was presented, and potential updating to the ground snow
   load in the design code was suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The torsional dynamic response of a pile embedded in layered soil is
   investigated while considering the influence of the pile end soil. The
   finite soil layers under the end of the pile are modeled as a fictitious
   soil pile that has the same cross-sectional area as the pile and is in
   perfect contact with the pile end. To allow for variations of the
   modulus or cross-sectional area of the pile and soil, the soil
   surrounding and below the pile is vertically decomposed into finite
   layers. Using the Laplace transform and impedance function transfer
   method, the analytical solution for the dynamic response of the pile
   head in the frequency domain is then obtained, and the relevant
   semi-analytical solution in the tine domain is derived using the inverse
   Fourier transform and convolution theorem. The rationality and accuracy
   of the solution is verified by comparing the torsional dynamic behavior
   of the pile calculated with the fictitious soil pile with those based on
   a rigid support model and a viscoelastic support model. Finally, a
   parametric study is conducted to investigate the influence of the
   properties and thickness of the pile end soil on the torsional dynamic
   response of the pile. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Beneficiation of the Nechalacho rare earth deposit: Flotation response
   using benzohydroxamic acid}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{158-169}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rare earth minerals (REM) may be beneficiated using a variety of
   separation techniques with froth flotation being the most commonly
   applied in operating REM separation plants. Many different collectors
   have been tested with traditional REM such as bastnasite. The most
   successful are the hydroxamic acids. The Nechalacho deposit contains
   many REM for which there is minimal processing information in
   literature. Thus, experimental investigation into their flotation
   behaviour is required.
   This work focuses on understanding the effect of a benzohydroxamic acid
   collector on the flotation of a REM enriched pre-concentrate from the
   Nechalacho deposit (after lab-scale gravity and magnetic separation
   steps). The lab-scale flotation response of the REM is quantified using
   mass recoveries, water recoveries, QEMSCAN and chemical assay data and
   TOF-SIMS in order to study the recovery, entrainment and kinetics of
   different REM. Three different flotation schemes are investigated to
   determine the effect of a secondary addition of collector as well as the
   addition of lead ions, a known activator in hydroxamic acid flotation.
   It is important to note that the goal of this work is to determine
   fundamental flotation properties of the different REM in the Nechalacho
   deposit. As such, the process investigated here is not indicative in any
   way of the current process design for this deposit. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{808}},
Pages = {{258-289}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The flow of a planar jet (sheet) impinging onto a solid flat plate with
   slip is examined theoretically. The jet is assumed to spread out in a
   thin layer bounded by a hydraulic jump, and draining at the edge of the
   plate. In contrast to an adhering jet, a slipping jet does not admit a
   similarity solution. Taking advantage of the different scaling in each
   region, series expansions are used in the developing and fully viscous
   layers, which are matched at the transition point. We show that a
   slipping film exhibits a singularity in the normal stress at the leading
   edge of the boundary layer, as opposed to the singularity in velocity
   and shear stress for an adhering film. The boundary-layer and film
   heights are both found to decrease with slip relative to a smooth
   substrate, roughly like root 30x/Re - 2S, whereas the slip velocity
   intensifies like S root Re/30x with slip. Here, x is the distance along
   the plate, S is the slip length and Re is the Reynolds number (in units
   of the jet width). The transition is delayed by slip. Guided by the
   measurements of Duchesne et al. (Europhys. Lett., vol. 107, 2014, p.
   54002) for a circular adhering jet, the hydraulic-jump height and
   location are determined for a planar jet, and are found to increase with
   the Froude number (flow rate) like Fr-1/4 and Fr-5/8 respectively,
   essentially independently of slip length.}},

Abstract = {{Drag reduction in turbulent channel flows has significant practical
   relevance for energy savings. Various methods have been proposed to
   reduce turbulent skin friction, including microscale surface
   modifications such as riblets or superhydrophobic surfaces. More
   recently, macroscale surface modifications in the form of longitudinal
   grooves have been shown to reduce drag in laminar channel flows. The
   purpose of this study is to show that these grooves also reduce drag in
   turbulent channel flows and to quantify the drag reduction as a function
   of the groove parameters. Results are obtained using computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) simulations with turbulence modeled by the k-omega
   shear-stress transport (SST) model, which is first validated with direct
   numerical simulations (DNS). Based on the CFD results, a reduced
   geometry model is proposed which shows that the approximate drag
   reduction can be quantified by evaluating the drag reduction of the
   geometry given by the first Fourier mode of an arbitrary groove
   geometry. Results are presented to show the drag reducing potential of
   grooves as a function of Reynolds number as well as groove wave number,
   amplitude, and shape. The mechanism of drag reduction is discussed,
   which is found to be due to a rearrangement of the bulk fluid motion
   into highvelocity streamtubes in the widest portion of the channel
   opening, resulting in a change in the wall shear stress profile.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the impact of furfural (a furan derivative) on
   hydrogen production rates and yields at initial

   Fermentation studies were carried out in batches using synthetic
   lignocellulosic hydrolysate as substrate and mesophilic anaerobic
   digester sludge as seed. Contrary to other literature studies where
   furfural was inhibitory, this study showed that furfural concentrations
   of up to 1 g/L enhanced hydrogen production with yields as high as 19\%
   from the control (batch without furfural). Plots of hydrogen yields
   against g furfural/g sugars and hydrogen yields versus g furfural/g
   biomass showed negative linear correlation indicating that these
   parameters influence biohydrogen production. Regression analysis
   indicated that g furfural/g sugars(initial) exerted a greater effect on
   the degree of inhibition of hydrogen production than g furfural/g

Title = {{Study of the impact of photoionization on negative and positive
   needle-plane corona discharge in atmospheric air}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A 2D axisymmetric model of the atmospheric pressure needle-plane corona
   discharge incorporating the photoionization phenomenon is presented in
   this paper. The photoionization model was developed using a three-term
   exponential approximation based on a model suggested by Bourdon et al.
   The coefficients of the photoionization model were tuned by reproducing
   the results of a positive corona discharge and comparing them with the
   experimental data published previously in the literature. In fact, this
   photoionization model is an essential module for studying a
   self-sustained positive corona discharge. Incorporating the
   photoionization phenomenon in the numerical model for the negative
   corona discharge causes an average of 5\% increase in both the frequency
   and the DC current of the discharge. The relative importance of the
   photoionization in both positive and negative coronas was put in a
   quantitative frame by introducing the ratio of the integral of the
   impact ionization source term (IIS) divided by the Integral of the
   photoionization source term (IPS). With the help of this ratio and the
   spatial distribution of the two source terms, the minor role played by
   the photoionization source term for the negative discharge is justified.
   In the case of the positive discharge, the vital importance of the
   photoionization for sustaining the discharge is explained. Moreover, for
   the negative corona discharge, comparison of the ratio of the secondary
   emitted electrons (SEE) from the cathode surface divided by the IPS, at
   different instants of the formation of a Trichel pulse was found to be
   beneficial for the purpose of evaluating the relative importance of the
   photoionization. It is concluded that, although SEE on the rising edge
   of the Trichel pulse is smaller than the IPS since the injected
   electrons from the cathode surface are generated in the area with the
   strongest electric field, they have a greater contribution to the
   discharge current.}},

Title = {{Effect of hydrogen uptake on the electrochemical corrosion of N18
   zircaloy under gamma irradiation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{388}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{252-258}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{It has been well recognized that dramatic hydrogen uptake occurred in
   zircaloy after kinetic transition and porous structure was observed
   subsequently due to phase transformation of tetragonal to monoclinic
   zirconia. Therefore, how hydrogen solute and gamma-induced
   capillary-embedded hydrolysis influence the corrosion of zircaloy is an
   intriguing issue. In this work, the effect of hydrogen uptake and gamma
   irradiation on corrosion of N18 zircaloy was studied. Raman spectra and
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) were employed to analyse phase structure
   and surface morphology. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy were utilized to qualitatively evaluate the
   electron transfer properties of the oxide film formed on the zircaloy
   surface after corrosion. The depth profile and surface chemical states
   of involving elements were analysed by auger electron spectroscopy (AES)
   and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. It was found
   that hydrogen permeation can decline the integrity and impedance
   semicircle of the oxide films, the more the hydrogen uptake is; the
   smaller magnitude of impedance will be. In view of the gamma
   irradiation, it is demonstrated that it promotes the corrosion rate
   slightly. Based on the irradiation theory and existing phenomena, the
   underlying mechanism is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, the solubility of the form A of ibrutinib in isopropanol

   experimentally determined by a gravimetric method in the temperature
   range from 278.15 to 323.15 K at atmospheric pressure. The experimental
   solubility data were correlated by several commonly used models
   including the modified Apelblat equation, the Buchowski-Ksiazczak lambda
   h equation and an empirical quartic polynomial equation. The results
   showed that, in the temperature range investigated, the solubility of
   ibrutinib generally increased with the increasing temperature, and the
   solubility order at the room temperature in the studied solvents was:
   MEK > acetone > ethyl acetate > 1-butanol > acetonitrile approximate to
   isopropanol > MTBE. In addition, all the models gave satisfactory
   correlation results, in which the empirical quartic polynomial equation
   stood out to be more suitable with a higher accuracy than the other two

Abstract = {{The emergence of Big Data has had profound impacts on how data are
   stored and processed. M technologies created to process continuous
   streams of data with low latency, Complex Event Processing (CEP) and
   Stream Processing (SP) have often been related to the Big Data velocity
   dimension and used in this context. Many modern CEP and SP systems
   leverage cloud environments to provide the low latency and scalability
   required by Big Data applications, yet validating these systems at the
   required scale is a research problem per se. Cloud computing simulators
   have been used as a tool to facilitate reproducible and repeatable
   experiments in clouds. Nevertheless, existing simulators are mostly
   based on simple application and simulation models that are not
   appropriate for CEP or for SP. This article presents CEPSim, a simulator
   for CEP and SP systems in cloud environments. CEPSim proposes a query
   model based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and introduces a
   simulation algorithm based on a novel abstraction called event sets.
   CEPSim is highly customizable and can be used to analyse the performance
   and scalability of user-defined queries and to evaluate the effects of
   various query processing strategies. Experimental results show that
   CEPSim can simulate existing systems in large Big Data scenarios with
   accuracy and precision. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction technique using biased
   subcarriers is proposed and investigated. A known time-domain reference
   sample (D-ref) is used to bias the subcarriers at the transmitter, and
   the same bias is used at the receiver to recover the sequence of
   original subcarrier samples. A closed-form analytical expression for
   complementary cumulative distribution function for PAPR has been derived
   and is illustrated as a function of the introduced bias. The
   effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated both analytically
   and numerically. Analytical and simulation results confirm that
   significant reduction in PAPR can be achieved. For example, it is shown
   that nearly 9.45-dB reduction in 0.1\% PAPR can be achieved for a 16-QAM
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system with 1024 subcarriers.
   Numerical results show that the average bit error rate performance of
   the proposed system does not degrade relative to the original system. It
   is found that the proposed technique has the lowest complexity among the
   various available techniques for PAPR reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Platinum-based catalysts have been considered the most effective
   electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in water splitting.
   However, platinum utilization in these electrocatalysts is extremely
   low, as the active sites are only located on the surface of the catalyst
   particles. Downsizing catalyst nanoparticles to single atoms is highly
   desirable to maximize their efficiency by utilizing nearly all platinum
   atoms. Here we report on a practical synthesis method to produce
   isolated single platinum atoms and clusters using the atomic layer
   deposition technique. The single platinum atom catalysts are
   investigated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, where they exhibit
   significantly enhanced catalytic activity (up to 37 times) and high
   stability in comparison with the state-of-the-art commercial
   platinum/carbon catalysts. The X-ray absorption fine structure and
   density functional theory analyses indicate that the partially
   unoccupied density of states of the platinum atoms' 5d orbitals on the
   nitrogen-doped graphene are responsible for the excellent performance.}},

Abstract = {{The shear behavior of concrete reinforced with fiber-reinforced polymer
   (FRP) but without web reinforcement is potentially the most critical
   case in shear-prone applications due to the brittle nature of the
   concrete and reinforcement and, as such, requires special attention. A
   total of 16 one-way reinforced concrete slabs reinforced with glass- and
   carbon-FRP bars in addition to steel-reinforcement were constructed and
   tested to failure under four-point flexural loading. Their structural
   behavior was observed and reported in terms of failure mechanisms, crack
   patterns, main shear cracks, and ultimate capacities. The test results
   confirmed the effect of the axial stiffness of longitudinal FRP
   reinforcement on shear strength. The use of high-strength concrete had a
   positive impact on the initial shear-cracking load and ultimate-load
   capacity. The influence of the reinforcement type, bar diameter, and bar
   shear stiffness on the mode of failure was determined and discussed.
   Most of the CFRP-reinforced slabs experienced brittle failure, while
   most of the GFRP reinforced slabs-with reinforcement axial stiffness
   equivalent to that of the CFRP reinforced slabs-kept their integrity
   even after failure, thereby avoiding brittle modes of failure. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A novel bio-based epoxy resin was synthesized using de-polymerized
   hydrolysis lignin (DHL) as a feedstock under alkaline condition. The
   chemical functionality of DHL-based epoxy resin was studied using
   Fourier Transformation Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).The curing behavior
   of DHL-based epoxy resin with a selective curing agent
   (4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane; DDM) was also investigated using
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The curing process was found to
   proceed via a ring opening reaction involving the epoxy and the amine
   groups followed by etherification reactions at the end. The thermal and
   mechanical behavior of the resulting DHL-based epoxy resin were
   investigated using a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a universal
   testing machine (IJTM), respectively. The cured DHL-based epoxy-DDM
   system demonstrated good thermal and mechanical performances, suggesting
   its potential of utilizing hydrolysis lignin a byproduct/waste stream
   from cellulosic ethanol processes for the production of value-added

Journal = {{IET COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{2372-2379}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{In a dual-hop relaying system without a direct link between the source
   and the destination, the source broadcasts information signal to the
   relay and relay broadcasts it to the destination, thus it uses two
   phases to transmit one symbol. This study proposes a novel scheme to
   incorporate signal space diversity into a dual-hop relaying system with
   multiple decode-and-forward (DF) relays to enhance its spectral
   efficiency. The proposed dual-hop signal space cooperative relaying
   scheme transmits two symbols in three phases while the conventional
   dual-hop DF relaying system uses four phases to transmit the same two
   symbols. Therefore, the proposed scheme improves the spectral efficiency
   without additional complexity, bandwidth or transmit power. The proposed
   scheme is analysed over Rayleigh fading channel and error probability
   performance is derived. Moreover, an asymptotic approximation for the
   error probability is obtained to illustrate the impact of different
   system parameters and diversity gain. In addition, this study discusses
   the power allocation optimisation, relay position optimisation and the
   joint optimisation of both. Furthermore, closed-form expression for the
   average channel capacity is derived. In the end, analytical results are
   compared and validated through Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 has been documented to
   survive implantation onto the vaginal epithelium and interfere with
   urogenital pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are
   largely unknown. Here, we report for the first time the construction of
   dedicated knock-out mutants in L. rhamnosus GR-1 to enable the study of
   gene functions. In a search for genes responsible for the adherence
   capacity of L. rhamnosus GR-1, a genomic region encoding a protein with
   homology to lectin-like proteins was identified. Phenotypic analyses of
   the knock-out mutant of L. rhamnosus GR-1 revealed a two-fold decreased
   adhesion to the vaginal and ectocervical epithelial cell lines compared
   to wild-type. In contrast, the adhesion to gastro-intestinal epithelial
   (Caco2) and endocervical cell lines (Hela and End1/E6E7) was not
   drastically affected by the mutation, suggesting that the LGR-1\_Llp1
   lectins mediates tissue tropism. The purified LGR-1\_Llp1 protein also
   inhibited biofilm formation and adhesion of uropathogenic Escherichia
   coli. For the first time, an important role for a novel lectin-like
   protein in the adhesion capacity and host cell-specific interaction of a
   vaginal probiotic Lactobacillus strain has been discovered, with an
   additional role in pathogen inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{A full-ring PET insert consisting of 16 PET detector modules was
   designed and constructed to fit within the 114 mm diameter gradient bore
   of a Bruker 7 T MRI. The individual detector modules contain two silicon
   photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays, dual-layer offset LYSO crystal arrays,
   and high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) cables for both signal
   and power transmission. Several different RF shielding configurations
   were assessed prior to construction of a fully assembled PET insert
   using a combination of carbon fibre and copper foil for RF shielding.
   MR-compatibility measurements included field mapping of the static
   magnetic field (B-0) and the time-varying excitation field (B-1) as well
   as acquisitions with multiple pulse sequences: spin echo (SE), rapid
   imaging with refocused echoes (RARE), fast low angle shot (FLASH)
   gradient echo, and echo planar imaging (EPI). B-0 field maps revealed a
   small degradation in the mean homogeneity (+0.1 ppm) when the PET insert
   was installed and operating. No significant change was observed in the
   B-1 field maps or the image homogeneity of various MR images, with a 9\%
   decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed only in EPI images
   acquired with the PET insert installed and operating. PET detector flood
   histograms, photopeak amplitudes, and energy resolutions were unchanged
   in individual PET detector modules when acquired during MRI operation.
   There was a small baseline shift on the PET detector signals due to the
   switching amplifiers used to power MRI gradient pulses. This baseline
   shift was observable when measured with an oscilloscope and varied as a
   function of the gradient duty cycle, but had no noticeable effect on the
   performance of the PET detector modules. Compact front-end electronics
   and effective RF shielding led to minimal cross-interference between the
   PET and MRI systems. Both PET detector and MRI performance was
   excellent, whether operating as a standalone system or a hybrid PET/MRI.}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{654-670}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Today, the use of social networks is growing ceaselessly and rapidly.
   More alarming is the fact that these networks have become a substantial
   pool for unstructured data that belong to a host of domains, including
   business, governments and health. The increasing reliance on social,
   networks calls for data mining techniques that is likely to facilitate
   reforming the unstructured data and place them within a systematic
   pattern. The goal of the present survey is to analyze the data mining
   techniques that were utilized by social media networks between 2003 and
   2015. Espousing criterion-based research strategies, 66 articles were
   identified to constitute the source of the present paper. After a
   careful review of these articles, we found that 19 data mining
   techniques have been used with social media data to address 9 different
   research objectives in 6 different industrial and services domains.
   However, the data mining applications in the social media are still raw
   and require more effort by academia and industry to adequately perform
   the job. We suggest that more research be conducted by both the academia
   and the industry since the studies done so far are not sufficiently
   exhaustive of data mining techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing
   near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from
   the dynamic uplift of rocks during crater formation. As crater size
   increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples,
   debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of
   origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an
   unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through
   drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found
   was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The
   peak-ring rocks are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an
   unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore
   generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.}},

Abstract = {{Boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dye molecules are well known for their
   excellent absorption and emission optical properties. Here, we report
   the results of an electrochemical and electrochemiluminescence (ECL)
   study of an organic-soluble and a water-soluble BODIPY dye to explore
   their effectiveness as ECL luminophores. A combination of UV-visible,
   fluorescence, and spooling ECL spectroscopy was used to study the
   mechanisms of ECL light emission. It was discovered that excimers, the
   excited states of analyte dimers, contributed significantly to the
   production of ECL. These BODIPY molecules exhibited relatively weak ECL
   efficiencies following the annihilation mechanism. However, ECL was
   enhanced with co-reactants such as persulfate, and tri-n-propylamine.
   Spooling ECL spectroscopy was utilized to gain analytical insight into
   light emission mechanisms. It is shown that while these two BODIPY
   compounds can form photoinduced excited monomers, excimers were
   generated mainly in their co-reactant ECL pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Low hydrophilicity of graphene is one of the major obstacles for
   biomaterials application. To create some hydrophilic groups on graphene
   is addressed this issue. Herein, COOH+ ion implantation modified
   graphene (COOH+/graphene) and COOH functionalized graphene were designed
   by physical ion implantation and chemical methods, respectively. The
   structure and surface properties of COOH+/graphene and COOH
   functionalized graphene were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle measurement.
   Compared with graphene, COOH+/graphene and COOH functionalized graphene
   revealed improvement of cytocompatibility, including in vitro cell
   viability and morphology. More importantly, COOH+/graphene exhibited
   better improvement effects than functionalized graphene. For instance,
   COOH+/graphene with 1 x 10(18) ions/cm(2) showed the best
   cell-viability, proliferation and stretching. This study demonstrated
   that ion implantation can better improve the cytocompatibility of the

Title = {{Longitudinal force on transmission towers due to non-symmetric downburst
   conductor loads}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{206-226}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Many failure incidents for transmission line structures have been
   observed in various locations around the globe as a result of downburst
   wind events. The localized nature of such downbursts imposes a load case
   on transmission towers that does not exist under large-scale events such
   as hurricanes. This load case happens when the downburst location leads
   to an uneven and unequal distribution of wind velocity along the
   conductor spans located at opposite sides of a tower. Hence, a
   difference in the tension forces will develop between the two spans of
   the conductors attached to the left and right sides of the tower. This
   difference in tension forces will lead to a net longitudinal force
   acting on the tower cross arm, which is believed to be the reason for
   the failure of a number of towers during downbursts. The estimation of
   this force requires conducting a nonlinear analysis of the conductors
   under the variable loading conditions resulting from the most critical
   downburst location, while taking into account a number of key parameters
   including the flexibility of the insulators and the conductor's
   pretension force. The objective of this paper is to develop a simple
   procedure that can be used by practitioners to estimate such a force. A
   study is first conducted to determine the most critical downburst
   configuration expected to produce the highest values of the longitudinal
   forces. A parametric study is then conducted to assess the variations in
   the longitudinal forces with various geometric and material parameters
   influencing the behaviour of the conductors. Results of this parametric
   study are then used to develop a set of charts that can be used to
   estimate the longitudinal forces using three-dimensional linear
   interpolation. An example is provided to illustrate the application of
   the developed procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rutile-monoclinic phase transitions of vanadium oxide (VO2) nanocrystals
   adsorbed on graphene-based substrates are of current scientific
   interest, although their adsorption and growth mechanisms have not been
   investigated theoretically. In this study, we use density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations for determining the binding energies and
   predicting the corresponding directions of growth of VO2 nanostructures
   (rutile and M-1-monoclinic) interacting with both pure graphene and
   functionalized graphene nanoribbons. Several adsorption sites of pure
   graphene including the top, bridge, and hollow sites are considered,
   while additional adsorption sites of functionalized graphene
   nanoribbons, epoxy, alcohol and carboxylate are investigated. Vanadium
   oxide nanostructures are found to favor physical adsorption on the
   hollow sites of pure graphene, while chemical adsorption is favored on
   the carboxylate sites of functionalized graphene nanoribbons (FGNRs).
   Charge density maps showed the electron distribution originating from
   the interaction between VO2 and graphene substrates, helping to
   understand the mechanism of charge transfer. Electronic local potentials
   showed vertical growth tendencies for rutile VO2, while M-1-monoclinic
   VO2 showed horizontal growth tendencies. Partial density of states
   (PDOS) helped examine the electronic structure of metallic rutile VO2
   binding to hollow and carboxylate sites of functionalized graphene.
   These results provide an improved understanding of the controlled and
   oriented growth of VO2 nanocrystals on graphene-based substrates which
   can enable various properties such as the metal-insulator transition
   (MIT) of VO2 in light regulation applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: One of the main obstacles in lignocellulosic ethanol
   production is the necessity of pretreatment and fractionation of the
   biomass feedstocks to produce sufficiently pure fermentable
   carbohydrates. In addition, the by-products (hemicellulose and lignin
   fraction) are of low value, when compared to dried distillers grains
   (DDG), the main by-product of corn ethanol. Fast pyrolysis is an
   alternative thermal conversion technology for processing biomass. It has
   recently been optimized to produce a stream rich in levoglucosan, a
   fermentable glucose precursor for biofuel production. Additional product
   streams might be of value to the petrochemical industry. However,
   biomass heterogeneity is known to impact the composition of pyrolytic
   product streams, as a complex mixture of aromatic compounds is recovered
   with the sugars, interfering with subsequent fermentation. The present
   study investigates the feasibility of fast pyrolysis to produce
   fermentable pyrolytic glucose from two abundant lignocellulosic biomass
   sources in Ontario, switchgrass (potential energy crop) and corn cobs
   (by-product of corn industry).
   Results: Demineralization of biomass removes catalytic centers and
   increases the levoglucosan yield during pyrolysis. The ash content of
   biomass was significantly decreased by 82-90\% in corn cobs when
   demineralized with acetic or nitric acid, respectively. In switchgrass,
   a reduction of only 50\% for both acids could be achieved. Conversely,
   levoglucosan production increased 9-and 14-fold in corn cobs when rinsed
   with acetic and nitric acid, respectively, and increased 11-fold in
   switchgrass regardless of the acid used. After pyrolysis, different
   configurations for upgrading the pyrolytic sugars were assessed and the
   presence of potentially inhibitory compounds was approximated at each
   step as double integral of the UV spectrum signal of an HPLC assay. The
   results showed that water extraction followed by acid hydrolysis and
   solvent extraction was the best upgrading strategy. Ethanol yields
   achieved based on initial cellulose fraction were 27.8\% in switchgrass
   and 27.0\% in corn cobs.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that ethanol production from
   switchgrass and corn cobs is possible following a combined
   thermochemical and fermentative biorefinery approach, with ethanol
   yields comparable to results in conventional pretreatments and
   fermentation processes. The feedstock-independent fermentation ability
   can easily be assessed with a simple assay.}},

Abstract = {{3D microbatteries hold great promise as on-board energy supply systems
   for microelectronic devices. The construction of 3D microbatteries
   relies on the development of film deposition techniques that can enable
   coatings of uniform electrode and electrolyte materials in
   high-aspect-ratio substrates. Here, a 3D FePO4 on carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs@FePO4) structure is fabricated by coating FePO4 on CNTs/carbon
   paper substrate using atomic layer deposition. Compared to FePO4 on a
   planar substrate, the 3D CNTs@FePO4 electrode exhibits significantly
   increased areal capacity and excellent rate capability for lithium-ion
   and sodium-ion storage. The 3D CNTs@FePO4 maintains areal capacities of
   64 and 33 mu Ah cm(-2) after 180 cycles for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
   and sodium-ion batteries, which are 16 and 33 times higher than those of
   planar FePO4 electrode, respectively. Moreover, hybrid 3D
   CNTs@FePO4@Li3PO4 structure is fabricated by coating Li3PO4 solid-state
   electrolyte on 3D CNTs@FePO4. The CNTs@FePO4@Li3PO4 electrode shows
   stable cycling performance in LIBs. Hard X-ray photoemission
   spectroscopy analysis demonstrates that the Li3PO4 coating prevents the
   formation of undesirable LiF in the solid-electrolyte interphase layer,
   which is believed to be responsible for the performance degradation in
   CNTs@FePO4. This work paves the way to building reliable 3D
   nanostructured electrode and electrolyte architectures for high areal
   capacity microbatteries.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is considered as a powerful technique to
   synthesize novel electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),
   because not only the compositions can be specifically designed to
   achieve higher battery performances, but also the materials can be
   deposited on various substrates for different purposes. Herein, a novel
   design of active material/electrolyte mixture electrode, i.e., titanium
   dioxide/lithium phosphate (TLPO) nanocomposite, has been successfully
   developed by ALD and deposited on carbon nanotube substrates (CNTs@TLPO)
   at 250 degrees C, by combining the ALD recipes of TiO2 and lithium
   phosphate (LPO). In the nanocomposite, TiO2 forms anatase nanocrystals,
   embedded in a matrix of amorphous lithium phosphate. CNTs@TLPO has been
   examined as an anode material for LIBs, exhibiting a similar
   electrochemical response as anatase TiO2 in the cyclic voltammetry
   testing. CNTs@TLPO presents an outstanding capacity of 204 mA h g(-1)
   upon 200 cycles in charge and discharge cycling measurements, as well as
   a significantly improved rate capability compared with ALD deposited
   TiO2 on CNTs without LPO ALD cycles. This work shows that the in situ
   addition of solid-state electrolyte (e.g., lithium phosphate), which
   introduces higher Li+ ionic conductivity, is an efficient way to achieve
   high-performance electrode materials for LIBs by ALD.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) is a diluent monomer used
   pervasively in dental composite resins. Through hydrolytic degradation
   of the composites in the oral cavity it yields a hydrophilic
   biodegradation product, triethylene glycol (TEG), which has been shown
   to promote the growth of Streptococcus mutans, a dominant cariogenic
   bacterium. Previously it was shown that TEG up-regulated gtfB, an
   important gene contributing to polysaccharide synthesis function in
   biofilms. However, molecular mechanisms related to TEG's effect on
   bacterial function remained poorly understood. In the present study, S.
   mutans UA159 was incubated with clinically relevant concentrations of
   TEG at pH 5.5 and 7.0. Quantitative real-time PCR, proteomics analysis,
   and glucosyltransferase enzyme (GTF) activity measurements were employed
   to identify the bacterial phenotypic response to TEG. A S. mutans vicK
   isogenic mutant (SM Delta vicK1) and its associated complemented strain
   (SM Delta vicK1C), an important regulatory gene for biofilm-associated
   genes, were used to determine if this signaling pathway was involved in
   modulation of the S. mutans virulence-associated genes. Extracted
   proteins from S. mutans biofilms grown in the presence and absence of
   TEG were subjected to mass spectrometry for protein identification,
   characterization and quantification. TEG up-regulated gtfB/C, gbpB,
   comC, comD and comE more significantly in biofilms at cariogenic pH
   (5.5) and defined concentrations. Differential response of the vicK
   knock-out (SM Delta vicK1) and complemented strains (SM Delta vicK1C)
   implicated this signalling pathway in TEG-modulated cellular responses.
   TEG resulted in increased GTF enzyme activity, responsible for
   synthesizing insoluble glucans involved in the formation of cariogenic
   biofilms. As well, TEG increased protein abundance related to biofilm
   formation, carbohydrate transport, acid tolerance, and stress-response.
   Proteomics data was consistent with gene expression findings for the
   selected genes. These findings demonstrate a mechanistic pathway by
   which TEG derived from commercial resin materials in the oral cavity
   promote S. mutans pathogenicity, which is typically associated with
   secondary caries.}},

Journal = {{ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We present H-band near-infrared polarimetric imaging observations of the
   F5V star HD 157587 obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) that
   reveal the debris disk as a bright ring structure at a separation of
   similar to 80-100 au. The new GPI data complement recent Hubble Space
   Telescope/STIS observations that show the disk extending out to over 500
   au. The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along the projected minor
   axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected major axis. We
   associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized forward
   scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To
   constrain the disk geometry, we fit two separate disk models to the
   polarized image, each using a different scattering phase function. Both
   models favor a disk inclination of similar to 70 degrees and a 1.5 +/-
   0.6 au stellar offset in the plane of the sky along the projected major
   axis of the disk. We find that the stellar offset in the disk plane,
   perpendicular to the projected major axis is degenerate with the form of
   the scattering phase function and remains poorly constrained. The disk
   is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong adaptive
   optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the
   system's proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources'
   positions relative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are
   background objects and unrelated to the disk's offset from the star.}},

Abstract = {{While mechanisms to detoxify plant produced, anti-herbivore compounds
   have been associated with plant host use by herbivores, less is known
   about the role of chemosensory perception in their life histories. This
   is especially true for generalists, including chelicerate herbivores
   that evolved herbivory independently from the more studied insect
   lineages. To shed light on chemosensory perception in a generalist
   herbivore, we characterized the chemosensory receptors (CRs) of the
   chelicerate two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, an extreme
   generalist. Strikingly, T. urticae has more CRs than reported in any
   other arthropod to date. Including pseudogenes, 689 gustatory receptors
   were identified, as were 136 degenerin/Epithelial Na+ Channels (ENaCs)
   that have also been implicated as CRs in insects. The genomic
   distribution of T. urticae gustatory receptors indicates recurring
   bursts of lineage-specific proliferations, with the extent of receptor
   clusters reminiscent of those observed in the CR-rich genomes of
   vertebrates or C. elegans. Although pseudogenization of many gustatory
   receptors within clusters suggests relaxed selection, a subset of
   receptors is expressed. Consistent with functions as CRs, the genomic
   distribution and expression of ENaCs in lineage-specific T. urticae
   expansions mirrors that observed for gustatory receptors. The expansion
   of ENaCs in T. urticae to > 3-fold that reported in other animals was
   unexpected, raising the possibility that ENaCs in T. urticae have been
   co-opted to fulfill a major role performed by unrelated CRs in other
   animals. More broadly, our findings suggest an elaborate role for
   chemosensory perception in generalist herbivores that are of key
   ecological and agricultural importance.}},

Title = {{Comparison of static and dynamic resilience for a multipurpose reservoir
   operation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{8630-8649}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Reliability, resilience, and vulnerability are the traditional risk
   measures used to assess the performance of a reservoir system. Among
   these measures, resilience is used to assess the ability of a reservoir
   system to recover from a failure event. However, the time-independent
   static resilience does not consider the system characteristics,
   interaction of various individual components and does not provide much
   insight into reservoir performance from the beginning of the failure
   event until the full performance recovery. Knowledge of dynamic
   reservoir behavior under the disturbance offers opportunities for
   proactive and/or reactive adaptive response that can be selected to
   maximize reservoir resilience. A novel measure is required to provide
   insight into the dynamics of reservoir performance based on the
   reservoir system characteristics and its adaptive capacity. The
   reservoir system characteristics include, among others, reservoir
   storage curve, reservoir inflow, reservoir outflow capacity, and
   reservoir operating rules. The reservoir adaptive capacity can be
   expressed using various impacts of reservoir performance under the
   disturbance (like reservoir release for meeting a particular demand,
   socioeconomic consequences of reservoir performance, or resulting
   environmental state of the river upstream and downstream from the
   reservoir). Another way of expressing reservoir adaptive capacity to a
   disturbing event may include aggregated measures like reservoir
   robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. A novel measure
   that combines reservoir performance and its adaptive capacity is
   proposed in this paper and named dynamic resilience.'' The paper also
   proposes a generic simulation methodology for quantifying reservoir
   resilience as a function of time. The proposed resilience measure is
   applied to a single multipurpose reservoir operation and tested for a
   set of failure scenarios. The dynamic behavior of reservoir resilience
   is captured using the system dynamics simulation approach, a
   feedback-based object-oriented method, very effective for modeling
   complex systems. The results of dynamic resilience are compared with the
   traditional performance measures in order to identify advantages of the
   proposed measure. The results confirm that the dynamic resilience is a
   powerful tool for selecting proactive and reactive adaptive response of
   a multipurpose reservoir to a disturbing event that cannot be achieved
   using traditional measures. The generic quantification approach proposed
   in the paper allows for easy use of dynamic resilience for planning and
   operations of various civil infrastructure systems.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Acrylic latexes with epoxy and carboxyl groups have been synthesized via
   a two-stage emulsion polymerization process. Different contents of
   glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) were introduced by three addition modes to
   copolymerize with methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, acrylic acid (AA)
   in the presence of K2S2O8. To obtain stable latexes, NaHCO3 was employed
   as a buffer to compensate for the acidity from the thermal dissociation
   of K2S2O8, and triethylamine was used to neutralize the carboxyl acid
   from AA. The results showed that the stable latexes with core/shell
   structure were synthesized by this method, and higher GMA content or
   addition at earlier stage led to forming the latexes with higher content
   of coagulum and bigger sized particles. During the formation of films,
   the polymer epoxy groups underwent the crosslinking reaction with
   carboxyl acid. When the GMA content increased or GMA was introduced at a
   later stage, high crosslinking extent was formed in the films. As a
   result, the crosslinking provided the films with improved water
   resistance, chemical resistance, tensile strength, hardness, abrasion
   resistance, and thermal stability.}},

Title = {{Late Holocene rupture behavior and earthquake chronology on the Hope

Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{11-12}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Hope fault is the most active and southernmost splay of the
   Marlborough fault system in the northern South Island of New Zealand.
   The fault consists of five geometrically defined segments. We used
   trenching to acquire paleoseismic data and radiocarbon dating of faulted
   late Holocene sediments on the Hurunui segment of the Hope fault to
   derive an earthquake chronology that extends from the historic 1888 M-w
   7.1 Amuri earthquake to ca. 300 C.E., thereby providing the longest
   chronologic record of earthquakes on the Hope fault to date. Earthquake
   event horizons were identified by upward fault terminations, colluvial
   wedges, unconformities, and/or progressive folding of shutter basin
   deposits. Six earthquakes identified at C.E. 1888, 1740-1840, 1479-1623,
   819-1092, 439-551, and 373-419 indicate a mean recurrence interval of
   similar to 298 +/- 88 yr, with successive median interevent times
   ranging from 98 to 595 yr. The large variance in interevent times with
   respect to mean recurrence interval is explained by (1) possible
   coalescence of rupture overlap from the adjacent Hope River segment onto
   the Hurunui segment at our study site (including the 1888 Mw 7.1 Amuri
   earthquake, sourced primarily from the Hope River segment), which
   results in apparently shorter interevent times at the study site
   compared to mean recurrence intervals from adjacent fault segments, (2)
   possible earthquake temporal clustering on the Hurunui segment, which
   could result in interevent times that are significantly shorter or
   longer than interevent times and mean recurrence intervals predicted by
   a periodic earthquake rupture model, and/or (3) ``missing{''} events,
   which could result in interevent times and mean recurrence intervals at
   the study site that are longer than the actual mean recurrence interval.
   While we cannot exclude option 3 as a possibility, we prefer options 1
   and 2 to explain earthquake chronologies and rupture behavior on the
   Hurunui segment of the Hope fault, given the detailed nature of our
   geologic and chronologic investigations. By demonstrating that the 1888
   Amuri earthquake propagated through a proposed segment boundary, we
   provide the first evidence for coseismic multisegment ruptures on the
   Hope fault. In contrast, the penultimate earthquake ruptured the Hurunui
   segment at 1740-1840 C.E. with no known rupture of the Hope River
   segment. Paleoearthquake records near geometrically complex segment
   structural boundaries on major strike-slip faults may show temporal
   recurrence distributions resulting from earthquake ruptures that
   variably arrest or propagate through proposed segment boundaries. We
   note that earthquake recurrence along major strikeslip plate-boundary
   faults may vary between more periodic and more episodic end members,
   even on adjacent, geometrically defined segments.}},

Title = {{A novel position and force coordination approach in four channel
   nonlinear teleoperation}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{688-699}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel control scheme is presented to achieve
   simultaneous position and force coordination in nonlinear teleoperation
   systems. Providing force feedback would facilitate the task for the
   operator and increase the performance. The four channel architecture is
   employed for this target as a high transparent structure. However, the
   stability issue has been a challenging problem, even in the sense of
   linear teleoperators. By employing a novel nonlinear damping, the
   stability of the closed loop system has been preserved even when the
   communication channel is subjected to time varying delay. In addition,
   no passivity condition is required for both the operator and the
   environment, a restrictive condition which is not always held in
   practice. We also proved through Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions that
   position and force tracking error will asymptotically converge to zero.
   The controllers do not require any knowledge of the robot dynamics
   except the gravity terms. In order to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed controller, a simulation result is presented, illustrating both

Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive impairment affects 40\%-68\% of
   relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. Gray matter (GM)
   demyelination is complicit in cognitive impairment, yet cortical lesions
   are challenging to image clinically. We wanted to determine whether
   cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and
   mean transit time (MTT) differences exist between cognitively impaired
   (CI) and unimpaired (NI) RRMS.
   Methods: Prospective study of healthy controls (n = 19), CI (n = 20),
   and NI (n = 19) undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   cognitive testing < 1 week apart. White matter (WM) T2 hyperintense
   lesions and T1 black holes were traced. General linear regression
   assessed the relationship between lobar WM volume and cortical and WM
   CBF, CBV, and MTT. Relationship between global and lobar cortical CBF,
   CBV, and MTT and cognitive impairment was tested using a generalized
   linear model. Adjusted Bonferroni p < 0.005 was considered significant.
   Results: No significant differences for age, gender, disease duration,
   and any fractional brain or lesion volume were demonstrated for RRMS
   subgroups. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and Hospital Anxiety
   and Depression Scale-Depression (HADS-D) were higher in CI. Lobar
   cortical CBF and CBV were associated with cognitive impairment (p <
   0.0001) after controlling for confounders. Cortical CBV accounted for
   7.2\% of cognitive impairment increasing to 8.7\% with cortical CBF (p =
   0.06), while WM and cortical CBF accounted for 8.2\% of variance (p =
   0.04).
   Conclusion: Significant cortical CBF and CBV reduction was present in CI
   compared to NI in the absence of structural differences.}},

Abstract = {{Fuel cells are a promising technology solution for reliable and clean
   energy because they offer high energy conversion efficiency and low
   emission of pollutants. However, high cost and insufficient durability
   are considerable challenges for widespread adoption of polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) in practical applications.
   Current PEMFCs catalysts have been identified as major contributors to
   both the high cost and limited durability. Atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   is emerging as a powerful technique for solving these problems due to
   its exclusive advantages over other methods. In this review, we
   summarize recent developments of ALD in PEMFCs with a focus on design of
   materials for improved catalyst activity and durability. New research
   directions and future trends have also been discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Volume = {{169}},

Abstract = {{As a result of difficulties in obtaining undisturbed samples in
   cohesionless soils, empirical correlations based on cone penetration
   test (CPT) results, often developed from calibration chamber
   experiments, are widely used for determining many soil parameters for
   geotechnical investigation. This paper describes the application of 19
   reduced-scale calibration chamber CPTs for examining the empirical
   correlations used for predicting the relative density of loose to
   medium-dense sands. A reduced-scale subtraction cone with an apex angle
   of 60 degrees and a net area ratio of 0.75 was used in the laboratory
   tests. Current methods for estimating relative density present very
   large differences among themselves as well as with the experiments of
   this study, rendering them meaningless for general application in all
   sands. The state parameter is suggested as a more reliable and universal
   alternative to relative density for estimating the degree of compaction
   of any sand deposit from CPT data. It is demonstrated that an empirical
   method provides reasonable estimates of the state parameter for the CPT
   experiments of this study. Compared with relative density, the state
   parameter method can be particularly useful for examining the
   liquefaction susceptibility of sands.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless resource virtualization (WRV) is currently emerging as a key
   technology to overcome the major challenges facing the mobile network
   operators (MNOs) such as reducing the capital, minimizing the operating
   expenses, improving the quality of service, and satisfying the growing
   demand for mobile services. Achieving such conflicting objectives
   simultaneously requires a highly efficient utilization of the available
   resources including the network infrastructure and the reserved
   spectrum. In this paper, the most dominant WRV frameworks are discussed
   where different levels of network infrastructure and spectrum resources
   are shared between multiple MNOs. Moreover, we summarize the major
   benefits and most pressing business challenges of deploying WRV. We
   further highlight the technical challenges and requirements for
   abstraction and sharing of spectrum resources in next generation
   networks. In addition, we provide guidelines for implementing
   comprehensive solutions that are able to abstract and share the spectrum
   resources in next generation network. The paper also presents an
   efficient algorithm for base station virtualization in long-term
   evolution (LTE) networks to share the wireless resources between MNOs
   who apply different scheduling polices. The proposed algorithm maintains
   a high-level of isolation and offers throughput performance gain.

   boundary conditions. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method has been applied
   to track the flow interface between liquid and gas, with the solid
   particles dispersed in the liquid phase, in the free coating process. A
   finite length cylinder is dip coated, where the substrate is pulled out
   of a concentrated suspension bath. In the current work, the initial
   solid particle volume fraction range is 0.1-0.4 and the withdrawal
   velocity varies in the range of 0.05-0.15m/s. Comparisons are made

   recovery method, i.e., the spatial multiple differential measuring
   method, is proposed in the framework of 2-D SCS. At each receive
   antenna, a differential measurement vector is acquired from the repeated
   training sequences in the IEEE 802.11 series preamble. Then, multiple
   measurement vectors from all receive antennas are utilized to recover

Abstract = {{An algorithm suitable for analysis of convection problems in corrugated

   Chebyshev expansions in the wall-normal direction. The boundary
   conditions are expressed in the form of constraints and the spectrally
   accurate discretization of these constraints is discussed. The solution
   is carried out using the fix flow rate constraint. Discretization as
   well as a method for the direct inclusion of this constraint in the flow
   solver is presented. Several tests are used to demonstrate the spectral
   accuracy of the solution. The solution process relies on iterations with
   an efficient solver taking advantage of the structure of the coefficient
   matrix used to solve the linear system. The limitations of the algorithm
   are discussed and gains associated with the over-determined formulation
   are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Next generation drug-loaded polymer scaffolds for hard tissue
   engineering require unique structures to enhance release kinetics while
   enabling bone cell growth (osteogenesis). This study examined the
   encapsulation of the pro-angiogenic mediator, ginsenoside Rg(1) into
   biodegradable poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) microspheres to facilitate
   osteogenesis, while examining the release mechanism using advanced X-ray
   absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES). Ginsenoside
   Rg(1)-loaded PPF microspheres were prepared using both an emulsion
   method and a microfluidic device, with the microfluidic technique
   providing tunable unimodal PPF spheres ranging in size from 3 to 52 mu m
   by varying the flow rates. The morphology and composition of the
   Rg(1)-loaded PPF microspheres were characterized using FTIR, XRD, and
   XANES to examine the distribution of ginsenoside Rg(1) throughout the
   polymer matrix. Encapsulation efficiency and release profiles were
   studied and quantified by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, showing high
   encapsulation efficiencies of 95.4 +/- 0.8\% from the microfluidic
   approach. Kinetic analysis showed that Rg(1) release from the more
   monodisperse PPF microspheres was slower with a significantly smaller
   burst effect than from the polydisperse spheres, with the release
   following Fickian diffusion. The released Rg, maintained its angiogenic
   effect in vitro, showing that the PPF microspheres are promising to
   serve as vehicles for long-term controlled drug delivery leading to
   therapeutic angiogenesis in bone tissue engineering strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The fiber arrangement in the pars tensa of the rat tympanic membrane
   (TM) was observed using a high resolution scanning electron microscope.
   The entire pars tensa is composed of fibrils with diameter of
   approximately 25 nm. These fibrils can be grouped into radial, circular,
   parabolic, and oblique fibers as reported in other mammals. The radial
   fibrils interweave into a planar form rather than into discrete
   cylindrical fibers. Before attaching to the manubrium and tympanic ring,
   the radial fibrils bend and cross neighboring fibrils to form a random
   fibril network, and change their direction from perpendicular to
   somewhat parallel to the manubrium and tympanic ring. The circular
   fibrils form cylindrical fibers near the peripheral part of the TM while
   closer to the manubrium, they form planar bundles. The observed fiber
   morphology and arrangement may provide helpful information in improving
   numerical models for the TM's acoustical response and designing a
   fibrous graft for the repair of TM perforations. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{A log-logistic model is developed to predict the probability of rupture
   (POR) given burst of a pressurized steel pipeline at a
   naturally-occurring part-through wall corrosion defect. The predictors
   of the model are the defect depth normalized by the pipe wall thickness
   and defect length normalized by the square root of the product of the
   pipe diameter and wall thickness. A set of 140 full-scale burst tests of
   corroded thin walled pipes are collected from the open literature to
   calibrate and validate the proposed POR model. The parameters of the POR
   model are evaluated using the maximum likelihood method. To facilitate
   deterministic defect assessments, a threshold POR of 0.35 is proposed
   such that defects with POR greater than or equal to 0.35 are designated
   as potential ruptures. The impact on the proposed POR model due to the
   measurement errors associated with defect sizes reported by the
   inspection tool is examined through sensitivity analyses. (C) 2016

Title = {{Retention performance of green roofs in three different climate regions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{542}},
Pages = {{115-124}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Green roofs are becoming increasingly popular for moderating stormwater
   runoff in urban areas. This study investigated the impact different
   climates have on the retention performance of identical green roofs
   installed in London Ontario (humid continental), Calgary Alberta
   (semi-arid, continental), and Halifax Nova Scotia (humid, maritime).
   Drier climates were found to have greater percent cumulative stormwater
   retention with Calgary (67\%) having significantly better percent
   retention than both London (48\%) and Halifax (34\%). However, over the
   same study period the green roof in London retained the greatest depth
   of stormwater (598 mm), followed by the green roof in Halifax (471 mm)
   and then Calgary (411 mm). The impact of climate was largest for medium
   sized storms where the antecedent moisture condition (AMC) at the
   beginning of a rainfall event governs retention performance. Importantly
   AMC was a very good predictor of stormwater retention, with similar
   retention at all three sites for a given AMC, emphasizing that AMC is a
   relevant indicator of retention performance in any climate. For large
   rainfall events (i.e., >45 mm) green roof average retention ranged
   between 16\% and 29\% in all cities. Overall, drier climates have
   superior retention due to lower AMC in the media. However, moderate and
   wet climates still provide substantial total volume reduction benefits.

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: The study aimed to determine the relationship
   between T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal and
   histologic sub-patterns in prostate cancer areas with different Gleason
   grades.
   Materials and Methods: MR images of prostates (n = 25) were obtained
   prior to radical prostatectomy. These were processed as whole mount
   specimens with tumors and the peripheral zone was annotated digitally by
   two pathologists. Gleason grade 3 was the most prevalent grade and was
   subdivided into packed, intermediate, and sparse based on
   gland-to-stroma ratio. Large cribriform, intraductal carcinoma, and
   small cribriform glands (grade 4 group) were separately annotated but
   grouped together for statistical analysis. The log MRI signal intensity
   for each contoured region (n = 809) was measured, and pairwise
   comparisons were performed using the open-source software R version
   3.0.1.
   Results: Packed grade 3 sub-pattern has a significantly lower MRI
   intensity than the grade 4 group (P < 0.00001). Sparse grade 3 has a
   significantly higher MRI intensity than the packed grade 3 sub-pattern
   (P < 0.0001). No significant difference in MRI intensity was observed
   between the Gleason grade 4 group and the sparse sub-pattern grade 3
   group (P = 0.54). In multivariable analysis adjusting for peripheral
   zone, the P values maintained significance (packed grade 3 group vs
   grade 4 group, P < 0.001; and sparse grade 3 sub pattern vs packed grade
   3 sub-pattern, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that T2-weighted MRI signal is
   dependent on histologic sub-patterns within Gleason grades 3 and 4
   cancers, which may have implications for directed biopsy sampling and
   patient management.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate estimation of low blood velocities whose Doppler shifts span
   the wall filter cutoff, such as near the wall in recirculation or
   disturbed flow regions, is important for accurate mapping of velocities
   to achieve improved estimations of wall shear stress and turbulence,
   which are known risk factors for atherosclerosis and stroke. This paper
   presents the comparative benefit of increasing the number of receiver
   beams above three for an improved estimation of low 3-D velocities. The
   3-D crossbeam vector Doppler ultrasound configurations were studied in
   terms of the number of receiver beams, interbeam angle, and beam
   selection method (criterion for discriminating between tissue and blood
   Doppler signals) for a range of velocity orientations, which may prove
   useful in the design of a future 2-D array for vascular imaging. For
   maximum velocity resolution, a shallow gradient of low flow velocities
   up to 5 cm/s was generated across a large-diameter (2.46 cm) straight
   vessel. Data were acquired using a linear array rotated around the
   central transmit beam axis to generate three-to eight-receiver (3R-8R)
   configurations; the rotation of each configuration relative to the flow
   axis was used to mimic a broad range of velocity vector orientations.
   Accuracy and precision for >= 5 receivers were consistently better over
   all velocity orientations and for all selection methods. For a velocity
   magnitude of 2 cm/s, the best accuracy and precision in both magnitude
   and direction (similar to 21\% +/-13\%, <1 degrees +/-9 degrees,
   respectively) were seen with a 5R configuration using a weighted
   least-squares selection method. Asymmetry in the 5R configuration led to
   an improved accuracy and precision compared with that in symmetrical 6R
   and 8R configurations. The results demonstrated relatively little to no
   benefit from more than five receiver beams.}},

Abstract = {{Plane-wave imaging is desirable for its ability to achieve high frame
   rates, allowing the capture of fast dynamic events and continuous
   Doppler data. In most implementations of plane-wave imaging, multiple
   low-resolution images from different plane-wave tilt angles are
   compounded to form a single high-resolution image (HRI), thereby
   reducing the frame rate. Compounding improves the lateral beam profile
   in the HRI, but it also acts as a low-pass filter in slow time that
   causes attenuation and aliasing of signals with high Doppler shifts.
   This paper introduces a spread-spectrum color Doppler imaging method
   that produces HRIs without the use of compounding, thereby eliminating
   the tradeoff between beam quality, maximum unaliased Doppler frequency,
   and frame rate. The method uses a long, random sequence of transmit
   angles rather than a linear sweep of plane-wave directions. The random
   angle sequence randomizes the phase of off-focus (clutter) signals,
   thereby spreading the clutter power in the Doppler spectrum, while
   keeping the spectrum of the in-focus signal intact. The ensemble of
   randomly tilted low-resolution frames also acts as the Doppler ensemble,
   so it can be much longer than a conventional linear sweep, thereby
   improving beam formation while also making the slow-time Doppler
   sampling frequency equal to the pulse repetition frequency. Experiments
   performed using a carotid artery phantom with constant flow demonstrate
   that the spread-spectrum method more accurately measures the parabolic
   flow profile of the vessel and outperforms conventional plane-wave
   Doppler in both contrast resolution and estimation of high flow
   velocities. The spread-spectrum method is expected to be valuable for
   Doppler applications that require the measurement of high velocities at
   high frame rates.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Using a novel technique, we assess and describe the distal
   radioulnar joint (DRUJ) anatomy. The purpose of this study was to
   provide the anatomic dimensions of the DRUJ and to evaluate
   contralateral symmetry.
   Methods Computed tomography images of 100 cadaveric forearms were
   obtained. Three-dimensional models of the radius and ulna were generated
   and evaluated using 3 dimensional modeling software. Measurements of the
   radius of curvature of the sigmoid notch (SN) and ulnar head (UH), as
   well as the length of the SN and volar and dorsal lips were performed in
   the axial and coronal sequences. In addition, mid-coronal angular
   measurements were made of the SN and UH to quantify the obliquity of the
   DRUJ. All coronal measurements were performed with the forearm set to
   neutral rotation.
   Results The average ulnar variance was -0.9 +/- 1.8 mm. The radius of
   curvature of the UH (8.2 +/- 1.3 mm) was markedly smaller than that of
   the SN (18.2 +/- 8.5 mm). The length of the SN in coronal sequences
   increased from volar to dorsal by 65\%. The mid-coronal angle (DRUJ
   obliquity) of the SN and UH measured 6.0 +/- 9.9 degrees and 18.0 +/-
   9.9 degrees, respectively. A direct inverse correlation was demonstrated
   in the obliquity of the DRUJ and ulnar variance. All anatomic
   measurements were similar when comparing bilateral specimens.
   Conclusions The SN length tends to increase in size from volar to
   dorsal. Bilateral specimens from the same individual demonstrate
   similarities and can be cautiously used for comparison.
   Clinical relevance The relationships and measurements demonstrated in
   this study can be a guide when considering reconstructive procedures or
   dealing with complex fractures involving the DRUJ. Copyright (C) 2016 by

Title = {{Wind load response of offshore wind turbine towers with fixed monopile
   platform}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{122-138}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Wind turbine towers are continuously subjected to wind force as their
   major dynamic load. Dynamic response of the wind turbine tower subjected
   to wind forces is usually estimated by numerical methods such as finite
   element method (FEM). In this paper, the analytical transfer matrix
   method (TMM) is used to determine wind load response of wind turbine.
   Therefore, various and general models including coupled springs (CS),
   distributed springs (DS) and apparent fixity length (AF) models are
   employed for modeling of wind turbine foundation and axial force is
   modeled as a variable force along the tower, as well. Wind force is
   divided into two parts containing thrust and distributed force. The
   transfer matrix is derived based on Euler-Bernoulli's beam differential
   equation. The global transfer matrix is obtained by applying boundary
   conditions of the tower and constructing the point matrix. Then, the
   factors affecting the tower dynamic response such as foundation models,
   axial induction factor, terrain factor, wind shear and gust condition
   are examined in several case studies. Finally, the TMM results are
   compared with the available results in the literature such as of the FEM
   which show good agreement. The comparisons can be concluded that the TMM
   can be used instead of the conventional numerical methods maintaining
   high accuracy for wind induced vibration analysis of wind turbine
   towers.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur batteries have been receiving unprecedented attentions in
   recent years due to their exceptional high theoretical capacity and
   energy density, low cost and environmental friendliness. Yet their
   practical applications are still hindered by short cycle life, low
   efficiency and poor conductivity which are mainly caused by the
   insulating nature of sulfur and dissolution of polysulfides. Here, a
   nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets/sulfur (NGNSs/S) composite was
   synthesized via a facile chemical reaction deposition. In this
   composite, NGNSs was employed as a conductive host to entrap
   S/polysulfides in the cathode part. The NGNSs/S composite delivered an
   initial discharge capacity of 856.7 mAhg(-1) and a reversible capacity
   of 319.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with good recoverable rate capability. (C)

Abstract = {{We consider scheduling issues at Beycelik, a Turkish automotive stamping
   company that uses presses to give shape to metal sheets in order to
   produce auto parts. The problem concerns the minimization of the total
   completion time of job orders (i.e., makespan) during a planning
   horizon. This problem may be classified as a combined generalized
   flowshop and flexible flowshop problem with special characteristics. We
   show that the Stamping Scheduling Problem is NP-Hard. We develop an
   integer programming-based method to build realistic and usable
   schedules. Our results show that the proposed method is able to find
   higher quality schedules (i.e., shorter makespan values) than both the
   company's current process and a model from the literature. However, the
   proposed method has a relatively long run time, which is not practical
   for the company insituations when a (new) schedule is needed quickly
   (e.g., when there is a machine breakdown or a rush order). To improve
   the solution time, we develop a second method that is inspired by
   decomposition. We show that the second method provides higher-quality
   solutionsand in most cases optimal solutionsin a shorter time. We
   compare the performance of all three methods with the company's
   schedules. The second method finds a solution in minutes compared to
   Beycelik's current process, which takes 28hours. Further, the makespan
   values of the second method are about 6.1\% shorter than the company's
   schedules. We estimate that the company can save over Euro187,000
   annually by using the second method. We believe that the models and
   methods developed in this study can be used in similar companies and
   industries.}},

   the depth sensitivity of the subtraction-based approach is better than
   classical approaches using continuous-wave or time-resolved methods.
   Furthermore, the results showed that the subtraction-based approach has
   a unique, selective sensitivity to a layer at a specific depth. In vivo

Abstract = {{Game development is an interdisciplinary concept that embraces artistic,
   software engineering, management, and business disciplines. This
   research facilitates a better understanding of important dimensions of
   digital game development methodology. Game development is considered as
   one of the most complex tasks in software engineering. The increased
   popularity of digital games, the challenges faced by game development
   organizations in developing quality games, and high competition in the
   digital game industry demand a game development maturity assessment.
   Consequently, this study presents a Digital Game Maturity Model to
   evaluate the current development methodology in an organization. The
   framework of this model consists of assessment questionnaires, a
   performance scale, and a rating method. The main goal of the
   questionnaires is to collect information about current processes and
   practices. In general, this research contributes towards formulating a
   comprehensive and unified strategy for game development maturity
   evaluation. Two case studies were conducted and their assessment results
   reported. These demonstrate the level of maturity of current development
   practices in two organizations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, an automatic-recovery inertial switch is presented which
   for the first time adopts gallium-indium (EGaIn) as the switching metal
   droplet. The device consists of a glass substrate with patterned sensing
   electrodes, a PDMS microfluidic chip with microchannels and microvalves
   and a metal droplet. Here, we used EGaIn as the conductive element of
   the switch because it has several advantages compared with other
   conductive materials such as water or mercury. Specifically, the
   proposed device has the ability to automatically recover and can be used
   repeatedly. In the initial off-state, the droplet is stored in the
   reservoir. During the working state, the metal droplet passes through
   the channel and connects the sensing electrodes when the acceleration
   exceeds the designed threshold level. After that, the EGaIn will return
   to its original position by a subtle use of its structural
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Goal: Maintaining a constant contact force (CF) of an ablation catheter
   during cardiac catheter ablation therapy is clinically challenging due
   to inherent myocardial motion, often resulting in poor ablation of
   arrhythmogenic substrates. To enable a prescribed contact force to be
   applied during ablation, a catheter contact force controller (CCFC) was
   developed. Methods: The system includes a hand-held device attached to a
   commercial catheter and steerable sheath. A compact linear motor
   assembly attaches to an ablation catheter and autonomously controls its
   relative position within the shaft of the steerable sheath. A
   closed-loop control system is implemented within embedded electronics to
   enable real-time catheter-tissue contact force control. To evaluate the
   performance of the CCFC, a linear motion phantom was used to impose a
   series of physiological CF profiles; lesion CF was controlled at
   prescribed levels ranging from 15 to 40 g. Results: For a prescribed CF
   of 25 g, the CCFC was able to regulate the CF with a root mean squared
   error of 3.7 +/- 0.7 g. The ability of the CCFC to retract the catheter
   upon sudden changes in tissue motion, which may have caused tissue
   damage, was also demonstrated. Finally, the device was able to regulate
   the CF for a predetermined amount of time according to a force-time
   integral model. Conclusion: The developed CCFC is capable of regulating
   catheter-tissue CF in a laboratory setting that mimics clinical ablation
   therapy. Significance: Catheter-tissue CF control promises to improve
   the precision and success of ablation lesion delivery.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{807}},
Pages = {{167-204}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An analysis of flows in converging-diverging channels has been carried
   out with the primary goal of identifying geometries which result in
   increased mixing. The model geometry consists of a channel whose walls
   are fitted with spanwise grooves of moderate amplitudes (up to 10\% of
   the mean channel opening) and of sinusoidal shape. The groove systems on
   each wall are shifted by half of a wavelength with respect to each
   other, resulting in the formation of a converging-diverging conduit. The
   analysis is carried out up to Reynolds numbers resulting in the
   formation of secondary states. The first part of the analysis is based
   on a two-dimensional model and demonstrates that increasing the
   corrugation wavelength results in the appearance of an unsteady
   separation whose onset correlates with the onset of the travelling wave
   instability. The second part of the analysis is based on a
   three-dimensional model and demonstrates that the flow dynamics is
   dominated by the centrifugal instability over a large range of geometric
   parameters, resulting in the formation of streamwise vortices. It is
   shown that the onset of the vortices may lead to the elimination of the
   unsteady separation. The critical Reynolds number for the vortex onset
   initially decreases as the corrugation amplitude increases but an
   excessive increase leads to the stream lift up, reduction of the
   centrifugal forces and flow stabilization. The flow dynamics under such
   conditions is again dominated by the travelling wave instability.
   Conditions leading to the formation of streamwise vortices without
   interference from the travelling wave instability have been identified.
   The structure and the mixing properties of the saturated states are
   discussed.}},

Title = {{Uncertainties in the Estimation of Local Peak Pressures on Low-Rise
   Buildings by Using the Gumbel Distribution Fitting Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The lack of a standard accepted method to estimate local peak pressure
   coefficients from wind tunnel data can lead to inconsistent definitions
   and interpretations, particularly because cost and time constraints
   associated with wind tunnel tests of low-rise buildings necessitate
   relatively short (equivalent full-scale) durations. This paper focuses
   on a Gumbel distribution fitting method widely used in practice. Because
   the sources of uncertainty regarding estimated peaks include the use of
   short-duration records (in practice) and the assumption that the
   observed peaks from wind tunnel pressure data are Gumbel-distributed,
   this is quantified in detail in terms of the parameters determining the
   required minimum record length. It is shown that 15 observed peaks can
   lead to local peak pressure estimates with adequate precision for many
   design scenarios. However, the conversion of peak coefficients from a
   short duration to those of a longer duration requires an increase in the
   number of observed peaks to maintain precision.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and evaluate a rapid spherical navigator echo (SNAV)
   motion correction technique, then apply it for retrospective correction
   of brain images.
   Methods: The pre-rotated, template matching SNAV method (preRot-SNAV)
   was developed in combination with a novel hybrid baseline strategy,
   which includes acquired and interpolated templates. Specifically, the
   SNAV templates are only rotated around X- and Y-axis; for each rotated
   SNAV, simulated baseline templates that mimic object rotation about the
   Z-axis were interpolated.
   The new method was first evaluated with phantom experiments. Then, a
   customized SNAV-interleaved gradient echo sequence was used to image
   three volunteers performing directed head motion. The SNAV motion
   measurements were used to retrospectively correct the brain images.
   Experiments were performed using a 3.0 T whole-body MRI scanner and both
   single and 8-channel head coils.
   Results: Phantom rotations and translations measured using the hybrid
   baselines agreed to within 0.9 degrees and 1 mm compared to those
   measured with the original preRot-SNAV method. Retrospective motion
   correction of in vivo images using the hybrid preRot-SNAV effectively
   corrected for head rotation up to 4 and 4 mm.
   Conclusions: The presented hybrid approach enables the acquisition of
   pre-rotated baseline templates in as little as 2.5 s, and results in
   accurate measurement of rotations and translations. Retrospective 3D
   motion correction successfully reduced motion artifacts in vivo. (C)

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{27-39}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Elevated-conical tanks are widely used as water reservoirs in various
   locations around the globe. The vessel of a conical tank can consist of
   a truncated cone solely or a truncated cone with a top cylindrical part.
   Current codes of practice do not provide any provisions or guidelines
   for designing reinforced concrete conical tanks under hydrostatic
   loading. Available provisions are limited only to cylindrical and
   rectangular tanks. In this paper, a nonlinear Finite Element Model
   (FEM), based on shell element discretization, is used to analyze
   hydrostatically loaded reinforced concrete conical tanks. A common
   simplified approach used in the design of conical tanks involves
   replacing the conical vessels with equivalent cylinders. The adequacy of
   this simplified method is assessed in this study through comparison with
   the detailed finite element results. The FEM is then used to develop a
   set of charts which can be used to determine the adequate thickness as
   well as straining actions that develop in a liquid filled reinforced
   concrete conical tank. The use of this set of charts in designing
   reinforced concrete conical tanks is illustrated through worked
   examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{301}},
Pages = {{848-857}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{High flux gas-solids circulating fluidized bed downer reactors have
   unique characteristics especially suitable for very fast reactions.
   Detailed hydrodynamics of such reactors are experimentally studied using
   FCC particles at various superficial gas velocities (1-7 m/s) under high
   flux conditions up to 700 kg/m(2)s for the first time. Results show that
   although the radial distribution of solids holdup is somewhat less
   uniform under very high flux conditions in the downers, it is still much
   more uniform compared to riser reactors. Radial profiles of solids
   holdup, particle velocity and solids flux are significantly affected by
   the operating conditions. Particle velocity distribution is
   characterized by a relatively flat core and an annulus, where the
   particle velocity slightly increases towards the wall under low flux. In
   very high flux downer reactors, the shape of the local particle velocity
   becomes parabolic. It is also found that relationships between local
   solids holdup and particle velocity are different in the downers
   compared to the risers due to their different flow characteristics.
   Compared to the riser reactor, downer has a self-adjusting mechanism to
   perform with the nearly ``ideal{''} plug flow nature. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The development of process analytical technologies (PAT) can improve the
   efficiency and product quality during pharmaceutical manufacturing. The
   objective of the current research was to investigate the potential
   application of passive acoustic emission monitoring to detect changes
   due to lubricant addition and its dispersal in a V-blender. Trials were
   conducted with sugar spheres and two placebo formulations of
   pharmaceutical granules in a V blender. Vibrations from acoustic
   emissions were measured using PCB Piezotronics accelerometers with ICP
   signal conditioners. A wavelet filter was applied to the measured
   acoustic emissions to remove vibrations from the tumbling motion of the
   V-shell, allowing a focus on information about particle motion and
   interactions within the V-shell. Three signal features were identified
   in the acoustic emissions with each feature being attributed to phases
   of the particle motion within the V-shell. The maximum feature amplitude
   was found to vary with lubricant dispersal; both particle flowability
   and the coefficient of restitution had an impact on the acoustic
   emissions amplitude. Particle flowability changes were correlated to how
   the lubricant interacted with the solid's surface which was observed
   from scanning electron micrographs. The measured vibrations from passive
   acoustic emissions reflected changes in particle motion and interactions
   within a V-blender as the lubricant dispersed demonstrating the
   potential of passive acoustic emissions measurements to monitor blending
   processes inline and in real time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   cooling}},

Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{610-621}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Numerical models are developed by researchers to analyze and understand
   the trends occurring within rotary kilns, and allow for improvements in
   terms of energy quantification and usage. The present study develops a
   one-dimensional kiln model using elements of existing models and then
   links the model to the surroundings via a composite resistance model and
   a forced convection model that enables proper inclusion of the effects
   of shell-cooling fans. Shell-cooling fans are common in industry and
   allow for a reduction in shell temperature and promotion of internal
   coating formation. Thermal conductivity through the kiln shell is
   treated as a calibration parameter to allow for a more accurate shell
   temperature profile to be generated, while a forced convection model
   developed for a bank of jets impinging on a large cylinder is
   implemented to quantify the external convective resistance. The
   governing heat transfer and chemistry equations are implemented into the
   Matlab R2014a software to produce one-dimensional solutions of the
   temperature distributions and species mass fractions observed in a
   rotary cement kiln. A validation study is performed against an existing
   one-dimensional model showing reasonable quantitative and qualitative
   results of temperature profiles and species outputs. Using operational
   parameters from a partner organization, a profile of internal and
   external temperature profiles and the corresponding axial development of
   species products is also presented. Scanned shell temperature data is
   then compared against the results of the model considering only free
   convection, and forced convection from the kiln shell cooling fans in
   operation. An error of >= 20\% was observed when the effects of forced
   convection on the kiln shell are neglected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We report a facile and eco-friendly strategy for the fabrication of
   highly fluorescent nitrogen-doped carbon nanodots (N-CDs) and
   demonstrate their applications for multicolor cellular imaging and Co2+
   sensing in living cells. One-pot hydrothermal method using pigskin as
   the precursor yields bright green-emitting N-CDs, providing an easy way
   for the production of N-CDs without a tedious synthetic methodology or
   the toxic/expensive solvents and starting materials. Doping N
   heteroatoms benefits the generation of N CDs with stronger fluorescence
   emission. As -prepared N-CDs exhibit exceptional advantages including
   high fluorescent quantum yield (24.1\%), excellent biocompatibility, low
   -toxicity, and satisfactory chemical stability. Depending on these
   superior properties, as-synthesized N-CDs have been successfully used
   for multicolor cellular imaging. More strikingly, as-synthesized N-CDs
   generates strong response to Co2+ ions and gives rise to the
   fluorescence quenching and further application is extended to precise
   and quantitative detection of Co2+ ions in living cells. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Al-Li-Cu alloys are the least dense aluminum series with large
   applications in aerospace industries where mass plays an important role
   in calculations. In these applications, ambient- and
   elevated-temperature creep phenomena are among main failure mechanisms
   that should be assessed in detail for a safe service. Instrumented
   nanoindentation approach is a semi-destructive technique that can be
   well adapted to assess rate-dependent plastic deformation behavior of
   Al-Li-Cu alloys at room and elevated temperature. In the present paper,
   therefore, dual stage, constant loading-rate followed by constant-load,
   pyramidal nanoindentation tests were performed on an Al-Li-Cu alloy to
   assess time-dependent deformation behavior at room temperature. To this
   end, indentation size effect, indentation stress/strain rate,
   dislocations' activation energy and activation volume and their
   dependencies upon indenter displacement (indentation depth) were
   analyzed. The results were used to assess and understand possible
   transition mechanisms during a dual stage indentation scheme of an
   Al-Li-Cu alloy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{78-96}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{As cloud computing technologies finalize their transformation into the
   standard technologies for businesses of all sizes, they face more
   scrutiny than ever. Clients are expecting the benefits of turning
   infrastructure, platform and network into services payable per use
   without tolerating any service hiccups caused by performance bottlenecks
   or overprovision. This puts cloud providers under pressure to deliver
   data center management solutions and deployment plans in minimal time
   and with failure allowance close to none. Any comprehensive solution
   evaluation could gain much from the use of cloud simulators. Cloud
   simulators have the advantage of practicality over both mathematical
   proofs and real testbeds. They support any amount of heterogeneous use
   cases demanded by the cloud provider. Despite being a relatively new
   concept, multiple cloud simulators were developed. However, they are
   still in the phase of adapting to the scenarios, objectives and
   characteristics of the cloud. This paper examines a selected set of the
   current cloud simulators in terms of vision, features, and architecture.
   Strong points and limitations are discussed. Moreover, this paper
   presents a framework for cloud simulator design that can serve as an
   elaborate design checklist. A discussion of the open research challenges
   concludes the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the ground electrode shows that this electrode configuration is a
   dominant parameter for enhancing the energy yield in the plasma reactor.
   Furthermore, it was noted as the size of the reactor is increased, by
   increasing the gap between the electrodes, higher level of SIE is needed
   to reach the same level of ozone concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Coal fly ash (CFA) was transformed to Na-P zeolite (CFA-ZP)
   experimentally at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (similar to
   400 degrees C) via conventional hydrothermal heating followed by
   sonochemical energy in 4 h. The synthesized products were characterized
   using XRD, TGA/DTA, SEM, PSD, and BET techniques and CEC method. The
   effect of ultra-sonication time on crystallinity of the synthesized
   zeolite was studied. Crystallinity of Na-P zeolite as high as 87\% was
   achieved at the optimum experimental conditions of NaOH/CFA of 0.27 and
   1 h conventional heating followed by 3 h ultrasound irradiation.
   Experimental results revealed that sonochemical treatment shortened the
   crystallization time from 24 h to 4 h. Increasing the conventional
   heating time and decreasing the ultra-sonication time resulted in a
   lower crystallinity of the synthesized zeolite. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Studying chemical reactions at the nanoscale level could aid to better
   understand and control reaction processes. In this paper, the redox
   reaction between hydroquinone and Ag+ via gold nanoparticles as a
   suitable surface was taken as an example, where its thermochemical
   values were computed by using density functional theory (DFT) methods
   with the 6-31G(d) basis set. The calculated results exhibited that the
   reaction kinetics was related to pH values and concluded as three
   different kinds of processes. Assisted by the gold nanoparticles, we
   tracked the reduction of Ag+ in real time by plasmon resonance Rayleigh
   scattering spectroscopy and dark-field microscopy. Moreover, discrete
   dipole approximation and transmission electron microscope images were
   also conducted, and the calculated results were in good agreement with
   the experimental ones. In addition, we utilized the pH response of the
   redox reaction to distinguish cancer cells from the normal ones, which
   showed promising applications in promoting the development of disease
   diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Improved Performance by SiO2 Hollow Nanospheres for Silver
   Nanowire-Based Flexible Transparent Conductive Films}},

Abstract = {{Flexible transparent conductive films (TCFs) have attracted tremendous
   interest thanks to the rapid development of portable/flexible/wearable
   electronics. TCFs on the basis of silver nanowires (AgNWs) with
   excellent performance are becoming an efficient alternative to replace
   the brittle transparent metal oxide. In this study, a promising method
   was developed by introducing SiO2 hollow nano spheres (SiO2-HNSs) into
   the film to significantly improve the performance of AgNW-based TCFs.
   Since SiO2-HNSs have opposite charges to AgNWs, the strong attraction
   had promoted a uniform distribution of AgNWs and made the distance
   between AgNWs closer, which could decrease the contact resistance
   greatly. The introduction of SiO2 layer remarkably enhanced the
   transmission of visible light and the conductivity. In addition, the
   TCFs constructed by AgNWs and SiO2-HNSs showed, much higher thermal
   stability and adhesive force than those by only AgNWs. As an example,
   the transmission of AgNW/SiO2-HNS-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate)
   (PET) could increase about 14.3\% in comparison to AgNW-coated PET.
   Typically, a AgNW/SiO2-HNS-based TCF with a sheet resistance of about 33
   Omega/sq and transmittance of about 98.0\% (excluding substrate) could
   be obtained with excellent flexibility, adhesion, and thermal stability.
   At last some devices were fabricated.}},

Abstract = {{The depolymerization of coatings prepared from a 6-nitroveratryl
   carbonate end-capped poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG) self-immolative
   polymer was studied. This polymer undergoes end-to-end depolymerization
   following cleavage of the end-cap by UV light. Several important
   fundamental differences between this class of polymers and conventional
   degradable polymers were revealed. For example, polymer backbone
   cleavage and depolymerization exhibited different dependencies on pH,
   emphasizing the decoupling of these processes. Probing of the coating
   erosion mechanism illustrated an interesting combination of features
   from surface erosion and bulk degradation mechanisms that arise from the
   end-to-end depolymerization mechanism and further differentiate these
   polymers from convention degradable polymers. It was also demonstrated
   that, unlike backbone cleavage, PEtG depolymerization did not exhibit a
   dependence on water and that PEtG could depolymerize back to the
   volatile monomer ethyl glyoxylate at ambient temperature and pressure.
   This unusual feature was utilized to perform facile polymer
   reprogramming/recycling via an irradiation trapping repolymerization
   sequence as well as polymer patterning by a simple
   irradiation-evaporation sequence.}},

Abstract = {{Background Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for
   all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality
   levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015)
   provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific
   mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to
   2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and
   expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures.
   Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and
   year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD
   2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation
   of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter
   selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian
   process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also
   expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to
   14 294 geography-year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including
   Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for
   mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific
   mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating
   estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to
   systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across
   geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends
   of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic
   Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per
   capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined
   factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of
   counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population
   growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes
   contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in
   life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of
   the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in
   accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates
   Reporting (GATHER).
   Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61.7 years
   (95\% uncertainty interval 61.4-61.9) in 1980 to 71.8 years (71.5-72.2)
   in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in
   life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly
   high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies
   saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in
   countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From
   2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11.3 years
   (3.7-17.4), to 62.6 years (56.5-70.2). Total deaths increased by 4.1\%
   (2.6-5.6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55.8 million (54.9 million to
   56.6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17.0\%
   (15.8-18.1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth
   and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for
   non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes
   increasing by 14.1\% (12.6-16.0) to 39.8 million (39.2 million to 40.5
   million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13.1\%
   (11.9-14.3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs,
   including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis,
   and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total
   deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal,
   neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to
   2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to
   HIV/AIDS (42.1\%, 39.1-44.6), malaria (43.1\%, 34.7-51.8), neonatal
   preterm birth complications (29.8\%, 24.8-34.9), and maternal disorders
   (29.1\%, 19.3-37.1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as
   lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas
   deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders.
   Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from
   2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly
   more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015,
   rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths
   due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000-183 000) and pneumococcal
   pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower
   respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000-532 000), although
   pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of
   population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates
   substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected
   associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular
   shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with
   rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years
   of life lost {[}YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on
   the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous
   patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease,
   stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most
   regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for
   ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable,
   maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs
   throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected
   YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading
   causes of early death.
   Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily
   improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress
   continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries
   than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against
   this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life
   expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are
   increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates,
   population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most
   non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting
   increased demands on health systems. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

   2015 Dis Injury Incidence},

Abstract = {{Background Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract
   from the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a
   trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many
   countries from causes affecting children, to non-communicable diseases
   (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases,
   Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the
   incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and
   injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of
   1990 to 2015.
   Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year,
   and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical
   procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data
   sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the
   identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to
   November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal
   outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by
   cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved
   version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed
   for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative
   modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited
   to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be
   determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator
   that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and
   fertility (the Socio-demographic Index {[}SDI]) and used it to compare
   observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries
   or locations with similar SDI scores.
   Findings We generated 9.3 billion estimates from the various
   combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae,
   and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes
   had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory
   infections (17.2 billion, 95\% uncertainty interval {[}UI] 15.4-19.2
   billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2.39 billion, 2.30-2.50 billion).
   Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10\%
   of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type
   headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss,
   migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and
   ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people
   in 2015 was anaemia, with 2.36 billion (2.35-2.37 billion) individuals
   affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of
   individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively.
   Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of
   years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for
   18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale.
   Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower
   than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included
   in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically
   accounted for 20-30\% of total disability, largely attributable to
   nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases,
   HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading
   global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause
   was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in
   central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS
   in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and
   legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries;
   iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda;
   onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo.
   Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number
   of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the
   epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute
   to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well
   as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in
   data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the
   standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides
   opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between
   countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at
   similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the
   estimates available. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
   Study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk
   factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. By providing
   national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this
   study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in
   context.
   Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for
   previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate
   attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and trends
   in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural,
   environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks
   from 1990 to 2015. This study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met
   World Cancer Research Fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable
   evidence. We extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from
   randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household
   surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. We used
   statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate
   covariates. We developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure
   across risk factors-the summary exposure value. Using the counterfactual
   scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of
   deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. We decomposed
   trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth,
   population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific
   DALY rates. We characterised risk exposure in relation to a
   Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation,
   household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and
   smoking each decreased by more than 25\%. Global exposure for several
   occupational risks, high body-mass index (BMI), and drug use increased
   by more than 25\% over the same period. All risks jointly evaluated in
   2015 accounted for 57.8\% (95\% CI 56.6-58.8) of global deaths and
   41.2\% (39.8-42.8) of DALYs. In 2015, the ten largest contributors to
   global DALYs among Level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure
   (211.8 million {[}192.7 million to 231.1 million] global DALYs), smoking
   (148.6 million {[}134.2 million to 163.1 million]), high fasting plasma
   glucose (143.1 million {[}125.1 million to 163.5 million]), high BMI
   (120.1 million {[}83.8 million to 158.4 million]), childhood
   undernutrition (113.3 million {[}103.9 million to 123.4 million]),
   ambient particulate matter (103.1 million {[}90.8 million to 115.1
   million]), high total cholesterol (88.7 million {[}74.6 million to 105.7
   million]), household air pollution (85.6 million {[}66.7 million to
   106.1 million]), alcohol use (85.0 million {[}77.2 million to 93.0
   million]), and diets high in sodium (83.0 million {[}49.3 million to
   127.5 million]). From 1990 to 2015, attributable DALYs declined for
   micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation
   and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted DALY
   rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. Rising
   exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable DALYs from
   high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and
   drug use. Environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined
   steadily with SDI; low physical activity, high BMI, and high fasting
   plasma glucose increased with SDI. In 119 countries, metabolic risks,
   such as high BMI and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most
   attributable DALYs in 2015. Regionally, smoking still ranked among the
   leading five risk factors for attributable DALYs in 109 countries;
   childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early
   death and disability in much of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Declines in some key environmental risks have contributed
   to declines in critical infectious diseases. Some risks appear to be
   invariant to SDI. Increasing risks, including high BMI, high fasting
   plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to
   rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for
   intervention. Some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain
   major causes of attributable DALYs, even as exposure is declining.
   Public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are
   increasingly major contributors to global burden. Copyright (C) The

Abstract = {{Ultrafine dry powder coating technology creates biocompatible polymeric
   coatings for implants. Nanoparticles (nTiO(2)) modify flow to prevent
   agglomeration and create homogenous coatings. Since polyester-based
   coatings require the potentially harmful 1,3,5-triglycidyl isocyanurate
   (TGIC) curing agent, this study's objective was to develop alternative
   TGIC-free formulations. Epoxy and epoxy/polyester (1:1) hybrid mixtures
   were enriched with CaO (5\% w/w) and nTiO(2) (0.5\% w/w), as functional
   additives and flow modifiers, respectively. Epoxy-TiO2 and Hybrid-TiO2
   mixtures were prepared with micron-sized TiO2 (25\% w/w) to enhance
   biocompatibility. Polymer chips and additives were combined in a
   high-shear mixer and passed through a sieve (35 mu m) to yield ultrafine
   particles that were sprayed (20kV) onto metal sheets and cured (200
   degrees C). Particle size analyses showed that all formulations were
   ultrafine (D 0.5<35 mu m), and epoxy/polyester/TiO2 mixtures were the
   smallest (D 0.5=16.34 mu m). Angles of repose, avalanche and resting
   indicated reduced flowability when epoxy was enriched with TiO2 and/or
   polyester, although all formulae were highly flowable. Elemental mapping
   of coatings showed a predominance of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) from
   resin polymer, and elevated titanium (Ti) in the TiO2 enriched surfaces.
   However, calcium (Ca) clusters were higher on the epoxy/polyester Hybrid
   coatings. Optical microscopy showed human mesenchymal cells (ATCC
   CRL-1486) attached and spread out, and Alizarin Red staining showed
   mineral deposits in 2-4 week cultures, particularly on
   epoxy/polyester/TiO2 Hybrid surfaces. These epoxy resin-based
   formulations were effective TGIC-free substitutes for ultrafine dry
   powder coatings on implants. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

Abstract = {{A ratiometric fluorescent pH probe 44(1E,
   3E)-4-(benzo{[}d]thiazol-2-yl)buta-1, 3-dienyl)-N, N-dimethylbenzenamine
   (BTDB) was synthesized via ethylene bridging of thiazol and
   cinnamaldehyde for extremely acidic sensing. BTDB exhibits ratiometric
   fluorescence emission (I-425 nm/I-595 nm) characteristics with pK(a) of
   2.34 and a large Stokes shift of 177 nm under acidic conditions. The
   linear response to pH is in the range of 2.3-4.0. Quantum chemical
   calculations with the B3LYP exchange functional theory demonstrated that
   the ratiometric response of the probe to acidic pH was due to H+ binding
   with the N of cinnamaldehyde and the induced decreases of the
   intramolecular charger transfer (ICT) process. The as-prepared probe
   displayed excellent cell membrane permeability was further applied
   successfully to monitor pH fluctuations in live cells with excellent
   lysosomal targeting ability, and extreme acidity in Escherichia soli
   cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum sulfide was loaded on TiO2 by an in-situ solar
   photo-deposition method over a dye synthesized photocatalytic process
   using Eosin Y (EY) as a photo-sensitizer and tri-ethanolamine (TEOA) as
   an electron donor. (NH4)(2)MoS4 was also used as a precursor. The effect
   of molybdenum sulfide as a co-catalyst was investigated. The proposed
   noble-metal-free photocatalytic system exhibited high efficiency for H-2
   evolution. A systematic statistical design of experimental analysis was
   employed to explore the impact of various parameters and to subsequently
   optimize the photocatalytic hydrogen production. TEOA, EY and
   (NH4)(2)MoS4 concentrations as well as pH of the solution were selected
   as the four factors in the study, whereas the amount of hydrogen
   produced after 3 h of solar irradiation was considered as the response.
   The possible mechanism for the in-situ solar photo-deposition method was
   also proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Ionic liquids for the fractionation of microalgae biomass}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{22-27}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Microalgae have emerged as one of the most promising sources of
   renewable biomass. However, considerable challenges must be addressed in
   order to improve the commercial outlook for the production of commodity
   chemicals. The largest challenge remains the energy intensive and
   consequently costly process of microalgae harvesting and drying. Ionic
   liquids have found a niche application in this area by allowing the
   extraction of lipids from wet biomass at low temperatures in less time
   than traditional lipid extraction methods. A number of recent studies
   have advanced the study of wet extraction of microalgae using ionic
   liquids and elucidated some of the limitations of this process. However,
   the most promising avenue for ionic liquid-based wet extraction lies in
   the fractionation and recovery of multiple biomass products such as
   lipids, carbohydrates, and carotenoids, in a single process. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style in
   building Web applications based on services. In SOA, the lack of trust
   between different parties affects the adoption of such architecture.
   Because trust is an important factor in successful online interactions,
   it is a major criterion for service selection. In the context of online
   services and SOA, the literature shows that the field of trust is not
   mature. The definitions of trust and its essential aspects do not
   reflect the true nature of trust online. This paper proposes a
   comprehensive trust-based SOA solution based on an identified trust
   definition and its principles for selecting services based on their
   trustworthiness. In particular, SOA is extended and a new component, the
   trust framework, which is responsible for the trust process, is added to
   the architecture. Consequently, its components are identified and built.
   The trust-based SOA is implemented through experiments and scenarios.

Title = {{THE ORBIT AND TRANSIT PROSPECTS FOR beta PICTORIS b CONSTRAINED WITH ONE

Abstract = {{A principal scientific goal of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is
   obtaining milliarcsecond astrometry to constrain exoplanet orbits.
   However, astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases,
   systematic errors, and speckle noise. Here, we describe an analytical
   procedure to forward model the signal of an exoplanet that accounts for
   both the observing strategy (angular and spectral differential imaging)
   and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Loeve Image Projection
   algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position of an
   exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and
   Markov-chain Monte Carlo to account for correlated noise. In the case of
   GPI data on beta Pic b, this technique, which we call Bayesian KLIP-FM
   Astrometry (BKA), outperforms previous techniques and yields 1 sigma
   errors at or below the one milliarcsecond level. We validate BKA by
   fitting a Keplerian orbit to 12 GPI observations along with previous
   astrometry from other instruments. The statistical properties of the
   residuals confirm that BKA is accurate and correctly estimates
   astrometric errors. Our constraints on the orbit of beta Pic b firmly
   rule out the possibility of a transit of the planet at 10-sigma
   significance. However, we confirm that the Hill sphere of beta Pic b
   will transit, giving us a rare chance to probe the circumplanetary
   environment of a young, evolving exoplanet. We provide an ephemeris for
   photometric monitoring of the Hill sphere transit event, which will
   begin at the start of April in 2017 and finish at the end of January in
   2018.}},

Title = {{Impact of librarians on reporting of the literature searching component

Volume = {{104}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A critical element in conducting a systematic review is the
   identification of studies. To date, very little empirical evidence has
   been reported on whether the presence of a librarian or information
   professional can contribute to the quality of the final product. The
   goal of this study was to compare the reporting rigor of the literature
   searching component of systematic reviews with and without the help of a
   librarian.
   Method: Systematic reviews published from 2002 to 2011 in the twenty
   highest impact factor pediatrics journals were collected from MEDLINE.
   Corresponding authors were contacted via an email survey to determine if
   a librarian was involved, the role that the librarian played, and
   functions that the librarian performed. The reviews were scored
   independently by two reviewers using a fifteen-item checklist.
   Results: There were 186 reviews that met the inclusion criteria, and
   44\% of the authors indicated the involvement of a librarian in
   conducting the systematic review. With the presence of a librarian as
   coauthor or team member, the mean checklist score was 8.40, compared to
   6.61 (p<0.001) for reviews without a librarian.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that having a librarian as a coauthor or
   team member correlates with a higher score in the literature searching
   component of systematic reviews.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormality of sensorimotor integration in the basal ganglia and cortex
   has been reported in the literature for patients with task-specific
   focal hand dystonia (FHD). In this study, we investigate the effect of
   manipulation of kinesthetic input in people living with writer's cramp
   disorder (a major form of FHD). For this purpose, severity of dystonia
   is studied for 11 participants while the symptoms of seven participants
   have been tracked during five sessions of assessment and Botulinum toxin
   injection (BoNT-A) therapy (one of the current suggested therapies for
   dystonia). BoNT-A therapy is delivered in the first and the third
   session. The goal is to analyze the effect of haptic manipulation as a
   potential assistive technique during BoNT-A therapy. The trial includes
   writing, hovering, and spiral/sinusoidal drawing subtasks. In each
   session, the subtasks are repeated twice when (a) a participant uses a
   normal pen, and (b) when the participant uses a robotics-assisted system
   (supporting the pen) which provides a compliant virtual writing surface
   and manipulates the kinesthetic sensory input. The results show
   (p-value<0.001 using one-sample t-tests) that reducing the writing
   surface rigidity significantly decreases the severity of dystonia and
   results in better control of grip pressure (an indicator of dystonic
   cramping). It is also shown that (p-value<0.001 based on paired-samples
   t-test) using the proposed haptic manipulation strategy, it is possible
   to augment the effectiveness of BoNT-A therapy. The outcome of this
   study is then used in the design of an actuated pen as a
   writing-assistance tool that can provide compliant haptic interaction
   during writing for FHD patients.}},

   constraints in continuous max-flow medical image segmentation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Optimization-based segmentation approaches deriving from discrete
   graph-cuts and continuous max-flow have become increasingly nuanced,
   allowing for topological and geometric constraints on the resulting
   segmentation while retaining global optimality. However, these two
   considerations, topological and geometric, have yet to be combined in a
   unified manner. The concept of ``shape complexes,{''} which combine
   geodesic star convexity with extendable continuous max-flow solvers, is
   presented. These shape complexes allow more complicated shapes to be
   created through the use of multiple labels and super-labels, with
   geodesic star convexity governed by a topological ordering. These
   problems can be optimized using extendable continuous max-flow solvers.
   Previous approaches required computationally expensive coordinate system
   warping, which are ill-defined and ambiguous in the general case. These
   shape complexes are demonstrated in a set of synthetic images as well as
   vessel segmentation in ultrasound, valve segmentation in ultrasound, and
   atrial wall segmentation from contrast-enhanced CT. Shape complexes
   represent an extendable tool alongside other continuous max-flow methods
   that may be suitable for a wide range of medical image segmentation
   problems. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{In-depth understanding of the diaphragm's anatomy and physiology has
   been of great interest to the medical community, as it is the most
   important muscle of the respiratory system. While noncontrast
   four-dimensional (4-D) computed tomography (CT) imaging provides an
   interesting opportunity for effective acquisition of anatomical and/or
   functional information from a single modality, segmenting the diaphragm
   in such images is very challenging not only because of the diaphragm's
   lack of image contrast with its surrounding organs but also because of
   respiration-induced motion artifacts in 4-D CT images. To account for
   such limitations, we present an automatic segmentation algorithm, which
   is based on a priori knowledge of diaphragm anatomy. The novelty of the
   algorithm lies in using the diaphragm's easy-to-segment contacting
   organs-including the lungs, heart, aorta, and ribcage-to guide the
   diaphragm's segmentation. Obtained results indicate that average mean
   distance to the closest point between diaphragms segmented using the
   proposed technique and corresponding manual segmentation is 2.55 +/-
   0.39 mm, which is favorable. An important feature of the proposed
   technique is that it is the first algorithm to delineate the entire
   diaphragm. Such delineation facilitates applications, where the
   diaphragm boundary conditions are required such as biomechanical
   modeling for in-depth understanding of the diaphragm physiology. (C)

Abstract = {{Prostate segmentation on T2w MRI is important for several diagnostic and
   therapeutic procedures for prostate cancer. Manual segmentation is
   time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subject to high interobserver
   variability. This study investigated the suitability of
   computer-assisted segmentation algorithms for clinical translation,
   based on measurements of interoperator variability and measurements of
   the editing time required to yield clinically acceptable segmentations.
   A multioperator pilot study was performed under three pre- and
   postediting conditions: manual, semiautomatic, and automatic
   segmentation. We recorded the required editing time for each
   segmentation and measured the editing magnitude based on five different
   spatial metrics. We recorded average editing times of 213, 328, and 393
   s for manual, semiautomatic, and automatic segmentation respectively,
   while an average fully manual segmentation time of 564 s was recorded.
   The reduced measured postediting interoperator variability of
   semiautomatic and automatic segmentations compared to the manual
   approach indicates the potential of computer-assisted segmentation for
   generating a clinically acceptable segmentation faster with higher
   consistency. The lack of strong correlation between editing time and the
   values of typically used error metrics (rho < 0.5) implies that the
   necessary postsegmentation editing time needs to be measured directly in
   order to evaluate an algorithm's suitability for clinical translation.

Abstract = {{An experimental study is reported that investigated the bubble formation
   from a novel nozzle design in a liquid cross-flow using high speed
   imaging. Different configurations and orientations of the novel nozzle
   design were considered over a range of gas-to-liquid flow rate ratios
   (GLR) from 0.00031 to 0.00204. The results show that for all cases, the
   novel nozzle generated smaller bubbles at higher detachment frequency
   compared to the standard nozzle. At low liquid velocities, the novel
   nozzle generated bubbles that were 30\% smaller in size at a detachment
   frequency 2-3 times higher than that for the standard nozzle. It was
   also found that the bubble diameter and the detachment frequency are
   almost independent of the liquid velocity. The underlying physical
   process of bubble formation and detachment in the novel nozzle under
   liquid cross-flow was also investigated. It was observed that the
   process comprised of three phases: expansion, collapse and pinch off. It
   was also found that the rebound force of the bubble from a side-hole
   under the influence of liquid drag force and hydrostatic pressure plays
   a key role in the early bubble detachment. The results demonstrated that
   the novel nozzle design performs better than the standard nozzle in the
   liquid cross-flow, especially at high GLRs. Crown Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Our group has shown a greater number of functioning motor units (MU) in
   a cohort of highly active older (similar to 65 yr) masters runners
   relative to age-matched controls. Because of the precipitous loss in the
   number of functioning MUs in the eighth and ninth decades of life it is
   unknown whether older world class octogenarian masters athletes (MA)
   would also have greater numbers of functioning MUs compared with
   age-matched controls. We measured MU numbers and neuromuscular
   transmission stability in the tibialis anterior of world champion MAs
   (similar to 80 yr) and compared the values with healthy age-matched
   controls (similar to 80 yr). Decomposition-enhanced spike-triggered
   averaging was used to collect surface and intramuscular electromyography
   signals during dorsiflexion at similar to 25\% of maximum voluntary
   isometric contraction. Near fiber (NF) MU potential analysis was used to
   assess neuromuscular transmission stability. For the MAs compared with
   age-matched controls, the amount of excitable muscle mass (compound
   muscle action potential) was 14\% greater (P < 0.05), there was a trend
   (P = 0.07) toward a 27\% smaller surface-detected MU potential
   representative of less collateral reinnervation, and 28\% more
   functioning MUs (P < 0.05). Additionally, the MAs had greater MU
   neuromuscular stability than the controls, as indicated by lower NF
   jitter and jiggle values (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that
   high-performing octogenarians better maintain neuromuscular stability of
   the MU and mitigate the loss of MUs associated with aging well into the
   later decades of life during which time the loss of muscle mass and
   strength becomes functionally relevant. Future studies may identify the
   concomitant roles genetics and exercise play in neuro-protection.}},

Title = {{The rotator cuff muscles are antagonists after reverse total shoulder
   arthroplasty}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: There is disagreement regarding whether, when possible,
   the rotator cuff should be repaired in conjunction with reverse total
   shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). Therefore, we investigated the effects of
   rotator cuff repair in RTSA models with varying magnitudes of humeral
   and gienosphere lateralization.
   Methods: Six fresh frozen cadaveric shoulders were tested on a validated
   in vitro muscle-driven motion simulator. Each specimen was implanted
   with a custom adjustable, load-sensing RTSA after creation of a
   simulated rotator cuff tear. The effects of 4 RTSA configurations (0 and
   10 mm of humeral lateralization and glenosphere lateralization) on
   deltoid force and joint load during abduction with and without rotator
   cuff repair were assessed.
   Results: Deltoid force was significantly affected by increasing humeral
   lateralization (-2.5\% +/- 1.7\% body weight {[}BW], P = .016) and
   glenosphere lateralization (+ 7.7\% +/- 5.6\% BW, P = .016). Rotator
   cuff repair interacted with humeral and glenosphere lateralization (P =
   .005), such that with no humeral lateralization, glenosphere
   lateralization increased deltoid force without cuff repair (8.1\% +/-
   5.1\% BW, P = .012). This effect was increased with cuff repair (12.8\%
   +/- 7.8\% BW, P = .010), but the addition of humeral lateralization
   mitigated this effect. Rotator cuff repair increased joint load (+
   11.9\% +/- 5.1\% BW, P = .002), as did glenosphere lateralization (+
   13.3\% +/- 3.7\% BW, P <.001). These interacted, such that increasing
   glenosphere lateralization markedly increased the negative effects of
   cuff repair (9.4\% +/- 3.2\% BW {[}P =.001] vs. 14.4\% +/- 7.4\% BW {[}P
   = .005]).
   Conclusion: Rotator cuff repair, especially in conjunction with
   glenosphere lateralization, produces an antagonistic effect that
   increases deltoid and joint loading. The long-term effects of this
   remain unknown; however, combining these factors may prove undesirable.
   Humeral lateralization improves joint compression through deltoid
   wrapping and increases the deltoid's mechanical advantage, and
   therefore, could be used in place of rotator cuff repair, thus avoiding
   its complications. (C) 2016 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board

   investigated using a 100 mL bench-scale reactor operating at 300 degrees
   C with an initial hydrogen pressure of 50 bar for 3 h with a pyrolysis
   oil (PO). The catalytic efficiencies for bio-oil HDO for the catalysts
   were compared with the expensive but commercially available Ru/C
   catalyst. Addition of small amount of P to the Mo catalysts supported on
   either AC and Al2O3 led to increased degree of deoxygenation (DOD) and
   oil yield compared with those without P. MoP supported on AC (MoP/AC)
   demonstrated bio-oil HDO activity comparable to the Ru/C catalyst.
   Furthermore, three AC-supported metal phosphides for PO HDO were

Abstract = {{The Nakamura method, which involves horizontal-to-vertical spectral
   ratio (HVSR) analysis, is widely used for seismic microzonation studies.
   The noise from local traffic in city conditions presents a challenge for
   the application of HVSR analysis. This article presents a technique
   developed for separation of the transient noise due to local traffic
   (high-level noise) and background ambient noise (low-level noise) and
   the application of the HVSR analysis to both partitions of the noise.
   This approach is applied to identify the predominant frequencies for
   almost 200 noise samples from the Greater Toronto area. The results
   demonstrated that the developed technique is effective and allows
   estimation of the fundamental resonant frequency in the HVSR in urban
   environment, even in the presence of intensive nearby traffic. The
   interpretation of the obtained results showed that, most probably, the
   lower (fundamental) frequency appears due to multiple reflections from
   the overburden/bedrock boundary. In some cases, a resonance with higher
   amplitude is dominant, and it is due to a contrast boundary between soil
   layers in the overburden.}},

Abstract = {{We present in-vivo study related to the use of our implantable RF
   telemetry system for pressure-volume (PV) cardiac monitoring in a animal
   subject. We implant a commercial MEMS PV sensor into the subject's heart
   left-ventricle (LV), while the telemetry system is implanted outside of
   the heart and connected to the sensor with a 7-microwires tether. The RF
   telemetry system is suitable for commercial application in medium sized
   subjects, its total volume of 2.475cm(3) and a weight of 4.0g. Our
   designed system is 58 \% smaller in volume, 44 \% in weight and has a 55
   \% reduction in sampling power over the last reported research in PV
   telemetry. In-vivo data was captured in both an acute and a freely
   moving setting over a 24 hour period. We experimentally demonstrated
   viability of the methodology that includes the surgical procedure and
   real-time monitoring of the in-vivo data in a freely moving subject.
   Further improvements in catheter design will improve the data quality
   and safety of the subject. This real-time implantable technology allows
   for researchers to quantify cardiac pathologies by extracting real-time
   pressure-volume loops, wirelessly from within freely moving subjects.}},

   The effect of processing parameters, such as injection velocity and melt
   temperature, on the microstructure and electrical conductivity of
   injection molded microparts was systematically investigated. The
   electrical conductivity of the microparts was measured in three
   perpendicular directions to determine anisotropy. Results showed that
   the measured conductivity is process-dependent and melt temperature is
   the main factor that affects the electrical conductivity of the
   resultant samples. Electrical conductivity increased with an incremental
   loading fraction of CNT, and the percolation threshold shifted to higher
   filler loading concentration which was ascribed to the very high shear
   rate in mu IM. In addition, Raman analysis, SEM observations, and
   simulation results indicated that CNT is preferentially oriented along
   the flow direction arising from the high shearing effect induced by mu

Abstract = {{We present the initial results from a small animal PET insert designed
   to be operated inside a 7T MRI. The insert fits within the 114 mm inner
   diameter of the Bruker BGA-12S gradient coil while accommodating the
   Bruker 35 mm volume RF coil (outer diameter 60 mm), both used in the
   Bruker 70/20 MRI systems. The PET insert is a ring comprising 16
   detectors. Each detector has a dual-layer offset (DLO) lutetium-yttrium
   oxyorthsilicate (LYSO) scintillator array read out by two SensL
   SPMArray4B SiPM arrays. The DLO scintillator has bottom (top) layers of:
   22 x 10 (21 x 9) crystals of size 1.2 x 1.2 x6 (4) mm(3) for a total of
   409 crystals per block, providing an axial extent of 28.17 mm. The
   detector outputs are multiplexed to four signals using a custom readout
   board and digitized using the OpenPET data acquisition platform. The
   detector flood images successfully resolve over 99\% of the crystals,
   with average energy resolution of 12.5 +/- 2.0\% at 511 keV. Testing of
   the PET system inside the MRI showed that the PET insert had no effect
   on MRI image homogeneity and only a small effect on echo planar images
   (EPI) signal to noise ratio (SNR) (-9\%), with neither PET nor MRI
   images showing obvious artefacts. These acquisitions used the OpenPET
   operating in ``oscilloscope mode{''} with USB2.0 interface, allowing a
   maximum total singles event rate of 280 kcps, strongly limiting the
   count rate capabilities of the system. The PET radial spatial resolution
   (as measured with a Na-22 point source and FBP-3DRP reconstruction) is
   1.17 mm at the centre, degrading to 1.86 mm at a 15 mm radial offset.
   Simultaneous phantom and mouse PET/MR imaging produced good quality
   images that were free of any obvious artefacts.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the causes of the low-biodiversity faunas in the Western
   Interior Seaway (WIS), overwhelmingly dominated by ammonite and bivalve
   molluscs, will help us to understand paleoenvironmental conditions in
   the WIS. In this study, we examined rare earth elements (REEs) in
   well-preserved molluscs from the Bearpaw Formation to reconstruct WIS
   redox conditions. Both nektonic and benthic molluscs share similar REE
   patterns with enrichment in light REEs. There is only a slight Ce
   depletion in both types of molluscs, indicating no significant
   fractionation of Ce from the other REEs. A lack of significant Ce
   anomalies in molluscs points to oxygen-deficient (probably dysoxic)
   conditions in the middle to bottom part of the water column where the
   molluscs lived. Given the general lack of significant Ce anomalies also
   in molluscs from older formations, oxygen deficiency was likely
   prevalent in the Late Cretaceous in the WIS. A warmer climate in the
   Cretaceous is probably a driver of such conditions, as predicted by
   ocean models. Long-term oxygen deficiency and stratification, inferred
   from the heterogeneity in delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of molluscs,
   may also imply weak circulation, reducing the exchange of surface water
   and subsurface water, and the transport of oxygen into the WIS. The
   oxygen deficiency and weak circulation of the seaway is also expressed
   in the general characteristics of faunas and possibly Bearpaw
   sedimentary rocks. Oxygen deficiency rather than the brackish water
   conditions may have been largely responsible, therefore, for the low
   diversity of the WIS fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Stakeholder involvement can serve to increase the quality of decision

   engagement process applied in the development of the Computerized Tool

   Change described here followed many of the tenants of best practices

Abstract = {{In this study, effects of fractionation solvents, catalysts,

   lignin products of relatively high purity. The use of HCl catalyst
   contributed to a high crude cellulose yield, while H2SO4 showed an
   adverse effect on cellulose yield. However, both of these acidic
   catalysts contributed to much lower hemicellulose contents in the
   resulted crude cellulose products compared with those obtained without a
   catalyst. Fractionation at 90 degrees C for 180 min in mixed solvents of
   acetic acid/formic acid/water (3:6:1, v/v/v) with or without catalyst
   produced crude cellulose with very low residual lignin contents (<4\%).

Abstract = {{This contribution reports the kinetics of the photocatalytic production
   of hydrogen using a modified DP25 (TiO2)-1 wt\% Pt and ethanol as an
   organic scavenger. This study is carried out in a Photo-CREC water II
   Reactor with a specially designed H-2 collector tank. Experiments are
   developed under the following conditions: (a) An optimum photocatalyst
   loading, (b) Near-UV irradiation, (c) An acid pH and (d) Using ethanol
   as an organic scavenger. This research considers an ``In
   Series-Parallel{''} kinetics to describe the photocatalytic conversion
   of ethanol (the organic scavenger) and of other carbon containing
   product species. Rate equations considered are of the
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood type leading to a set of ordinary differential
   equations. Furthermore, it is observed that hydrogen formation is a near
   zero order reaction. Regression analyses are used to calculate kinetic
   parameters with a cross-correlation matrix and 95\% confidence
   intervals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) is a Staphylococcus aureus
   superantigen that has been implicated in both menstrual and nonmenstrual
   toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Despite the important role of TSST-1 in
   severe human disease, a comprehensive understanding of staphylococcal
   regulatory factors that control TSST-1 expression remains incomplete.
   The S. aureus exotoxin expression (Sae) operon contains a
   well-characterized two-component system that regulates a number of
   important exotoxins in S. aureus, although regulation of TSST-1 by the
   Sae system has not been investigated. We generated a defined deletion
   mutant of the Sae histidine kinase sensor (saeS) in the prototypic
   menstrual TSS strain S. aureus MN8. Mutation of saeS resulted in a
   complete loss of TSST-1 expression. Using both luciferase reporter
   experiments and quantitative real-time PCR, we demonstrate that the Sae
   system is an important transcriptional activator of TSST-1 expression.
   Recombinant SaeR was able to bind directly to the tst promoter to a
   region containing two SaeR consensus binding sites. Although the
   stand-alone SarA transcriptional regulator has been shown to be both a
   positive and a negative regulator of TSST-1, deletion of sarA in S.
   aureus MN8 resulted in a dramatic overexpression of TSST-1. As expected,
   mutation of agr also reduced TSST-1 expression, but this phenotype
   appeared to be independent of Sae. A double mutation of saeS and sarA
   resulted in the loss of TSST-1 expression. This work indicates that the
   Sae system is a dominant and direct transcriptional activator that is
   required for expression of TSST-1.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) affects the foot's
   overall function and its ability to dissipate plantar pressure forces.
   Previous research on the MLA includes measuring the calcaneal-first
   metatarsal angle using a static sagittal plane radiograph, a dynamic
   height-to-length ratio using marker clusters with a multisegment foot
   model, and a contained angle using single point markers with a
   multisegment foot model. The objective of this study was to use biplane
   fluoroscopy to measure a contained MLA angle between foot types: pes
   planus (low arch), pes cavus (high arch), and normal arch. Fifteen
   participants completed the study, five from each foot type. Markerless
   fluoroscopic radiostereometric analysis (fRSA) was used with a
   three-dimensional model of the foot bones and manually matching those
   bones to a pair of two-dimensional radiographic images during midstance
   of gait. Statistically significant differences were found between
   barefoot arch angles of the normal and pes cavus foot types (p = 0.036),
   as well as between the pes cavus and pes planus foot types (p = 0.004).
   Dynamic walking also resulted in a statistically significant finding
   compared to the static standing trials (p = 0.014). These results
   support the classification of individuals following a physical
   assessment by a foot specialist for those with pes cavus and planus foot
   types. The differences between static and dynamic kinematic measurements
   were also supported using this novel method.}},

Abstract = {{The protein osteopontin (OPN) plays an important role in preventing the
   formation of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) kidney stones. To gain
   insight into these mechanisms, crystallization was induced by addition
   of human kidney OPN to artificial urine (ionic strength comparable to
   urine; without citrate), and the OPN-COM interaction studied using a
   combination of scanning electron (SEM) and confocal microscopy. By SEM,
   we found that increasing OPN concentrations formed large monoclinic
   penetration twins (no protein added) and, at higher concentrations (1-,
   2 mu g/ml OPN), super and hyper twins with crystal habits not found in
   previous studies. For instance, the hyper twins indicate well-facetted
   gearwheel-like habits with ``teeth{''} developed in all crystallographic
   < h0l > directions. At OPN concentrations >= 2 mu g/ml, a switching to
   small dumbbell-shaped COM habits with fine-textured surfaces occurred.
   Confocal microscopy of these dumbbells indicates protein incorporation
   in almost the entire crystal structure (in contrast to facetted COM),
   proposing a threshold concentration of similar to 2 mu g/ml OPN for the
   facetted to the non-facetted habit transformation. Both the
   gearwheel-like and the dumbbell-shaped habit are again found
   side-by-side (presumably triggered by OPN concentration gradients within
   the sample) in in-vitro formed conglomerates, which resemble
   cross-sections of papillary kidney stones. The abrupt transformation
   from facetted to non-facetted habits and the unique compliance of the
   two in vitro formed habits with the two main morphologies found in
   papillary kidney stones propose that OPN is a main effector in direct
   stone-forming processes. Moreover, stone structures which exhibit these
   two morphologies side-by-side might serve as a novel indicator for OPN
   concentrations surrounding those structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Rational finite element assisted design of precast steel fibre
   reinforced concrete pipes}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{124}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{There has been growing interest to introduce steel fibres in precast
   concrete pipes as a replacement for regular reinforcement. Several
   experimental studies have been conducted in order to determine the
   optimal fibre content for various pipe design scenarios. However, there
   is still need for more inclusive and comprehensible design approaches.
   This paper aims at developing a rational design tool for precast SFRC
   pipes. For this purpose, a non-linear 3D finite element model was
   developed to simulate the three edge-bearing test. The model was
   verified using experimental data generated previously by the authors on
   full-scale SFRC pipes as well as other data available in the open
   literature. The model was capable of reasonably simulating the
   load-deformation curves of SFRC pipes tested using the
   three-edge-bearing method. The average error in model-predicted ultimate
   D-loads was about 6.5\% on the conservative side. Subsequently, a
   parametric study was conducted. The pipe diameter, pipe wall thickness,
   fibre type and content, concrete compressive strength, and targeted pipe
   strength were the parameters under investigation. The findings of the
   parametric study were presented in a tabular form that can be used as a
   design aid supplementary to the ASTM C1765 standard. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ultimate strength of hollowcore slabs is greatly affected by their
   post-cracking behaviour. The composite action between the concrete
   topping and the hollowcore slab adds another level of nonlinearity. This
   paper presents a comprehensive finite element study to evaluate the
   nonlinear properties of the interface between a hollowcore slab and its
   concrete topping. The presented finite element modeling procedure was
   validated using data from a previous comprehensive experimental study by
   the authors. The nonlinear material behaviour of the concrete and the
   prestressing strands were also accounted for. The paper presents a
   modeling method that realistically simulates the staged construction
   technique of composite hollowcore slabs. Finite element results allowed
   understanding changes to the interface properties due to the confining
   effect of the applied load as well as the interaction between the shear
   and peel stresses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent heat and mass transfer in packed beds of spheres is widely
   encountered in industrial and food storage applications and, as such,
   modeling of such cases is of interest in design and development. Herein,
   we propose a closure of the volume- and time-averaged (macroscopic)
   turbulence, and non-equilibrium turbulent heat and mass transfer
   equations for randomly packed spheres, based on computational results of
   flow and heat transfer for a unique geometric model. In this respect,
   the closure results are derived from pore-level (microscopic)
   information obtained from numerical simulations of turbulent heat and
   fluid flow. Turbulence is incorporated at both levels using the
   k-epsilon model, and the dispersive effects of turbulence are also
   considered. For the momentum equation, the closure is sought for the
   Darcy and Forchheimer terms. For the non-equilibrium heat and mass
   transport equations, we obtain closures for the dispersion, turbulent
   flux, turbulent dispersion, and interfacial heat and mass transfer
   terms. The closure results are found to be dependent upon the porosity
   and Reynolds number. However, the mean sphere diameter and its local
   variation inside the representative elemental volumes only weakly affect
   the results. The closure results are presented as power law-based
   correlations, such that they can be easily implemented in a
   volume-time-averaged framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{With the increased application of magnesium high-pressure die castings
   (HPDC), it is necessary to better understand
   process-structure-mechanical properties. In the case of HPDC, ductility
   and yield strength strongly depend on porosity, grain size, and the skin
   thickness. In this contribution, a new method is developed which employs
   knowledge of local cooling rates to predict the grain size and the skin
   thickness of HPDC magnesium components. The centreline cooling curve,
   together with the die temperature, and the thermodynamic properties of
   the alloy are then used as inputs to compute the solution to the Stefan
   problem of a moving phase boundary, thereby providing the
   through-thickness cooling curves at each chosen location of the casting.
   The local cooling rate is used to calculate the resulting grain size and
   skin thickness via established relationships. The prediction of skin
   thickness and average grain size of skin region determined from this
   method compares quite well with the experimental results. Due to the
   presence of externally solidified grains, this method underestimates the
   grain size value in the core region, as compared to the experiment.
   Finally, we predict the locally varying yield strength using a modified
   Hall-Petch equation.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder
   with cognitive, motor, and emotional symptoms. The thalamus and basal
   ganglia form circuits with the cortex supporting all three of these
   behavioral domains. Abnormalities in the structure of subcortical
   regions may suggest atypical development of these networks, with
   implications for understanding the neural basis of ASD symptoms.
   Findings from previous volumetric studies have been inconsistent. Here,
   using advanced surface-based methodology, we investigated localized
   differences in shape and surface area in the basal ganglia and thalamus
   in ASD, using T1-weighted anatomical images from the Autism Brain
   Imaging Data Exchange (373 male participants aged 7-35 years with ASD
   and 384 typically developing). We modeled effects of diagnosis, age, and
   their interaction on volume, shape, and surface area. In participants
   with ASD, we found expanded surface area in the right posterior thalamus
   corresponding to the pulvinar nucleus, and a more concave shape in the
   left mediodorsal nucleus. The shape of both caudal putamen and pallidum
   showed a relatively steeper increase in concavity with age in ASD.
   Within ASD participants, restricted, repetitive behaviors were
   positively associated with surface area in bilateral globus pallidus. We
   found no differences in overall volume, suggesting that surface-based
   approaches have greater sensitivity to detect localized differences in
   subcortical structure. This work adds to a growing body of literature
   implicating corticobasal ganglia-thalamic circuits in the
   pathophysiology of ASD. These circuits subserve a range of cognitive,
   emotional, and motor functions, and may have a broad role in the complex
   symptom profile in ASD.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{143-155}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Falling behind schedule and having discrepancy between the as-built and
   designed baseline plans are unfavourable events that often occur in
   construction projects. Hence, real-time progress tracking and monitoring
   of construction components remains a vital part of project management
   and is critical to achieving project objectives. Yet manual approaches
   for progress tracking lack the required accuracy for integration with
   other construction interfaces. Conversely, automatic progress tracking
   can result in timely detection of potential time delays and construction
   discrepancies and directly supports project control decision-making.
   This paper examines different technologies of automated and electronic
   construction data collection. In particular, enhanced IT, geo-spatial,
   3D imaging, and augmented reality technologies have recently achieved
   significant advances in this field. Each of these technologies is
   discussed herein in terms of its advantages and limitations. Comparisons
   of such technologies to identify various trends concerning their
   applicability in real-time data acquisition of construction projects are
   made, along with recommendations for their suitability in different
   projects. This should assist construction stakeholders in choosing
   appropriate tools to enhance time and cost effectiveness and achieve
   better control and more effective decisions during construction. It is
   also hoped that this review will stimulate further research on and
   development of these technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier BV. All rights

Abstract = {{Steel structures dissipate the seismic energy through steel yielding,
   which results in residual deformations. Although conventional
   earthquake-resisting structural systems provide adequate seismic safety,
   they experience significant structural damage when exposed to strong
   ground shaking. Seismic residual drifts complicate the repair of damaged
   structures or render the structure as irreparable. Therefore, systems
   that can minimize the seismic residual deformations are needed.
   Superelastic shape memory alloys (SMAs) have the ability to undergo
   large deformations and recover all plastic deformations upon unloading.
   Their utilization in steel structures can significantly reduce seismic
   residual deformations, which will facilitate post-seismic retrofitting.
   Although the literature provides few research data on using SMA in steel
   beam-column connections, previous research did not address their optimum
   use. This paper identifies the required locations of SMA connections in
   a typical steel moment resisting frame to enhance its seismic
   performance in terms of maximum inter-storey drift, residual
   deformations, and damage scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   solids moisture content as the solids tumble in a V-blender. Trials were
   conducted with wooden beads, sugar spheres and two placebo formulations
   of pharmaceutical granules in a V-blender. Vibrations from acoustic
   emissions were measured using PCB Piezotronics accelerometers with ICP
   signal conditioners. A wavelet filter was applied to the measured
   acoustic emissions to remove vibrations from the tumbling motion of the
   V-shell, allowing a focus on information about particle motion and
   interactions within the V-shell. Three signal features were identified
   in the acoustic emissions with each feature being attributed to phases
   of the particle motion within the V-shell. The maximum feature amplitude
   was found to vary with solids moisture content; both particle mass and
   flowability had an impact on the acoustic emissions amplitude. Particle
   flowability changes were correlated to a critical moisture content
   obtained from solids drying profiles. The measured vibrations from
   passive acoustic emissions reflected changes in particle motion and
   interactions within a V-blender as the solids moisture content varied
   demonstrating the potential of passive acoustic emissions measurements
   to obtain critical process information inline and in real time. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Be stars are surrounded by outflowing circumstellar matter structured in
   the form of decretion discs. They are often members of binary systems,
   where it is expected that the decretion disc interacts both radiatively
   and gravitationally with the companion. In this work we study how
   various orbital (period, mass ratio and eccentricity) and disc
   (viscosity) parameters affect the disc structure in coplanar binaries.
   The main effects of the secondary on the disc are its truncation and the
   accumulation of material inwards of truncation. We find two limiting
   cases with respect to the effects of eccentricity: in circular or nearly
   circular prograde orbits, the disc maintains a rotating, constant in
   shape, configuration, which is locked to the orbital phase. The disc
   structure appears smaller in size, more elongated and more massive for
   small viscosity parameter, small orbital separation and/or high mass
   ratio. In highly eccentric orbits, the effects are more complex, with
   the disc structure strongly dependent on the orbital phase. We also
   studied the effects of binarity in the disc continuum emission. Since
   the infrared and radio SED are sensitive to the disc size and density
   slope, the truncation and matter accumulation result in considerable
   modifications in the emergent spectrum. We conclude that binarity can
   serve as an explanation for the variability exhibited in observations of
   Be stars, and that our model can be used to detect invisible companions.}},

Abstract = {{We present the discovery of a brown dwarf companion to the debris disk
   host star HR 2562. This object, discovered with the Gemini Planet Imager
   (GPI), has a projected separation of 20.3 +/- 0.3 au (0{''}.618 +/-
   0{''}.004) from the star. With the high astrometric precision afforded
   by GPI, we have confirmed, to more than 5 sigma, the common proper
   motion of HR 2562B with the star, with only a month-long time baseline
   between observations. Spectral data in the J-, H-, and K-bands show a
   morphological similarity to L/T transition objects. We assign a spectral
   type of L7 +/- 3 to HR 2562B. and derive a luminosity of
   log(L-bol/L-circle dot) = -4.62 +/- 0.12, corresponding to a mass of 30
   +/- 15 M-Jup from evolutionary models at an estimated age of the system
   of 300-900 Myr. Although the uncertainty in the age of the host star is
   significant, the spectra and photometry exhibit several indications of
   youth for HR 2562B. The source has a position angle that is consistent
   with an orbit in the same plane as the debris disk recently resolved
   with Herschel. Additionally, it appears to be interior to the debris
   disk. Though the extent of the inner hole is currently too uncertain to
   place limits on the mass of HR 2562B, future observations of the disk
   with higher spatial resolution may be able to provide mass constraints.
   This is the first brown-dwarf-mass object found to reside in the inner
   hole of a debris disk, offering the opportunity to search for evidence
   of formation above the deuterium burning limit in a circumstellar disk.}},

Title = {{Characterization of multi-joint upper limb movements in a single task to
   assess bradykinesia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{368}},
Pages = {{337-342}},

Abstract = {{Bradykinesia is a disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) which
   presents with slowness of movement. Visual assessment using clinical
   rating scales is currently the gold standard to assess bradykinesia.
   Such assessments require multiple separate movements, are subjective,
   and rely on the ability of the rater to determine frequency and
   amplitude features of excursion of multiple joints simultaneously.
   The current study introduces the use of wearable inertial measurement
   units (IMUs) to characterize full-arm repetitive movements and provide a
   new index score for bradykinesia severity (BKI) in the upper limbs. The
   BKI provides an approach to measuring bradykinesia reliably and
   objectively. Importantly, this index is needed to demonstrate
   separability between healthy individuals and PD participants, and also
   between bradykinetic and non-bradykinetic PD participants.
   Thirteen PD participants and ten age-matched healthy control
   participants were studied. Using a single upper limb task that activated
   multiple joints and recordings from angular displacements from all
   joints, features relevant to demonstrating bradykinesia were extracted
   and systematically combined to create the total BKI. A strong
   correlation coefficient was obtained comparing BKI to upper limb UPDRS
   bradykinesia scores (r(s) = 0.626, p = 0.001). The BKI successfully
   identified differences between control and PD participants (p = 0.018).
   The BKI was also sensitive enough to identify differences within the PD
   population, separating PD participants with and without bradykinesia (p
   < 0.001).
   This study demonstrates the feasibility of using IMU-based motion
   capture systems and employing the new BKI for quantitative assessment of
   bradykinesia. This approach when generalized to lower extremity and
   truncal movements would be able to provide an objective and reproducible
   whole body bradykinesia index. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrical transmission tower-line systems transport the needed

   tower is also presented. It was shown that the turbulent winds introduce
   variability in the capacity curve. The estimated capacity curve by using
   the nonlinear static pushover analysis is in close agreement to the
   average capacity curve obtained based on the curves estimated using the
   incremental dynamic analysis. Most importantly, it is shown that the
   capacity curve of a single tower represents adequately that of a tower
   within a tower-line system, and the effect of the dynamic interaction
   between the tower and the wires on the capacity curve is negligible. (C)

Abstract = {{A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) double layer microfiltration membrane
   has been modified with zeolite imidazolate metal organic frameworks-8
   (ZIF-8) and tested for micropollutants removal from water. The physical
   properties of the modified membrane and its removal characteristics are
   tested using progesterone as a model pollutant. Compared to the
   unmodified membrane, incorporation of ZIF-8 onto the polymer matrix
   resulted in close to 40\% increase in the membrane adsorption capacity
   and almost doubling its water permeability which could result in
   significant reduction in processing specific energy consumption. The
   membrane maintained near 95\% of its original removal efficiency after
   three regeneration cycles using polyethylene glycol-400. Modeling of the
   adsorption results agreed satisfactorily with the experimental
   measurements. The synergy provided by using ZIF-8 particles and the
   significant regeneration volume reduction ratio demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the approach for increasing the overall micropollutants
   removal capacity and allows for its further consideration for
   development of viable continuous membrane adsorption techniques for
   decontamination of water resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Alkali metal-oxygen (Li-O-2, Na-O-2) batteries have attracted a great
   deal of attention recently due to their high theoretical energy
   densities, comparable to gasoline, making them attractive candidates for
   application in electrical vehicles. However, the limited cycling life
   and low energy effi ciency (high charging overpotential) of these cells
   hinder their commercialization. The Li-O-2 battery system has been
   extensively studied in this regard during the past decade. Compared to
   the numerous reports of Li-O-2 batteries, the research on Na-O-2
   batteries is still in its infancy. Although, Na-O-2 batteries show a
   number of attractive properties such as low charging overpotential and
   high round-trip energy effi ciency, their cycling life is currently
   limited to a few tens of cycles. Therefore, understanding the chemistry
   behind Na-O-2 cells is critical towards enhancing their performance and
   advancing their development. Chemical and electrochemical reactions of
   Na-O-2 batteries are reviewed and compared with those of Li-O-2
   batteries in the present review, as well as recent works on the chemical
   composition and morphology of the discharge products in these batteries.
   Furthermore, the determining kinetics factors for controlling the
   chemical composition of the discharge products in Na-O-2 cells are
   discussed and the potential research directions toward improving Na-O-2
   cells are proposed.}},

Title = {{Oxygen modulation of flexible PbS/Pb Schottky junction PEC cells with
   improved photoelectric performance}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{35}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Flexible photoelectric devices are emerging as a new class of
   photovoltaic cells. In this study, lead (Pb) foil was used as a flexible
   substrate to grow in situ lead sulfide (PbS) film with good uniformity
   and adhesion by a solvothermal elemental direct reaction, resulting in a
   PbS/Pb Schottky junction formed naturally between the PbS film and
   underlying Pb foil. We found that the photocurrent response of the
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell was greatly improved through a facile
   oxygen (O-2)-modulation-based post-processing technique. O-2 could
   decompose the organic residue and oxidize the Pb at the interface
   between the PbS film and Pb foils. Different characterization
   techniques, including thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning
   calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy,
   x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the change in transient photocurrent
   density (J(p)) with time (t), dark current-voltage (I-V) and absorption
   spectra were applied to get a full understanding of the O-2 modulation
   effect. The oxidization treatment of the PbS film could regulate the
   flow of charge carriers to reduce their recombination, leading to
   photoresponse enhancement for the PEC cells. In particular, the process
   could modulate the tunneling current and interface states to optimize
   dark I-V characteristics. In addition, the magnitude of the barrier
   height can be tuned by O-2 modulation, which was explained by
   theoretical analysis and calculation. We also demonstrated that the in
   situ formed PbS film has outstanding adhesion on the flexible Pb
   substrate. Our film synthesis method and post O-2-modulation design as
   well as the corresponding device assembly may provide a novel
   perspective to the flexible PCE-cell-related research.}},

Title = {{Human Envelope Following Responses to Amplitude Modulation: Effects of
   Aging and Modulation Depth}},
Journal = {{EAR AND HEARING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{E322-E335}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To record envelope following responses (EFRs) to monaural
   amplitude-modulated broadband noise carriers in which amplitude
   modulation (AM) depth was slowly changed over time and to compare these
   objective electrophysiological measures to subjective behavioral
   thresholds in young normal hearing and older subjects.
   Design: Participants: three groups of subjects included a young
   normal-hearing group (YNH 18 to 28 years; pure-tone average = 5 dB HL),
   a first older group ({''}01{''}; 41 to 62 years; pure-tone average = 19
   dB HL), and a second older group ({''}02{''}; 67 to 82 years; pure-tone
   average = 35 dB HL). Electrophysiology: In condition 1, the AM depth (41
   Hz) of a white noise carrier, was continuously varied from 2\% to 100\%
   (5\%/s). EFRs were analyzed as a function of the AM depth. In condition
   2, auditory steady-state responses were recorded to fixed AM depths
   (100\%, 75\%, 50\%, and 25\%) at a rate of 41 Hz. Psychophysics: A 3 AFC
   (alternative forced choice) procedure was used to track the AM depth
   needed to detect AM at 41 Hz (AM detection). The minimum AM depth
   capable of eliciting a statistically detectable EFR was defined as the
   physiological AM detection threshold.
   Results: Across all ages, the fixed AM depth auditory steady-state
   response and swept AM EFR yielded similar response amplitudes.
   Statistically significant correlations (r = 0.48) were observed between
   behavioral and physiological AM detection thresholds. Older subjects had
   slightly higher (not significant) behavioral AM detection thresholds
   than younger subjects. AM detection thresholds did not correlate with
   age. All groups showed a sigmoidal EFR amplitude versus AM depth
   function but the shape of the function differed across groups. The 02
   group reached EFR amplitude plateau levels at lower modulation depths
   than the normal-hearing group and had a narrower neural dynamic range.
   In the young normal-hearing group, the EFR phase did not differ with AM
   depth, whereas in the older group, EFR phase showed a consistent
   decrease with increasing AM depth. The degree of phase change (or phase
   slope) was significantly correlated to the pure-tone threshold at 4 kHz.
   Conclusions: EFRs can be recorded using either the swept modulation
   depth or the discrete AM depth techniques. Sweep recordings may provide
   additional valuable information at suprathreshold intensities including
   the plateau level, slope, and dynamic range. Older subjects had a
   reduced neural dynamic range compared with younger subjects suggesting
   that aging affects the ability of the auditory system to encode subtle
   differences in the depth of AM. The phase-slope differences are likely
   related to differences in low and high-frequency contributions to EFR.
   The behavioral-physiological AM depth threshold relationship was
   significant but likely too weak to be clinically useful in the present
   individual subjects who did not suffer from apparent temporal processing
   deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Many patients face difficulties when accessing medical facilities,
   particularly in rural areas. To alleviate these concerns, medical
   centers may offer transportation to eligible patients. However, the
   operation of such services is typically not tightly coordinated with the
   scheduling of medical appointments. Motivated by our collaborations with
   the U.S. Veterans Health Administration, we propose an integrated
   approach that simultaneously considers patient routing and operating
   room scheduling decisions. We model this problem as a mixed-integer
   program. Unfortunately, realistically sized instances of this problem
   are intractable, so we focus on a special case of the problem that
   captures the needs of low-volume (e.g., rural) hospitals. We establish
   structural properties that are exploited to develop a branch-and-price
   algorithm, which greatly outperforms a commercial solver on the original
   formulation. We discuss several algorithmic strategies to improve the
   overall solution efficiency. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
   approach through an extensive computational study calibrated with
   clinical data. Our results demonstrate that there exist opportunities
   for healthcare providers to significantly improve the quality of their
   services by integrating scheduling and routing decisions.}},

   representing information about resources on the Web. As a W3C (World
   Wide Web Consortium) Recommendation, RDF has rapidly gained popularity.
   With the widespread acceptance of RDF on the Web and in the enterprise,
   a huge amount of RDF data is being proliferated and becoming available.
   Efficient and scalable management of RDF data is therefore of increasing
   importance. RDF data management has attracted attention in the database
   and Semantic Web communities. Much work has been devoted to proposing
   different solutions to store RDF data efficiently. This paper focusses
   on using relational databases and NoSQL (for not only SQL (Structured
   Query Language)') databases to store massive RDF data. A full up-to-date
   overview of the current state of the art in RDF data storage is provided
   in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Background Remote catheter navigation systems protect interventionalists
   from scattered ionizing radiation. However, these systems typically
   require specialized catheters and extensive operator training.
   Methods A new compact and sterilizable telerobotic system is described,
   which allows remote navigation of conventional tip-steerable catheters,
   with three degrees of freedom, using an interface that takes advantage
   of the interventionalist's existing dexterity skills. The performance of
   the system is evaluated ex vivo and in vivo for remote catheter
   navigation and ablation delivery.
   Results The system has absolute errors of 0.1 +/- 0.1mm and 7 +/- 6
   degrees over 100mm of axial motion and 360 degrees of catheter rotation,
   respectively. In vivo experiments proved the safety of the proposed
   telerobotic system and demonstrated the feasibility of remote navigation
   and delivery of ablation.
   Conclusion The proposed telerobotic system allows the interventionalist
   to use conventional steerable catheters; while maintaining a safe
   distance from the radiation source, he/she can remotely navigate the
   catheter and deliver ablation lesions. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) is a promising remediation technology
   utilizing in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) to clean up contaminated
   groundwater at hazardous waste sites. The small particle size and large
   surface area of nZVI result in high reactivity and rapid destruction of
   contaminants. Over the past 20 years, a great deal of research has
   advanced the nZVI technology from bench-scale tests to field-scale
   applications. However, to date, the overall number of well-characterized
   nZVI field deployments is still small compared to other alternative
   remedies that are more widely applied. Apart from the relatively high
   material cost of nZVI and questions regarding possible nanotoxicological
   side effects, one of the major obstacles to the widespread utilization
   of nZVI in the field is its short persistence in the environment due to
   natural reductant demand (NRD). The NRD for nZVI is predominantly due to
   reduction of water, but other reactions with naturally present oxidants
   (e.g., oxygen) occur, resulting in situ conditions that are reducing
   (high in ferrous iron phases and H-2) but with little or no Fe(0). This
   article reviews the main biogeochemical processes that determine the
   selectivity and longevity of nZVI, summarizes data from prior
   (laboratory and field) studies on the longevity of various common types
   of nZVI, and describes modifications of nZVI that could improve its
   selectivity and longevity for full-scale applications of ISCR. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In the present study, tablets were successfully coated with ultrafine
   ethylcellulose powders by using an electrostatic dry powder coating
   technology and sustained drug release was successfully achieved. The
   angle of repose (AOR) of the ultrafine powders of ethylcellulose was
   significantly reduced by adding nano sized colloidal silicon dioxide,
   indicating a significant improvement of flowability. Variations in
   charging voltage of the electrostatic gun had a significant influence on
   the coating powder adhesion and coating efficiency. Lactose and triethyl
   citrate (TEC) were used as the solid and liquid plasticizers to reduce
   the glass transition temperature (T-g) of ethylcellulose. The presence
   of liquid plasticizer could also increase the electrical conductivity of
   drug tablets so as to promote the coating powder adhesion. Other factors
   that affect the film formation include curing time and curing
   temperature. Dissolution tests indicated that the drug release from
   electrostatic dry powder coated tablets could be altered by adjusting
   coating level or pore former ratio in the coating formulation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Neuroanatomy is one of the most challenging subjects in anatomy, and
   novice students often experience difficulty grasping the complex
   three-dimensional (3D) spatial relationships. This study evaluated a 3D

   spatial abilities and students' knowledge in neuroanatomy. The study's
   crossover design divided the participants into two groups, each starting
   with tests for anatomy knowledge and spatial ability, followed by access
   to either the 3D online learning module or the gross anatomy laboratory.
   Participants completed a second knowledge test prior to accessing the
   other learning modality. Participants in both groups scored
   significantly higher on Quiz 1 than on the Pretest knowledge assessment
   (W=47, P<0.01; W=30, P<0.01). Students who initially accessed the 3D
   online resources scored significantly better on the Quiz 1 than students
   who accessed the gross anatomy resources (W=397.5, P<0.01). Scores
   significantly improved on Quiz 2 for participants who accessed the 3D
   learning module following exposure to the cadaveric resources (W=94,
   P<0.01). After exposure to both learning modalities, there were no

Abstract = {{Analytical evaluation of the interfacial shear stresses for composite
   hollowcore slabs with concrete topping is rare in the literature. Adawi
   et al. (2014) estimated the interfacial shear stiffness coefficient
   (k(s)) that governs the behavior of the interface between hollowcore
   slabs and the concrete topping using push-off tests. This parameter is
   utilized in this paper to provide closed form solutions for the
   differential equations governing the behavior of simply supported
   composite hollowcore slabs. An analytical solution based on the
   deformation compatibility of the composite section and elastic beam
   theory, is developed to evaluate the shear stresses along the interface.
   Linear finite element modeling of the full-scale tests presented in
   Adawi et al. (2015) is also conducted to validate the developed
   analytical solution. The proposed analytical solution was found to be
   adequate in estimating the magnitude of horizontal shear stress in the
   studied composite hollowcore slabs. (C) 2016 Faculty of Engineering,

Abstract = {{The relationship between carotid disease and modestly abnormal airflow
   in ex-smokers without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is

   vessel-wall-plus-plaque thickness (VWT) and vessel wall volume (VWV) to
   quantify and evaluate such carotid ultrasound measurements in ex- and
   never-smokers without airflow limitation. These patients did not fulfill
   the diagnostic criteria for COPD. We also investigated the relationship
   of carotid atherosclerosis with pulmonary phenotypes of COPD. We
   evaluated 61 subjects without a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary or
   vascular diseases including 34 never-smokers (72 +/- 6 year) and 27
   ex-smokers (73 +/- 9 year). We measured mean VWT () and mean VWT
   specific to carotid regions-of-interest () and evaluated potential
   differences between ex- and never-smokers. Carotid ultrasound and
   pulmonary disease measurement relationships were also evaluated using
   correlation coefficients (r) and multivariate regression analyses.
   Ex-smokers had a significantly greater (p = 0.003) and (p < 0.00001)
   than never-smokers, whereas a significant difference between the two
   groups was not detected by VWV (p = 1.0). There were significant
   correlations between the ventilation defect percent (VDP) measured by
   MRI with (r = 0.42, p = 0.001) and (r = 0.56, p = 0.00001). Multivariate
   regression models showed that VDP significantly predicted (beta = 0.38,
   p = 0.004) and (beta = 0.50, p = 0.00001). VWT-based measurements
   detected differences in vessel-wall-plus-plaque burden in ex- and
   never-smokers, which were not revealed using VWV. There were significant
   correlations between cardiovascular and pulmonary disease biomarkers in
   these ex-smokers who did not have a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary or

Title = {{ResilSIMA Decision Support Tool for Estimating Resilience of Urban

Journal = {{WATER}},

Abstract = {{Damages to urban systems as a result of water-related natural disasters
   have escalated in recent years. The observed trend is expected to
   increase in the future as the impacts of population growth, rapid
   urbanization and climate change persist. To alleviate the damages
   associated with these impacts, it is recommended to integrate disaster
   management methods into planning, design and operational policies under
   all levels of government. This manuscript proposes the concept of
   ResilSIM: A decision support tool that rapidly estimates the resilience
   (a modern disaster management measure that is dynamic in time and space)
   of an urban system to the consequences of natural disasters. The
   web-based tool (with mobile access) operates in near real-time. It is
   designed to assist decision makers in selecting the best options for
   integrating adaptive capacity into their communities to protect against
   the negative impacts of a hazard. ResilSIM is developed for application
   in Toronto and London, Ontario, Canada; however, it is only demonstrated
   for use in the city of London, which is susceptible to riverine
   flooding. It is observed how the incorporation of different combinations
   of adaptation options maintain or strengthen London's basic structures
   and functions in the event of a flood.}},

Title = {{Bioaugmentation: An Emerging Strategy of Industrial Wastewater Treatment
   for Reuse and Discharge}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A promising long-term and sustainable solution to the growing scarcity
   of water worldwide is to recycle and reuse wastewater. In wastewater
   treatment plants, the biodegradation of contaminants or pollutants by
   harnessing microorganisms present in activated sludge is one of the most
   important strategies to remove organic contaminants from wastewater.
   However, this approach has limitations because many pollutants are not
   efficiently eliminated. To counterbalance the limitations,
   bioaugmentation has been developed and consists of adding specific and
   efficient pollutant-biodegrading microorganisms into a microbial
   community in an effort to enhance the ability of this microbial
   community to biodegrade contaminants. This approach has been tested for
   wastewater cleaning with encouraging results, but failure has also been
   reported, especially during scale-up. In this review, work on the
   bioaugmentation in the context of removal of important pollutants from
   industrial wastewater is summarized, with an emphasis on recalcitrant
   compounds, and strategies that can be used to improve the efficiency of
   bioaugmentation are also discussed. This review also initiates a
   discussion regarding new research areas, such as nanotechnology and
   quorum sensing, that should be investigated to improve the efficiency of
   wastewater bioaugmentation.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The use of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Stream Processing (SP)
   systems to process high-volume, high-velocity Big Data has renewed
   interest in procedures for managing these systems. In particular,
   selfmanagement and adaptation of runtime platforms have been common
   research themes, as most of these systems run under dynamic conditions.
   Nevertheless, the research landscape in this area is still young and
   fragmented. Most research is performed in the context of specific
   systems, and it is difficult to generalize the results obtained to other
   contexts. To enable generic and reusable CEP/SP system management
   procedures and self-management policies, this research introduces the
   Attributed Graph Rewriting for Complex Event Processing Management
   (AGeCEP) formalism. AGeCEP represents queries in a language-and
   technologyagnostic fashion using attributed graphs. Query
   reconfiguration capabilities are expressed through standardized
   attributes, which are defined based on a novel classification of CEP
   query operators. By leveraging this representation, AGeCEP also proposes
   graph rewriting rules to define consistent reconfigurations of queries.
   To demonstrate AGeCEP feasibility, this research has used it to design
   an autonomic manager and to define a selected set of self-management
   policies. Finally, experiments demonstrate that AGeCEP can indeed be
   used to develop algorithms that can be integrated into diverse CEP
   systems.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{The linear subtraction methods commonly used for preclinical
   contrast-enhanced imaging are susceptible to registration errors and
   motion artifacts that lead to reduced contrast-to-tissue ratios. To
   address this limitation, a new approach to linear contrast-enhanced
   ultrasound (CEUS) is proposed based on the analysis of the temporal
   dynamics of the speckle statistics during wash-in of a bolus injection
   of microbubbles. In the proposed method, the speckle signal is
   approximated as a mixture of temporally varying random processes,
   representing the microbubble signal, superimposed onto spatially
   heterogeneous tissue backscatter in multiple subvolumes within the
   region of interest. A wash-in curve is constructed by plotting the
   effective degrees of freedom (EDoFs) of the histogram of the speckle
   signal as a function of time. The proposed method is, therefore, named
   the EDoF method. The EDoF parameter is proportional to the shape
   parameter of the Nakagami distribution. Images acquired at 18 MHz from a
   murine mammary fat pad breast cancer xenograft model were processed
   using gold-standard nonlinear amplitude modulation, conventional linear
   subtraction, and the proposed statistical method. The EDoF method shows
   promise for improving the robustness of linear CEUS based on reduced
   frame-to-frame variability compared with the conventional linear
   subtraction time-intensity curves. Wash-in curve parameters estimated
   using the EDoF method also demonstrate higher correlation to nonlinear
   CEUS than the conventional linear method. The conceptual basis of the
   statistical method implies that EDoF wash-in curves may carry
   information about vascular complexity that could provide valuable new
   imaging biomarkers for cancer research.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) adopts and extends the concept of cloud
   computing to make mass Manufacturing Resources and Capabilities (MR/Cs)
   more widely integrated and accessible to users through the Internet.
   However, a single manufacturing cloud (MC) has limited MR/Cs, due to
   both economic and technical constraints, and can only provide limited
   manufacturing services in terms of function, price, and reliability,
   etc. Using the aggregated MR/Cs or services of multiple MCs is a natural
   evolution, i.e., MCs can satisfy peak demands for MR/Cs through
   collaboration, while users can have a wider selection of services from
   multiple MCs. To address such requirements, we propose a hybrid
   framework for integrating multiple MCs. The key functional modules and
   the business models of the proposed framework are presented to guide
   future integration of MCs. The enabling technologies, such as semantic
   web and ontologies, intelligent agents, service-oriented architecture,
   and materials handling and logistics technologies are also discussed. A
   case study is given, showing the feasibility and rationality of the
   proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of the software game development industry is enormous and is
   gaining importance day by day. This growth imposes severe pressure and a
   number of issues and challenges on the game development community. Game
   development is a complex process, and one important game development
   choice is to consider the developer's perspective to produce
   good-quality software games by improving the game development process.
   The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the
   developer's dimension as a factor in software game success. It focuses
   mainly on an empirical investigation of the effect of key developer's
   factors on the software game development process and eventually on the
   quality of the resulting game. A quantitative survey was developed and
   conducted to identify key developer's factors for an enhanced game
   development process. For this study, the developed survey was used to
   test the research model and hypotheses. The results provide evidence
   that game development organizations must deal with multiple key factors
   to remain competitive and to handle high pressure in the software game
   industry. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate
   empirically the influence of key developer's factors on the game
   development process.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an observing programme using deep, multiband imaging
   to probe the chaotic regions of tidal tails in search of an underlying
   stellar population, using NGC 3256's 400 Myr twin tidal tails as a case
   study. These tails have different colours of u - g = 1.05 +/- 0.07 and r
   - i = 0.13 +/- 0.07 for NGC 3256W, and u - g = 1.26 +/- 0.07 and r - i =
   0.26 +/- 0.07 for NGC 3256E, indicating different stellar populations.
   These colours correspond to simple stellar population ages of
   288(-54)(+11) and 841(-157)(+125) Myr for NGC 3256W and NGC 3256E,
   respectively, suggesting that NGC 3256W's diffuse light is dominated by
   stars formed after the interaction, while light in NGC 3256E is
   primarily from stars that originated in the host galaxy. Using a mixed
   stellar population model, we break our diffuse light into two
   populations: one at 10 Gyr, representing stars pulled from the host
   galaxies, and a younger component, whose age is determined by fitting
   the model to the data. We find similar ages for the young populations of
   both tails (195(+10)(-13) and 170(+44)(-70) Myr for NGC 3256W and NGC
   3256E, respectively), but a larger percentage of mass in the 10 Gyr
   population for NGC 3256E (98(-3)(+1) per cent versus 90(-6)(+5) per
   cent). Additionally, we detect 31 star cluster candidates in NGC 3256W
   and 19 in NGC 2356E, with median ages of 141 and 91 Myr, respectively.
   NGC 3256E contains several young (< 10 Myr), low-mass objects with
   strong nebular emission, indicating a small, recent burst of star
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{White-rot fungi are distinguished by their ability to efficiently
   degrade lignin via lignin-modifying type II peroxidases, including
   manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP). In the present
   study, time-of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was
   used to evaluate lignin modification in three coniferous and three
   deciduous wood preparations following treatment with commercial
   preparations of LiP and MnP from two different white-rot fungi. Percent
   modification of lignin was calculated as a loss of intact methoxylated
   lignin over nonfunctionalized aromatic rings, which is consistent with
   oxidative cleavage of methoxy moieties within the lignin structure.
   Exposure to MnP resulted in greater modification of lignin in coniferous
   compared to deciduous wood (28 vs. 18 \% modification of lignin); and
   greater modification of G-lignin compared to S-lignin within the
   deciduous wood samples (21 vs. 12 \%). In contrast, exposure to LiP
   resulted in similar percent modification of lignin in all wood samples
   (21 vs 22 \%), and of G- and S-lignin within the deciduous wood (22 vs.
   23 \%). These findings suggest that the selected MnP and LiP may
   particularly benefit delignification of coniferous and deciduous wood,
   respectively. Moreover, the current analysis further demonstrates the
   utility of ToF-SIMS for characterizing enzymatic modification of lignin
   in wood fibre along with potential advantages over UV and HPCL-MS
   detection of solubilized delignification products.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the broadcast nature of radio propagation, the wireless air
   interface is open and accessible to both authorized and illegitimate
   users. This completely differs from a wired network, where communicating
   devices are physically connected through cables and a node without
   direct association is unable to access the network for illicit
   activities. The open communications environment makes wireless
   transmissions more vulnerable than wired communications to malicious
   attacks, including both the passive eavesdropping for data interception
   and the active jamming for disrupting legitimate transmissions.
   Therefore, this paper is motivated to examine the security
   vulnerabilities and threats imposed by the inherent open nature of
   wireless communications and to devise efficient defense mechanisms for
   improving the wireless network security. We first summarize the security
   requirements of wireless networks, including their authenticity,
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues. Next, a
   comprehensive overview of security attacks encountered in wireless
   networks is presented in view of the network protocol architecture,
   where the potential security threats are discussed at each protocol
   layer. We also provide a survey of the existing security protocols and
   algorithms that are adopted in the existing wireless network standards,
   such as the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WiMAX, and the long-term evolution (LTE)
   systems. Then, we discuss the state of the art in physical-layer
   security, which is an emerging technique of securing the open
   communications environment against eavesdropping attacks at the physical
   layer. Several physical-layer security techniques are reviewed and
   compared, including information-theoretic security,
   artificial-noise-aided security, security-oriented beamforming,
   diversity-assisted security, and physical-layer key generation
   approaches. Since a jammer emitting radio signals can readily interfere
   with the legitimate wireless users, we also introduce the family of
   various jamming attacks and their countermeasures, including the
   constant jammer, intermittent jammer, reactive jammer, adaptive jammer,
   and intelligent jammer. Additionally, we discuss the integration of
   physical-layer security into existing authentication and cryptography
   mechanisms for further securing wireless networks. Finally, some
   technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are
   summarized and the future trends in wireless security are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic site response of discontinuous permafrost is discussed. The
   presence of frozen ground in soil deposits can significantly affect
   their dynamic response due to stiffer conditions characterized by higher
   shear-wave velocities compared to unfrozen soils. Both experimental and
   numerical investigations were conducted to examine the problem. The
   experimental program included a series of 1g shaking table tests on
   small-scale models. Nonlinear numerical analyses were performed
   employing FLAC software. The numerical model was verified using the
   obtained experimental results. Parametric simulations were then
   conducted using the verified model to study variations of the free-field
   spectral accelerations (on top of the frozen and unfrozen soil blocks)
   with the scheme of frozen-unfrozen soil, and to determine the key
   parameters and their effects on seismic site response. Results show that
   spectral accelerations were generally higher in frozen soils than in
   unfrozen ones. It was found that the shear-wave velocity of the frozen
   soil as well as the assumed geometry of the blocks and their spacing
   have a significant impact on the site response.}},

   extracellular matrix (ECM). Matricellular proteins (MPs) are a group of
   diverse non-structural ECM components that bind cell surface receptors
   mediating interactions between the cell and its microenviroment,
   effectively regulating adhesion, migration, proliferation, signaling,
   and cell phenotype. Periostin (Postn), a pro-fibrogenic secreted
   glycoprotein, is defined as an MP based on its expression pattern and
   regulatory roles during development and healing and in disease
   processes. Postn consists of a typical signal sequence, an EMI domain
   responsible for binding to fibronectin, four tandem fasciclin-like
   domains that are responsible for integrin binding, and a C-terminal
   region in which multiple splice variants originate. This review focuses
   specifically on the role of Postn in wound healing and remodeling, an
   area of intense research during the last 10 years, particularly as
   related to skin healing and myocardium post-infarction. Postn interacts
   with cells through various integrin pairs and is an essential downstream
   effector of transforming growth factor-beta superfamily signaling.
   Across various tissues, Postn is associated with the pro-fibrogenic
   process: specifically, the transition of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts,
   collagen fibrillogenesis, and ECM synthesis. Although the complexity of
   Postn as a modulator of cell behavior in tissue healing is only
   beginning to be elucidated, its expression is clearly a defining event
   in moving wound healing through the proliferative and remodeling phases.}},

Abstract = {{Lignin-based epoxy resins derived from de-polymerized Kraft/organosolv
   lignins were blended with a conventional bisphenol A (BPA)-based epoxy
   resin at various percentages to prepare bio-based epoxy systems as
   polymer matrices for manufacturing of fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs)
   and coatings. The curing process of epoxy composites was studied using
   DSC and the activation energy was calculated by isoconversional methods.
   Epoxy composites comprising a low percentage (25 wt\%) of lignin-based
   epoxy resin can be cured faster than the pure BPA-based epoxy resin used
   in particular at the early stage of curing. However, blending a large
   amount (>50 wt\%) of lignin-based epoxy resin with the BPA-based epoxy
   resin retarded the curing process particularly at the late stage of
   curing. Tensile and flexural strengths of the prepared FRPs using
   bio-based epoxy composites were found to be superior or comparable to
   those of the FRP with the pure BPA-based epoxy resin when the
   lignin-based epoxy resin blending ratio is less than 50-75 wt\%.
   Furthermore, the bio-based epoxy films comprising up to 50 wt\% of
   DOL-based epoxy resin were exhibited high adhesion strength on a metal
   substrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an extensive literature review has been conducted on the
   material characterization of UHPC and its potential for large-scale
   field applicability. The successful production of ultra-high performance
   concrete (UHPC) depends on its material ingredients and mixture
   proportioning, which leads to denser and relatively more homogenous
   particle packing. A database was compiled from various research and
   field studies around the world on the mechanical and durability
   performance of UHPC. It is shown that UHPC provides a viable and
   long-term solution for improved sustainable construction owing to its
   ultra-high strength properties, improved fatigue behavior and very low
   porosity, leading to excellent resistance against aggressive
   environments. The literature review revealed that the curing regimes and
   fiber dosage are the main factors that control the mechanical and
   durability properties of UHPC. Currently, the applications of UHPC in
   construction are very limited due to its higher initial cost, lack of
   contractor experience and the absence of widely accepted design
   provisions. However, sustained research progress in producing UHPC using
   locally available materials under normal curing conditions should reduce
   its material cost. Current challenges regarding the implementation of
   UHPC in full-scale structures are highlighted. This study strives to
   assist engineers, consultants, contractors and other construction
   industry stakeholders to better understand the unique characteristics
   and capabilities of UHPC, which should demystify this resilient and
   sustainable construction material.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports statistical analyses of the mileage and
   pipe-related incidents data corresponding to the onshore gas
   transmission pipelines in the US between 2002 and 2013 collected by the
   Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration of the US Department
   of Transportation. The analysis indicates that there are approximately
   480,000 km of gas transmission pipelines in the US, approximately 60\%
   of them more than 45 years old as of 2013. Eighty percent of the
   pipelines are Class 1 pipelines, and about 20\% of the pipelines are
   Classes 2 and 3 pipelines. It is found that the third-party excavation,
   external corrosion, material failure and internal corrosion are the four
   leading failure causes, responsible for more than 75\% of the total
   incidents. The 12-year average rate of rupture equals 3.1 x 10(-5) per
   km-year due to all failure causes combined. External corrosion is the
   leading cause for ruptures: the 12-year average rupture rate due to
   external corrosion equals 1.0 x 10(-5) per km-year and is twice the
   rupture rate due to the third-party excavation or material failure. The
   study provides insights into the current state of gas transmission

Title = {{Numerical evaluation of community-scale aquifer storage, transfer and
   recovery technology: A case study from coastal Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{540}},
Pages = {{861-872}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aquifer storage, transfer and recovery (ASTR) may be an efficient low
   cost water supply technology for rural coastal communities that
   experience seasonal freshwater scarcity. The feasibility of ASTR as a
   water supply alternative is being evaluated in communities in
   south-western Bangladesh where the shallow aquifers are naturally
   brackish and severe seasonal freshwater scarcity is compounded by
   frequent extreme weather events. A numerical variable-density
   groundwater model, first evaluated against data from an existing
   community-scale ASTR system, was applied to identify the influence of
   hydrogeological as well as design and operational parameters on system
   performance. For community-scale systems, it is a delicate balance to
   achieve acceptable water quality at the extraction well whilst
   maintaining a high recovery efficiency (RE) as dispersive mixing can
   dominate relative to the small size of the injected freshwater plume.
   For the existing ASTR system configuration used in Bangladesh where the
   injection head is controlled and the extraction rate is set based on the
   community water demand, larger aquifer hydraulic conductivity, aquifer
   depth and injection head improve the water quality (lower total
   dissolved solids concentration) in the extracted water because of higher
   injection rates, but the RE is reduced. To support future ASTR system
   design in similar coastal settings, an improved system configuration was
   determined and relevant non-dimensional design criteria were identified.
   Analyses showed that four injection wells distributed around a central
   single extraction well leads to high RE provided the distance between
   the injection wells and extraction well is less than half the
   theoretical radius of the injected freshwater plume. The theoretical
   plume radius relative to the aquifer dispersivity is also an important
   design consideration to ensure adequate system performance. The results
   presented provide valuable insights into the feasibility and design
   considerations for community-scale ASTR systems but installation of
   systems in different hydrogeological contexts (i.e. high regional
   hydraulic gradient and aquifer TDS concentration) may require
   re-evaluation of the system design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: Defining prostate cancer (PCa) lesion clinical target volumes
   (CTVs) for multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) could
   support focal boosting or treatment to improve outcomes or lower
   morbidity, necessitating appropriate CTV margins for mpMRI-defined gross
   tumor volumes (GTVs). This study aimed to identify CTV margins yielding
   95\% coverage of PCa tumors for prospective cases with high likelihood.
   Methods and Materials: Twenty-five men with biopsy-confirmed clinical
   stage T1 or T2 PCa underwent pre-prostatectomy mpMRI, yielding
   T2-weighted, dynamic contrast-enhanced, and apparent diffusion
   coefficient images. Digitized whole-mount histology was contoured and
   registered to mpMRI scans (error <= 2 mm). Four observers contoured
   lesion GTVs on each mpMRI scan. CTVs were defined by isotropic and
   anisotropic expansion from these GTVs and from multiparametric (unioned)
   GTVs from 2 to 3 scans. Histologic coverage (proportions of tumor area
   on coregistered histology inside the CTV, measured for Gleason scores
   {[}GSs] >= 6 and >= 7) and prostate sparing (proportions of prostate
   volume outside the CTV) were measured. Nonparametric histologic-coverage
   prediction intervals defined minimal margins yielding 95\% coverage for
   prospective cases with 78\% to 92\% likelihood.
   Results: On analysis of 72 true-positive tumor detections, 95\% coverage
   margins were 9 to 11 mm (GS >= 6) and 8 to 10 mm (GS >= 7) for
   single-sequence GTVs and were 8 mm (GS >= 6) and 6 mm (GS >= 7) for
   3-sequence GTVs, yielding CTVs that spared 47\% to 81\% of prostate
   tissue for the majority of tumors. Inclusion of T2-weighted contours
   increased sparing for multiparametric CTVs with 95\% coverage margins
   for GS >= 6, and inclusion of dynamic contrast-enhanced contours
   increased sparing for GS >= 7. Anisotropic 95\% coverage margins
   increased the sparing proportions to 71\% to 86\%.
   Conclusions: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-defined GTVs
   expanded by appropriate margins may support focal boosting or treatment
   of PCa; however, these margins, accounting for interobserver and
   intertumoral variability, may preclude highly conformal CTVs.
   Multiparametric GTVs and anisotropic margins may reduce the required
   margins and improve prostate sparing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present six subspace decomposition based methods for
   joint time of arrival (TOA) and frequency of arrival (FOA) estimation of
   multiple incident sources. These are LU-TLS, QR-TLS, direct TSQR-TLS,
   direct TSLU-TLS, parallel TSQR-TLS, and parallel TSLU-TLS. The direct
   and parallel TSQR/TSLU-TLS are recently developed methods in subspace
   decomposition and are employed in this work for time and frequency
   estimation. The proposed methods employ a pair of spatially separated
   sensors to receive multiple incident source signals. A data matrix is
   constructed in the form of a Hankel matrix from multiple snapshots of
   the received signal. The information of both TOA and FOA of multiple
   incident sources is extracted from the data matrix by applying LU/QR
   techniques (in the first set of the methods) and a tall skinny TSLU/TSQR
   factorization in the second set. The estimates of the TOA and FOA are
   obtained from the signal subspace by applying the total least squares
   (TLS) method. Simulation results are presented to assess the performance
   of the proposed methods. The effect of parametric variations on the
   performance has also been analyzed for all the proposed methods.
   Further, the computational times and complexities of the proposed
   methods are also computed and compared with each other.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory motion is one major complicating factor in many image
   acquisition applications and image guided interventions. Existing
   respiratory motion estimation and compensation methods typically rely on
   breathing motion models learned from certain training data, and
   therefore may not be able to effectively handle intra-subject and/or
   inter-subject variations of respiratory motion. In this paper, we
   propose a respiratory motion compensation framework that directly
   recovers motion fields from sparsely spaced and efficiently acquired
   dynamic 2-D MRIs without using a learned respiratory motion model. We
   present a scatter-to-volume deformable registration algorithm to
   register dynamic 2-D MRIs with a static 3-D MRI to recover dense
   deformation fields. Practical considerations and approximations are
   provided to solve the scatter-to-volume registration problem
   efficiently. The performance of the proposed method was investigated on
   both synthetic and real MRI datasets, and the results showed significant
   improvements over the state-of-art respiratory motion modeling methods.
   We also demonstrated a potential application of the proposed method on
   MRI-based motion corrected PET imaging using hybrid PET/MRI. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Fermentative bioethanol production from pyrolytic sugars was improved
   via aromatics removal by liquid-liquid extraction. As solvents, the
   ionic liquid (IL) trihexyltetradecylphosphonium dicyanamide
   ((P666,14){[}N(CN)(2)]) and ethyl acetate (EA) were compared. Two
   pyrolytic sugar solutions were created from acid-leached and untreated
   pinewood, with levoglucosan contents (most abundant sugar) of 29.0\% and
   8.3\% (w/w), respectively. In a single stage extraction, 70\% of the
   aromatics were effectively removed by P-666,P-14{[}N(CN)(2)] and 50\% by
   EA, while no levoglucosan was extracted. The IL was regenerated by
   vacuum evaporation (100 mbar) at 220 degrees C, followed by extraction
   of aromatics from fresh pyrolytic sugar solutions. Regenerated IL
   extracted aromatics with similar extraction efficiency as the fresh IL,
   and the purified sugar fraction from pretreated pinewood was hydrolyzed
   to glucose and fermented to ethanol, yielding 0.46 g ethanol/(g
   glucose), close to the theoretical maximum yield. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Aiming to retard the self-polymerization of the reaction intermediates
   during bio-oil upgrading process, a large amount of alcohol (e.g., 50
   wt\% with respect to bio-oil) was used in the stabilization of fast
   pyrolysis oil by esterification before hydrotreatment by the authors in
   a previous work. In order to reduce the amount of alcohol use and hence
   improve the process economy, effects of stabilizing fast pyrolysis oil
   by esterification with methanol, ethanol or glycerol at a small loading
   (5 wt\% w.r.t. bio-oil) in the presence of Amberlyst-35 DRY - a solid
   acid catalyst on the subsequent hydrotreatment of the oil were
   investigated. The bio-oil hydrotreatment experiments were carried out at
   300 and 350 degrees C in a combined batch and semi-batch operation mode
   with Ru/C catalyst. The results demonstrated that, although
   stabilization of the pyrolysis oil by esterification with a small
   alcohol loading had least effects on the mass and carbon distribution in
   the hydrotreatment products and the elemental composition of the
   hydrotreated oil products, it could effectively reduce the molecular
   weight of the feed, prevent self-polymerization and decrease the overall
   molecular weight of the hydrotreated oil products. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Volume = {{210}},
Pages = {{285-292}},

Abstract = {{For improving the utilization and anti -poisoning performance of Pd
   catalysts for formate oxidation, atomic layer deposition (ALD) method
   was used to deposit Pd on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and CNTs-supported Ag
   (Ag/CNTs). The structures of the as-prepared Pd/CNTs and Pd-on-Ag/CNTs
   catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Electrochemical
   characterization and high -angle annular dark-field scanning TEM
   (HADDF-STEM) confirmed the Pd-on-Ag structure. Pd utilization, activity,
   and anti-poisoning performance for Pd/CNTs and Pd-on-Ag/CNTs catalysts
   were compared, indicating that the overall performances of the Pd-on-Ag
   catalysts are superior to those of Pd on CNTs without Ag. Particularly,
   the mass specific chronoamperometric current (I-cA) of the Pd-on-Ag/CNTs
   (171.8 mA mgpd (1)) is two times greater compared to that of Pd/CNTs

Abstract = {{Room-temperature-ionic-liquid-assisted sputtering with an alloy target
   is utilized to synthesize the graphene-supported AuPd alloy
   nanoparticles, whose Au-to-Pd ratio can be well controlled. The
   preparation process is one-step, free of additives and stabilizers. For
   direct electro-oxidation of ethanol in alkaline media, the supported
   AuPd alloy nano particles show much higher catalytic activity compared
   with a commercial Pd/C catalyst and the monometallic counterpart. The
   optimal Au-to-Pd ratio is 1:3, and the nanocatalyst of AuPd (1:3)
   possesses high stability and durability. After 500 cyclic voltammetry
   test cycles, the anodic peak current density for ethanol
   electro-oxidation still remains about 91\% of the initial one.
   Furthermore, by quantitatively analyzing the relative reactivity
   retention, the alloy nanoparticle catalysts with graphene as the support
   show much higher anti-poisoning performance than the corresponding
   monometallic catalysts with active C as the support. (C) 2016 Hydrogen

Abstract = {{In this work, the Fe3O4/CNTs composite and Fe3O4/C composite were

   systematically investigated by EIS as function of electrode potential.
   It is found that at intermediate degrees of intercalation, the
   characteristic Nyquist plots of Fe3O4 electrode are composed of three
   parts, namely, the small semicircle in high-frequency region can be
   attributed to the migration of lithium-ion through SEI film (the
   resistance of SEI film coupled with SEI film capacitance) as well as
   contact problems; the semicircle in the medium-frequency region is
   attributed to the electronic properties of the material and the large
   arc in low-frequency region is due to charge transfer step. Moreover,
   the changes of kinetic parameters for lithiation process of Fe3O4/CNTs

Title = {{Influence of the bluff body shear layers on the wake of a square prism
   in a turbulent flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Despite a substantial body of literature dealing with the effects of
   free-stream turbulence (FST) on two-dimensional square prism, there
   remain some open questions regarding the influence of the bluff body
   shear layer development in a highly perturbed environment and the
   resulting impact on bluff body flowcharacteristics. Accordingly, flows
   with ambient and enhanced FST were studied at Re-D = 5.0 x 10(4) using
   long-duration time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV). The data
   indicate a narrowing and lengthening of the mean wake and an
   accompanying rise in base pressure. Using triple decomposition, the
   underlying dynamics of the wake reveal a streamwise lengthening of the
   individual von Karman vortex structures, complementing the increase in
   mean wake length. Close inspection of the shear layer region, in the
   presence of FST, indicates a substantial increase in curvature towards
   the body but no pronounced increase in the growth rate. The loci of
   maximum turbulent kinetic energy and spanwise vorticity in the shear
   layer region further reveal that the most pronounced changes occur
   during the very initial stages follow separation. Inspection of a series
   of instantaneous PIV fields of Q criterion show that the conventional
   transition pathway, via the formation and subsequent pairing of the
   Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices, is bypassed. The KH vortices are
   observed to immediately cluster and amalgamate before breaking into
   smaller random eddies. The bypass transition is followed by shear layer
   reattachment in some cases. This is considered a primary mechanism
   responsible for the reported changes in the global flow characteristics
   and the altered wake dynamics. Furthermore, a quantitative definition of
   the diffusion length is implemented for the square prism wake and its
   relationship to the Strouhal number and wake formation length is
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the pore-scale distribution of silver nanoparticles
   during transport through a sandy porous medium via quantitative
   synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography (qSXCMT). The associated
   distributions of nanoparticle flow velocities and mass flow rates were
   obtained by coupling these images with computational fluid dynamic (CFD)
   simulations. This allowed, for the first time, the comparison of
   nanoparticle mass flow with that assumed by the standard colloid
   filtration theory (CFT) modeling approach. It was found that (0 25\% of
   the pore space was further from the grain than assumed by the CFT model;
   (ii) the average pore velocity agreed well between results of the
   coupled qSXCMT/CFD approach and the CFT model within the model fluid
   envelope, although the former were 2 times larger than the latter in the
   centers of the larger pores and individual velocities were upwards of 20
   times those in the CFT model at identical distances from grain surfaces;
   and (iii) approximately 30\% of all nanoparticle mass and 38\% of all
   nanoparticle mass flow occurred further away from the grain surface than
   expected by the CFT model. This work suggests that a significantly
   smaller fraction of nanoparticles than expected will contact a grain
   surface by diffusion via CFT models, likely contributing to inadequate
   CFT model nanoparticle transport predictions.}},

Title = {{Optical CT imaging of solid radiochromic dosimeters in mismatched
   refractive index solutions using a scanning laser and large area
   detector}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{4585-4597}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The practical use of the PRESAGE (R) solid plastic dosimeter is
   limited by the inconvenience of immersing it in high-viscosity oils to
   achieve refractive index matching for optical computed tomography (CT)
   scanning. The oils are slow to mix and difficult to clean from surfaces,
   and the dosimeter rotation can generate dynamic Schlieren inhomogeneity
   patterns in the reference liquid, limiting the rotational and overall
   scan speed. Therefore, it would be beneficial if lower-viscosity,
   water-based solutions with slightly unmatched refractive index could be
   used instead. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility
   of allowing mismatched conditions when using a scanning laser system
   with a large acceptance angle detector. A fiducial-based ray path
   measurement technique is combined with an iterative CT reconstruction
   algorithm to reconstruct images.
   Methods: A water based surrounding liquid with a low viscosity was
   selected for imaging PRESAGE (R) solid dosimeters. Liquid selection was
   optimized to achieve as high a refractive index as possible while
   avoiding rotation-induced Schlieren effects. This led to a refractive
   index mismatch of 6\% between liquid and dosimeters. Optical CT scans
   were performed with a fan-beam scanning-laser optical CT system with a
   large area detector to capture most of the refracted rays. A fiducial
   marker placed on the wall of a cylindrical sample occludes a given light
   ray twice. With knowledge of the rotation angle and the radius of the
   cylindrical object, the actual internal path of each ray through the
   dosimeter can be calculated. Scans were performed with 1024 projections
   of 512 data samples each, and rays were rebinned to form 512
   parallel-beam projections. Reconstructions were performed on a 512 x 512
   grid using 100 iterations of the SIRT iterative CT algorithm. Proof of
   concept was demonstrated with a uniformly attenuating solution phantom.
   PRESAGE (R) dosimeters ( 11 cm diameter) were irradiated with Cobalt-60
   irradiator to achieve either a uniform dose or a 2-level ``step-dose{''}
   pattern.
   Results: With 6\% refractive index mismatching, a circular field of view
   of 85\% of the diameter of a cylindrical sample can be reconstructed
   accurately. Reconstructed images of the test solution phantom were
   uniform ( within 3\%) inside this radius. However, the dose responses of
   the PRESAGE (R) samples were not spatially uniform, with variations of
   at least 5\% in sensitivity. The variation appears as a ``cupping{''}
   artifact with less sensitivity in the middle than at the periphery of
   the PRESAGE (R) cylinder. Polarization effects were also detected for
   these samples.
   Conclusions: The fiducial-based ray path measurement scheme, coupled
   with an iterative reconstruction algorithm, enabled optical CT scanning

   whole-heart quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors investigated the performance of a recently
   introduced 160-mm/256-row CT system for low dose quantitative myocardial
   perfusion (MP) imaging of the whole heart. This platform is equipped
   with a gantry capable of rotating at 280 ms per full cycle, a second
   generation of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR-V) to
   correct for image noise arising from low tube voltage potential/tube
   current dynamic scanning, and image reconstruction algorithms to tackle
   beam-hardening, cone-beam, and partial-scan effects.
   Methods: Phantom studies were performed to investigate the effectiveness
   of image noise and artifact reduction with a GE Healthcare Revolution CT
   system for three acquisition protocols used in quantitative CT MP
   imaging: 100, 120, and 140 kVp/25 mAs. The heart chambers of an
   anthropomorphic chest phantom were filled with iodinated contrast
   solution at different concentrations (contrast levels) to simulate the
   circulation of contrast through the heart in quantitative CT MP imaging.
   To evaluate beam-hardening correction, the phantom was scanned at each
   contrast level to measure the changes in CT number (in Hounsfield unit
   or HU) in the water-filled region surrounding the heart chambers with
   respect to baseline. To evaluate cone-beam artifact correction,
   differences in mean water HU between the central and peripheral slices
   were compared. Partial-scan artifact correction was evaluated from the
   fluctuation of mean water HU in successive partial scans. To evaluate
   image noise reduction, a small hollow region adjacent to the heart
   chambers was filled with diluted contrast, and contrast-to-noise ratio
   in the region before and after noise correction with ASiR-V was
   compared. The quality of MP maps acquired with the CT system was also
   evaluated in porcine CT MP studies. Myocardial infarct was induced in a
   farm pig from a transient occlusion of the distal left anterior
   descending (LAD) artery with a catheter-based interventional procedure.
   MP maps were generated from the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) heart
   images taken at baseline and three weeks after the ischemic insult.
   Results: Their results showed that the phantom and animal images
   acquired with the CT platform were minimally affected by image noise and
   artifacts. For the beam-hardening phantom study, changes in water HU in
   the wall surrounding the heart chambers greatly reduced from > +/- 30 to
   <=+/- 5 HU at all kVp settings except one region at 100 kVp (7 HU). For
   the cone-beam phantom study, differences in mean water HU from the
   central slice were less than 5 HU at two peripheral slices with each 4
   cm away from the central slice. These findings were reproducible in the
   pig DCE images at two peripheral slices that were 6 cm away from the
   central slice. For the partial-scan phantom study, standard deviations
   of the mean water HU in 10 successive partial scans were less than 5 HU
   at the central slice Similar observations were made in the pig DCE
   images at two peripheral slices with each 6 cm away from the central
   slice. For the image noise phantom study, CNRs in the ASiR-V images were
   statistically higher (p < 0.05) than the non-ASiR-V images at all kVp
   settings. MP maps generated from the porcine DCE images were in
   excellent quality, with the ischemia in the LAD territory clearly seen
   in the three orthogonal views.
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates that this CT system can provide
   accurate and reproducible CT numbers during cardiac gated acquisitions
   across a wide axial field of view. This CT number fidelity will enable
   this imaging tool to assess contrast enhancement, potentially providing
   valuable added information beyond anatomic evaluation of coronary
   stenoses. Furthermore, their results collectively suggested that the 100
   kVp/25 mAs protocol run on this CT system provides sufficient image
   accuracy at a low radiation dose (<3 mSv) for whole-heart quantitative
   CT MP imaging. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{A log-logistic probability of ignition (POI) model for ruptures of
   onshore natural gas transmission pipelines is proposed in this paper.
   The parameters of the proposed POI model are evaluated based on a total
   of 188 rupture incidents that occurred on onshore gas transmission
   pipelines in the U.S. between 2002 and 2014 as recorded in the pipeline
   incident database administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Material
   Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
   The product of the pipe internal pressure at the time of rupture and
   outside diameter squared is observed to be strongly correlated with POI
   and therefore adopted as the sole predictor in the POI model. The
   maximum likelihood method is employed to evaluate the model parameters.
   The 95\% confidence interval and upper confidence bound on the POI model
   are also evaluated. The model is validated against an independent set of
   rupture incident data reported in the literature. The proposed POI model
   will facilitate the quantitative risk assessment of onshore natural gas
   transmission pipelines in the U.S.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In asthma patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the lung
   clearance index (LCI) have revealed persistent ventilation
   heterogeneity, although its relationship to asthma control is not well
   understood. Therefore, our goal was to explore the relationship of MRI
   ventilation defects and the LCI with asthma control and quality of life
   in patients with severe, poorly controlled asthma.
   18 patients with severe, poorly controlled asthma (mean +/- SD 46 +/- 12
   years, six males/12 females) provided written informed consent to an
   ethics board approved protocol, and underwent spirometry, LCI and He-3
   MRI during a single 2-h visit. Asthma control and quality of life were
   evaluated using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and Asthma
   Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Ventilation heterogeneity was
   quantified using the LCI and 3He MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP).
   All participants reported poorly controlled disease (mean +/- SD ACQ
   score=2.3 +/- 0.9) and highly heterogeneous ventilation (mean +/- SD
   VDP= 12 +/- 11\% and LCI=10.5 +/- 3.0). While VDP and LCI were strongly
   correlated (r=0.86, p<0.0001), in a multivariate model that included
   forced expiratory volume in 1 s, VDP and LCI, VDP was the only
   independent predictor of asthma control (R-2=0.38, p=0.01). There was
   also a significantly worse VDP, but not LCI in asthma patients with an
   ACQ score >2 (p=0.04) and AQLQ score <5 (p=0.04), and a trend towards
   worse VDP (p=0.053), but not LCI in asthma patients reporting >= 1
   exacerbation in the past 6 months.
   In patients with poorly controlled, severe asthma MRI ventilation, but
   not LCI was significantly worse in those with worse ACQ and AQLQ.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonance enhanced optical transmission has been
   observed in periodic nanohole arrays and plenty of plasmonic
   applications from label-free biosensing to surface-enhanced
   spectroscopies on various platforms have been found. Recently this
   effect has also been demonstrated for nanohole arrays with quasiperiodic
   patterns such as the Penrose tiling. Here we pattern and transfer
   quasiperiodic nanohole arrays onto optical fibers and investigate their
   optical performance in refractive index sensing. These quasiperiodic
   arrays show multiple resonances closely related to their geometric
   features. The resonances are narrow and sensitive to the dielectric
   changes on the probe surface due to our high quality fabrication. We
   find the measured sensitivity of our quasiperiodic nanohole arrays is as
   high as that of periodic nanohole arrays and reaches the theoretical
   sensitivity limit as predicted by our universal sensitivity analysis.
   This result in turn verifies our sensitivity theory on propagating
   surface plasmon resonance in a wider range beyond periodic nanostructure
   arrays. Our study demonstrates the quasiperiodic nanohole array based
   optical fiber is a high-performance plasmonic sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal sulfides have been treated as promising materials for

   to its applications in sodium-ion batteries. In our context, three Ni3S2
   nanostructures directly grown on Ni foam were successfully designed
   using a facile hydrothermal method. The influences of the morphology on
   the performance evolution for sodium-ion batteries were studied in
   detail. As a result, it was found that the initial drop, gradual
   increase, convex type decline and concave type decline in the
   performance evolutions were mainly controlled by R-ct, R-sf,
   pulverization, and internal stress, respectively. More importantly, our
   results indicated that the clustered network-like structure was
   beneficial for the cycling and rate performance, while the rod-like
   structure was suitable for the cyclic stability of these electrodes. (C)

Title = {{Illness versus substance use effects on the frontal white matter in
   early phase schizophrenia: A 4 Tesla H-1-MRS study}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Young adults with early phase schizophrenia often report a
   past or current pattern of illicit substance use and/or alcohol misuse.
   Still, little is known about the cumulative and separate effects of each
   stressor on white matter tissue, at this vulnerable period of brain
   development.
   Methods: Participants involved 24 healthy controls with a past or
   current history of sustained illicit drug use and/or alcohol misuse
   (users), 23 healthy controls without such history (normative data), and
   27 users with early phase schizophrenia. H-1-MRS data were acquired from
   a large frontal volume encompassing 95\% of white matter, using a 4
   Tesla scanner (LASER sequence, TR/TE 3200/46 ms).
   Results: Reduced levels of choline-containing compounds (Cho) were
   specific to the effect of illness (Cohen's d = 0.68), with 22\% of the
   variance in Cho levels accounted for by duration of illness. Reduced
   levels of myoInositol (d = 1.10) and creatine plus phosphocreatine (d =
   1.07) were specific to the effects of illness plus substance use. Effect
   of substance use on its own was revealed by reductions in levels of
   glutamate plus glutamine (d = 0.83) in control users relative to
   normative data.
   Conclusions: The specific effect of illness on white matter might
   indicate a decreased synthesis of membrane phospholipids or
   alternatively, reduced membrane cellular density. In terms of
   limitations, this study did not include patients without a lifetime
   history of substance use (non-users), and the specific effect of each
   substance used could not be studied separately. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Motivation in Computer-Assisted Instruction}},
Journal = {{LARYNGOSCOPE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{S5-S13}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Computer-aided instruction (CAI) is defined as
   instruction in which computers play a central role as the means of
   information delivery and direct interaction with learners.
   Computer-aided instruction has become mainstream in medical school
   curricula. For example, a three-dimensional (3D) computer module of the
   larynx has been created to teach laryngeal anatomy. Although the novelty
   and educational potential of CAI has garnered much attention, these new
   technologies have been plagued with low utilization rates. Several
   experts attribute this problem to lack of motivation in students.
   Motivation is defined as the desire and action toward goal-oriented
   behavior. Psychologist Dr. John Keller developed the ARCS theory of
   motivational learning, which proposed four components: attention (A),
   relevance (R), concentration (C), and satisfaction (S). Keller believed
   that motivation is not only an innate characteristic of the pupil; it
   can also be influenced by external factors, such as the instructional
   design of the curriculum. Thus, understanding motivation is an important
   step to designing CAI appropriately. Keller also developed a 36-item
   validated instrument called the Instructional Materials Motivation
   Survey (IMMS) to measure motivation. The objective of this study was to
   study motivation in CAI. Medical students learning anatomy with the 3D
   computer module will have higher laryngeal anatomy test scores and
   higher IMMS motivation scores. Higher anatomy test scores will be
   positively associated with higher IMMS scores.
   Study Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
   Methods: After obtaining institutional review board approval, 100
   medical students (mean age 25.5 +/- 2.5, 49\% male) were randomized to
   either the 3D computer module (n = 49) or written text (n = 51).
   Information content was identical in both arms. Students were given 30
   minutes to study laryngeal anatomy and then completed the laryngeal
   anatomy test and IMMS. Students were categorized as either junior (year
   1 and 2) or senior (year 3 and 4).
   Results: There were no significant differences in anatomy scores based
   on educational modality. There was significant interaction of
   educational modality by year {[}F(1,96) = 4.12, P = 0.045, omega(2) =
   0.031]. For the total score, there was a significant effect of year
   {[}F(1,96) = 22.28, P < 0.001, omega(2) = 0.178], with seniors (15.4 +/-
   2.6) scoring significantly higher than juniors (12.8 +/- 3.1). For the
   motivational score, the total IMMS score had two significant effects.
   With educational modality {[}F(1,96) = 5.18, P = 0.025, omega(2) =
   0.041], the 3D group (12.4 +/- 2.8) scored significantly higher than the
   written text group (11.7 +/- 3.2). With year {[}F(1,96) = 25.31, P <
   0.001, omega(2) = 0.198], seniors (13.4 +/- 3.0) scored significantly
   higher than juniors (10.8 +/- 2.5). Pearson's correlation showed
   positive associations (r = 0.22-0.91) between anatomy scores and IMMS
   motivation scores (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Computer-aided instruction conferred no measurable
   educational benefit over traditional written text in medical students;
   however, CAI was associated with higher motivational levels.
   Computer-aided instruction was found to have a greater positive impact
   on senior medical students with higher anatomy and motivational scores.
   Higher anatomy scores were positively associated with higher
   motivational scores. Computer-aided instruction may be better targeted
   toward senior students.}},

Abstract = {{Production of particle stabilized oil in water emulsions has been
   investigated both theoretically and experimentally under oscillatory
   shear conditions using different stabilizing particles (SPs). The
   investigation included analysis of the interaction between particles
   interfacial stability and droplets breakage and coalescence. For
   hydrophobic SPs, droplets maintained their sizes as determined by torque
   balance (TB) without significant breakage or coalescence. For the more
   hydrophilic SPs, larger droplets formed that broke by eddies in the
   inertial subrange. At higher fluid shear stresses, loss of the SPs
   occurred during droplet formation leading to near bare droplet surface
   and coalescence to much larger sizes with subsequent fragmentation by
   capillary instabilities. The final droplet size in both cases was very
   different from TB model predictions. A modeling approach is proposed
   that combined both TB and droplet breakage and coalescence mechanisms.
   Comparison between the experimental results and the models predictions
   showed satisfactory agreement. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{Developing a low cost, highly active and durable cathode material is a
   high-priority research direction toward the commercialization of
   low-temperature fuel cells. However, the high cost and low stability of
   useable materials remain a considerable challenge for the widespread
   adoption of fuel cell energy conversion devices. The electrochemical
   performance of fuel cells is still largely hindered by the high loading
   of noble metal catalyst (Pt/Pt alloy) at the cathode, which is necessary
   to facilitate the inherently sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).
   Under these circumstances, the exploration of alternatives to replace
   expensive Pt-alloy for constructing highly efficient non-noble metal
   catalysts has been studied intensively and received great interest.
   Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) a novel type of porous crystalline
   materials, have revealed potential application in the field of clean
   energy and demonstrated a number of advantages owing to their accessible
   high surface area, permanent porosity, and abundant metal/organic
   species. Recently, newly emerging MOFs materials have been used as
   templates and/or precursors to fabricate porous carbon and related
   functional nanomaterials, which exhibit excellent catalytic activities
   toward ORR or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, recent
   advances in the use of MOF-derived functional nanomaterials as efficient
   electrocatalysts in fuel cells are summarized. Particularly, we focus on
   the rational design and synthesis of highly active and stable porous
   carbon-based electrocatalysts with various nanostructures by using the
   advantages of MOFs precursors. Finally, further understanding and
   development, future trends, and prospects of advanced MOF-derived
   nanomaterials for more promising applications of clean energy are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an adaptive filtering technique is proposed to estimate
   and characterize pathological tremors caused by Parkinson's Disease (PD)
   and Essential Tremor (ET). The technique is based on the formulation of
   band-limited multiple Fourier Linear Combiners (BMFLC) and is called
   Enhanced-BMFLC (E-BMFLC). The effectiveness of the designed filter is
   statistically evaluated through a clinical study involving 14 PD and 13
   ET patients. The hand tremors of the participants are studied in three
   Degrees Of Freedom (DOF). Using statistical analysis, it is shown that
   the new design of the filter significantly enhances the accuracy in
   comparison with the performance of conventional BMFLC filtering. In
   addition, E-BMFLC significantly reduces the sensitivity to parameter
   tuning and intrapatient variabilities. The observed improvements are
   achieved by modulating the memory of the proposed filter, and by
   enriching the utilized harmonic model. The proposed filter is then used
   to develop a safe haptics-enabled robotic rehabilitation architecture,
   designed for patients having hand tremors. The architecture is entitled
   Augmented Haptic Rehabilitation (AHR), which enables adaptive management
   of the involuntary components of the hand motion while delivering
   assist-as-needed haptic therapy (for the voluntary component) and
   avoiding unsafe amplification of hand tremors. Experimental evaluations
   are provided to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed AHR system.}},

Title = {{Mean pressure distributions and reattachment lengths for roof-separation

Abstract = {{Investigations of separated and reattaching flows near the leading edge
   of three-dimensional bluff bodies placed in turbulent boundary layers
   are important because of the large aerodynamic loads that these flows
   cause. Roofs of low-rise buildings are vulnerable to this kind of wind
   loading. Turbulence properties in the approaching boundary layer flow
   affect the pressure distributions and the mean size of the separation
   bubble formed on building surfaces. In this study, the effects of
   turbulence intensities and length scales in the incident boundary layer
   on the mean reattachment lengths and surface mean pressure distributions
   for low-rise building roofs are investigated. Particle Image Velocimetry
   measurements of the roof separation bubble, along with surface
   measurements, for a low-rise building model were taken for six
   different, upstream, boundary-layer conditions. Surface pressure
   measurements were taken for a second building model in similar upstream
   conditions. Along with these data, pressure data from the NIST
   aerodynamic database were used in the analysis. The mean size of the
   roof separation bubble is found to be unaffected by the turbulence
   length scales over the range tested, whereas turbulence intensity has a
   significant effect on reattachment lengths. The mean pressure
   distribution was found to be a function of both the mean reattachment
   length and the upstream turbulence intensity. A method of estimating the
   mean reattachment length on the roof of low-rise buildings from measured
   surface pressures and roof height turbulence intensity is proposed. (C)

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo provide detailed geometric and topological descriptions of
   the rat gluteus maximus arteriolar network, and to measure the
   distribution of diameters and lengths as well as their associated
   variability within and between networks.
   MethodsComplete arteriolar networks arising from feed artery (inferior
   gluteal artery) to terminal branches were imaged under baseline
   conditions, using IVVM. Photomontages of complete networks were
   assembled and evaluated offline for measurements of geometry and
   topology. Single-line (skeletonized) tracings of the networks were made
   for fractal analysis.
   ResultsDiameters and lengths decreased with increasing topological order
   (centrifugal), while number of elements increased with increasing order.
   Horton's laws were shown to be valid within the arteriolar networks of
   the rat GM. Inter-network variability in diameter (similar to 5-22\%)
   and length (similar to 17-30\%) at each order was generally lower than
   the corresponding intra-network variability in diameter (similar to
   10-48\%) and length (similar to 39-106\%).
   ConclusionsData presented in this study provide crucial quantitative
   analysis of complete arteriolar networks within healthy skeletal muscle,
   and may serve as ideal experimental inputs for future theoretical
   studies of skeletal muscle microvascular structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{Cerium doped Barium Fluoride (BaF2-Ce) transparent ceramic was
   fabricated and its luminescence and scintillation properties were
   studied. The photoluminescence shows the emission peaks at 310 nm and

   at 511 keV and 1274 keV were obtained with BaF2-Ce transparent ceramic
   for Na-22 radioisotopes. Energy resolution of 13.5\% at 662 keV is
   calculated for the BaF2-Ce transparent ceramic. Light yield of 5100
   photons/MeV was recorded for BaF2-Ce(0.2\%) ceramic and is comparable to
   its single crystal counterpart. Scintillation decay time measurements
   shows fast component of 58 ns and a relatively slow component of 434 ns
   under 662 keV gamma excitation. The slower component in BaF2-Ce(0.2\%)
   ceramic is about 200 ns faster than the STE emission in BaF2 host and is
   associated with the dipole-dipole energy transfer from the host matrix
   to Ce3+ luminescence center. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Predictive Trip Detection for Nuclear Power Plants}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4, 2}},
Pages = {{2352-2362}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of a Kalman filter (KF) to predict,
   within the shutdown system (SDS) of a nuclear power plant (NPP), whether
   safety parameter measurements have reached a trip set-point. In
   addition, least squares (LS) estimation compensates for prediction error
   due to system-model mismatch. The motivation behind predictive shutdown
   is to reduce the amount of time between the occurrence of a fault or
   failure and the time of trip detection, referred to as time-to-trip.
   These reductions in time-to-trip can ultimately lead to increases in
   safety and productivity margins. The proposed predictive SDS differs
   from conventional SDSs in that it compares point-predictions of the
   measurements, rather than sensor measurements, against trip set-points.
   The predictive SDS is validated through simulation and experiments for
   the steam generator water level safety parameter. Performance of the
   proposed predictive SDS is compared against benchmark conventional SDS
   with respect to time-to-trip. In addition, this paper analyzes:
   prediction uncertainty, as well as; the conditions under which it is
   possible to achieve reduced time-to-trip. Simulation results demonstrate
   that on average the predictive SDS reduces time-to-trip by an amount of
   time equal to the length of the prediction horizon and that the
   distribution of times-to-trip is approximately Gaussian. Experimental
   results reveal that a reduced time-to-trip can be achieved in a
   real-world system with unknown system-model mismatch and that the
   predictive SDS can be implemented with a scan time of under 100ms. Thus,
   this paper is a proof of concept for KF/LS-based predictive trip
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Background When children have marked problems with motor coordination,
   they often have problems with attention and impulse control. Here, we
   map the neuroanatomic substrate of motor coordination in childhood and
   ask whether this substrate differs in the presence of concurrent
   symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   Method Participants were 226 children. All completed Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)-based
   assessment of ADHD symptoms and standardized tests of motor coordination
   skills assessing aiming/catching, manual dexterity and balance. Symptoms
   of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) were determined using
   parental questionnaires. Using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance data, four
   latent neuroanatomic variables (for the cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
   basal ganglia and thalamus) were extracted and mapped onto each motor
   coordination skill using partial least squares pathway modeling.
   Results The motor coordination skill of aiming/catching was
   significantly linked to latent variables for both the cerebral cortex (t
   = 4.31, p < 0.0001) and the cerebellum (t = 2.31, p = 0.02). This effect
   was driven by the premotor/motor cortical regions and the superior
   cerebellar lobules. These links were not moderated by the severity of
   symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. In categorical
   analyses, the DCD group showed atypical reduction in the volumes of
   these regions. However, the group with DCD alone did not differ
   significantly from those with DCD and co-morbid ADHD.
   Conclusions The superior cerebellar lobules and the premotor/motor
   cortex emerged as pivotal neural substrates of motor coordination in
   children. The dimensions of these motor coordination regions did not
   differ significantly between those who had DCD, with or without
   co-morbid ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{A computational elbow joint model was developed with a main goal of
   providing complimentary data to experimental results. The computational
   model was developed and validated using an experimental elbow joint
   phantom consisting of a linked total joint replacement. An established
   in-vitro motion simulator was used to actively flex/extend the
   experimental elbow in multiple orientations. Muscle forces predicted by
   the computational model were similar to the experimental model in 4 out
   of the 5 orientations with errors less than 7.5 N. Valgus angle
   kinematics were in agreement with differences less than 2.3 degrees. In
   addition, changes in radial head length, a clinically relevant condition
   following elbow reconstruction, were simulated in both models and
   compared. Both lengthening and shortening of the radial head prosthesis
   altered muscle forces by less than 3.5 N in both models, and valgus
   angles agreed within 1 degrees. The computational model proved valuable
   in cross validation with the experimental model, elucidating important
   limitations in the in-vitro motion simulator's controller. With
   continued development, the computational model can be a complimentary
   tool to experimental studies by providing additional noninvasive outcome
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Gaussian normal bases (GNBs) are special set of normal bases (NBs) which

   representation for odd values of m > 1. The proposed fully-serial-in
   single multipliers perform multiplication of two field elements and
   offer high throughput when the data-path capacity for entering inputs is
   limited. The proposed hybrid-double and hybrid-triple digit-level GNB
   multipliers perform, respectively, two and three field multiplications
   using the same latency required for a single digit-level multiplier, at
   the expense of increased area. In addition, we present a new eight-ary
   field exponentiation architecture which does not require precomputed or

Abstract = {{Natural convection in a two-dimensional horizontal layer has been
   investigated. The layer is confined between two parallel horizontal
   plates. The upper plate is kept isothermal, while the lower plate has an
   externally imposed, long wavelength, spatially sinusoidal heating with
   the amplitude expressed in terms of the Rayleigh number Ra and the
   wavelength characterized by the wave number alpha. Only steady-state
   flow structures and their bifurcations have been considered. The
   detailed analysis has been carried out for two Prandtl numbers, i.e. Pr
   = 0.7 and Pr = 7, and only small differences in the bifurcation diagrams
   have been observed. When Ra < Ra (cr) = 427, convection has a simple
   topology consisting of one pair of counter-rotating rolls per heating
   period. Secondary motion in the form of rolls aligned in the direction
   of the primary rolls and concentrated around the hot spots occurs for Ra
   > 427. When 427 < Ra < similar to 470 and alpha < similar to 0.14, the
   secondary motion is described by the supercritical pitchfork
   bifurcation. One of the branches of this bifurcation is associated with
   an odd number of secondary rolls per half wavelength, with rolls above
   the hot spots rotating in the direction opposite to the primary rolls.
   The other branch is associated with an even number of secondary rolls
   per half wavelength, with the rolls above the hot spots co-rotating with
   the primary rolls. The new rolls are pinched off in pairs when alpha
   decreases. When Ra > similar to 470 and alpha > similar to 0.14,
   bifurcation assumes the form of ``bifurcation from infinity{''}. The
   main branch is associated with one pair of rolls per heating period for
   alpha > 0.25. Decrease in alpha along this branch results in the
   formation of secondary rolls, with the rolls at the hot spot co-rotating
   with the primary rolls. The lower part of the other branch is associated
   with one pair of rolls per heating period in the limit alpha -> 0.
   Increase in alpha results in pinching off a single roll which
   counter-rotates with respect to the primary roll at the hot spot.}},

Abstract = {{Static liquefaction failure of a sloping ground occurs when the shear
   stress applied by a monotonic triggering load exceeds the undrained
   yield (peak) shear strength of the saturated liquefiable cohesionless
   soil. Current practices for determining the in-situ undrained yield
   strength for ground subject to static shear stress either rely on a
   suite of costly laboratory tests on undisturbed field samples or
   empirical correlations based on in-situ penetration tests which do not
   account for the effects of anisotropic consolidation, intermediate
   principal stress, and mode of shear on the degree of strain-softening
   and brittleness of cohesionless soils. This study investigates the
   effects of variations in the direction and relative magnitudes of
   principal stresses associated with different modes of shear and ground
   slopes on static liquefaction failure of cohesionless soils. Empirical
   relationships are developed between soil brittleness index and maximum
   excess pore water pressure ratio to characterize soil shearing behavior
   observed in a database of 271 undrained laboratory shear tests collected
   from the past literature. The application of these relationships for
   estimating the static liquefaction triggering strength of cohesionless
   soils under sloping grounds is described for plane-strain boundary
   conditions and the results are compared with those back-calculated for
   several cases of static liquefaction flow failures. The proposed
   procedure incorporates variations in mode of shear and initial stress
   anisotropy in an empirical formulation based on in-situ penetration
   tests.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cylindrical concrete shafts are one of the main components of any
   concrete storm water or sewerage system. The state of stresses within
   the soil surrounding these shafts are not fully understood, since it is
   different than the well known stresses behind retaining walls due to the
   radial stiffness of the shaft. This paper concentrates on studying the
   lateral pressure around such shafts. The presented study consists of two
   main parts: an experimental program that comprises full-scale testing of
   cylindrical shafts under in situ conditions in a controlled laboratory
   environment, and a numerical modeling investigation using the finite
   element method. The research results showed that the lateral earth
   pressure ranged between above the at-rest to slightly below the active
   earth pressure based on the soil type. The shafts in clayey soils
   experienced larger lateral pressure values than those in sandy soils.
   The effect of compaction was found to be significant at the top two
   meters of backfill and negligible below that. The live load was found to
   have a marginal effect on the pressure close to the top of cylindrical
   shaft and this effect decreases with depth (i.e. distance from top of
   cylindrical shaft). Comparisons were made between the lateral earth
   pressure observed in this study and some proposed procedures by the
   Canadian Highway Bridge design code for calculating pressure behind
   retaining walls.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a therapist-in-the-loop framework for
   robotics-assisted mirror rehabilitation integrated with adaptive
   assist-as-needed therapy (ANT) that is adjusted based on the impairment
   level of the patient's affected limb. The framework, which is designed
   for patients with hemiparesis and/or hemispatial neglect, uses a
   patient's functional limb as the medium to transfer therapeutic training
   from the therapist to the patient's impaired limb (PIL). This allows the
   patient to use his/her functional limb to adjust the desired trajectory
   generated by the therapist if the trajectory is painful or uncomfortable
   for the PIL. In order to realize the adaptive patient-targeted therapy,
   two motor-function assessment metrics, performance symmetry and level of
   guidance, are proposed, providing real time, task-independent, and
   objective assessment of the PIL's motor deficiency. An adaptation law is
   also presented to adjust the intensity of the therapy delivered to the
   patient in real time and based on the aforementioned estimation of the
   impairment level of the PIL. Closed-loop system stability has been
   investigated in the presence of communication delays to facilitate
   tele/in-home rehabilitation. For this purpose, a combination of the
   Circle Criterion and the Small-Gain theorem has been applied to account
   both for communication time delays and the time-varying adaptive ANT.
   Results of experiments to investigate the performance of the proposed
   framework are reported.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo determine the efficacy of compressed sensing (CS)
   reconstructions for specific clinical magnetic resonance neuroimaging
   applications beyond more conventional acceleration techniques such as
   parallel imaging (PI) and low-resolution acquisitions.
   Materials and MethodsRaw k-space data were acquired from five healthy
   volunteers on a 3T scanner using a 32-channel head coil using T-2-FLAIR,
   FIESTA-C, time of flight (TOF), and spoiled gradient echo (SPGR)
   sequences. In a series of blinded studies, three radiologists
   independently evaluated CS, PI (GRAPPA), and low-resolution images at up
   to 5x accelerations. Synthetic T-2-FLAIR images with artificial lesions
   were used to assess diagnostic accuracy for CS reconstructions.
   ResultsCS reconstructions were of diagnostically acceptable quality at
   up to 4x acceleration for T-2-FLAIR and FIESTA-C (average qualitative
   scores 3.7 and 4.3, respectively, on a 5-point scale at 4x
   acceleration), and at up to 3x acceleration for TOF and SPGR (average
   scores 4.0 and 3.7, respectively, at 3x acceleration). The qualitative
   scores for CS reconstructions were significantly better than
   low-resolution images for T-2-FLAIR, FIESTA-C, and TOF and significantly
   better than GRAPPA for TOF and SPGR (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P <
   0.05) with no significant difference found otherwise. Diagnostic
   accuracy was acceptable for both CS and low-resolution images at up to
   3x acceleration (area under the ROC curve 0.97 and 0.96, respectively.)
   ConclusionMild to moderate accelerations are possible for those
   sequences by a combined CS and PI reconstruction. Nevertheless, for
   certain sequences/applications one might mildly reduce the acquisition
   time by appropriately reducing the imaging resolution rather than the
   more complicated CS reconstruction. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

   mA h g(-1) at 0.05 A g(-1) without obvious capacity fading after 300
   cycles. Furthermore, FGNS reveal high rate capacity of 152 mA h g(-1) at
   a high current density of 0.4 A g(-1). The excellent electrochemical
   performance is attributed to the oxygen-containing functional groups and
   specific poriferous structure of FGNS. The proposed FGNS are expected to
   be a simple, low-cost, efficient, and large-scale production of cathode
   materials for LIBs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Sn-based materials have been hindered from practical use for lithium
   ion batteries due to the inherent volume change leading to poor cycling
   performance. To mitigate this challenge, in this study, amorphous
   SnO2/graphene aerogel nanocomposites are fabricated via a simple
   hydrothermal approach. The amorphous nature of SnO2 is clearly
   determined in detail by transmission electron microscopy,
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and
   X-ray diffraction measurement. The as-prepared material shows satisfying
   reversible capacity and significant cyclic stability. For instance, it
   delivers an excellent discharge capacity of 700.1 mA h g(-1) in 80th
   cycle at a current density of 100 mA g-1, in accordance with a high
   retention capacity of 97.6\% compared to that of the sixth cycles, which
   is much better than crystalline SnO2/graphene aerogel. The enhanced
   electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the intrinsic isotropic
   nature, smaller size, and high electrochemical reaction kinetics of
   amorphous SnO2, together with the graphene aerogels matrix. Therefore,
   this study may provide an effortless, economic, and environmental
   friendly strategy to fabricate high volume change electrode materials
   for lithiuln ion batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Usually for modeling of soil in a direct soil-structure interaction
   (SSI) problem, the equivalent linear soil properties are used. However,
   this approach is not valid in the vicinity of a foundation, where the
   soil experiences large strains and a high level of nonlinearity because
   of structural vibrations. The near-field method was developed and
   described in a companion paper to overcome this limitation. This method
   considers the effects of large strains and suggests a shear modulus and
   a damping ratio further modified in the near-field of a foundation.
   Validity and performance of this approach are evaluated, application
   examples are explained and the results of a parametric study about the
   role of soil and structure parameters in the extent of SSI effects on
   the nonlinear seismic response of structures are presented in this
   paper. One real existing and five, ten, fifteen and twenty story
   moment-resisting frame steel buildings with two different site
   conditions corresponding to firm and soft soils are considered and the
   responses obtained from the near-field method are compared with the
   recorded and rigorous responses. Moreover, various SSI modeling
   techniques are employed to investigate the accuracy and performance of
   each approach. The results show that the near-field method is a simple
   yet accurate enough approach for analysis of direct SSI problems.}},

Abstract = {{By shielding zinc stannate (ZTO, viz., Zn2SnO4) nanoparticles with
   reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as well as multi-wall carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs), we have successfully created ZTO/RGO/MWCNTs composites via a
   facile hydrothermal process. In the designed hybrid nanostructure,
   acting as the strut and bridge to open the graphene sheets, 3D RGO/MWCNT
   nets not only tackle the problem of volume expansion and the aggregation
   of ZTO nanoparticles, but also maintain the integration of anode
   materials for high electrochemical performance. As a result, the
   resultant anode material shows high reversible capacity, superior rate
   capacity and long-running cycle performance for lithium ion batteries
   (LIBs). For instance, a excellent reversible capacity of 915.9 mAh g(-1)
   was obtained at the current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 340 cycles.
   Our study demonstrates significant potential of ZTO/RGO/MWCNTs as anode

Abstract = {{To address the decision-making problem for real-time multi-objective
   flood operations in multi-reservoir system, this paper develops a
   multi-objective best compromise decision model (MoBCDM). Utility
   function is used to quantitatively express the preference of decision
   maker, and also fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and segmentation
   and averaging (Seg/Ave) are adopted together with the preferences of
   decision participants (hydrologist and reservoir manager) to convert the
   problem into a scalar optimization. The differential evolution (DE)
   algorithm is implemented for obtaining the best compromise solution. The
   multi-objective flood operation problem in Shiguan River Basin (in
   China), which contains two reservoirs and three flood control points, is
   used as a case study. The analyses are performed to compare four
   historical flood operations scenarios, this model and current operating
   rules. The results of the analyses show that the MoBCDM outperforms all
   operational scenarios in terms of peak flow reduction at three flood
   downstream control points. In addition, the MoBCDM execution is very
   efficient in real-time implementation, and also weighting coefficients
   for the use by the MoBCDM can get high resolution calculated by FAHP.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the global status of waste to energy (WTE)
   technologies as a mean for renewable energy production and municipal
   solid waste (MSW) disposal method. A case study of the Kingdom of Saudi
   Arabia (KSA) under this concept was developed. The WTE opportunities in
   the KSA is undertaken in the context of two scenarios: (1) incineration
   and (2) refuse derived fuel (RDF) along with biomethanation from 2012 to
   2035. Biomethanation technology can proved to be the most suitable WTE
   technology for KSA due to (a) availability of high food waste volume
   (37\% of total MSW) that can be used as a feedstock, (b) higher
   efficiency (25-30\%) and (c) lowest annual capital (\$0.1-0.14/ton) and
   operational cost. However, the need for large space for continuous
   operation might increase operational cost. The RDF has an advantage over
   incineration due to (a) less annual capital (\$7.5-11.3/ton) and (b)
   operational cost (\$0.3-0.55/ton), but the high labor skills
   requirements will most probably be a limitation, if appropriate training
   and related infrastructure are not scheduled to be included as a
   prerequisite. The incineration technology also proves to be an efficient
   solution with a relatively higher efficiency (25\%) and lower
   operational cost (\$1.5-2.5/ton). However, the need for treatment of air
   and waterborne pollutants and ash within the incineration facility can
   be the limiting factors for the development of this technology in KSA.
   In 2012, the power generation potential for KSA was estimated at 671 MW
   and 319.4 MW from incineration and RDF with biomethanation scenarios
   respectively, which was forecasted to reach upto 1447 MW and 699.76 MW
   for both scenarios respectively by 2035. Therefore, WTE technologies,
   could make a substantial contribution to the renewable energy production
   in KSA as well as alleviating the cost of landfilling and its associated
   environmental impacts. However, the decision to select between the two
   scenarios requires further in-depth financial, technical and
   environmental analysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, the capacity of a natural circulation loop for
   transferring heat from a heat source to a heat sink has been analyzed.
   It is concluded that the capacity of the natural circulation loop
   depends on the conversion efficiency of the thermal energy from the heat
   source to the driving force for the circulation of the flow. The low
   conversion efficiency leading to weak driving force in such loops has
   been demonstrated analytically and validated through simulation results.
   This issue has resulted in a low heat transfer capacity in the
   circulation loop. To increase the heat transfer capacity, one has to
   improve this efficiency. To meet such a need, a novel efficiency booster
   has been developed in this paper. The booster essentially increases the
   flow driving force and hence significantly improves the overall heat
   transfer capacity. Design and analysis of this booster have been
   performed in detail. The performance has been examined through extensive
   computer simulations. It is concluded that the booster can indeed
   drastically improve the heat transfer capacity of the natural
   circulation loop. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the wind induced convective heat transfer
   from a ground mounted stand-alone solar panel using Reynolds-Averaged
   Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation with Shear Stress Transport (SST)
   k-omega turbulence model. An unsteady solver with a steady inlet
   condition is employed. The numerical modeling approach is validated for
   wind flow field around the solar panel with a Particle Image Velocimetry
   (PIV) experiment performed in the boundary layer wind tunnel. The solar
   panel is subjected to two different wind directions (0 degrees and 180
   degrees), and for each wind direction, three different incoming flows
   (wind speeds of 1, 5 and 10 m/s at 10 m height) are considered. The
   Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (CHTC) distributions on the
   surfaces of the solar panel are analyzed with respect to the flow field
   around the solar panel. Similar CHTC distribution is observed on both
   windward and leeward surfaces of the solar panel where natural
   convection is dominant over forced convection. In contrast, where forced
   convection is dominant, higher CHTC values (up-to 128\%) are found on
   the windward surfaces compared to the leeward surfaces of the panel.
   Relation between the dimensionless CHTC parameter Nusselt number (Nu)
   and the Reynolds number (Re) are presented and the results are compared
   with previous existing correlations. The lowest Re case (1.0 x 10(5)),
   which produces the maximum panel surface temperature and thus will
   result in minimum electrical efficiency of the panel, is identified to
   be the most critical case in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the suitability of pinewood pyrolysates as a carbon
   source for lipid production and cultivation of the oleaginous yeast
   Rhodosporidium diobovatum and the microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. Thermal
   decomposition of pinewood and fractional condensation were used to
   obtain an oil rich in levoglucosan which was upgraded to glucose by acid
   hydrolysis. Blending of pyrolytic sugars with pure glucose in both
   nitrogen rich and nitrogen limited conditions was studied for R.
   diobovatum, and under nitrogen limited conditions for C. vulgaris.
   Glucose consumption rate decreased with increasing proportions of
   pyrolytic sugars increasing cultivation time. While R. diobovatum was
   capable of growth in 100\% (v/v) pyrolytic sugars, C. vulgaris growth
   declined rapidly in blends greater than 20\% (v/v) until no growth was
   detected in blends > 40\%. Finally, the effects of pyrolysis sugars on
   lipid composition was evaluated and biodiesel fuel properties were
   estimated based on the lipid profiles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Continuous biohydrogen production by acclimatized anaerobic sludge was
   investigated using glucose and xylose individually at a concentration of
   10 g/L and furfural concentrations of (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g/L).
   The glucose-fed reactor showed that the initial hydrogen yield of 2.27
   mol H-2/mol glucose increased by 17\% and 6\% at furfural concentrations
   of 0.25 and 0.5 g/L, respectively, and decreased by 21\%, 29\% and 62\%
   at furfural concentrations of 1, 2, and 4 g/L, respectively. The
   inhibition threshold for furfural was in the range of 2-4 g/L. The
   revivability of the inhibited sludge was confirmed by eliminating
   furfural addition, which resulted in a hydrogen yield of 1.64 mol
   H-2/mol glucose comparable to the 2.27 mol H2/mol glucose observed
   initially without furfural. A similar trend was observed in the
   xylosefed reactor, in which the hydrogen yield decreased by 63\% at the
   4 g/L furfural to 0.57 mol H-2/mol xylose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Curiosity rover observed high Mn abundances (>25wt \% MnO) in
   fracture-filling materials that crosscut sandstones in the Kimberley
   region of Gale crater, Mars. The correlation between Mn and trace metal
   abundances plus the lack of correlation between Mn and elements such as
   S, Cl, and C, reveals that these deposits are Mn oxides rather than
   evaporites or other salts. On Earth, environments that concentrate Mn
   and deposit Mn minerals require water and highly oxidizing conditions;
   hence, these findings suggest that similar processes occurred on Mars.
   Based on the strong association between Mn-oxide deposition and evolving
   atmospheric dioxygen levels on Earth, the presence of these Mn phases on
   Mars suggests that there was more abundant molecular oxygen within the
   atmosphere and some groundwaters of ancient Mars than in the present
   day.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is a major pathophysiological consequence of
   obstructive sleep apnea. Recently, it has been shown that IH results in
   changes in body energy balance, leptin secretion and concomitant
   alterations in arcuate nucleus (ARC). In this study, the role of leptin
   on these changes was investigated in leptin-deficient rats exposed to IH
   or normoxic control conditions. Body weights, consumatory and locomotor
   behaviours, and protein signaling in ARC were assessed immediately after
   IH exposure. Compared to normoxia, IH altered body weight, food intake,
   locomotor pattern, and the plasma concentration of leptin and
   angiotensin II in the wild-type rat. However, these changes were not
   observed in the leptin-deficient rat. Within ARC of wild-type animals,
   IH increased phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of
   transcription 3 and pro-opiomelanocortin protein expression, but not in
   the leptin-deficient rat. The long-form leptin receptor protein
   expression was not altered following IH in either rat strain. These data
   suggest that leptin is involved in mediating the alterations to body
   energy balance and ARC activity following IH. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland

   butanol from 30 g/L sugars). The treatment of SAEH with resin L-493
   prior the fermentation resulted in no inhibitory effects and an ABE
   titer of 14.44 g/L, including 5.49 g/L butanol was obtained,
   corresponding to an ABE yield and productivity of 0.49 g/g and 0.60
   g/L/h, respectively. Dual functionality of the resin was realized by
   also using it as an in-situ product removal agent. Integrating in-situ
   product removal allowed for the use of high substrate concentrations
   without the typical product inhibition. Resin-detoxified SAEH was
   supplemented with neat glucose and an effective ABE titer of 33 g/L
   (including 13.7 g/L acetone, 16.4 g/L butanol and 1.9 g/L ethanol) was
   achieved with resin-based in-situ product removal, corresponding to an
   ABE yield and productivity of 0.41 g/g and 0.69 g/L/h, respectively.
   Both detoxification of the substrate and the products was achieved by
   the same resin, which was added prior the fermentation. Integrating
   hydrolysate detoxification and in-situ butanol removal in a batch
   process through single resin can potentially simplify cellulosic butanol
   production.}},

Title = {{Finite-Element Analysis of Bone Stresses on Primary Impact in a
   Large-Animal Model: The Distal End of the Equine Third Metacarpal}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess whether the transient stresses of foot impact with the ground
   are similar to those found during midstance loading and if the location
   of high stress correlate with the sites most commonly associated with
   mechanically induced osteoarthritis (OA). We compared impact stresses in
   subchondral bone between two subject-specific, three-dimensional,
   finite-element models of the equine metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint-one
   with advanced OA and one healthy, and with similar published data on the
   stresses that occur at midstance.
   Methods
   Two right MCP joints (third metacarpal and proximal phalanx) were
   scanned using micro-computed tomography (mu CT). Images were segmented,
   and meshed using modified 10-node quadratic tetrahedral elements. Bone
   material properties were assigned based on the bone density. An impact
   velocity of 3.55 m/s was applied to each model and contact pressures and
   stress distribution were calculated for each. In a separate iteration,
   the third metacarpal was loaded statically. A sampling grid of 160
   equidistant points was superimposed over selected slices, and average
   peak stresses were calculated for 6 anatomical regions. Within-region
   maximal peak and average von Mises stresses were compared between
   healthy and OA bones in both midstance and impact loading.
   Results
   Average impact stresses across all regions, in both locations (palmar
   and dorsal) were greater in the OA model. Highest impact stresses were
   located in the dorsal medial condyle in the healthy (12.8 MPa) and OA
   (14.1MPa) models, and were lowest in the palmar medial and lateral
   parasagittal grooves in the healthy (5.94 MPa) and OA (7.07 MPa) models.
   The healthy static model had higher peak (up to 49.7\% greater) and
   average (up to 38.6\% greater) stresses in both locations and across all
   regions compared to the OA static model.
   Conclusions
   Under simulated footfall a trot, loading on the dorsal aspect of the
   third metacarpal at impact created stresses similar to those found
   during midstance. The high accelerations that occur under impact loading
   are likely responsible for creating the high stresses, as opposed to
   midstance loading where the high stresses are the result of high mass
   loading. Although the stress magnitudes were found to be similar among
   the two loading conditions, the location of the high stress loading
   occurred in sites that are not typically associated with osteoarthritic
   changes.}},

Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{826}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{A global disk oscillation implemented in the viscous decretion disk
   (VDD) model has been used to reproduce most of the observed properties
   of the well known Be star zeta Tau. 48 Librae shares several
   similarities with zeta Tau-they are both early-type Be stars, display
   shell characteristics in their spectra, and exhibit cyclic V/R
   variations-but has some marked differences as well, such as a much
   denser and more extended disk, a much longer V/R cycle, and the absence
   of the so-called triple-peak features. We aim to reproduce the
   photometric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic observables of 48 Librae
   with a self-consistent model, and to test the global oscillation
   scenario for this target. Our calculations are carried out with the
   three-dimensional NLTE radiative transfer code HDUST. We employ a
   rotationally deformed, gravity-darkened central star surrounded by a
   disk whose unperturbed state is given by the VDD model. A
   two-dimensional global oscillation code is then used to calculate the
   disk perturbation and superimpose it on the unperturbed disk. A very
   good, self-consistent fit to the time-averaged properties of the disk is
   obtained with the VDD. The calculated perturbation has a period P = 12
   years, which agrees with the observed period, and the behavior of the
   V/R cycle is well reproduced by the perturbed model. The perturbed model
   improves the fit to the photometric data and reproduces some features of
   the observed spectroscopic data. Some suggestions to improve the
   synthesized spectroscopy in a future work are given.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) is an emerging technology for the
   remediation of contaminated sites. However, there are concerns related
   to the impact of nZVI on in situ microbial communities. In this study,
   the microbial community composition at a contaminated site was monitored
   over two years following the injection of nZVI stabilized with
   carboxymethyl cellulose (nZVI-CMC). Enhanced dechlorination of
   chlorinated ethenes to nontoxic ethene was observed long after the
   expected nZVI oxidation. The abundance of Dehalococcoides (Dhc) and
   vinyl chloride reductase (vcrA) genes, monitored using qPCR, increased
   by over an order of magnitude in nZVI-CMC-impacted wells. The entire
   microbial community was tracked using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
   pyrosequencing. Following nZVI-CMC injection, a clear shift in microbial
   community was observed, with most notable increases in the
   dechlorinating genera Dehalococcoides and Dehalogenimonas. This study
   suggests that coupled abiotic degradation (i.e., from reaction with
   nZVI) and biotic degradation fueled by CMC led to the long-term
   degradation of chlorinated ethenes at this field site. Furthermore,
   nZVI-CMC addition stimulated dehalogenator growth (e.g.,
   Dehalococcoides) and biotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes.}},

Abstract = {{Drug-eluting stents are used in the treatment of atherosclerosis, where
   the incorporation of anti-proliferative or anti-inflammatory drugs
   decreases the rate of restenosis, the recurrence of artery narrowing.
   However, these stents can suffer from limitations such as drug depletion
   and delamination of the drug-eluting coating from the stent surface.
   Described here is an approach aimed at addressing these issues. Starting
   from a maleic anhydride adduct of polyisobutylene (PIB) prepared from
   butyl rubber, ring opening using paclitaxel (PTX) or a combination of
   PTX and polystyrene (PS) afforded covalent conjugates of PTX and PIB or
   PIB-PS graft copolymers bearing pendant carboxylic acids. When coated on
   stainless steel, the drug release was slower than that from a control
   coating that ressembles a clinical formulation comprising a physical
   mix-ture of a PS-PIB-PS triblock copolymer (SIBS) and PTX. The PTX
   conjugates also exhibited enhanced adhesion to stainless steel and
   increased tensile strength in comparison with the starting rubber.
   Cytotoxicity assays indicated that the materials did not leach toxic
   levels of PTX into cell culture media. Nevertheless, they were capable
   of inhibiting the adhesion and proliferation of C2C12 cells on their
   surfaces. These properties are advantageous for the potential
   application of the materials as stent coatings. (C) 2016 Wiley

   highest H-2 yield (1.34 mol/mol of C for glucose and 1.01 mol/mol of C
   for biocrude) and highest carbon gasiifcation efficiency (88\% for
   glucose and 92\% for biocrude). It was found that Ru promoted Ni and
   ZrO2 showed some catalytic activities towards hydrogen production. The
   pressure was 25 MPa for all experiments. Stability test showed that
   10\%Ni-0.08\%Ru/Al2O3-ZrO2 was highly stable for a 20 h run. Among the
   parameters studied, higher temperature favored H-2 yield, whereas higher
   concentration led to lower H-2 yield. We found that carbon gasification
   efficiency of cattle manure biocrude was independent of variation in
   temperature and concentration. Also the equilibrium condition was
   attained at lower temperature and concentration in terms of carbon
   conversion of the feed. An Eley-Rideal (ER) based mechanistic model was
   devised and tested against the obtained data. It was found the
   dissociation of adsorbed oxygenated hydrocarbon is the rate determining
   step with an average absolute deviation 6.65\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A zinc-containing offretite (Zn-OFF) was synthesized using a
   hydrothermal method. The goal was to prepare a Zn-OFF zeolite with
   adsorption properties for selective removal of thiophenic chemical
   species in gasoline. It was expected that this new sorbent would perform
   favorably under the conditions close to the ones of FCC units. Following
   the Zn-OFF synthesis, several characterization techniques were used such
   as: a) temperature programmed desorption (TPD), b) temperature
   programmed reduction (TPR), c) temperature programmed oxidization (TPO),
   d) X-ray diffraction, e) N-2 isotherm, f) UV-vis spectra, g) Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (SEM) and h) Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
   (FTIR). In addition, chemical characterization was developed using
   Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and
   X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). It was proven on this basis, that zinc species
   are most likely included in the zeolite framework. Regarding the
   influence of Zn on the OFF zeolites, it was shown that Zn considerably
   increases (doubles) the weak acidity measured by TPD as well as shifts
   the TPD peak towards a higher temperature range. Additionally, FTIR
   pyridine adsorption also showed in the case of the Zn-OFF in comparison
   with the OFF, a 2.5 times higher abundance of Lewis acid sites versus
   Bronsted sites. It is speculated on this basis, that the Zn in the OFF
   structure increases species adsorption, changing the adsorption bonding
   strengths. Regarding the Zn-OFF performance, it was proven in a CREC
   Riser Simulator unit that one can achieve 37 wt\% of 2-methylthiophene
   removal with less than 1.3 wt\% being converted into coke. (C) 2016

   (3-hydroxyhexanoate {[}3HH] contents of 5.6 and 11.1 mol \%) were used
   as polymer matrix. One of two natural flours (cellulose or wood) at 1 wt
   \% was added to this PHBH matrix. Crystallization behaviors under
   nonisothermal conditions were characterized using differential scanning

   characterized using DSC and polarized optical microscopy. The results
   suggested that both cellulose and wood flour addition enhanced
   crystallization of the PHBH containing 5.6 mol \% of 3HH (i.e.,
   increased crystallization peak temperature and degree of crystallinity
   under the nonisothermal conditions, as well as decreased crystallization
   half time under the isothermal conditions). Of the two flours, wood
   flour was found to have greater effects, due to its higher crystal

Abstract = {{This manuscript reports the fluid dynamics in the developed flow region
   of a cocurrent gas-solid down flow fluidized bed unit. Gas-solid flows
   are simulated using a Computational Particle Fluid Dynamics (CPFD)
   numerical scheme and experimental data from the CREC-GS-Optiprobes. This
   model represents clusters in a downer unit. It is hypothesized that in
   downers, clusters are formed via a Random Particle Selection Method
   (RPSM) ensuring cluster dynamic stability. To accomplish this, a
   statistical particle selection of clusters (SPSC) method is developed.
   This hybrid model is validated with experimental data obtained in a 2 m
   height and 2.57 cm diameter column. Observed time-averaged axial and
   radial velocities and solid concentration profiles are successfully
   simulated by the Hybrid CPFD/CREC-GS-Optiprobes Data Model. These
   findings support: (a) a narrow distribution of particle cluster
   residences, (b) the relatively flat radial solid concentrations and
   solid cluster velocities, and (c) a valuable approach for establishing
   slip velocities in downer units. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dynamic coastal forcing influences the transport of pollutants in
   nearshore aquifers and their ultimate flux to coastal waters. In this
   study, field data are presented that show, for the first time, the
   influence of a period of intensified wave conditions (wave event) on
   nearshore groundwater flows and geochemistry in a sandy beach. Field
   measurements at a freshwater beach allow wave effects to be quantified
   without other complex forcing that are present along marine shorelines
   (e.g., tides). Pressure transducer data obtained over an isolated wave
   event reveal the development of transient groundwater flow
   recirculations. The groundwater flows were simulated in FEFLOW using a
   phase-averaged wave setup approach to represent waves acting on the
   sediment-water interface. Comparison of measured and simulated data
   indicates that consideration of wave setup alone is able to adequately
   capture wave-induced perturbations in groundwater flows. While prior
   studies have shown sharp pH and redox spatial zonations in nearshore
   aquifers, this study reveals rapid temporal variations in conductivity,
   pH, and redox (ORP) in shallow sediments (up to 0.5 m depth) in response
   to varying wave conditions. Comparison of head gradients with calculated
   conductivity and pH mixing ratios indicates the controlling effect of
   the wave-induced water exchange and flows in driving the observed
   geochemical dynamics. While we are not able to conclusively determine
   the extent to which temporal variations are caused by conservative
   mixing versus reactive processes, the pH and ORP variations observed
   will have significant implications for the fate of reactive pollutants
   discharging through sandy nearshore aquifers.}},

Journal = {{EPL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With attractive features like high energy density and flexibility,
   dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) have been designed to harvest
   mechanical energy from diverse sources. However, their energy harvesting
   performance could be limited by the material viscoelasticity and various
   failure modes. Adopting the finite-deformation viscoelasticity model,
   this work presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the performance
   of a DEG with a ``triangular{''} harvesting scheme. Simulation results
   reveal that choosing an appropriate in-plane stretch ratio for the onset
   of the discharging process can raise the harvested energy of DEGs. It is
   also found that the energy conversion efficiency of a DEG can be
   markedly improved by avoiding loss-of-tension of elastomer during the

Abstract = {{Triaxial shear tests are often carried out in a temperature controlled

   are often neglected or considered to have negligible effect on the

   fluctuation on volume and pore water pressure measurements is
   investigated for triaxial testing of sand samples. The experimental
   results show that even few degrees (+/- 2 degrees C) variation in
   temperature can produce relatively large pore water pressures in a
   saturated soil specimen in triaxial testing. These changes can
   particularly impact triaxial shear testing results of sands. An
   analytical procedure is also introduced that reasonably captures
   temperature-induced volume and pore pressure changes in a triaxial
   sample. The analytical method is then used for a parametric study of the
   mechanisms involved in temperature-induced effects.}},

Abstract = {{Consider an interleave-division multi-user coding model for a Gaussian
   multiple-access channel (MAC). Each user's message is encoded by a
   separate channel encoder followed by a user-interleaver, which is
   employed for user separation. All the users' codewords are jointly
   regarded as one multi-user codeword, and the distance between two
   multi-user codewords is defined as the Euclidean distance after the
   inter-user superposition caused by the MAC. A distance enumerator
   analysis estimates the multi-user maximum likelihood decoding
   performance. By introducing user-scramblers, a multi-user code ensemble
   is defined, and its distance enumerator is calculated as concatenated
   multiple single-user codes and a superposition code. Both finite-length
   and asymptotic analyses are given and it is shown that
   interleave-division multi-user codes have much better distance
   properties than conventional random direct-sequence code-division
   multiple-access. In fact, the codes achieve almost the same asymptotic
   uniquely decodable performance as a multi-user random code.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the link between restingstate functional connectivity
   (FC), measured by the correlations of fMRI BOLD time courses, and
   structural connectivity (SC), estimated through fiber tractography.
   Instead of a static analysis based on the correlation between SC and FC
   averaged over the entire fMRI time series, we propose a dynamic
   analysis, based on the time evolution of the correlation between SC and
   a suitably windowed FC. Assessing the statistical significance of the
   time series against random phase permutations, our data show a
   pronounced peak of significance for time window widths around 20-30 TR
   (40-60 s). Using the appropriate window width, we show that FC patterns
   oscillate between phases of high modularity, primarily shaped by
   anatomy, and phases of low modularity, primarily shaped by inter-network
   connectivity. Building upon recent results in dynamic FC, this
   emphasizes the potential role of SC as a transitory architecture between
   different highly connected restingstate FC patterns. Finally, we show
   that the regions contributing the most to these whole-brain level
   fluctuations of FC on the supporting anatomical architecture belong to
   the default mode and the executive control networks suggesting that they
   could be capturing consciousness-related processes such as mind
   wandering.}},

Abstract = {{The flow in an annulus driven by the axial movement of one of the
   cylinders has been studied. The stationary cylinder has been fitted with
   axisymmetric ribs resulting in the appearance of the
   centrifugal-force-driven instability which leads to the formation of
   axial vortices. The critical stability conditions have been determined
   for a wide range of geometries of practical interest; these conditions
   include the critical Reynolds number as well as the best vortex packing.
   It has been shown that a sufficiently large increase of the ribs'
   wavelength leads to a flow stabilization as the flow becomes nearly
   rectilinear, thus reducing the strength of the centrifugal force field.
   It has also been demonstrated that a sufficiently large decrease of the
   ribs' wavelength similarly results in the flow stabilization as the
   stream lifts up above the ribs' peaks and becomes more rectilinear.
   Reduction of the annulus' radius leads to qualitatively different flow
   responses depending on the position of the moving cylinder. The critical
   Reynolds number is reduced and the range of the ribs' wave numbers
   capable of inducing the instability is increased when the outer cylinder
   drives the flow. The trend is reversed when the inner cylinder drives
   the flow. Conditions when the ribbed cylinder is unable to induce any
   instability and, thus, behaves as a hydraulically smooth cylinder have
   been identified. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{A critical component in the interpretation of earthquake ground motions
   is the role that site effects play. In eastern Canada, the sediment
   layers which overlie glaciated bedrock produce strong and highly
   variable site responses. We use horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) response
   spectral ratios as the indicator variable by which to characterize the
   salient characteristics of site response. We show that site response can
   bemodeled using two key descriptive variables that are readily
   obtainable: (1) peak frequency (f(peak)), as determined from H/V or
   sediment depth; and (2) overall sediment type (or stiffness). We use
   these variables to create a preliminary model of site amplification that
   can be used in the development of ground-motion prediction equations
   (GMPEs) and in regional-scale ShakeMap-type applications. The key to the
   site characterization is the relationship between f(peak) and sediment
   thickness (depth-to-bedrock), which we derive using H/V data from
   earthquakes in the region, combined with compiled geophysical logs and a
   digital sediment thickness map from the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS).
   The OGS map also provides information on surficial sediment type, which
   is correlated with peak amplitudes (A(peak)) of response. H/V-spectral
   shapes may be associated with four main site categories, which in
   decreasing order of stiffness are: bedrock, till, sand/clay, and organic
   sediment/fill. The peak amplitudes of response are generally shown to
   increase as stiffness decreases, at least for the weak motions that are
   the focus of this study. We model site response by defining a generic
   site amplification curve, which is dependent only on f(peak) and site
   category. These site amplification curves can be applied in the
   development of regional GMPEs, and in the construction of near-real-time
   ShakeMaps.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a spectrally efficient nonorthogonal time-frequency
   training sequence (TS)-based channel state information (CSI) acquisition
   approach is proposed for multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems under the framework
   of structured compressed sensing (SCS). The scheme first relies on a
   time-domain TS that is identical for all transmit antennas to acquire
   the partial channel common support by utilizing the spatial correlation
   property of the MIMO channels and then uses the frequency-domain TS for
   accurate CSI recovery based on the proposed adaptive
   spatially-temporally joint simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit
   algorithm. Here, the obtained partial channel common support can be
   utilized to reduce the complexity of the classical SCS algorithm and
   improve the signal recovery probability. Simulation results show that
   the proposed scheme could significantly reduce the TS overhead and
   demonstrate better performance than the existing MIMO-OFDM systems,
   which might be suitable for massive MIMO systems in future
   fifth-generation communications.}},

Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) reinforced by nanoclay platelets exhibits

   Shear thinning behavior of nanoclay platelets probably reduced the

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using the microtunnelling technique to install
   pipelines through Queenston shale of southern Ontario is being
   investigated. In the microtunnelling technique, lubricant fluids - such
   as bentonite slurry and polymer solution - are used to facilitate
   excavation during installation of the pipeline sections. In this regard,
   a comprehensive testing program was performed to investigate the
   time-dependent deformation behaviour of Queenston shale considering
   lubricant fluids used in construction. The free swell test,
   semi-confined swell test, and the null swell test were utilized to
   perform this study. Results of 144 tests are presented and the variation
   of swelling characteristics of Queenston shale in lubricant fluids and
   in water is discussed briefly. The swelling model suggested by Lo and
   Hefny in 1996 was adopted to develop the swelling envelopes of Queenston
   shale in lubricant fluids and water in both horizontal and vertical
   directions with respect to the rock bedding. In comparison to swelling
   in fresh water, the study revealed that the polymer solution has
   substantially reduced the swelling of Queenston shale in all directions,
   while the bentonite solution was less efficient in reducing the swelling
   of Niagara Queenston shale, and has a slight negative influence on the
   swelling (i.e., increased swelling) of Milton Queenston shale.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{799}},
Pages = {{297-333}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The changes in discharge in pressure-driven flows through channels with
   longitudinal grooves have been investigated in the laminar flow regime
   and in the turbulent flow regime with moderate Reynolds numbers (Re-2H
   approximate to 6000) using both analytical and numerical methodologies.
   The results demonstrate that the long-wavelength grooves can increase
   discharge by 20 \%-150 \%, depending on the groove amplitude and the
   type of flow, while the short-wavelength grooves reduce the discharge.
   It has been shown that the reduced geometry model applies to the
   analysis of turbulent flows and the performance of grooves of arbitrary
   form is well approximated by the performance of grooves whose shape is
   represented by the dominant Fourier mode. The flow patterns, the
   turbulent kinetic energy as well as the Reynolds stresses were examined
   to identify the mechanisms leading to an increase in discharge. It is
   shown that the increase in discharge results from the rearrangement of
   the bulk fluid movement and not from the suppression of turbulence
   intensity. The turbulent kinetic energy and the Reynolds stresses are
   rearranged while their volume-averaged intensities remain the same as in
   the smooth channel. Analysis of the interaction of the groove patterns
   on both walls demonstrates that the converging-diverging configuration
   results in the greatest increase in discharge while the wavy channel
   configuration results in a reduction in discharge.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study is conducted to investigate the flow dynamics
   within the near-wake region of a horizontal axis wind turbine using
   particle image velocimetry (PIV). Measurements were performed in the
   horizontal plane in a row of four radially distributed measurement
   windows (tiles), which are then patched together to obtain larger
   measurement field. The mean and turbulent components of the flow field
   were measured at various blade phase angles. The mean velocity and
   turbulence characteristics show high dependency on the blade phase angle
   in the near-wake region closer to the blade tip and become phase
   independent further downstream at a distance of about one rotor
   diameter. In the near-wake region, both the mean and turbulent
   characteristics show a systemic variation with the phase angle in the
   blade tip region, where the highest levels of turbulence are observed.
   The streamlines of the instantaneous velocity field at a given phase
   allowed to track a tip vortex which showed wandering trend. The tip
   vortices are mostly formed at r/R>1, which indicates the wake expansion.
   Results also show the gradual movement of the vortex region in the axial
   direction, which can be attributed to the dynamics of the helical tip
   vortices which after being generated from the tip, rotate with respect
   to the blade and move in the axial direction because of the axial
   momentum of the flow. The axial velocity deficit was compared with other
   laboratory and field measurements. The comparison shows qualitative
   similarity. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Use of beta regression for statistical downscaling of precipitation in

Abstract = {{Impacts of global climate change on water resources systems are assessed
   by downscaling coarse scale climate variables into regional scale
   hydro-climate variables. In this study, a new multisite statistical
   downscaling method based on beta regression (BR) is developed for
   generating synthetic precipitation series, which can preserve temporal
   and spatial dependence along with other historical statistics. The beta
   regression based downscaling method includes two main steps: (1)
   prediction of precipitation states for the study area using
   classification and regression trees, and (2) generation of precipitation
   at different stations in the study area conditioned on the precipitation
   states. Daily precipitation data for 53 years from the ANUSPLIN data set
   is used to predict precipitation states of the study area where
   predictor variables are extracted from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set
   for the same interval. The proposed model is applied to downscaling
   daily precipitation at ten different stations in the Campbell River
   basin, British Columbia, Canada. Results show that the proposed
   downscaling model can capture spatial and temporal variability of local
   precipitation very well at various locations. The performance of the
   model is compared with a recently developed non-parametric kernel
   regression based downscaling model. The BR model performs better
   regarding extrapolation compared to the non-parametric kernel regression
   model. Future precipitation changes under different GHG (greenhouse gas)
   emission scenarios also projected with the developed downscaling model
   that reveals a significant amount of changes in future seasonal
   precipitation and number of wet days in the river basin. (C) 2016

Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{As a result of huge advancements in VLSI technology, more and more
   complex circuits are being implemented making not only the whole digital
   system more prone to faults, but also the fault detector itself
   susceptible to faults resulting in the requirement of concurrent fault
   detection architecture of the encoders and decoders. In this paper, we
   present a multiple-bit parity-based fault detection architecture for
   parallel CRC computation. After analyzing the parallel implementation of
   CRC, we present a formulation to generate a multiple-bit parity
   prediction structure to incorporate the fault detection architecture.
   Using the formulations of digit level CRC architecture, the checksum is
   divided into few blocks and predicted multiple-bit parity of the blocks
   are compared with the actual parity bits. Finally, with the help of
   software simulation and ASIC implementation, we show that the proposed
   scheme is highly efficient in terms of fault detection capability
   whereas it involves small area and time overhead. As an example, we have
   shown that the worst case area overhead is 25.7 percent for CRC-32 with
   four parity bits, and corresponding time overhead is 15.6 percent.}},

Abstract = {{The micropiled raft (MPR) offers an efficient foundation system that
   combines the advantages of micro piles and piled rafts that can be used
   as primary foundation system or to enhance an existing raft foundation.
   In this paper, a calibrated and verified finite element model (FEM) with
   centrifuge tests was used to carry out a numerical investigation on the
   performance of MPR in sand. A total of 78 different cases were analyzed
   in this study to assess the behavior of MPR in sand taking into account
   a number of factors that may influence its behavior such as: the number
   of micropiles (MPs), the spacing to micropile diameter (S/D-mp), the
   raft thickness, type of loading and soil density. The outcomes of this
   investigation should help in understanding the effect of these factors
   on the MPR axial stiffness, including; differential settlement; load
   sharing between the MPs and the raft; and the raft bending moment.
   Moreover, the ability of the PDR method to evaluate the axial stiffness
   of a MPR for the preliminary design stage is examined. It was found that
   the MPR system has the ability to increase the tolerable bearing
   pressure by 190\% compared to an isolated raft system. In addition, an
   adjustment factor (COPR) for PDR method was introduced to account for
   the raft flexibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Background: Posterior glenoid erosion is thought to be initiated by
   humeral head subluxation. However, it is unknown whether subluxation is
   entirely caused by soft-tissue instability and unbalanced muscle
   activity or whether osseous morphology is a contributing factor. We
   hypothesized that patients with posterior erosion may exhibit premorbid
   glenoid morphology that is inherently retroverted and inferiorly
   inclined compared with age-matched normal glenoids.
   Methods: This study examined 80 scapulae, evenly distributed between 2
   groups: osteoarthritic with type B2 glenoids and age-matched normal
   glenoids. From 3-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions,
   version and inclination were measured from the anterior paleoglenoid
   region of the B2 glenoids, which is representative of the premorbid
   glenoid, and compared with measurements obtained from similar regions in
   the normal cohort.
   Results: The anterior paleoglenoid region of B2 glenoids was
   significantly (P < .001) more retroverted (-14 degrees +/- 6 degrees)
   compared with similar regions in nonarthritic normal glenoids (-5
   degrees +/- 5 degrees). There were no significant differences (P = .166)
   in the glenoid inclination angle between type B2 glenoids (0 degrees +/-
   6 degrees) and nonarthritic normal glenoids (2 degrees +/- 5 degrees).
   Negative values represent retroverted and inferiorly inclined glenoids.
   Discussion: Understanding premorbid glenoid morphologic variations may
   provide insight into the pathoanatomy of humeral head subluxation,
   osteoarthritis, and posterior glenoid erosion. The results of this study
   indicate that patients with type B2 osteoarthritic glenoids have
   significantly greater premorbid glenoid retroversion compared with
   nonarthritic normal glenoids, suggesting that this premorbid morphologic
   variation may be one contributing factor to posterior erosion. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Background: The stem lengths of humeral components used in shoulder
   arthroplasty vary; however, the literature on these devices is limited.
   This finite element study investigates the effect of humeral component
   length on stresses in the proximal humerus.
   Methods: Intact and 3 reconstructed (standard length, short, and
   stemless implants) finite element models were created from shoulder
   computed tomography scan data (N = 5). Loading was simulated at varying
   abduction angles (15 degrees, 45 degrees, and 75 degrees). The average
   bone stress (represented as a percentage of intact values) was reported
   at 8 transverse slices. In addition, the overall average change in
   cortical and trabecular bone stresses was quantified.
   Results: Cortical bone stresses in the most proximal slice for the
   standard (58\% +/- 12\%) and short (78\% +/- 10\%) stem models were
   significantly reduced compared with the intact (100\%) and stemless
   (101\% +/- 6\%) models (P =.005). These reductions persisted in the
   second cortical slice for the standard stem compared with the intact,
   stemless, and short models (P = .025). Interestingly, stresses in the
   trabecular bone within these proximal slices were significantly elevated
   when stemless implants were used compared with all other implants (P <
   .001), regardless of abduction angle.
   Conclusion: Reducing stem length produced humeral stresses that more
   closely matched the intact stress distribution in proximal cortical
   bone. Opposing trends presented in the proximal trabecular bone,
   probably because of differences in load transfer when shorter stems are
   used. Accordingly, the results suggest that implant stem length is 1
   variable that can be modified in an attempt to better mimic intact bone
   stresses during humeral component insertion, provided stem fixation is
   adequate. (C) 2016 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{122-137}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Steel moment resisting frames (SMRFs) are widely utilized as a lateral
   load resisting system. Their seismic performance is usually assessed by
   examining the maximum value of inter-storey drift (MID) of all floors.
   The accuracy of such assessment is debatable given the wide spread of
   values of MID at collapse that exist in the literature. In this study, a
   simplified method to define the failure inter-storey drift for each
   floor of a SMRF is proposed. The method was validated with the
   experimental and analytical studies by other researchers. Three- and
   ten-storey SMRFs were considered to further validate the proposed
   method. The effects of the vertical and/or horizontal seismic components
   of five different ground motions on the SMRFs were evaluated using
   incremental dynamic analysis. The proposed method accurately identified
   the severely damaged floors of SMRFs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The interaction of ethyl xanthate collector with precipitated iron and

   compared with copper hydroxide. In an attempt to comprehend the factors
   in favor of the higher interactions between ethyl xanthate and copper
   hydroxides, quantum mechanical simulations using density functional
   theory (DFT) have been carried out. The DFT simulation results confirmed
   that the interaction of ethyl xanthate with solvated copper hydroxides
   was more energetically favorable than with iron hydroxides. The
   simulations also showed that negatively-charged iron hydroxide
   complexes, should they arise at alkaline pH in the electrical double
   layer surrounding iron hydroxide precipitates, bring about no affinity
   vis-a-vis ethyl xanthate collector and quite contrarily, their formation
   and adsorption on the precipitate surface could inhibit the collector
   adsorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur/nitrogen dual-doped graphene aerogels (SNGAs) with a unique
   porous network structure have been designed through a facile and
   versatile one-pot hydrothermal strategy. When employed as anode in LIBs,
   the SNGAs with nitrogen content of 1.50 wt.\% and sulfur content of
   15.11 wt.\% exhibit superior cycle life and rate capability. For
   example, a high reversible capacity of 1109.8 mAh g(-1) can be obtained
   after 400 cycles even at a high current density of 800 mA g(-1). It was
   discreetly demonstrated that the prominent improved performance of SNGAs
   can be mainly ascribed to the effect of dual-doping heteroatoms in
   cooperation with each other in to the graphene lattice as well as the
   porous nanostructure facilitating the mass transfer for both ions and
   electrons. Our conclusions illustrate that the strategy of dual-doped
   graphene aerogel may promote the potential application of graphene for
   high performance lithium ion batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Effects of in-house prepared CoMo catalysts supported on various
   nano-structured materials (activated carbon, {[}y-alumina, HZSM-5,
   MCM-41 and SBA-15) and a commercial catalyst of Ru/C were compared for
   hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of fast pyrolysis oil (P0) in supercritical
   ethanol at 300 and 350 degrees C. All catalysts proved to be effective
   for significantly reducing the molecular weight of the PO by HDO
   treatment at 350 degrees C. Although Ru/C catalyst produced the highest
   oil yield at both temperatures (66.6 wt\% at 300 degrees C and 61.0 wt\%
   at 350 degrees C) with the lowest and negligible coke formation (<1
   wt\%), the catalyst is very expensive and difficult for regeneration, so
   it is not a viable catalyst for bio-oil upgrading on a large scale.
   Among all the supported CoMo catalysts, CoMo/MCM-41 produced the highest
   yield of oil products (light oil (OL) + heavy oil (HO)) of the highest
   H/C molar ratio. With this catalyst, the oil yield attained 61.9 wt\% at
   300 degrees C and 57.8 wt\% at 350 degrees C, and the spent catalyst
   after regeneration produced almost the same oil yields as the fresh one.
   In addition, CoMo catalysts supported on MCM-41 and SBA showed better
   resistance to coke/carbon deposition in the HDO process, compared with
   CoMo catalysts supported on HZSM-5 and Al2O3. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Due to the emergence of numerous bandwidth-hungry applications, we are
   motivated to investigate cheaper and faster Internet access solutions to
   serve in a neighborhood. We concentrate on the convergence of optical
   and wireless networks for the deployment of Internet access networks so
   that we can exploit the opportunities of both technologies. We focus on
   network dimensioning and placement of equipment in hybrid
   optical-wireless access networks. A number of integrated
   optical-wireless architectures have been investigated for the greenfield
   deployment of future access networks. A novel hybrid network
   infrastructure, namely PON-LTE access network, has been proposed where
   fiber will be deployed as deeply as affordable/practical and then,
   wireless systems will be used to extend this connectivity to a large
   number of locations and ultimately connect the wire-less end users. We
   propose a 2-phase network design optimization scheme for greenfield
   deployment of PON-LTE access network infrastructure. In the first phase,
   we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model which optimizes the
   greenfield deployment of LTE network based on the static distribution of
   mobile user equipment (MUE). The proposed model takes into account
   various physical layer constraints of LTE network and determines the
   optimal clustering of MUEs as well as the location of eNBs in a
   neighborhood. In the second phase, we propose another ILP model which
   determines the optimal placement of a number of integrated ONU-EPCs as
   well as a single AWG with respect to the location of the eNBs determined
   during the first phase. Our proposed scheme also facilitates the
   construction of an efficient physical architecture/topology of a hybrid
   PON-LTE access network. Computational experiments have been conducted on
   three different data sets consisting of 128, 256 and 512 mobile user
   equipment in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A black TiO2 nanotube (NT) heterostructure with an anatase-core and an
   amorphous-shell has been synthesized by NH3 annealing of amorphous NT
   grown by the anodization of a Ti substrate. Remarkable photoabsorption
   behavior of these black TiO2 NTs is observed: strong absorption
   throughout the entire optical wavelength region from ultraviolet to
   near-infrared. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
   (RIXS) have been used to elucidate the origin of this spectacular light
   capture phenomenon. Surface-sensitive XANES recorded in total electron
   yield and XPS show that the surface layer is amorphous with a chemical
   composition approaching that of Ti4O7. Bulk-sensitive XANES using X-ray
   partial fluorescence yield and Ti 2p RIXS confirm the presence of a rich
   amount of Ti3+ in the crystalline bulk (core of the NT with anatase
   structure) of black TiO2 NTs, which exhibits a dispersive d-d energy
   loss at similar to 2 eV corresponding to the broad visible light
   absorption at similar to 600 nm. Our results suggest that the
   extraordinary photoabsorption behavior of these black TiO2 NTs is due to
   the stabilization of Ti3+ in this special N-doped core-shell assembly
   having structure varying between TiO2 (bulk anatase) and Ti4O7 (surface,
   amorphous).}},

Abstract = {{We present new H (1.51.8 mu m) photometric and K-1 (1.92.2 mu m)
   spectroscopic observations of the young exoplanet HD 95086 b obtained
   with the Gemini Planet Imager. The Hband magnitude has been
   significantly improved relative to previous measurements, whereas the
   lowresolution K-1 (lambda/delta lambda approximate to 66) spectrum is
   featureless within the measurement uncertainties and presents a
   monotonically increasing pseudocontinuum consistent with a cloudy
   atmosphere. By combining these new measurements with literature L'
   photometry, we compare the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
   planet to other young planetarymass companions, field brown dwarfs, and
   to the predictions of grids of model atmospheres. HD 95086 b is over a
   magnitude redder in K-1 - L' color than 2MASS J120733463932539 b and HR
   8799 c and d, despite having a similar L' magnitude. Considering only
   the near-infrared measurements, HD 95086 b is most analogous to the
   brown dwarfs 2MASS J2244316+204343 and 2MASS J21481633+4003594, both of
   which are thought to have dusty atmospheres. Morphologically, the SED of
   HD 95086 b is best fit by low temperature (T-eff = 8001300 K), low
   surface gravity spectra from models which simulate high photospheric
   dust content. This range of effective temperatures is consistent with
   field L/T transition objects, but the spectral type of HD 95086 b is
   poorly constrained between early L and late T due to its unusual
   position the colormagnitude diagram, demonstrating the difficulty in
   spectral typing young, low surface gravity substellar objects. As one of
   the reddest such objects, HD 95086 b represents an important empirical
   benchmark against which our current understanding of the atmospheric
   properties of young extrasolar planets can be tested.}},

Abstract = {{A simple soluble salt-driven matrix swelling method was developed for
   fast fabrication of a silver nanoparticle-based conductive elastomer.
   Taking advantage of the synergistic effects of silver trifluoroacetate
   and methanol, the swelling capability of an elastomeric block copolymer
   polystyrene-block-polyisoprene-block-polystyrene (SIS) was greatly
   enhanced. The interaction of silver ions and double bonds of the
   copolymer enables fast infiltration of soluble salt into the polymer
   network, resulting in a high-content loading of silver ions, which is a
   prerequisite for fabrication of a highly conductive polymer. In-situ
   reduction was performed under a swollen state to allow the reducer to
   effectively penetrate into the polymer matrix, thoroughly reducing the
   silver salt into silver nanoparticles. A three-layered conductive
   elastomer was obtained, with a high concentration of silver
   nanoparticles formed on both surfaces of SIS copolymer. Typically, the
   conductivity of the reduced SIS elastomer was measured to be >2 x 10(5)
   S/m when epsilon = 0, and can maintain to be over one seventh of its
   initial value even at a 200\% elongation. The conductive elastomer can
   withstand over 1000 stretch-release cycles under a strain of 100\%. A
   radio-frequency antenna was prepared with the conductive elastomer,
   which gives the ability of dimension tuning, to realize high-quality
   frequency-selective radiation at a wide bandwidth of larger than 2.6
   GHz. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{We compared the change of electrical resistance with elongation
   (piezoresistive effect) in thin films made of conductive multiwalled
   carbon nanotubes embedded in eight different elastomers. Two distinct
   forms of piezoresistive effect were observed: (i) in the monotonic (M)
   case, the film resistance always increased with the applied strain; (ii)
   the nonmonotonic (NM) case showed an initial increase in the resistance,
   while with further elongation the resistance began to decrease. By
   varying the amount of nitrile and/or styrene groups in the polymer
   matrix one can alter the piezoresistive effect qualitatively: composites
   with approximate to 25 wt \% or more of nitrile or styrene functional
   side groups exhibited M piezoresistance, while others, with no, or
   methyl side groups only, showed NM piezoresistance. Influence of the
   second filler (either conductive carbon black or nonconductive nanoclay)
   in the ternary composites on the piezoresistive effect was explored. The
   possibility to modify the piezoresistive behavior of the conductive
   elastomer composites, for example, via chemical modification of the
   polymeric matrix, opens up a new venue for practical applications such
   as diverse types of sensors and, in NM case, complex dynamical systems
   (bistable elements, electromechanical oscillators, etc.) in the MEMS
   field. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133,

Title = {{Catalytic Decarboxylation of Fatty Acids to Aviation Fuels over Nickel
   Supported on Activated Carbon}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Decarboxylation of fatty acids over non-noble metal catalysts without
   added hydrogen was studied. Ni/C catalysts were prepared and exhibited
   excellent activity and maintenance for decarboxylation. Thereafter, the
   effects of nickel loading, catalyst loading, temperature, and carbon
   number on the decarboxylation of fatty acids were investigated. The
   results indicate that the products of cracking increased with high
   nickel loading or catalyst loading. Temperature significantly impacted
   the conversion of stearic acid but did not influence the selectivity.

Title = {{State-dependent capital and income breeding: a novel approach to
   evaluating individual strategies with stable isotopes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Species-specific strategies for financing the costs of
   reproduction are well understood, forming a continuum ranging from high
   to low reliance on stored nutrients. Animals relying mostly on stored
   reserves are termed `capital breeders', whereas `income breeders' rely
   mostly on concurrent intake when financing the costs of reproduction.
   The role and adaptive value of individual variation in these strategies
   remain elusive. Life-history theory posits that capital breeding should
   be favoured when offspring reproductive value peaks, typically occurring
   early in the season, and that current income should increasingly be used
   with progressing season. Because resource limitation may hamper flexible
   resource allocation, a corollary prediction is that only good-condition
   individuals may show the expected seasonal shift in resource use. To
   test this prediction, we examined stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta
   N-15) in blood and lipid-free egg yolk of breeding eider females
   (Somateria mollissima) from the Baltic Sea to assess the role of
   individual variation in the use of proteins from local diet vs. stored
   reserves.
   Results: We show for the first time that individuals from a single
   population differ in their utilization of stored reserves and concurrent
   intake to finance the costs of reproduction. Consistent with our
   prediction, heavy females predominantly used stored reserves for
   producing egg yolks early in the season, increasingly relying on local
   feeding with later onset of breeding, whereas light females showed no
   seasonal change in allocation strategy.
   Conclusions: Stable isotope profiling at the individual level is a
   powerful tool for monitoring relative changes in investment strategies
   through time, showing promise as an early warning indicator of
   ecological change in food webs.}},

Abstract = {{Foreshore beach sands and pore water may act as a reservoir and nonpoint
   source of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) to surface waters. This paper
   presents data collected at a fine sand beach on Lake Huron, Canada over
   three field events. The data show that foreshore sand erosion as wave
   height increases results in elevated Escherichia coli concentrations in
   surface water, as well as depletion of E. coli from the foreshore sand
   and pore water. E. coli initially attached to foreshore sand rather than
   initially residing in the pore water was found to be the main
   contributor to elevated surface water concentrations. Surface water E.
   coli concentrations were a function of not only wave height (and
   associated sand erosion) but also the time elapsed since a preceding
   period of high wave intensity. This finding is important for statistical
   regression models used to predict beach advisories. While calculations
   suggest that foreshore sand erosion may be the dominant mechanism for
   releasing E. coli to surface water during intensified wave conditions at
   a fine sand beach, comparative characterization of the E. coli
   distribution at a coarse sand-cobble beach suggests that interstitial
   pore water flow and discharge may be more important for coarser sand
   beaches.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{180-188}},
Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{Despite the increasing importance of air-lift reactors, very little
   published information is available on how the ratio of aerated to
   non-aerated cross-sectional areas (A(d)/A(r)) of the reactor, and the
   aerating system affect the oxygen mass transfer and other performance
   characteristics. The influence of the ratio of cross-sectional areas of
   downcomer to riser (A(d)/A(r)), and the type of gas-distributor on
   volumetric oxygen mass-transfer coefficient, gas holdup, and liquid
   circulation velocity were investigated in a 114 L rectangular air-lift
   reactor with motile baffle, separating aerated from non-aerated
   compartments. The results indicated that the oxygen mass transfer
   characteristics of rectangular air-lift reactor are better at A(d)/A(r)
   of 2.0; the gas holdup and liquid circulation time showed maximum values
   at the same ratio. A new empirical model for the effects of the aeration
   rate and A(d)/A(r) ratio was proposed to account for the observed
   changes of volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient. The model took
   into account the different mixing patterns in the reactor for both
   cases: A(d)/A(r) <= 1 and A(d)/A(r) > 1 using a wide range of these
   ratios. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The small sample size of the annual maximum wind speed at a wind speed
   recording site causes uncertainty in the estimated return period of wind
   speed. The influence of this uncertainty on the estimated return period
   values of annual maximum wind speed and structural reliability is
   quantified in this study. The results show that the effect of
   statistical uncertainty due to limited sample size on the estimated
   return period value of the wind speed and structural reliability is
   largely reduced if the sample size is increased from 10 to 20. The
   implication of the results is discussed in terms of two alternative
   options to specify the factored design wind load: (i) a low return
   period for selecting nominal wind speed combined with a large wind load
   factor and (ii) a high return period for selecting nominal wind speed
   combined with unity wind load factor. It was concluded that option (i)
   is preferred to cope with sample size effect if the design in a region
   with statistically homogeneous wind climate; for code making with
   spatially varying coefficient of variation of annual maximum wind speed,
   the analysis results support the use of option (ii) since it leads to

Title = {{Anatomical pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging segmentation for
   regional structure-function measurements of asthma}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6, 1}},
Pages = {{2911-2926}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Pulmonary magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) and x-ray
   computed-tomography have provided strong evidence of spatially and
   temporally persistent lung structure-function abnormalities in
   asthmatics. This has generated a shift in their understanding of lung
   disease and supports the use of imaging biomarkers as intermediate
   endpoints of asthma severity and control. In particular, pulmonary H-1
   MRI can be used to provide quantitative lung structure-function
   measurements longitudinally and in response to treatment. However, to
   translate such biomarkers of asthma, robust methods are required to
   segment the lung from pulmonary H-1 MRI. Therefore, their objective was
   to develop a pulmonary H-1 MRI segmentation algorithm to provide
   regional measurements with the precision and speed required to support
   clinical studies.
   Methods: The authors developed a method to segment the left and right
   lung from H-1 MRI acquired in 20 asthmatics including five
   well-controlled and 15 severe poorly controlled participants who
   provided written informed consent to a study protocol approved by Health
   Canada. Same-day spirometry and plethysmography measurements of lung
   function and volume were acquired as well as H-1 MRI using a whole-body
   radiofrequency coil and fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence at
   a fixed lung volume (functional residual capacity + 1 l). We
   incorporated the left-to-right lung volume proportion prior based on the
   Potts model and derived a volume-proportion preserved Potts model, which
   was approximated through convex relaxation and further represented by a
   dual volume-proportion preserved max-flow model. The max-flow model led
   to a linear problem with convex and linear equality constraints that
   implicitly encoded the proportion prior. To implement the algorithm, H-1
   MRI was resampled into similar to 3x3x3 mm(3) isotropic voxel space. Two
   observers placed seeds on each lung and on the background of 20
   pulmonary H-1 MR images in a randomized dataset, on five occasions, five
   consecutive days in a row. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated using the
   Dice-similarity-coefficient (DSC) of the segmented thoracic cavity with
   comparison to five-rounds of manual segmentation by an expert observer.
   The authors also evaluated the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of the
   Euclidean distance between lung surfaces, the absolute, and percent
   volume error. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of
   variation (CoV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for two
   observers who repeated segmentation measurements five-times.
   Results: For five well-controlled asthmatics, forced expiratory volume
   in 1 s (FEV1)/forcedvital capacity (FVC) was 83\% +/- 7\% and FEV1 was
   86 +/- 9\% pred. For 15 severe, poorly controlled asthmatics, FEV1/FVC =
   66\% +/- 17\% and FEV1 = 72 +/- 27\% pred. The DSC for algorithm and
   manual segmentation was 91\% +/- 3\%, 92\% +/- 2\% and 91\% +/- 2\% for
   the left, right, and whole lung, respectively. RMSE was 4.0 +/- 1.0 mm
   for each of the left, right, and whole lung. The absolute (percent)
   volume errors were 0.1 l (similar to 6\%) for each of right and left
   lung and similar to 0.2 l (similar to 6\%) for whole lung. Intra- and
   inter-CoV (ICC) were <0.5\% (>0.91\%) for DSC and <4.5\% (>0.93\%) for
   RMSE. While segmentation required 10 s including +/- 6 s for user
   interaction, the smallest detectable difference was 0.24 l for algorithm
   measurements which was similar to manual measurements.
   Conclusions: This lung segmentation approach provided the necessary and
   sufficient precision and accuracy required for research and clinical
   studies. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicin}},

Title = {{Oklahoma tornado risk and variability: A statistical model}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{19-32}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study uses an existing catalog of registered tornadoes over the
   territory of the United States to construct a numerical model for
   tornado loss assessment. The model is tested for the state of Oklahoma
   (OK). The aggregated annual (AGG) tornado losses are modelled as a
   function of (1) annual frequency of tornadoes, (2) intensity, length and
   width of tornado tracks, (3) exposure and (4) vulnerability derived
   using literature information. Three different configurations of input
   parameters are investigated: (NoVar) all input parameters except for the
   annual number of tornadoes are derived based on their mean values, (HOV)
   variability of house prices, track orientation and vulnerability values
   are included, and (HOVI) variability of tornado intensity along track
   length and width is introduced. The calculated AGG losses from
   independent model runs show high level of convergence for 1000 years of
   simulated tornadoes. The largest differences in the exceedance
   probability loss curves result from introducing variability in intensity
   along the tornado tracks (HOVI). We ran proxies for calculating
   Risk-Based Capital in order to understand the impact of these findings
   for policy makers and/or the insurance industry. Modelled losses are
   compared against results from a commercial tornado risk assessment model
   as well as against the 2013 Moore tornado event. The NoVar and HOV cases
   predict the 2013 Moore twister to be 1 in 10 and 1 in 12.5 loss event,
   respectively, whereas the HOVI case estimates the return period of this
   event at 58 years. Probability of being hit by a tornado in OK is
   calculated to be 0.039\%, which is in accordance with literature. The
   limitations and uncertainties of developed model are also discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{While the open nature of radio propagation enables convenient
   ``anywhere{''} wireless access, it becomes the root of security
   vulnerabilities in wireless communications. In light of this,
   physical-layer authentication, which is based on exploitation of the
   dynamics of physical layer attributes, is emerging as an effective
   approach to enhancing wireless security. In this article, we first
   review the existing physical-layer authentication techniques and
   identify their current limitations, ranging from low authentication
   reliability to the difficulties of integrating these techniques with the
   existing wireless infrastructure and applying them in complex future
   networks. We then present three promising research areas in addressing
   these challenges. Specifically, we propose the use of the
   multi-attribute multi-observation technique for enhancing the
   authentication reliability. In order to apply point-to-point
   physical-layer authentication techniques into existing wireless
   networks, we propose a cross-layer authentication approach relying on a
   composite security key that can seamlessly integrate physical-layer and
   upper-layer authentication schemes. We also discuss possible ways of
   invoking physical-layer authentication to reduce both the complexity and
   latency of the security processes in complex heterogeneous networks with
   the aid of the proposed physical security context sharing.}},

   Membrane}},
Journal = {{MEMBRANES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{An oscillatory emulsification system for the production of oil in water
   emulsions using a commercially available low-cost woven metal
   microscreen (WMMS) is investigated. The system allows for independent
   control of both the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes such that it
   provides two degrees of freedom for controlling the emulsion properties.
   The investigations included the production of both surfactant and
   particle-stabilized emulsions. The average droplet size was found to
   decrease when both the oscillation frequency and amplitude was
   increased. For surfactant-stabilized emulsions, using bi-surfactants in
   both the continuous and dispersed phases resulted in a smaller droplet
   size due to lower interfacial tension. For particle-stabilized
   emulsions, both the hydrodynamics of the system and the hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic nature of the stabilizing particles influenced the
   interfacial properties at the oil-water interface, which in turn
   affected the final droplet size and distribution with potential droplet
   breakage. In absence of the latter, a simple torque balance model can be
   used to reasonably predict the average emulsion droplet size.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate representation of myocardial infarct geometry is crucial to
   patient-specific computational modeling of the heart in ischemic
   cardiomyopathy. We have developed a methodology for segmentation of left
   ventricular (LV) infarct from clinically acquired, two-dimensional (2D),
   late-gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) images,
   for personalized modeling of ventricular electrophysiology. The infarct
   segmentation was expressed as a continuous min-cut optimization problem,
   which was solved using its dual formulation, the continuous max-flow
   (CMF). The optimization objective comprised of a smoothness term, and a
   data term that quantified the similarity between image intensity
   histograms of segmented regions and those of a set of training images. A
   manual segmentation of the LV myocardium was used to initialize and
   constrain the developed method. The three-dimensional geometry of
   infarct was reconstructed from its segmentation using an implicit,
   shape-based interpolation method. The proposed methodology was
   extensively evaluated using metrics based on geometry, and outcomes of
   individualized electrophysiological simulations of cardiac
   dys(function). Several existing LV infarct segmentation approaches were
   implemented, and compared with the proposed method. Our results
   demonstrated that the CMF method was more accurate than the existing
   approaches in reproducing expert manual LV infarct segmentations, and in
   electrophysiological simulations. The infarct segmentation method we
   have developed and comprehensively evaluated in this study constitutes
   an important step in advancing clinical applications of personalized
   simulations of cardiac electrophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of the difficulties related to obtaining undisturbed samples
   of cohesionless soils, CPT-based empirical correlations, often developed
   from calibration chamber experiments, are widely used for determining
   many soil parameters for geotechnical investigation. This paper
   describes the application of 19 reduced-scale calibration chamber cone
   penetration tests to evaluate empirical correlations for predicting the
   relative density, the unit weight, the constrained modulus, and the soil
   identification of loose to medium-dense sands. A subtraction cone, 6 mm
   in diameter with an apex angle of 60 degrees and a net area ratio of
   0.75, is used in the laboratory tests. Due to the fine gradation of the
   quartz sand used in the experiments, some of the CPT results are located
   within the silty sand range of the soil identification charts. An
   extensive evaluation is also presented for the stress normalization
   process of the CPT data. It is determined that a relative density-based
   overburden stress normalization method provided the best estimates for
   correcting the cone tip resistance for effective overburden stress. (C)

   Light in Presence of a TiO2-Polymeric Film Photocatalyst}},
Journal = {{PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Application of titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a photocatalyst has presented
   a promising avenue for the safe photocatalytic degradation of
   pollutants. Increasing levels of the release of pharmaceuticals in the
   environment and formation of the intermediates during their degradation
   may impose health and environmental risks and therefore require more
   attention. Photocatalytic degradation of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)
   was carried out in the presence of the TiO2-filled polymeric film as a
   photocatalyst under solar light irradiation. The polymeric film
   incorporates TiO2 in the matrix, which acts as a photocatalyst under
   solar illumination and degrades the acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) into a
   range of organic compounds before complete demineralization (formation
   of carbon dioxide and water as final products). Among the intermediates,
   acetic acid was found to be present in a larger amount compared to other
   organic acids. The qualitative/quantitative analyses of the
   intermediates resulted in the determination of the most probable
   reaction's mechanism in the degradation process. The mechanism of
   degradation of acetylsalicylic acid and its reaction pathway were
   developed from liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), Fourier
   Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and UV spectrophotometric analysis. It was
   found that hydroxyl groups were dominant in the degradation process
   compared to electrons and holes generated by TiO2. The total organic
   carbon (TOC) analysis was also carried out to analyze the organic carbon
   content of the intermediates formed during the course of degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Layered ejecta craters on Mars have been interpreted to indicate the
   presence of volatiles in the substrate, making them important targets
   for the investigation of sites of astrobiological significance. If the
   ejecta are associated with the presence of water in the substratum,
   specific surface grain size trends are expected. In this study we
   explore the distribution of grain sizes in the layered ejecta of impact
   craters located in Chryse Planitia, using Thermal Emission Imaging
   System (THEMIS) thermal infrared data. Ejecta grain size trends, in
   conjunction with ejecta mobility and lobateness values, are applied to
   assess the degree of surface flow of the ejecta, and in turn to
   constrain the plausible volatile abundance, cohesion, and fine particle
   content of the target materials. Craters with a larger fraction of small
   grain sizes in their ejecta showed greater ejecta mobility and
   lobateness, consistent with a water-rich and/or a low-cohesion target.
   Craters displaying decreasing grain size with increasing radius had
   smaller diameters and lower ejecta mobility and lobateness, indicating
   only a minimal component of surface ejecta flow. Ejecta grain size
   trends varied with crater diameter, from which the presence of vertical
   compositional stratigraphy in Chryse Planitia is inferred and
   interpreted. Our observations are synthesized into a number of plausible
   geologic scenarios for Chryse Planitia.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model for the dip coating process has been developed for

   explores the effects of the substrate radius and hydrodynamic behavior

   fiber optics and used as a matrix to suspend 1 vol. \% titanium dioxide
   particles. The coating substrate is a 100 mu m diameter fiber optic
   diffuser. Ellis viscosity model is applied as a non-Newtonian viscous
   model for coating thickness prediction, including the influence of
   viscosity in low shear rates that occurs near the surface of the
   withdrawal film. In addition, the results of the Newtonian and power law
   models are compared with the Ellis model outcomes. The rheological
   properties and surface tension of fluids were analyzed and applied in
   the models and a good agreement between experimental and analytical

   to preprocess the channel variations. More specifically, two one-bit
   quantizers are used to quantize the temporal channel variations in the
   dimensions of channel amplitude and path delay, respectively. Under a
   simple hypothesis testing, a new test statistic is developed based on
   the sum of outputs of the two quantizers. For performance analysis,
   false alarm rate (FAR) and probability of detection (PD) are defined
   based on the developed test statistic, and their closed-form expressions
   are derived as well. An optimization problem is defined for finding
   optimal parameters of the proposed scheme based on exhaustive search
   method. Monte Carlo simulations are utilized to evaluate the performance
   of the proposed scheme. Compared with other existing method in the
   literature, the proposed scheme outperforms significantly in spoofing
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nanosheet-layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized
   by hydrolyzing urea and used for adsorption of tetracycline antibiotic
   from an aqueous solution. The prepared adsorbent was characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS),
   and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. XRD pattern analyses
   confirmed that the prepared adsorbent had a typical LDH nanostructure.
   The sorption rate was significantly affected by the solution pH, and
   higher removal efficiency was observed at pH 3. Under optimal condition,
   about 82\% of tetracycline was removed. UV/VIS spectrum studies
   demonstrated that nitrate, carbonate, sulfate, and fluoride did not
   interact with the molecular structure of tetracycline. However, the
   results showed that all the foreign anions decreased the tetracycline
   removal efficiency by 7-30\%. Four kinetic models were studied and best
   fitted onto experimental data with higher correlation coefficient for
   pseudo second-order model. In addition, results of the equilibrium study
   demonstrated that the removal of tetracycline followed the Freundlich
   isotherm model and the maximum sorption capacity was found to be 98.04

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete conical tanks are used in municipalities and
   industrial applications as liquid containing vessels. These tanks can be
   ground supported tanks or elevated on a supporting shaft. Although most
   design codes provide guidelines for rectangular and cylindrical tanks,
   no guidance is provided in these codes for conical tanks. This study
   focuses on assessing the accuracy of a design approach based on the
   provisions of Portland Cement Association Circular Concrete Tanks
   without Pre-stressing code for cylindrical tanks combined with an
   equivalent cylinder approach provided by the American Water Works
   Association-D100. Several reinforced concrete conical tanks with
   different geometric configurations are analyzed under the effect of
   hydrostatic loading using this approach. The internal forces obtained
   according to code provisions are compared with those predicted by a
   linear finite element analysis model developed for all studied tanks.
   The finite element analysis model is based on a degenerated consistent
   sub-parametric triangular shell element developed in-house. The results
   of this comparison show that Portland Cement Association Circular
   Concrete Tanks without Pre-stressing approach leads to larger hoop
   tension and smaller meridional moment compared to those obtained from
   the finite element analysis. Therefore, the Portland Cement Association
   Circular Concrete Tanks without Pre-stressing provisions combined with
   the equivalent cylinder approach lead to an inadequate design if applied
   to conical-shaped tanks.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and variability has the potential to impact crop growth
   by altering components of a region's water balance. Evapotranspiration
   driven by higher temperatures can directly increase the demand of
   irrigation water, while indirectly decreasing the length of the annual
   crop growth period. The accompanying change in precipitation also
   affects the need to supply irrigation water. This study focuses on the
   spatial and temporal variation of historical and future irrigation water
   requirements of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Haihe River
   Basin, China. Irrigation water requirement is estimated using a simple
   water balance model. Climate change is incorporated by using predicted
   changes in daily precipitation and temperature. Changes in
   evapotranspiration and crop phenophase are then calculated for
   historical and future climate. Over the past 50 years, a decrease in
   total net irrigation water requirement (NIR) was observed mainly due to
   a reduction in the crop growth period length. The NIR is shown to
   decrease 2.8 similar to 6.9 mm with a 1-day reduction in growth period
   length. In the future, sowing period will come later and the heading
   period earlier in the year. The NIR in November, March and April is
   predicted to increase, especially in April. Increased NIR can result in
   increased water deficit, causing negative impacts on crop yield due to
   water stress. In the future, more attention should be paid to water
   resource management during the annual crop growth period of winter wheat
   in the Haihe River Basin.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of the current work were: (1) to study the influence of variety
   and geographical production area on the total phenolic content, total
   anthocyanin content, total flavonoid content, total carotenoid content
   and antioxidant activity in bean varieties (Dimeta, Napirira and
   Nanyati) from different growing areas in central Malawi, and (2) to
   evaluate the possibility of establishing a classification based on the
   geographical areas of the growing regions. A total of 47 bean samples
   were collected from Makowe, Mphathi, Chuma-Chitsala and Khulungira Zone.
   These four locations were segregated based on altitude, latitude and
   longitude. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis were
   used to distinguish and classify among these samples. Significant
   differences (P < 0.05) in total phenolic content (2.92-4.97 mg/g), total
   anthocyanin content (14.52-152.31 mu g/g), total flavonoid content
   (2.01-6.38 mg/g) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (16.75-24.51 mu
   mol/g) were found among the different sampled villages, showing a
   significant effect of the producing region on these parameters. The
   beans in Makowe had lower polyphenols than in other locations. Results
   of principal component analysis indicate that phytochemicals and
   antioxidant capacity could serve as parameters to establish a bean
   classification according to the geographical area of production.}},

Abstract = {{Many image-guided interventions rely on tracked ultrasound where the
   transducer is augmented with a tracking device. The relationship between
   the ultrasound image coordinate system and the tracking sensor must be
   determined accurately via probe calibration. We introduce a novel
   calibration framework guided by the prediction of target registration
   error (TRE): Between successive measurements of the calibration phantom,
   our framework guides the user in choosing the pose of the calibration
   phantom by optimizing TRE.
   We introduced an oriented line calibration phantom and modeled the
   ultrasound calibration process as a point-to-line registration problem.
   We then derived a spatial stiffness model of point-to-line registration
   for estimating TRE magnitude at any target. Assuming isotropic,
   identical localization error, we used the model to estimate TRE for each
   pixel using the current calibration estimate. We then searched through
   the calibration tool space to find the pose for the next fiducial which
   maximally minimized TRE.
   Both simulation and experimental results suggested that TRE decreases
   monotonically, reaching an asymptote when a sufficient number of
   measurements (typically around 12) are made. Independent point
   reconstruction accuracy assessment showed sub-millimeter accuracy of the
   calibration framework.
   We have introduced the first TRE-guided ultrasound calibration
   framework. Using a hollow straw as an oriented line phantom, we
   virtually constructed a rigid lines phantom and modeled the calibration
   process as a point-to-line registration. Highly accurate calibration was
   achieved with minimal measurements by using a spatial stiffness model of
   TRE to strategically choose the pose of the calibration phantom between
   successive measurements.}},

Title = {{Lactobacilli require physical contact to reduce staphylococcal TSST-1
   secretion and vaginal epithelial inflammatory response}},
Journal = {{PATHOGENS AND DISEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Staphylococcus aureus biofilms can be found on vaginal epithelia,
   secreting toxins and causing inflammation. The co-vaginal species
   Lactobacillus can alter staphylococcal-induced epithelial secretion of
   inflammatory cytokines and quench staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome
   toxin-1 secretion. It is hypothesized that these effects of lactobacilli
   require direct physical contact between lactobacilli, staphylococci and
   the epithelium. Indeed, lactobacilli only reduced S. aureus-induced
   inflammatory cytokine expression when allowed physical contact with
   vaginal epithelial cells. Furthermore, a reduction in toxic shock
   syndrome toxin-1 secretion only occurred when a probiotic Lactobacillus
   strain was allowed contact, but not when being physically separated from
   S. aureus. Bacterial-probe atomic force microscopy demonstrated that
   lactobacilli and staphylococci strongly adhere to epithelial cells,
   while lactobacilli adhere stronger to staphylococci than staphylococci
   to each other, giving lactobacilli opportunity to penetrate and reside
   in staphylococcal biofilms, as visualized using confocal laser scanning
   microscopy with fluorescence in situ hybridization probes. These results
   identify that physical contact and biochemical signaling by lactobacilli
   are intrinsically linked mechanisms that reduce virulence of S. aureus
   biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by
   arterial hypoxemia accompanied by severe inflammation and alterations to
   the pulmonary surfactant system. Published data has demonstrated a
   protective effect of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) deficiency
   against the inflammatory response associated with ARDS; however, the
   effect of Mmp3 on physiologic parameters and alterations to surfactant
   have not been previously studied. It was hypothesized that Mmp3
   deficient (Mmp3(-/-)) mice would be protected against lung dysfunction
   associated with ARDS and maintain a functional pulmonary surfactant
   system. Wild type (WT) and Mmp3(-/-) mice were subjected to
   acid-aspiration followed by mechanical ventilation. Mmp3(-/-) mice
   maintained higher arterial oxygenation compared with WT mice at the
   completion of ventilation. Significant increase in functional large
   aggregate surfactant forms were observed in Mmp3(-/-) mice compared with
   WT mice. These findings further support a role of Mmp3 as an attractive
   therapeutic target for drug development in the setting of ARDS.}},

Abstract = {{The Serial-out bit-level multiplication scheme is characterized by an
   important latency feature. It has an ability to sequentially generate an
   output bit of the multiplication result in each clock cycle. However,
   the computational complexity of the existing serial-out bit-level
   multipliers in GF(2(m)) using normal basis representation, limits its
   usefulness in many applications; hence, an optimized serial-out
   bit-level multiplier using polynomial basis representation is needed. In
   this paper, we propose new serial-out bit-level Mastrovito multiplier
   schemes. We show that in terms of the time complexities, the proposed
   multiplier schemes outperform the existing serial-out bit-level schemes
   available in the literature. In addition, using the proposed multiplier
   schemes, we present new hybrid-double multiplication architectures. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a hybrid
   multiplier structure using the polynomial basis is proposed. Prototypes
   of the presented serial-out bit-level schemes and the proposed
   hybrid-double multiplication architectures (10 schemes in total) are
   implemented over both GF(2(163)) and GF(2(233)), and experimental
   results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal convection is examined theoretically for fluids possessing
   significant thermal relaxation time, characterizing the response of the
   heat flux and the temperature gradient to changes in one another.
   Fourier's law breaks down for such fluids. Non-Fourier heat transport
   occurs in a wide range of applications, including superfluid helium,
   fluids subjected to rapid heating, and strongly confined fluids. The
   parallels between non-Fourier fluids and viscoelastic polymeric
   solutions are established. For viscoelastic fluids, the constitutive
   equation for stress must be frame invariant, a condition that must also
   hold for the constitutive equation for heat flux. The stability of
   conduction state is first reviewed, and the convection state is obtained
   using a low-order dynamical system approach. The stability of steady
   convection is analysed, and the Nusselt number is obtained as function
   of the Rayleigh and Cattaneo numbers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

   nano/microsphere achieving brilliant lithium storage performance}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It has remained a challenge to develop a facile and scalable approach to
   synthesize high-energy lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrode materials
   with excellent rate capabilities and prominent cycling stabilities for
   their applications in new generation energy storage devices. In this
   study, for the first time, we report a crumpled reduced graphene oxide
   (cG) encapsulated three-dimensional (3D) hollow vanadium pentoxide
   (V2O5) nano/microspheres fabricated by one-step solvothermal treatment
   followed by subsequent annealing. This rapid and effective synthesis
   method is environmental friendly and economically beneficial without
   involving costly organic vanadium sources, tedious operation, or
   sophisticated equipment. Remarkably, the desired cG-encapsulated V2O5
   composite contains 5 wt\% reduced graphene oxide (rGO), yet exhibits
   outstanding rate capacities and cycling stabilities. This product can
   deliver reversible capacities of 289 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and 163
   mA h g(-1) at 5000 mA g(-1) (492 W h kg(-1) and 9840 W kg(-1)), as well
   as a capacity retention of about 94\% after 200 cycles at 2000 mA g(-1)
   in the potential range between 2.0 V and 4.0 V (vs. Li/Li+).
   Furthermore, the unique structural feature and typical formation
   mechanism of the designed materials are clarified based on multiple
   experimental results. More commendably, a chain of solid powders had
   been successfully encapsulated using this scalable reaction system. It
   is expected that this versatile approach will facilitate the
   applications of cG, and provide a novel avenue to create more
   fascinating rGO-based functional materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY \& BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Economic realities for the rising industrial biofuel production have
   changed substantially during the low oil price period starting in the
   mid 2010's. Increased competition requires the sector to increase
   productivity through the reduction of low-value by-products and full
   utilization of all value and energy stored in their respective
   feedstock. Biodiesel is produced commercially from substrates such as
   animal fat and vegetable oil, generating approximately 10 wt\% crude
   glycerol as its main, currently underutilized, by-product. This crude
   glycerol is contaminated with catalyst, soap, free fatty acids,
   glycerides and methyl esters; hence only a small fraction enters the
   existing glycerol markets, while the purification costs for the majority
   of crude glycerol are simply too high. However, this presents a unique
   opportunity to generate additional value. One technical possibility is
   to use crude glycerol as a carbon source for butanol production, a
   compound of higher value and energy, a potential additive for gasoline
   and diesel fuels and bulk chemical commodity. Conversion facilities
   could be co-located with biodiesel plants, utilizing established
   infrastructure and adding significant value and productivity to the
   existing biodiesel industry. This review focuses on the current
   activities geared towards the bioconversion of crude glycerol to
   butanol.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports phenol degradation using several TiO2 photocatalysts
   (DP25, Anatase 1, Hombikat UV-100, Anatase 2) in a Photo-CREC Water-II
   Reactor. The physicochemical properties of the photocatalysts used, such
   as crystallinity, superficial area, and pore size distribution are
   reported. Reactor efficiencies are calculated using both Quantum Yields
   (QYs) and Photochemical and Thermodynamic Efficiency Factors (PTEFs).
   This is accomplished using phenol and phenol intermediate
   photoconversion rates. This allows the determination of hydroxyl radical
   consumption rates, at every step of the photodegradation process. With
   these data, and with the absorbed photon rates, energy efficiencies are
   calculated. It is shown that for the best performing photo catalysts the
   maximum QYs reach 50\% levels. These favourable photoconversion
   efficiencies confirm the critical importance of having available highly
   performing photocatalysts and photoreactors, such is the case of
   Photo-CREC Water-II Reactor unit.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides theoretical support to a recent promising ZSM5
   catalyst used for the selective desulfurization of light diesel type
   compounds (Al-Bogami and de Lasa 2013; Al-Bogami, Moreira, and de Lasa
   2013). With this end, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations employing a
   rigid silicalite structure are developed to calculate self-diffusivities
   of n-Dodecane (n-C12) and Benzothiophene (BZT) in a silicalite
   structure. The simulations are performed at 573 K, 623 K, 673 K and 723
   K at a fixed loading of 1 molecule per unit cell to study the
   temperature effect on diffusivity coefficient. In addition, a number of
   simulations which are developed to investigate four molecule loadings
   (corresponding to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 molecule per zeolite unit cell)
   at 723 K. MD simulations, show a self diffusivity of BZT one order of
   magnitude higher than that of n-C12 self diffusivity at all temperatures
   investigated. This is the case in spite of BZT having a critical
   molecular diameter of 6 angstrom when compared to the 4.9 angstrom
   diameter of-C12. In addition, the self diffusivity coefficient is found
   to increase with temperature for both n-C12 and BZT. Furthermore, the
   results obtained show that the self diffusivity of n-C12 decreases as
   the number of n-C12 molecules per zeolite unit cell increases. On the
   other hand, it is observed that the self-diffusivity coefficient for BZT
   remains fairly constant and drops at a loading of 1 molecule per zeolite
   unit cell only. These coefficients show that differences in n-C12 and
   benzothiophene diffusivities favours desulfurization with selective
   benzothiophene adsorption and sulfur species removal as coke (Al-Bogami
   and de Lasa 2013).}},

Abstract = {{A probabilistic model for simulating tropical cyclone (TC) track from
   the genesis to lysis is developed based on historical best-track dataset
   for western North Pacific basin. The spatially varying model
   coefficients are determined through regression analysis. Tracks are
   simulated using the developed probabilistic model; statistics of the key
   parameters defining the TC track: the translation velocity, storm
   heading and, relative intensity that is a function of central pressure
   difference, are estimated at sites along the coastline using the
   simulated tracks. The statistics of the key parameters are compared with
   those estimated using historical tracks, indicating the adequacy of the
   developed empirical track model. The developed track model together with
   a well-established planetary boundary layer wind field model are
   subsequently used to assess the TC or typhoon wind hazard, in terms of
   the return period value of the annual maximum TC wind speed, for coastal
   region of the mainland China. The estimated wind hazard at selected
   sites is compared to that based on the circular sub-regional method.
   Comparison is also extended to the values recommended in Chinese design
   code at many sites, and the results from the surface wind observations
   at four sites. It is shown that the estimated typhoon wind hazard is
   consistent with that derived based on surface wind observations, and the
   mapped typhoon wind hazard near the coastal line is in good agreement
   with that presented in current design code.}},

Abstract = {{The progression of a cell population where each individual is
   characterized by the value of an internal variable varying with time
   (e.g. size, mass, and protein concentration) is typically modelled by a
   population balance equation, a first-order linear hyperbolic partial
   differential equation. The characteristics described by internal
   variables usually vary monotonically with the passage of time. A
   particular difficulty appears when the characteristic curves exhibit
   different slopes from each other and therefore cross each other at
   certain times. In particular, such a crossing phenomenon occurs during
   T-cell immune response when the concentrations of protein expressions
   depend upon each other and also when some global protein (e.g.
   Interleukin signals) that is shared by all T-cells is involved. At these
   crossing points, the linear advection equation is not possible by using
   the hyperbolic conservation laws in a classical way. Therefore, a new
   transport method is introduced in this article that is able to find the
   population density function for such processes. A multi-scale
   mathematical modelling framework is employed. At the first scale, two
   processes, the activation and reaction terms (assimilated as nucleation
   and growth in particulate processes), are studied as independent
   processes. At the second scale, the dynamic variation in the population
   density of activated T-cells is investigated in the presence of
   activation and reaction terms. The newly-developed transport method is
   shown to work in the case of crossing characteristics and to provide a
   smooth solution at the crossing points in contrast to the classical
   numerical techniques.}},

Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Flowable dental composites are used as restorative materials
   due to their excellent esthetics and rheology. However, they suffer from
   inferior mechanical properties compared to conventional composites. The
   aim of this study was to reinforce a flowable dental composite with TiO2
   nanotubes (n-TiO2) and to assess the effect of n-TiO2 surface
   modifications on the mechanical properties of the reinforced composite.
   Methods. n-TiO2 were synthesized using an alkaline hydrothermal process
   and then functionalized with silane or methacrylic acid (MA). sNanotubes
   were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy,
   X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy. Commercially available flowable
   composite (Filtek (TM) Supreme Ultra Flowable Restorative, 3M ESPE) was
   reinforced with varying amounts of nanotubes (0-5 wt\%). Flowability of
   the resulting composites was evaluated using a Gillmore needle method.
   Dynamic Young's modulus (E) was measured using an ultrasonic technique.
   Fracture toughness (K-IC) was assessed using a notchless triangular
   prism and radiopacity was quantified. Viability of NIH/3T3 fibroblasts
   was evaluated following incubation on composite specimens for 24 h.
   Results. Electron microscopy revealed a tubular morphology of n-TiO2.
   All reinforced composites exhibited significantly greater values of E
   than unreinforced composite. Composites reinforced with 3 wt\% n-TiO2
   functionalized with MA exhibited the greatest values of E and K-Ic.
   Cytotoxicity assays revealed that reinforced composites were
   biocompatible. Taken together, flowable composites reinforced with
   n-TiO2 exhibited mechanical properties superior to those of unreinforced
   composite, with minimal effects on flowability and radiopacity.
   Significance. n-TiO2-reinforced flowable composites are promising
   materials for use in dental restorations. (C) 2016 Academy of Dental

Abstract = {{Aerodynamic loads on, and wind flow field around, an array of ground
   mounted solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, immersed in the atmospheric
   boundary layer (ABL) for open country exposure, are investigated using
   the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. A full
   scale three-dimensional (3D) solver from OpenFOAM (R) (ESI Group) is
   employed with the Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-omega turbulence
   closure. Several azimuthal wind directions (South, 0 degrees; Southwest,
   45 degrees; Northwest, 135 degrees and North, 180 degrees), for a
   Reynolds number of 3 x 10(6), are considered. The numerical modeling
   approach is validated by comparing the velocity field surrounding a
   ground mounted stand-alone solar panel with wind tunnel experiments.
   Detail analysis of wind loading on the array is provided in relation to
   the wind flow field surrounding the array. The results for the array
   configuration show that all the trailing rows are in the complete wake
   of the leading row for straight winds (0 degrees and 180 degrees), but
   not for oblique winds (45 degrees and 135 degrees). For all four wind
   directions studied here, the first windward row experiences the maximum
   wind loads in terms of drag and lift In terms of the maximum overturning
   moment, the 45 and 135 wind directions are critical with similar
   overturning moment coefficients for each row. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{To enhance the removal of model naphthenic acids (NA) from synthetic
   wastewater and removal of organics in oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW) by adsorption, surfaces of commercial charcoal derived activated
   carbon (AC) and proprietary petroleum coke-derived activated carbon
   (PAC) were modified. Two different amination processes including a
   single stage treatment with ammonia gas at an elevated temperature and a
   two-step treatment of nitration followed by reduction were adopted. All
   adsorbents showed excellent capacity for the model NAs and OSPW at low
   pH (<= 4.0). Ammonia treatment was more effective on improvement of
   adsorption capacity than the nitration followed by reduction method. The
   effect was more significant for commercial activated carbon compared to
   PAC, especially for multi-component adsorption at pH 8.0. The kinetics
   of adsorption improved significantly by the surface modification methods
   indicating great potential for these adsorbents in continuous column
   operation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Catalytic steam gasification of biomass surrogates: Thermodynamics and
   effect of operating conditions}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{232-242}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Thermodynamic chemical equilibrium of biomass steam gasification is
   considered using both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric analyses.
   These thermodynamic analyses include gaseous products, tars and coke, as
   well as consider a wide range of operating conditions. It is shown that
   both stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric approaches provide close
   results. Catalytic steam gasification of biomass surrogate species
   (glucose and 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) is developed in a CREC Riser
   Simulator under the expected conditions of a circulating fluidized bed
   gasifier. A highly active and stable fluidizable Ni/La2O3-gamma-Al2O3
   catalyst is employed in this study, to investigate the effects of
   gasifier operating conditions. This catalyst yields 98\% carbon
   conversion of glucose to permanent gases with no tar formation and
   negligible coke deposition at 700 degrees C. Catalytic gasification
   results with the variation of temperature and steam/biomass ratio show
   limited deviation from equilibrium predictions. The deviation between
   experimental results and equilibrium predictions can be attributed to
   the relatively shorter reaction time (20 s). As the reaction time is
   increased, experimental results approach chemical equilibrium. For
   2-methoxy-4-methylphenol gasification, 90\% carbon conversion is
   obtained with only 5.7 wt\% tar formation and 3.3 wt\% coke deposition.
   Again chemical equilibrium predictions are close. The only exceptions
   are: (a) coke and methane being overestimated and (b) tars being
   underestimated. Regarding synthesis gas from glucose and
   2-methoxy-4-methylphenol gasification, the Ni/La2O3-gamma-Al2O3 catalyst
   yields a H-2/CO ratio greater than 2.0. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Adaptive Control of a Hysteretic Magnetorheological Robot Actuator}},
Journal = {{IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1336-1344}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new adaptive control scheme is proposed to compensate
   for the magnetic hysteresis in magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based
   actuators. MR actuators offer high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia
   ratios. Input and output shafts are mechanically decoupled in MR
   actuators, providing lower inertia compared to the same power geared
   motors. Additionally, geared motors typically add significant noises on
   the torque/force measurements. Noises on the torques/forces can be
   attenuated in MR actuators due to fluidic connections between the input
   and output shafts, facilitating high fidelity torque/force control.
   Despite these unique characteristics, magnetic circuits within MR
   actuators create hysteresis between the input current and output torque
   that negatively affects the quality of torque/force control and the
   repeatability of MR actuators. A hysteresis compensation scheme is
   essential to gain repeatable and high-quality actuation. To this end, we
   propose an adaptive control method that estimates both hysteresis and
   uncertain parameters of the magnetic circuit and cancels nonlinearities
   based on feedback linearization technique. A set of experiments is
   performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the
   results are compared to a proportional-integral-derivative controller.}},

Abstract = {{Steel conical tanks are widely used for liquid storage around the world
   and especially in North America. A number of those tanks collapsed in
   the last decades at different places as a result of instability of the
   steel shells. Despite being widely used, no specific design procedure is
   available for conical tanks under dynamic conditions. Most of the
   previous studies related to steel conical tanks focused on calculating
   the acting forces due to a seismic event. This study however, focuses on
   evaluating the capacity of conical tanks under hydrodynamic pressure
   resulting from horizontal ground excitation using non-linear static
   pushover analysis. The capacity is then compared to the seismic demand
   obtained using a previously developed mechanical model found in the
   literature for different seismic zones. This paper is a part of a larger
   study aiming to provide a simplified design procedure for steel conical
   tanks when subjected to earthquakes. The study is conducted numerically
   using a non-linear finite element model that accounts for the effects of
   large deformations and geometric imperfections on the stability of steel
   conical tanks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{199-210}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Liquid tanks in the form of truncated cones are commonly used for liquid
   storage in North America and in other locations. This paper is a part of
   an extensive research program aimed to develop a comprehensive design
   procedure for liquid-filled steel conical tanks under seismic loading.
   Because of the inclination of the walls of conical tanks, the vertical
   component of the ground motion excitation has a significant effect on
   conical tanks compared to the case of cylindrical tanks. To the best of
   the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to focus on the
   assessment of the capacity of steel conical tanks under the vertical
   component of a seismic excitation. The study is carried out numerically
   using an in-house finite element model by conducting nonlinear static
   pushover analysis under a load distribution simulating hydrodynamic
   pressure associated with vertical ground excitations. The numerical
   model accounts for the effects of geometric and material nonlinearities
   as well as initial geometric imperfections. Charts are developed to
   estimate the capacity of steel conical tanks to resist vertical ground
   excitations based on yielding and buckling criteria for different
   imperfection levels. The developed charts are used to estimate the
   capacities of a number of steel conical tanks which are then compared to
   the hydrodynamic loading associated with various seismic zones. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Liquid product from white birch bark liquefaction in water/ethanol
   (50:50, v/v) mixture was successfully applied in substituting 50 wt\% of
   phenol in the synthesis of bark based phenol formaldehyde (BPF) resole
   (i.e., 50\% HTL-oil BPF resole). Besides, eHTL-oil from liquefaction of
   the bark extracted in 70 vol\% aqueous acetone, and fHTL-oil obtained
   after HTL-oil fractionation in water, were also used to substitute 50\%
   of phenol for BPF resoles synthesis. The results showed that all the
   three BPF resoles contained more free formaldehyde than the neat PF
   resole, and bark extraction before liquefaction and HTL-oil
   fractionation after liquefaction led to higher free formaldehyde
   contents in the resulted 50\% eHTL-oil BPF resole and 50\% fHTL-oil BPF
   resole. Furthermore, bark extraction before liquefaction retarded the
   curing of the resulted 50\% eHTL-oil BPF resole, while HTL-oil
   fractionation after liquefaction slightly promoted the curing of the
   resulted 50\% eHTL-oil BPF resole. All the three BPF resoles displayed
   less thermal stability than the neat PF resole, but the effects of bark
   extraction before liquefaction and HTL-oil fractionation after
   liquefaction on the thermal stability of the resulted BPF resoles were
   negligible. All the three BPF resoles could meet the bond strength
   requirements as adhesives for plywood in accordance to the JIS standard.
   Bark extraction before liquefaction led to less water resistance for the
   resulted 50\% eHTL-oil BPF resole, while HTL-oil fractionation after
   liquefaction improved the water resistance of the resulted 50\% BPF

Abstract = {{Waste crude glycerol from biodiesel production can be used to produce
   biobutanol using Clostridium pasteurianum with the main products being
   n-butanol, 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and ethanol. There has been much
   discrepancy and mystery around the cause and effect of process
   parameters on the product distribution, thus a better understanding of
   the pathway regulation is required. This study shows that as process pH
   decreased, the rate of cell growth and CO2 production also decreased,
   resulting in slower fermentations, increased duration of butanol
   production and higher butanol concentrations and yields. The production
   rate of PDO was multi-modal and the role of PDO appears to function in
   redox homeostasis. The results also showed that C. pasteurianum
   displayed little biphasic behavior when compared to Clostridia spp.
   typically used in ABE fermentation due to the alternative
   glycolysis-independent reductive pathway of PDO production, rendering it
   suitable for a continuous fermentation process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A conjugate fluid-porous approach to convective heat and mass transfer
   with application to produce drying}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{55-67}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A computational model capable of simulating heat and mass transfer in
   conjugate fluid-porous domains is utilized to simulate forced convective
   drying. The material to be dried is considered as the porous region,
   which is coupled through interfaces to the surrounding pure fluid
   region. The computational model solves transport equations for mass and
   momentum, energy, and moisture in all regions simultaneously. The model
   includes non-equilibrium heat and moisture transport in the porous
   region such that the fluid and solid constituents, and the exchanges
   between them, are captured. The interfacial moisture transfer condition
   between phases in the porous region, and between the porous and pure
   fluid regions, is developed to show the level of detail required for
   modeling. The study considers the drying of apple flesh to validate the
   developed drying model against available experimental data. The results
   show accurate prediction of moisture content as a function of drying
   time for different airflow velocities, and correctly capture the
   influences of temperature, relative humidity and initial moisture
   content on the drying rate. Thus, the model is considered viable for
   taking steps towards implicit dynamic coupling of the constituents in
   the porous region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The linear operator plays an important role in the computational process

   The effective use of these operators has been judged through solving

Abstract = {{Key agreement is paramount in secure wireless communications. A
   promising approach to address key agreement schemes is to extract secure
   keys from channel characteristics. However, because channels lack
   randomness, it is difficult for wireless networks with stationary
   communicating terminals to generate robust keys. In this paper, we
   propose a Robust Secure Key Agreement (RSKA) scheme from Received Signal
   Strength (RSS) in stationary wireless networks. In order to mitigate the
   asymmetry in RSS measurements for communicating parties, the sender and
   receiver normalize RSS measurements and quantize them into q-bit
   sequences. They then reshape bit sequences into new l-bit sequences.
   These bit sequences work as key sources. Rather than extracting the key
   from the key sources directly, the sender randomly generates a bit
   sequence as a key and hides it in a promise. This is created from a
   polynomial constructed on the sender's key source and key. The receiver
   recovers the key by reconstructing a polynomial from its key source and
   the promise. Our analysis shows that the shared key generated by our
   proposed RSKA scheme has features of high randomness and a high bit rate
   compared to traditional RSS-based key agreement schemes.}},

   diversity}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed to enhance the spectral
   efficiency of a two-way cooperative relaying system, where two source
   terminals exchange information directly and via K intermediate relays
   using the three-phase two-way decode-and-forward (DF) protocol. Signal
   space diversity (SSD) is incorporated into the two-way cooperative
   relaying system in the proposed scheme that exploits the inherent
   diversity in the modulation signal space by rotating and expanding the
   ordinary constellation. The proposed SSD-based three-phase two-way DF
   relaying scheme exchanges four symbols in three time slots and thus
   doubles the spectral efficiency as compared to the conventional
   three-phase two-way DF relaying system, where six time slots are
   required to exchange the same four symbols. This improvement in spectral
   efficiency is achieved without adding any extra complexity, bandwidth,
   or transmit power. A comprehensive analysis of the proposed scheme is
   carried out in this paper, and closed-form expressions for various
   performance metrics, including error probability, outage probability,
   and channel capacity, are derived. It is shown that the proposed scheme
   provides a diversity gain equal to one higher than the number of relays.
   The paper also studies different schemes for the optimization of relay
   position and power allocation. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are
   performed which confirm the validity and accuracy of the analytical
   framework.}},

Title = {{Controlled SnO2 Crystallinity Effectively Dominating Sodium Storage
   Performance}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{The exploration of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is a profound challenge
   due to the rich sodium abundance and limited supply of lithium on earth.
   Here, amorphous SnO2/graphene aerogel (a-SnO2/GA) nanocomposites have
   been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method for use as anode
   materials in SIBs. The designed annealing process produces crystalline
   SnO2/graphene aerogel (c-SnO2/GA) nanocomposites. For the first time,
   the significant effects of SnO2 crystallinity on sodium storage
   performance are studied in detail. Notably, a-SnO2/GA is more effective
   than c-SnO2/GA in overcoming electrode degradation from large volume
   changes associated with charge-discharge processes. Surprisingly, the
   amorphous SnO2 delivers a high specific capacity of 380.2 mAh g(-1)
   after 100 cycles at a current density of 50 mA g(-1), which is almost
   three times as much as for crystalline SnO2 (138.6 mAh g(-1)). The
   impressive electrochemical performance of amorphous SnO2 can be
   attributed to the intrinsic isotropic nature, the enhanced Na+ diffusion
   coefficient, and the strong interaction between amorphous SnO2 and GA.
   In addition, amorphous SnO2 particles with the smaller size better
   function to relieve the volume expansion/shrinkage. This study provides
   a significant research direction aiming to increase the electrochemical
   performance of the anode materials used in SIBs.}},

Title = {{Predicting Treatment Outcomes from Prefrontal Cortex Activation for
   Self-Harming Patients with Borderline Personality Disorder: A
   Preliminary Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Self-harm is a potentially lethal symptom of borderline personality
   disorder (BPD) that often improves with dialectical behavior therapy
   (DBT). While DBT is effective for reducing self-harm in many patients
   with BPD, a small but significant number of patients either does not
   improve in treatment or ends treatment prematurely. Accordingly, it is
   crucial to identify factors that may prospectively predict which
   patients are most likely to benefit from and remain in treatment. In the
   present preliminary study, 29 actively self-harming patients with BPD
   completed brain-imaging procedures probing activation of the prefrontal
   cortex (PFC) during impulse control prior to beginning DBT and after 7
   months of treatment. Patients that reduced their frequency of self-harm
   the most over treatment displayed lower levels of neural activation in
   the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) prior to beginning
   treatment, and they showed the greatest increases in activity within
   this region after 7 months of treatment. Prior to starting DBT,
   treatment non-completers demonstrated greater activation than
   treatment-completers in the medial PFC and right inferior frontal gyrus.
   Reductions in self-harm over the treatment period were associated with
   increases in activity in right DLPFC even after accounting for
   improvements in depression, mania, and BPD symptom severity. These
   findings suggest that pre-treatment patterns of activation in the PFC
   underlying impulse control may be prospectively associated with
   improvements in self-harm and treatment attrition for patients with BPD
   treated with DBT.}},

Abstract = {{1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) is, a chlorinated solvent classified as a
   probable human carcinogen. Due to its extensive use in industrial
   applications, widespread contamination, and recalcitrance toward abiotic
   dechlorination, 1,2-DCA remains a challenging compound for the
   remediation community. Over the past decade, nano zerovalent iron (nZVI)
   has been efficiently used to treat many of the chlorinated compounds of
   concern. However, thus far, even nZVI (monometallic or bimetallic) has
   been unable to dechlorinate 1,2-DCA. Therefore, an alternative treatment
   coupling nZVI with dithionite to treat 1,2-DCA is proposed in this work.
   Coupled nZVI-dithionite was able to degrade >90\% 1,2-DCA over the
   course of a year. The effects of dithionite and nZVI loadings,
   carboxyinethyl cellulose (CMC) coating, addition of palladium, and other
   iron species as metal surfaces on the degradation kinetics were also
   investigated. Observed pseudo-first-order rate constants (k(obs)) ranged
   from 3.8 x 10(-3) to 7.8 x 10(-3) d(-1). Both nudeophilic substitution
   and reductive dechlorination are the proposed mechanisms for 1,2-DCA
   degradation by coupled nZVI-dithionite treatment. Characterization
   analysis of the nZVI-dithionite nanoparticles shows that most of the
   iron was still preserved in the zerovalent state even after more than
   one year of reactivity with some iron sulfide (FeS) formation. Scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that the nanosized spherical
   particles were still present along with the FeS platelets. This novel
   treatment represents the first nZVI-based formulation to achieve nearly
   complete degradation of 1,2-DCA.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands drill cuttings waste represents one of the most difficult
   challenges for the oil sands mining sector. Reducing the amount oil
   sands drill cutting waste sent to landfill offers one of the best
   solutions for waste management. The present work offers an innovative
   solution for the recycle and reuse of treated oil sands drill cuttings
   waste (TOSW) in grout manufacture. In this study, the physical, chemical
   and mineralogical characteristics of the treated oil sands drill
   cuttings waste were investigated. Fresh and hardened properties for
   grouts incorporating the treated solid drill cuttings waste were
   evaluated. The results show that incorporating up to 20\% of the treated
   solid drill cuttings waste as a partially replacement of cement will not
   adversely affect the properties of the grout. Leaching tests evidenced
   the reduction in the release of heavy metals from the tested mixtures
   compared to that of the raw waste indicating successful
   stabilization/solidification of such waste in the grout. (C) 2016

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Aerodynamic response of a standard tall building (commonly known as the
   CAARC model) is investigated using LES. The LES employs the Consistent
   Discrete Random Flow Generation (CDRFG) technique to generate the inflow
   boundary condition allowing accurate depiction of the turbulence spectra
   and coherency. The building aerodynamic behavior is investigated for two
   configurations (an isolated building and a building with complex
   surrounding buildings) and the results are compared with a previous wind
   tunnel test. It is found that pressure and other wind-induced responses,
   such as top displacement, top acceleration and base moments, obtained
   from the LES are in a good agreement with those in the wind tunnel. The
   average difference between LES and wind tunnel results is found to be
   4\% for the pressures and 6\% for the dynamic responses for the
   simulated wind directions, which emphasizes the accuracy of the employed
   model. As expected, comparison between the results for the isolated and
   the complex surrounding configuration showed 50\% and 40\% difference
   for mean and rms pressure coefficients, respectively. The employed LES
   model leads to an acceptable estimation for the wind pressure
   distribution and responses of the study building in a time-efficient
   manner. Therefore, it is expected to encourage the use of CFD in similar
   wind engineering applications in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A new fluidizable VO chi/gamma-Al2O3-ZrO2 catalyst for the oxidative
   dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene is investigated. This
   catalyst operates in an oxygen free environment. The prepared catalyst
   is characterized using various physicochemical techniques. Nitrogen
   adsorption/desorption isotherm analysis shows a significant extent of
   monolayer coverage suggesting high active sites dispersion. TPR/TPO
   results demonstrate that the VO chi/gamma-Al2O3-ZrO2 catalyst is very
   reactive and displays consistent hydrogen consumption during repeated
   reduction and oxidation cycles. NH3-TPD analysis indicates that the
   support acidity decreases after catalyst modification with ZrO2. The
   estimated energy of ammonia desorption is found to be 75.4, 77.8 and
   80.5 kJ/g for the Al2O3/ZrO2 ratio of 2:1,1:1 and 1:2, respectively.
   This higher energy of desorption with ZrO2 content, it is assigned to
   the increased ZrO2-support interaction. XRD patterns display the
   presence of a VO chi, crystal phase on the support surface. When
   evaluated in a fluidized CREC (Chemical Reactor Engineering Center)
   Riser Simulator, the ZrO2 modified catalyst shows at 600 degrees C close
   to 90\% ethylene selectivity while the unmodified catalyst gave 42\%
   ethylene only. Furthermore, ethylene selectivity remained stable with
   catalyst time-on-stream. It is concluded that ZrO2 enhances
   metal-support interaction, influencing favorably the VO chi,
   reducibility and ethylene selectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Lithium-air batteries have become a focus of research on future battery
   technologies. Technical issues associated with lithium-air batteries,
   however, are rather complex. Apart from the sluggish oxygen reaction
   kinetics which demand efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and
   oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, issues are also inherited
   from the nature of an open battery system and the use of reactive metal
   lithium as anode. Lithium-air batteries, which exchange oxygen directly
   with ambient air, face more challenges due to the additional oxidative
   agents of moisture, carbon dioxide, etc. which degrade the metal lithium
   anode, deteriorating the performance of the batteries. In order to
   improve the cycling performance one must hold a full picture of
   lithium-oxygen electrochemistry in the presence of carbon dioxide and/or
   moisture and fully understand the fundamentals of chemistry reactions
   therein. Recent advances in the exploration of the effect of moisture
   and CO2 contaminants on Li-O-2 batteries are reviewed, and the
   mechanistic understanding of discharge/charge process in O-2 at
   controlled level of moisture and/or CO2 are illustrated. Prospects for
   development opportunities of Li-air batteries, insight into future
   research directions, and guidelines for the further development of
   rechargeable Li-air batteries are also given.}},

Abstract = {{We present astrometric monitoring of the young exoplanet HD 95086 b
   obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager between 2013 and 2016. A small
   but significant position angle change is detected at constant
   separation; the orbital motion is confirmed with literature
   measurements. Efficient Monte Carlo techniques place preliminary
   constraints on the orbital parameters of HD 95086 b. With 68\%
   confidence, a semimajor axis of 61.7(-8.4)(+20.7) au and an inclination
   of. 153.0(+9.7)(-13.5) are favored, with eccentricity less than 0.21.
   Under the assumption of a coplanar planet-disk system, the periastron of
   HD 95086 b is beyond 51 au with 68\% confidence. Therefore, HD 95086 b
   cannot carve the entire gap inferred from the measured infrared excess
   in the SED of HD 95086. We use our sensitivity to additional planets to
   discuss specific scenarios presented in the literature to explain the
   geometry of the debris belts. We suggest that either two planets on
   moderately eccentric orbits or three to four planets with inhomogeneous
   masses and orbital properties are possible. The sensitivity to
   additional planetary companions within the observations presented in
   this study can be used to help further constrain future dynamical
   simulations of the planet-disk system.}},

Abstract = {{This study numerically evaluates the effect of secondary flow on the
   reaction performance in heterogeneous gaseous spiral coiled reactor
   utilizing selective wall coatings. Laminar multispecies gas flow in
   spiral coiled reactor with circular and square cross-section is
   investigated using a validated three-dimensional computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model. Various selective wall coating strategies are
   evaluated within a range of Reynolds number. The reactor performance is
   measured not only based on the conversion rate but also in terms of
   figure of merit (FoM) defined as reaction throughput per unit pumping
   power and catalyst coating active area. The results indicate that
   secondary flow enhance reaction performance and improve catalyst
   utilization, especially at the outer wall. By maximizing this effect,
   the requirement of expensive catalyst materials can be minimized. This
   study highlight the potential of selective catalyst coating in coiled
   reactor for process intensification and cost reduction in various
   applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) and organochlorine respiring bacteria
   (ORB) are two technologies used to detoxify chlorinated aliphatic
   hydrocarbons (CAHs). nZVI can rapidly detoxify high CAH concentrations,
   but is quickly oxidised and unable to degrade certain CAHs (e.g.,
   1,2-dichlorothane). In contrast, ORB can dechlorinate CAHs resistant to
   nZVI (e.g., 1,2-dichlorothane) but are inhibited by other CAHs of
   concern degradable by nZVI (e.g., chloroform and carbon tetrachloride).
   Combining the two was proposed as a unique treatment train to overcome
   each technology's shortcomings. In this study, this combined remedy was
   investigated using a mixture of 1,2-dichloroethane, degradable by ORB
   but not nZVI, and 1,1,2-trichloroethane, susceptible to both. Results
   indicated that nZVI rapidly dechlorinated 1,1,2-trichloroethane when
   supplied above 0.5 g/L, however ORB were inhibited and unable to
   dechlorinate 1,2-dichloroethane. pH increase and ionic species
   associated with nZVI did not significantly impact ORB, pinpointing Fe-0
   particles as responsible for ORB inhibition. Below 0.05 g/L nZVI, ORB
   activity was stimulated. Results suggest that combining ORB and nZVI at
   appropriate doses can potentially treat a wider range of CAHs than each
   individual remedy. At field sites where nZVI was applied, it is likely
   that in situ nZVI concentrations were below the threshold of negative
   consequences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inulin is a linear carbohydrate polymer of fructose subunits (2-60) with
   terminal glucose units, produced as carbon storage in selected plants.
   It cannot directly be taken up by most microorganisms due to its large
   size, unless prior hydrolysis through inulinase enzymes occurs. The
   hydrolyzed inulin can be taken up by microbes and/or recovered and used
   industrially for the production of high fructose syrup,
   inulo-oligosaccharides, biofuel, and nutraceuticals. Cell-free enzymatic
   hydrolysis would be desirable for industrial applications, hence the
   recombinant expression, purification and characterization of an
   Aspergillus niger derived exo-inulinase was investigated in this study.
   The eukaroyototic exo-inulinase of Aspergillus niger 12 has been
   expressed, for the first time, in an E. coli strain {[}Rosetta-gami B
   (DE3)]. The molecular weight of recombinant exo-inulinase was estimated
   to be similar to 81 kDa. The values of K-m and V-max of the recombinant
   exo-inulinase toward inulin were 5.3 +/- 1.1 mM and 402.1 +/- 53.1 mu
   mol min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively. Towards sucrose the
   corresponding values were 12.20 +/- 1.6 mM and 902.8 +/- 40.2 mmol
   min(-1) mg(-1) protein towards sucrose. The S/I ratio was 2.24 +/- 0.7,
   which is in the range of native inulinase. The optimum temperature and
   pH of the recombinant exo-inulinase towards inulin was 55 degrees C and
   5.0, while they were 50 degrees C and 5.5 towards sucrose. The
   recombinant exo-inulinase activity towards inulin was enhanced by Cu2+
   and reduced by Fe2+, while its activity towards sucrose was enhanced by
   Co2+ and reduced by Zn2+. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Eight or nine tropical cyclones (TC) per year make landfall over
   mainland China and cause large typhoon wind speeds and economic loss.
   This study estimates the return period value of the annual maximum
   typhoon wind speed, upsilon T, for a set of grid points in the coastal
   region of mainland China. upsilon T can be used to characterize the
   typhoon's wind hazard and to assign the wind load in design codes. The
   estimation uses a typhoon wind hazard model consisting of the TC track
   and wind field models. For the estimation, the development of track
   model for a circular subregion centered at each of the grid points is
   carried out by using the best-track dataset from China Meteorological
   Administration, and a well-accepted wind field model for simulating the
   TC is adopted. The spatial trends of the parameters controlling the
   track model are investigated, and the time histories of the wind speeds
   estimated by using the adopted wind field model are compared with those
   observed from two historical typhoon events. The estimated upsilon T
   values at the grid points are used to develop the typhoon wind hazard
   contour maps. A comparison of the contour maps to those recommended in
   the Chinese design code is given. The comparison provides a forward step
   towards the rational assessment of the wind pressure implemented in
   Chinese design codes. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To directly compare magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and
   computed tomography (CT) parametric response map (PRM) measurements of
   gas trapping and emphysema in ex-smokers both with and without chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Materials and Methods: Participants provided written informed consent to
   a protocol that was approved by a local research ethics board and Health
   Canada and was compliant with the HIPAA (Institutional Review Board Reg.
   \#00000940). The prospectively planned study was performed from March
   2014 to December 2014 and included 58 ex-smokers (mean age, 73 years +/-
   9) with (n = 32; mean age, 74 years +/- 7) and without (n = 26; mean
   age, 70 years +/- 11) COPD. MR imaging (at functional residual capacity
   plus 1 L), CT (at full inspiration and expiration), and spirometry or
   plethysmography were performed during a 2-hour visit to generate
   ventilation defect percent (VDP), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC),
   and PRM gas trapping and emphysema measurements. The relationships
   between pulmonary function and imaging measurements were determined with
   analysis of variance (ANOVA), Holm-Bonferroni corrected Pearson
   correlations, multivariate regression modeling, and the spatial overlap
   coefficient (SOC).
   Results: VDP, ADC, and PRM gas trapping and emphysema (ANOVA, P < .001)
   measurements were significantly different in healthy ex-smokers than
   they were in ex-smokers with COPD. In all ex-smokers, VDP was correlated
   with PRM gas trapping (r = 0.58, P < .001) and with PRM emphysema (r =
   0.68, P < .001). VDP was also significantly correlated with PRM in
   ex-smokers with COPD (gas trapping: r = 0.47 and P = .03; emphysema: r =
   0.62 and P < .001) but not in healthy ex-smokers. In a multivariate
   model that predicted PRM gas trapping, the forced expiratory volume in 1
   second normalized to the forced vital capacity (standardized
   coefficients {[}beta(S)] = -0.69, P = .001) and airway wall area percent
   (beta(S) = -0.22, P = .02) were significant predictors. PRM emphysema
   was predicted by the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (beta(S) =
   -0.29, P = .03) and VDP (beta(S) = 0.41, P = .001). Helium 3 ADC values
   were significantly elevated in PRM gastrapping regions (P < .001). The
   spatial relationship for ventilation defects was significantly greater
   with PRM gas trapping than with PRM emphysema in patients with mild (for
   gas trapping, SOC = 36\% +/- 28; for emphysema, SOC = 1\% +/- 2; P =
   .001) and moderate (for gas trapping, SOC = 34\% +/- 28; for emphysema,
   SOC = 7\% +/- 15; P = .006) COPD. For severe COPD, the spatial
   relationship for ventilation defects with PRM emphysema (SOC = 64\% +/-
   30) was significantly greater than that for PRM gas trapping (SOC = 36\%
   +/- 18; P = .01).
   Conclusion: In all ex-smokers, ADC values were significantly elevated in
   regions of PRM gas trapping, and VDP was quantitatively and spatially
   related to both PRM gas trapping and PRM emphysema. In patients with
   mild to moderate COPD, VDP was related to PRM gas trapping, whereas in
   patients with severe COPD, VDP correlated with both PRM gas trapping and
   PRM emphysema. (C) RSNA, 2016}},

   assessed for the potential for fracture (Aarhus, Medicon; Dual-Top, Jeil
   Medical; OrthoEasy, Forestadent; tomas-pin, Dentaurum; Unitek, 3M; and
   VectorTAS, Ormco). First, mini-implants were inserted manually, without
   predrilling, into bone substitutes (Sawbones) with a 3-mm-thick, dense
   (1.64 g/cm(3)) cortical layer. A custom-made insertion device was used
   for placement of mini-implants. A six-axis force/torque transducer was
   secured at the base of the bone blocks to measure the maximum torque
   experienced during insertion. Measured insertion torques were compared
   with previously reported fracture torques, yielding a torque ratio
   (insertion torque as a percentage of fracture torque), which was used as
   an indicator of the potential for mini-implant fracture. Mini-implants
   that experienced torque ratios = 75\% upon insertion underwent further
   testing, following the manufacturer's recommendations for predrilling in
   thick, dense bone conditions. Results: Significant differences in torque
   ratios were found among all mini-implants, except between OrthoEasy and
   Dual-Top, and OrthoEasy and VectorTAS. Overall, Aarhus had the highest
   torque ratio (91\% +/- 3\%), with Unitek showing the lowest ratio (37\%
   +/- 3\%). Aarhus and tomas-pin mini-implants displayed torque ratios >=
   75\% and experienced fracture upon insertion. When the manufacturer's
   specific predrilling recommendations were followed, no changes in torque
   ratio were found for Aarhus and tomas-pin. However, while Aarhus
   continued to fracture upon insertion, all tomas-pin mini-implants were
   inserted fully without fracture following predrilling. Conclusion: These
   findings support the safe use of Unitek, VectorTAS, Dual-Top, and
   OrthoEasy self-drilling mini-implants in areas of 3-mm-thick, 1.64
   g/cm(3) dense cortical bone without predrilling. Following predrilling,
   fractures did not occur with tomas-pin. For implants that continued to
   fracture after predrilling, other strategies may be required, such as
   the use of larger-diameter mini-implants in thick, dense bone
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Tendons/ligaments insert into bone via a transitional structure, the
   enthesis, which is susceptible to injury and difficult to repair.
   Fibrocartilaginous entheses contain fibrocartilage in their transitional
   zone, part of which is mineralized. Mineral-associated proteins within
   this zone have not been adequately characterized. Members of the Small
   Integrin Binding Ligand N-linked Glycoprotein (SIBLING) family are
   acidic phosphoproteins expressed in mineralized tissues. Here we show
   that two SIBLING proteins, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin
   (OPN), are present in the mouse enthesis. Histological analyses indicate
   that the calcified zone of the quadriceps tendon enthesis is longer in
   Bsp(-/-) mice, however no difference is apparent in the supraspinatus
   tendon enthesis. In an analysis of mineral content within the calcified
   zone, micro-CT and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the mineral content in
   the calcified fibrocartilage of the quadriceps tendon enthesis are
   similar between wild type and Bsp(-/-) mice. Mechanical testing of the
   patellar tendon shows that while the tendons fail under similar loads,
   the Bsp(-/-) patellar tendon is 7.5\% larger in cross sectional area
   than wild type tendons, resulting in a 16.5\% reduction in failure
   stress. However, Picrosirius Red staining shows no difference in
   collagen organization. Data collected here indicate that BSP is present
   in the calcified fibrocartilage of murine entheses and suggest that BSP
   plays a regulatory role in this structure, influencing the growth of the
   calcified fibrocartilage in addition to the weakening of the tendon
   mechanical properties. Based on the phenotype of the Bsp(-/-) mouse
   enthesis, and the known in vitro functional properties of the protein,
   BSP may be a useful therapeutic molecule in the reattachment of tendons
   and ligaments to bone. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The ability to properly analyze and interpret large microbiome
   data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire such data sets from
   environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing instruments impose a
   structure on these data: the natural sample space of a 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing data set is a simplex, which is a part of real space that is
   restricted to nonnegative values with a constant sum. Such data are
   compositional and should be analyzed using compositionally appropriate
   tools and approaches. However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing analysis assume these data are unrestricted.
   Methods: We show that existing tools for compositional data (CoDa)
   analysis can be readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing
   data sets.
   Results: The Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa data
   set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major elements of
   microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly available autism
   microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach in concert with
   multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent false positive
   identifications.
   Conclusions: The CoDa approach is readily scalable to microbiome-sized
   analyses. We provide example code and make recommendations to improve
   the analysis and reporting of microbiome data sets. Crown Copyright (C)

Title = {{Solar Hydrogen Production via a Samarium Oxide-Based Thermochemical
   Water Splitting Cycle}},
Journal = {{ENERGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The computational thermodynamic analysis of a samarium oxide-based
   two-step solar thermochemical water splitting cycle is reported. The
   analysis is performed using HSC chemistry software and databases. The
   first (solar-based) step drives the thermal reduction of Sm2O3 into Sm
   and O-2. The second (non-solar) step corresponds to the production of
   H-2 via a water splitting reaction and the oxidation of Sm to Sm2O3. The
   equilibrium thermodynamic compositions related to the thermal reduction
   and water splitting steps are determined. The effect of oxygen partial
   pressure in the inert flushing gas on the thermal reduction temperature
   (T-H) is examined. An analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics
   is performed to determine the cycle efficiency ((cycle)) and
   solar-to-fuel energy conversion efficiency ((solar-to-fuel)) attainable
   with and without heat recuperation. The results indicate that (cycle)
   and (solar-to-fuel) both increase with decreasing T-H, due to the
   reduction in oxygen partial pressure in the inert flushing gas.
   Furthermore, the recuperation of heat for the operation of the cycle
   significantly improves the solar reactor efficiency. For instance, in
   the case where T-H = 2280 K, (cycle) = 24.4\% and (solar-to-fuel) =
   29.5\% (without heat recuperation), while (cycle) = 31.3\% and
   (solar-to-fuel) = 37.8\% (with 40\% heat recuperation).}},

Abstract = {{Fine particle emission occurs in many gas solid operations including
   prilling towers, where highly concentrated solutions are converted to
   prills using showerheads followed by solidification and cooling through
   ambient air. These emissions are generally considered as air pollutants.
   Reduction of the fine particle emission from an industrial prilling
   tower for the production of ammonium nitrate (20 t/day) is studied.
   Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is employed to investigate
   fluid flow patterns and fluid and particle trajectories at steady state
   operating conditions. The air flow is modeled using the Eulerian
   approach, where the turbulence is treated with the Reynolds Averaged
   Navier Stokes (RANS) equations. Three design configurations with respect
   to the air exit were considered and tested using CFD. The concentrated
   solution was converted to droplets by operating the shower head in the
   Rayleigh jet breakup regime. It was found that formation of a quiescent
   zone around the showerhead was crucial in minimizing secondary
   disintegration of particles and formation of fine powder. The optimum
   diameter and location of a spray showerhead ring were obtained. The
   design of air exit configuration had substantial effect on particle air
   interaction and reduction of fine particle carry over. (c) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Lignin-based epoxy resins derived from depolymerized Kraft/organosolv
   lignins were blended with a commercial bisphenol A (BPA)-type epoxy
   resin at various percentages to prepare bio-based epoxy composites. The
   thermal stability and thermal decomposition kinetics of lignin-based
   epoxy composites were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis
   coupled with Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (TGA-FTIR) and
   compared with the conventional BPA-based epoxy resin. The activation
   energy of the decomposition process of the cured lignin-based epoxy
   composites was calculated by Kissinger, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunoe (KAS),
   and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) methods. The presence of lignin-based epoxy
   resin demonstrated a significant effect on the activation energy of the
   decomposition process in particular at the early and the final stages of
   decomposition. The increase in the percentage of lignin based epoxy
   resins in the composites reduced the initial activation energy of the
   system. Carbon oxides, methane, carbonyl compounds, amines and aromatic
   compounds were identified as the principal components during the thermal
   decomposition of the bio-based epoxy composites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The instability of steady natural convection of a non-Fourier fluid of
   the single-phase lagging (SPL) type between two vertical surfaces
   maintained at different temperatures is studied. SPL fluids possess a
   relaxation time, which reflects the delay in the response of the heat
   flux and the temperature gradient. The SPL model is particularly
   relevant to low-temperature liquids, ultrafast processes, and nanofluids
   (with a retardation time added in this case). Linear stability analysis
   is employed to obtain the critical state parameters, such as critical
   Grashof numbers. For intermediate Prandtl numbers (Pr = 7.5), when
   non-Fourier level exceeds a certain value, the neutral stability curve
   comprises a Fourier branch and an oscillatory branch. In this case,
   oscillatory convection increasingly becomes the mode of preference,
   compared to both conduction and stationary convection. Critical Grashof
   number decreases for fluids with higher non-Fourier levels.}},

Abstract = {{The present work demonstrates the extension of a thermal-hydraulic
   model, THRUST, with an objective to simulate the fast transient flow
   dynamics in a supercritical water channel of circular cross section.
   THRUST is a 1-D model which solves the nonlinearly coupled mass, axial
   momentum and energy conservation equations in time domain based on a
   characteristics-dependent fully implicit finite difference scheme using
   an Eulerian approach. The model developed accounts for the
   compressibility of the supercritical flow by considering the finite
   value of acoustic speed in the solution algorithm and treats the
   boundary conditions naturally. A supercritical water channel of circular
   cross section, for which the experimental data is available at steady
   state operating conditions, is chosen for the transient simulations to
   start with. Two different case studies are undertaken with a purpose to
   assess the capability of the model to analyze the fast transient
   processes caused by the large reduction in system pressure. The first
   transient case study is where the initial exit pressure is reduced by 1
   MPa exponentially in a time span of 5 s. In the second case study, the
   transient is initiated with a sudden step decrease in the exit pressure
   by the same amount. Results obtained for both the case studies show the
   desired performance from the model developed.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesConventional approaches to WSR estimation in the
   microcirculation involve assumptions that may result in
   under-/over-estimation of WSR. Therefore, our objectives were: (i)
   calculate WSR from RBC velocity profiles for a wide range of arteriolar
   diameters, (ii) provide an experimentally derived and straightforward
   WSR estimation function, and (iii) compare calculated to conventional
   WSR estimations.
   MethodsWe characterized RBC velocity profiles in arterioles (n=39) of
   branching networks (21-115m) in the rat gluteus maximus muscle (n=6).
   Measures included mean and maximum velocities, CFL thickness, and RBC
   column edge velocity, and an experiment-based WSR function was derived.
   ResultsCFL thickness (1-4.3m) positively correlated with arteriolar
   diameter (r(2)=0.64). Results from the WSR equationwere similar to
   values from edge RBC velocities/CFL. Experimental WSRs (1317-4334/sec)
   were independent of arteriolar diameter, and were greater than
   pseudoshear rates (for V-Ratio of 1.6, 2, or diameter-dependent V-Ratio
   function) (p<0.05).
   ConclusionA WSR equationwas derived from experimental hemodynamic
   parameters, and is adaptable to other velocity measurement techniques in
   order to obtain WSR and stress (when plasma viscosity is known). These
   findings provide insight on the nature of conventional WSR calculation
   methods in underestimating microvascular WSR values.}},

Abstract = {{Hyaluronan (HA) is a structurally simple polysaccharide, but its ability
   to act as a template for organizing pericellular matrices and its
   regulated synthesis and degradation are key to initiating repair
   responses. Importantly, these HA functions are usurped by tumor cells to
   facilitate progression and metastasis. Recent advances have identified
   the functional complexities associated with the synthesis and
   degradation of HA-rich matrices. Three enzymes synthesize large HA
   polymers while multiple hyaluronidases or tissue free radicals degrade
   these into smaller bioactive fragments. A family of extracellular and
   cell-associated HA-binding proteins/receptors translates the
   bioinformation encrypted in this complex polymer mixture to activate
   signaling networks required for cell survival, proliferation, and
   migration in an actively remodeling microenvironment. Changes in HA
   metabolism within both the peritumor stroma and parenchyma are linked to
   tumor initiation, progression, and poor clinical outcome. We review
   evidence that metastatic tumor cells must acquire the capability to
   autonomously synthesize, assemble, and process their own ``portable{''}
   HA-rich microenvironments to survive in the circulation, metastasize to
   ectopic sites, and escape therapeutic intervention. Strategies to
   disrupt the HA machinery of primary tumor and circulating tumor cells
   may enhance the effectiveness of current conventional and targeted
   therapies. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic dewatering has been shown to be a promising technology;
   however, one of the challenges in its practical application is the
   corrosion of anodes. Recently, dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) were
   developed that are virtually corrosion free. This paper investigates the
   feasibility of using titanium anodes with iridium oxide coating
   (IrO2/Ta2O5) in the electrokinetic dewatering of mine tailings slurries.
   Characterization of the tailings is presented, followed by the results
   of electrokinetic dewatering, including the gradually increased and
   decreased voltages applied during the treatment, polarity reversal, and
   surcharge pressure applied to tailings. The results show that
   electrokinetic treatment using DSAs can significantly dewater tailings
   with low density and minimize electrode corrosion. The electroosmotic
   permeability measured for the combination of voltages and surcharge
   pressures ranges from 6.39 x 10(-9) m(2)/sV to 5.30 x 10(-8) m(2)/sV.
   The results also show that the effectiveness and efficiency of the
   electrokinetic dewatering of tailings can be improved by first applying
   a high voltage and then reducing it gradually during treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to synthesize and evaluate the compressive strength of
   the ZrO2/Ti-6Al-4V joint brazed using an active metal filler
   Ag-Cu-Sn-Ti, and its application to dental implants assuring its
   reliability to resist the compressive failure in the actual oral
   environment. The brazing was performed at a temperature of 750 A degrees
   C for 30 min in a vacuum furnace under 5 x 10(-6) Torr atmosphere. The
   microstructure of the brazed joint showed the presence of an Ag-rich
   matrix and a Cu-rich phase, and Cu-Ti intermetallic compounds were
   observed along the Ti-6Al-4V bonded interface. The compressive strength
   of the brazed ZrO2/Ti-6Al-4V joint was measured by EN ISO 14801 standard
   test method. The measured compressive strength of the joint was similar
   to 1477 MPa-a value almost five times that of existing dental cements.
   Finite element analysis also confirmed the high von Mises stress values.
   The compressive strains in the samples were found concentrated near the
   Ti-6Al-4V position, matching with the position of the real fractured
   sample. These results suggest extremely significant compressive strength
   in ZrO2/Ti-6Al-4V joints using the Ag-Cu-Sn-Ti filler. It is believed
   that a highly reliable dental implant can be processed and designed
   using the results of this study.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo demonstrate a new multigradient echo bipolar acquisition
   sequence for fat quantification.
   Theory and MethodsA multiecho bipolar acquisition is used such that the
   even echoes have opposite polarity to the odd echoes. In addition, the
   readout gradients alternate their polarities every other phase-encode
   line. Each echo, therefore, consists of phase-encode lines with both
   positive and negative polarities. Phase-encodes acquired with the same
   polarity are grouped together, and parallel imaging reconstruction is
   used to obtain two full k-space maps with opposite readout polarities at
   all the echoes. By complex averaging, the inconsistent phase errors
   between odd and even echoes are removed and water/fat separation
   techniques used with conventional unipolar sequences can be performed.
   ResultsPhantoms and in vivo experiments demonstrated accurate fat
   fraction and increased signal to noise ratio efficiency compared with
   the established unipolar acquisition. Artefacts due to phase and
   magnitude errors of bipolar acquisition were eliminated in all
   experiments.
   ConclusionThe interleaved bipolar sequence is an efficient technique for
   fat quantification. It demonstrated accurate fat measurements in a
   shorter scan time compared with the standard unipolar sequence. Magn

Abstract = {{Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is a clinically accepted surgical
   procedure; however, its long-term wear performance is not known. The
   purpose of this work is to review wear simulator testing of reverse
   total shoulder arthroplasty, to develop a wear simulator protocol for
   reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, and to test it by performing a
   pilot study. The review of wear simulator testing in the literature
   revealed considerable variation in protocols. A combination of our own
   cadaveric testing and those of other research groups helped in
   determining the magnitude and direction of joint loading for the
   development of the present protocol. A MATCO orbital-bearing simulator
   was adapted using custom fixtures to simulate a circumduction motion of
   the shoulder under mildly adverse conditions, and a pilot study gave
   wear rates within the wide range found in the literature. Arguments were
   presented in support of the currently developed protocol, but it was
   also suggested that, rather than rely on one protocol, a series of
   simulator wear protocols should be developed to fully test the implant
   wear performance in reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.}},

Abstract = {{Organic electrolyte solution (OES), composed of room temperature ionic

   gradual reduction of the crystallinity of cellulose I, fragmentation and
   fibrillation, as well as lignin redistribution occurred with an increase
   of chi({[}AMIM]Cl) (molar portion of {[}AMIM]Cl) from 0.1 to 0.9;
   whereas the content of the cellulose, acid insoluble lignin as well as
   hemicellulose composition did not change. The efficiency of glucose
   released from EWP through rapid enzymatic hydrolysis (24 h hydrolysis
   yield) and the final hydrolysis yield (120 h hydrolysis yield) were
   improved remarkably by up to 460\% and S00\% after OES pretreatment. No
   negative effect of OES pretreatment on downstream ethanol fermentation

Abstract = {{Hybrid membranes with in situ generated Fe3O4 were fabricated by
   combining infiltration and magnetic alignment. Typically, a chitosan
   (CS) membrane containing iron ions was produced and then immediately
   immersed in NaOH solution. Fe3O4 was in situ generated when

   applied to tune their distribution. The characterization results
   indicated that Fe3O4 decreased the crystallinity of CS, favored the
   generation of a free-volume cavity, and aligned along the magnetic
   lines. For comparison, hybrid membranes without application of the
   magnetic field were produced. When used in pervaporation for ethanol
   dehydration, the hybrid membrane with magnetic alignment exhibited an
   enhanced flux compared to that without magnetic alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Relay communications have attracted increasing research attentions as a
   cost-effective technique to improve spatial diversity, service coverage,
   and energy efficiency in wireless networks. However, existing relay
   schemes (e.g., amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward (DF) schemes)
   still face several major challenges, particularly the accumulation of
   multipath channels effect in AF and long processing latency in DF. To
   address these issues, we propose a novel equalize-and-forward (EF) relay
   scheme to enhance the retransmission reliability while maintaining low
   processing delay at the relay node. In particular, the proposed EF relay
   estimates and equalizes the channel between source and relay to
   eliminate the channel accumulation effect without signal regeneration.
   To further reduce the relay processing time, the channel estimation and
   equalization in the proposed EF design are performed in parallel. The
   proposed equalization is realized by presetting the equalizer
   coefficients with the current channel response that is predicted in
   parallel using multiple past channel responses. Numerical results show
   that the proposed EF relay scheme can achieve comparable symbol error
   rate performance as the DF relay with much less relay latency. In
   addition, the EF relay exhibits low outage probability at the same data
   rate as compared with traditional amplify-and-forward and DF schemes.

Abstract = {{It was the objective of this study to evaluate the feasibility of
   separating xylose from lignocellulosic biomass (steam-exploded corncobs)
   in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder, through water addition and
   solid-liquid separation. Eight screw configuration profiles were
   evaluated to define the best performance on xylose recovery.
   Subsequently, operating conditions (barrel temperature, screw speed and
   water flow rate) were examined with respect to xylose recovery and
   specific mechanical energy consumption of the motor drive. It was found
   that liquid/solid separation highly depended on the position and spacing
   of reverse screw elements. For a given configuration the xylose recovery
   increased with increases in temperature and was only weakly correlated
   with the agitation rate. The xylose recovery went through a maximum when
   the flow rate of additional water was approximately 0.33 kg h(-1) water
   per kg h(-1) biomass feed rate. Furthermore, operating conditions
   influenced the specific mechanical energy consumption of the motor
   drive, allowing to minimize the amount of energy needed to obtain a
   prescribed xylose removal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research is to evaluate the performance of three
   turbulence models with respect to flow with high curvature in a
   centrifugal compressor stage designed for an aero-engine. The
   effectiveness of the curvature correction terms in the two-equation
   turbulence models is the main focus of this study, as implemented in the
   curvature-corrected shear stress transport (SST-CC) model of Smirnov and
   Menter. The SST-CC model uses a production multiplier in the k and omega
   equations. SST-CC results were compared against the SST model and
   previous simulations by Bourgeois et al. (2011, ``Assessment of
   Turbulence Model Predictions for an Aero-Engine Centrifugal
   Compressor,{''} ASME J. Turbomach., 133(1), pp. 1-15) using the Reynolds
   stress model (RSM-SSG) for stage performance characteristics,
   experimental velocity profiles at the impeller-diffuser interface, and
   velocity contours at the diffuser exit. The production multiplier was
   investigated in the compressor impeller. The comparisons showed that the
   SST-CC model better predicted the choke region in the pressure
   characteristic and efficiency characteristic, whereas the SST model
   better predicted the stall region. However, both models predicted a
   similar mean flow velocity field. Analysis of the production multiplier
   demonstrated that the term provided the expected effects near the walls
   of the convex and concave surfaces. However, away from the walls where
   turbulent production term was insignificant, the production multiplier
   showed abnormal predictions. The rotation effects were found to be
   weaker than the curvature effects near the impeller trailing edge of the
   current compressor.}},

Abstract = {{Although changes in morphology and defect distribution at the
   cathode/active layer interface are presumed to limit the efficiency of
   sputtered cathodes for organic solar cells, little information is
   available on the nature of defects involved and on possible strategies
   to mitigate these effects. We demonstrate the sputter-induced formation
   of paramagnetic centers associated to the change in conformation and
   amorphization of P3HT in the proximity of the cathodes, which strongly
   affects the performance of polymer fullerene bulk heterojunction
   photovoltaics. Similarity in g-values and X-ray diffraction analysis
   suggest that defects produced at the cathode/organic interface by
   sputtering are of the same nature as those produced by thermal annealing
   at 150-180 degrees C, and that thin calcium layers thermally evaporated
   prior to cathode sputtering act as thermal sinks mitigating the defect
   formation by impinging sputtered ions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hierarchically structured spherical CuBi2O4 particles were prepared
   using a facile hydrothermal method without using a surfactant over
   various hydrothermal reaction periods. The prepared CuBi2O4 samples were
   examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD), which confirmed the formation of a
   tetragonal crystal structure. The morphological features were analyzed
   using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), which
   elucidated the construction of the hierarchical microspherical CuBi2O4
   particles. The plausible growth mechanism of the hierarchical structure
   was explained in terms of a time-dependent synthesis process and its
   crystal structure. The uniform hierarchical CuBi2O4 microspheres were
   used to fabricate a Li-ion hybrid capacitor (Li-HC) along with activated
   carbon (AC), the generated device delivers a stable specific capacitance
   of 26.5 F g(-1) over 1500 cycles at a high current density of 1000 mA
   g(-1) and a capacity retention of similar to 86\%. The AC/CB2 Li-ion

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous small cell networks (HetSNet) comprise several low power,
   low cost (SBSa), (D2D) enabled links wireless-fidelity (Wi-Fi) access
   points (APs) to support the existing macrocell infrastructure, decrease
   over the air signaling and energy consumption, and increase network
   capacity, data rate and coverage. This paper presents an active user
   dependent path loss (PL) based traffic offloading (TO) strategy for
   HetSNets and a comparative study on two techniques to offload the
   traffic from macrocell to (SBSs) for indoor environments: PL and
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) based strategies. To quantify the
   improvements, the PL based strategy against the SIR based strategy is
   compared while considering various macrocell and (SBS) coverage areas
   and traffic-types. On the other hand, offloading in a dense urban
   setting may result in overcrowding the (SBSs). Therefore, hybrid
   traffic-type driven offloading technologies such as (WiFi) and (D2D)
   were proposed to en route the delay tolerant applications through (WiFi)
   (APs) and (D2D) links. It is necessary to illustrate the impact of daily
   user traffic profile, (SBSs) access schemes and traffic-type while
   deciding how much of the traffic should be offloaded to (SBSs). In this
   context, (AUPF) is introduced to account for the population of active
   small cells which depends on the variable traffic load due to the active
   users.}},

Abstract = {{Butanol is a promising biofuel and valuable platform chemical that can
   be produced through fermentative conversion of glycerol. The initial
   fermentation conditions for butanol production from pure glycerol by
   Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525 were optimized via a central composite
   design. The effect of inoculum age, initial cell density, initial pH of
   medium and temperature were quantified and a quadratic model was able to
   predict butanol yield as a function of all four investigated factors.
   The model was confirmed through additional experiments and via analysis
   of variance (ANOVA). Subsequently, numerical optimization was used to
   maximize the butanol yield within the experimental range. Based on these
   results, batch fermentations in a 7 L bioreactor were performed using
   pure and crude (residue from biodiesel production) glycerol as
   substrates at optimized conditions. A butanol yield of 0.34
   mole(butanol) mole(glycerol)(1) was obtained indicating the suitability
   of this feedstock for fermentative butanol production. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{La0.2Y1.8O3 is a new and promising scintillator which is based on the
   host material without doping. Here the time gated X-ray excited optical
   luminescence is measured by using the excitation energy below, above and
   at the La L-3-edge. A relatively slow and broad emission with peak at
   415 nm has been observed as the dominant emission. Also, a weak emission
   at 360 nm is observed at the fast window, associated with the
   recombination of trapped excitons in Y2O3 host. The observations show
   that the broad emission at 415 nm is most likely due to the
   recombination of trapped excitons associated with the La3+ doping into
   Y2O3 sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Successful conversion of coal fly ash (CFA) to synthetic NaP zeolite
   with zero liquid discharge is reported in this article. The process
   eliminates the need for large amounts of water and the need for a huge
   wastewater treatment unit. The need for water, as a make-up stream, is
   only to compensate water losses during sampling and drying. Savings
   associated with minimizing make-up water and eliminating wastewater
   treatment unit can be substantial. Water and sodium hydroxide
   consumption is reduced by 90\% and 50\%, respectively. Furthermore,
   quality of the NaP zeolite (CFA-ZP) obtained is comparable to
   conventional method. The zeolitized product shows high crystallinity and
   leach resistance toward heavy metal and trace element content of the
   product. Leaching tests revealed that the concentrations of most of
   trace elements in leachate of CFA-ZP were less than threshold limit for
   landfill leachate and wastewater effluent for discharging into river and
   surface water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{A one-step hydrothermal method for synthesizing nitrogen-doped graphene
   quantum dots (N-GQDs) from organic carbon sources is presented in this
   paper. The high-quality N-GQDs can be obtained via tuning the degree of
   dehydration/carbonization of citric acid and doping of nitrogen atoms
   into the graphene lattice. The micromorphology, chemical structure,
   composition and photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of the N-GQDs
   were characterized systematically. The size of the obtained N-GQDs is
   about 5-10 nm with typical topographic heights of 0.8-2.5 nm. There is
   intense blue emission and excitation-independent PL behavior when the
   N-GQDs are in aqueous solution. The most remarkable innovation is that
   the fluorescence quantum yield (FL QY) of our N-GQDs is up to 75.2\%,
   which is much higher than that of most reported GQDs (less than 25\%).
   Thus, it is initially believed that synthesis parameters, hydrothermal
   process and nitrogen doping may greatly influence the surface state and
   bandgap of the GQDs, which are important in determining the PL
   characteristics of the N-GQDs.}},

Title = {{Functional Ability Improved in Essential Tremor by IncobotulinumtoxinA
   Injections Using Kinematically Determined Biomechanical Patterns - A New
   Future}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Effective treatment for functional disability caused by essential tremor
   is a significant unmet need faced by many clinicians today. Current
   literature regarding focal therapy by botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A)
   injections uses fixed dosing regimens, which cannot be individualized,
   provides only limited functional benefit and unacceptable muscle
   weakness commonly occurs. This 38-week open label study, the longest
   to-date, demonstrates how kinematic technology addressed all these
   issues by guiding muscle selection.
   Method
   Participants (n = 24) were assessed at weeks 0, 6, 16, 22, 32, and 38
   and injected with incobo-tulinumtoxinA at weeks 0, 16, and 32. Clinical
   assessments including UPDRS tremor items, Fahn-Tolosa-Marin (FTM) tremor
   rating scale assessing tremor severity, writing and functional ability,
   quality of life questionnaire (QUEST) and objective kinematic
   assessments were completed at every visit. Participants performed two
   postural and two weight-bearing scripted tasks with motion sensors
   placed over the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints. These sensors captured
   angular tremor amplitude (RMS units) and acceleration joint motion that
   was segmented into directional components: flexion-extension (F/E),
   pronation-supination and radial-ulnar at the wrist, F/E at the elbow,
   and F/E and adduction-abduction at the shoulder. Injection parameters
   were determined using kinematics, followed by the clinician's
   determination of which muscles would contribute to the specific upper
   limb tremor biomechanics and dosing per participant.
   Results
   Multi-joint biomechanical recordings allowed individualized muscle
   selection and showed significant improvement in whole-arm function, FTM
   parts A-C scores, at week 6 which continued throughout the study. By
   week 38, the total FTM score statistically significantly reduced from
   16.2 +/- 4.6 at week 0 to 9.5 +/- 6.3 (p< 0.0005). UPDRS item 21 score
   rating action tremor was significantly reduced from 2.6 +/- 0.5 at week
   0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 (p = 0.01) at week 32. Quality of life (QUEST)
   significantly improved from 40.3 +/- 15.8 at week 0 to 31.1 +/- 15.3 (p
   = 0.035) at week 32 and to 27.8 +/- 15.3 (p = 0.028) at week 38.
   Kinematics provided an objective, secondary outcome measure, which
   showed a significant decrease in tremor amplitude in the wrist and
   shoulder joints (p< 0.05). Eight participants (40\%) self-reported mild
   weakness in injected muscles but had no interference in arm function.
   Conclusion
   Kinematic tremor assessments provide the injector unique insight to
   objectively individualize and personalize injection parameters
   demonstrating BoNT-A effectively alleviates functional disability caused
   by essential tremor. Kinematic technology is a promising method for
   standardizing assessments and for focal upper limb tremor treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) have been grown on highly ordered
   vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) by the successive ionic
   layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method at room temperature. Using.
   Fe-SEM, EDX, XPS, XRD and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, the
   effect of synthesis conditions and post treatment procedure on the
   physico/chemical characteristics of the NiS NPs-sensitized TNAs was
   investigated. The photo-electrochemical properties of the different
   photoanodes were investigated for the water reduction reaction using
   aqueous solutions of Na2S/Na2SO3 as sacrificial electrolyte under the
   whole spectrum of simulated solar light irradiation. The highest
   photocurrent was obtained as 7.68 mA/cm(2), for the optimized SILAR
   number of loading cycles equal to 4. The photo-activity was more than 10
   times larger than the corresponding one achieved for pure TNAs. A high
   incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of about 45\% was obtained.
   SILAR cycle numbers higher than 4, resulted in the unwanted increase of
   the size of NiS nanoparticles eventually transforming them in the form
   of electro-hole recombination centers. A mechanism based on density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations of the hexagonal bulk NiS
   electronic configuration is proposed to explain the observed enhanced
   photocatalytic activity for the optimum sample. The excellent
   performance of NiS NPs sensitized TNAs cells allows the composite
   photo-electrode to have many potential applications as a photoanode
   material for photo-electrochemical applications such as H-2 production,
   nanoparticle sensitized solar cells and UV photodetector. Copyright (C)

   for the application of polymer-based composites. Results indicated that
   the incorporation of CF apparently improved the tensile strength,
   flexural modulus and hardness of PPS/PTFE blends. Meanwhile, the
   specific wear rate and average friction coefficient of PPS/PTFE
   reinforced by 15 vol\% CF reached to 5.2 x 10(-6) mm(3)/Nm and 0.085,
   which are 88\% and 47\% lower than that of mono-PPS/PTFE blend at the
   same sliding condition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations
   of the worn surfaces revealed that the main wear mechanism of the
   PPS/PTFE composites transformed from adhesive wear to abrasive wear by
   the introduction of CR X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
   of worn surface and the macroscopic observations of steel ring
   counterpart indicated the existence of uniform, smooth and PTFE-rich
   transfer film for PPS/PTFE/CF trinary blends, which is responsible for
   the enhanced tribological properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Optical cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scanning of 3D
   radiochromic dosimeters may provide a practical method for 3D dose
   verification in radiation therapy. However, in cone-beam geometry stray
   light contaminates the projection images, degrading the accuracy of
   reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients. Stray light was measured
   using a beam pass aperture array (BPA) and structured illumination
   methods. The stray-toprimary ray ratio (SPR) along the central axis was
   found to be 0.24 for a 5\% gelatin hydrogel, representative of
   radiochromic hydrogels. The scanner was modified by moving the spectral
   filter from the detector to the source, changing the light's spatial
   fluence pattern and lowering the acceptance angle by extending distance
   between the source and object. These modifications reduced the SPR
   significantly from 0.24 to 0.06. The accuracy of the reconstructed
   linear attenuation coefficients for uniform carbon black liquids was
   compared to independent spectrometer measurements. Reducing the stray
   light increased the range of accurate transmission readings. In order to
   evaluate scanner performance for the more challenging application to
   small field dosimetry, a carbon black finger gel phantom was prepared.
   Reconstructions of the phantom from CBCT and fan-beam CT scans were
   compared. The modified source resulted in improved agreement.
   Subtraction of residual stray light, measured with BPA or structured
   illumination from each projection further improved agreement. Structured
   illumination was superior to BPA for measuring stray light for the
   smaller 1.2 and 0.5 cm diameter phantom fingers. At the costs of
   doubling the scanner size and tripling the number of scans, CBCT
   reconstructions of low-scattering hydrogel dosimeters agreed with those
   of fan-beam CT scans.}},

Abstract = {{\textbackslash{}Optical cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) using a
   broad beam and CCD camera is a fast method for densitometry of 3D
   optical gel dosimeters. However, diffuse light sources introduce
   considerable stray light into the imaging system, leading to
   underestimation of attenuation coefficients and non-uniformities in CT
   images unless corrections are applied to each projection image. In this
   study, the light source of a commercial optical CT scanner is replaced
   with a convergent cone beam source consisting of almost exclusively
   image forming primary rays. The convergent source is achieved using a
   small isotropic source and a Fresnel lens. To characterize stray light
   effects, fullfield cone beam CT imaging is compared to fan beam CT
   (FBCT) using a 1 cm high fan beam aperture centered on the optic axis of
   the system. Attenuating liquids are scanned within a large 96 mm
   diameter uniform phantom and in a small 13.5 mm diameter finger phantom.
   For the uniform phantom, cone and fan beam CT attenuation coefficients
   agree within a maximum deviation of (1 +/- 2)\% between mean values over
   a wide range from 0.036 to 0.43 cm(-1). For the finger phantom,
   agreement is found with a maximum deviation of (4 +/- 2)\% between mean
   values over a range of 0.1-0.47 cm(-1). With the convergent source,
   artifacts associated with refractive index mismatch and vessel optical
   features are more pronounced. Further optimization of the source size to
   achieve a balance between quantitative accuracy and artifact reduction
   should enable practical, accurate 3D dosimetry, avoiding time consuming
   3D scatter measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A novel sodium hybrid capacitor (NHC) is constructed with an
   intercalation-type sodium material {[}carbon coated-Na3V2(PO4)(3),
   C-NVP] and high surface area-activated carbon derived from an
   eco-friendly resource cinnamon sticks (CDCs) in an organic electrolyte.
   This novel NHC possesses a combination of high energy and high power
   density, along with remarkable electrochemical stability. In addition,
   the C-NVP/CDC system outperforms present, well-established lithium
   hybrid capacitor systems in all areas, and can thus be added to the list
   of candidates for future electric vehicles. A careful optimization of
   mass balance between electrode materials enables the C-NVP/CDC cell to
   exhibit extraordinary capacitance performance. This novel NHC produces
   an energy density of 118 Wh kg(-1) at a specific power of 95 W kg(-1)
   and retains an energy density of 60 Wh kg(-1) with high specific power
   of 850 W kg(-1). Furthermore, a discharge capacitance of 53 F g(-1) is
   obtained from the C-NVP/CDC cell at a 1 mA cm(-2) current density, along
   with 95\% capacitance retention, even after 10 000 cycles. The sluggish
   kinetics of the Na ion battery system is successfully overcome by
   developing a stable, high-performing NHC system.}},

Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Interactive segmentation is becoming of increasing interest to the
   medical imaging community in that it combines the positive aspects of
   both manual and automated segmentation. However, general-purpose tools
   have been lacking in terms of segmenting multiple regions simultaneously
   with a high degree of coupling between groups of labels. Hierarchical
   max-flow segmentation has taken advantage of this coupling for
   individual applications, but until recently, these algorithms were
   constrained to a particular hierarchy and could not be considered
   general-purpose. In a generalized form, the hierarchy for any given
   segmentation problem is specified in run-time, allowing different
   hierarchies to be quickly explored. We present an interactive
   segmentation interface, which uses generalized hierarchical max-flow for
   optimization-based multiregion segmentation guided by user-defined
   seeds. Applications in cardiac and neonatal brain segmentation are given
   as example applications of its generality. (C) 2016 Society of

   asthma: relationship to airway mechanics}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In patients with asthma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
   direct measurements of regional ventilation heterogeneity, the etiology
   of which is not well-understood, nor is the relationship of ventilation
   abnormalities with lung mechanics. In addition, respiratory resistance
   and reactance are often abnormal in asthmatics and the frequency
   dependence of respiratory resistance is thought to reflect ventilation
   heterogeneity. We acquired MRI ventilation defect maps, forced
   expiratory volume in one-second (FEV1), and airways resistance (Raw)
   measurements, and used a computational airway model to explore the
   relationship of ventilation defect percent (VDP) with simulated
   measurements of respiratory system resistance (R-rs) and reactance
   (X-rs). MRI ventilation defect maps were experimentally acquired in 25
   asthmatics before, during, and after methacholine challenge and these
   were nonrigidly coregistered to the airway tree model. Using the model
   coregistered to ventilation defect maps, we narrowed proximal (9th) and
   distal (14th) generation airways that were spatially related to the MRI
   ventilation defects. The relationships for VDP with Raw measured using
   plethysmography (r = 0.79), and model predictions of R-rs>14 (r = 0.91,
   P < 0.0001) and R-rs>9 (r = 0.88, P < 0.0001) were significantly
   stronger (P = 0.005; P = 0.03, respectively) than with FEV1 (r = -0.68,
   P = 0.0001). The slopes for the relationship of VDP with simulated lung
   mechanics measurements were different (P < 0.0001); among these, the
   slope for the VDP-X-rs0.2 relationship was largest, suggesting that VDP
   was dominated by peripheral airway heterogeneity in these patients. In
   conclusion, as a first step toward understanding potential links between
   lung mechanics and ventilation defects, impedance predictions were made
   using a computational airway tree model with simulated constriction of
   airways related to ventilation defects measured in mild-moderate
   asthmatics.}},

Abstract = {{Origanum vulgare L is commonly known as a wild marjoram and winter sweet
   which has been used in the traditional medicine due to its therapeutic
   effects as stimulant, anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial,
   anti-inflammatory and many other diseases. A reliable gene transfer
   system via Agrobacterium rhizogenes and plant regeneration via hairy
   roots was established in O. vulgare for the first time. The frequency of
   induced hairy roots was different by modification of the co-cultivation
   medium elements after infection by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains K599
   and ATCC15834. High transformation frequency (91.3 \%) was achieved by
   co-cultivation of explants with A. rhizogenes on modified (MS) medium.
   The frequency of calli induction with an 81.5 \% was achieved from hairy
   roots on MS medium with 0.25 mg/L-1 2,4-D. For shoot induction,
   initiated calli was transferred into a medium containing various
   concentrations of BA (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg/L-1). The frequency
   of shoot generation (85.18 \%) was achieved in medium fortified with
   0.25 mg/L-1 of BA. Shoots were placed on MS medium with 0.25 mg/l IBA
   for root induction. Roots appeared and induction rate was achieved after

Title = {{Influence of graft size on spinal instability with anterior cervical
   plate fixation following in vitro flexion-distraction injuries}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating
   (ACDFP) is commonly used for the treatment of distractive-flexion
   cervical spine injuries. Despite the prevalence of ACDFP, there is
   little biomechanical evidence for graft height selection in the unstable
   trauma scenario.
   PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate whether changes in graft height
   affect the kinematics of instrumented ACDFP C5-C6 motion segments in the
   context of varying degrees of simulated facet injuries.
   STUDY DESIGN: In vitro cadaveric biomechanical study was used as study
   design.
   METHODS: Seven C5-C6 motion segments were mounted in a custom spine
   simulator and taken through flexibility testing in axial rotation,
   lateral flexion, and flexion-extension. Specimens were first tested
   intact, followed by a standardized injury model (SIM) for a unilateral
   facet perch at C5-C6. The stability of the ACDFP approach was then
   examined with three graft heights (computed tomography-measured disc
   space height, disc space height undersized by 2.5 mm, and disc space
   height oversized by 2.5 mm) within three increasing unstable injuries
   (SIM, an added unilateral facet fracture, and a simulated bilateral
   facet dislocation injury).
   RESULTS: In all motions, regardless of graft size, ACDFP reduced range
   of motion (ROM) from the SIM state. For flexion-extension, the oversized
   graft had a larger decrease in ROM compared with the other graft sizes
   (p<. 05). Between graft sizes and injury states, there were a number of
   interactions in axial rotation and lateral flexion, where specifically
   in the most severe injury, the undersized graft had a larger decrease in
   ROM than the other two sizes (p<. 05).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study found that graft size did affect the kinematic
   stability of ACDFP in a series of distractive-flexion injuries; the
   undersized graft resulted in both facet overlap and locking of the
   uncovertebral joints leading to decreased ROM in lateral bending and
   axial rotation, whereas an oversized graft provided larger ROM decreases
   in flexion-extension. As such, a graft that engages the uncovertebral
   joint may be more advantageous in providing a rigid environment for
   fusion with ACDFP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The universal fluorescent staining property of thiazole orange (TO) dye
   was adapted in order to be specific for G-quadruplex DNA structures,
   through the introduction of a styrene-like substituent at the
   ortho-position of the TO scaffold. This extraordinary outcome was
   determined from experimental studies and further explored through
   molecular docking studies. The molecular docking studies help understand
   how such a small substituent leads to remarkable fluorescent signal
   discrimination between G-quadruplex DNA and other types of nucleic
   acids. The results reveal that the modified dyes bind to the
   G-quadruplex or duplex DNA in a similar fashion as TO, but exhibit
   either enhanced or quenched fluorescent signal, which is determined by
   the spatial length and orientation of the substituent and has never been
   known. The new fluorescent dye modified with a p-(dimethylamino)styryl
   substituent offers 10-fold more selectivity toward telomeric
   G-quadruplexes than double-stranded DNA substrates. In addition, native
   PAGE experiments, FRET, CD analysis, and live cell imaging were also
   studied and demonstrated the potential applications of this class of
   thiazole-orange-based fluorescent probes in bioassays and cell imaging.}},

   computational modelling can correctly reproduce experimental product
   distributions, predicted reactivity trends and guide interpretation of
   electronic structures of complex systems. The case studies focus on the
   calculations of a variety of spectroscopic features of porphyrins and

Abstract = {{Therapeutic angiogenesis has emerged as a potential strategy to treat
   ischemic vascular diseases. However, systemic or local administration of
   growth factors is usually inefficient for maintaining the effective
   concentration at the site of interest due to their rapid clearance or
   degradation. In this study, we report a differential and sustained
   release of an angiogenic factor, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), and
   an arteriogenic factor, fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF9), from
   alpha-amino acid-derived biodegradable poly(ester amide) (PEA) fibers
   toward targeting neovessel formation and maturation. FGF2 and FGF9 were
   dual loaded using a mixed blend and emulsion electrospinning technique
   and exhibited differential and sustained release from PEA fibers over 28
   days with preserved bioactivity. In vitro angiogenesis assays showed
   enhanced endothelial cell (EC) tube formation and directed migration of
   smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB
   and stabilized EC/SMC tube formation. FGF2/FGF9-loaded PEA fibers did
   not induce inflammatory responses in vitro using human monocytes or in
   vivo after their subcutaneous implantation into mice. Histological
   examination showed that FGF2/FGF9-loaded fibers induced cell niche
   recruitment around the site of implantation. Furthermore, controlled in
   vivo delivery of FGF9 to mouse tibialis anterior (TA) muscle resulted in
   a dose-dependent expansion of mesenchymal progenitor-like cell layers
   and extracellular matrix deposition. Our data suggest that the release
   of FGF2 and FGF9 from PEA fibers offers an efficient differential and
   sustained growth factor delivery strategy with relevance to therapeutic
   angiogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Myringotomy refers to a surgical incision in the eardrum, and it is
   often followed by placement of a ventilation tube into the incision as
   part of the treatment of middle-ear infections. Although it is one of
   the first procedures learned by surgical residents in otolaryngology, it
   is difficult to master because of the need to work in the narrow
   confines of the ear canal under a microscope. Consequences of surgical
   errors include bleeding, trauma, and hearing loss. We previously
   introduced virtual reality (VR)-based simulators for training on various
   aspects of myringotomy; however, a complete simulator that includes an
   interactive microscope, speculum positioning, and tube placement has not
   been developed. In this paper, a VR-based simulator is implemented to
   simulate all surgical aspects of myrintogomy and tube placement. A
   unique aspect of this implementation is the use of a commercially
   available digital gaming engine to capitalize on its support for
   graphical rendering and physics computations. The simulated anatomy was
   derived from medical images and could be viewed in stereo 3D with
   photorealistic quality. A haptic arm co-located with the stereo scene
   was used to manipulate virtual surgical tools and to interact with the
   virtual ear with force feedback. Quantitative performance tests on the
   simulator demonstrate that the procedure can be simulated in real time.
   Qualitative feedback from instructing ear surgeons indicates that the
   models are anatomically accurate and contain all landmarks necessary for
   surgical training. Although initial impressions of simulated speculum
   placement, microscope positioning, eardrum cutting, and tube insertion
   are positive, extensive validation is planned to quantify realism and
   training effects.}},

Title = {{Crystallization of Esomeprazole Magnesium Water/Butanol Solvate}},
Journal = {{MOLECULES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The molecular structure of esomeprazole magnesium derivative in the
   solid-state is reported for the first time, along with a simplified
   crystallization pathway. The structure was determined using the single
   crystal X-ray diffraction technique to reveal the bonding relationships
   between esomeprazole heteroatoms and magnesium. The esomeprazole
   crystallization process was carried out in 1-butanol and water was
   utilized as anti-solvent. The product proved to be esomeprazole
   magnesium tetrahydrate with two 1-butanol molecules that crystallized in
   P6(3) space group, in a hexagonal unit cell. Complete characterization
   of a sample after drying was conducted by the use of powder X-ray
   diffraction (PXRD), H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS).
   Investigation by H-1-NMR and TGA has shown that the solvent content in
   the dried sample consists of two water molecules and 0.3 butanol
   molecules per esomeprazole magnesium molecule. This is different from
   the single crystal X-ray diffraction results and can be attributed to
   the loss of some water and 1-butanol molecules stabilized by
   intermolecular interactions. The title compound, after drying, is a true
   solvate in terms of water; conversely, 1-butanol fills the voids of the
   crystal lattice in non-stoichiometric amounts.}},

Title = {{Formation and Transformation Behavior of Sodium Dehydroacetate Hydrates}},
Journal = {{MOLECULES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The effect of various controlling factors on the polymorphic outcome of
   sodium dehydroacetate crystallization was investigated in this study.
   Cooling crystallization experiments of sodium dehydroacetate in water
   were conducted at different concentrations. The results revealed that
   the rate of supersaturation generation played a key role in the
   formation of the hydrates. At a high supersaturation generation rate, a
   new sodium dehydroacetate dihydrate needle form was obtained; on the
   contrary, a sodium dehydroacetate plate monohydrate was formed at a low
   supersaturation generation rate. Furthermore, the characterization and
   transformation behavior of these two hydrated forms were investigated
   with the combined use of microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD),
   Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermal
   gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   dynamic vapor sorption (DVS). It was found that the new needle crystals
   were dihydrated and hollow, and they eventually transformed into sodium
   dehydroacetate monohydrate. In addition, the mechanism of formation of
   sodium dehydroacetate hydrates was discussed, and a process growth model
   of hollow crystals in cooling crystallization was proposed.}},

Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{50}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Managing biosolids, the major by-product from wastewater treatment
   plants (WWTPs), persists as a widespread challenge that often
   constitutes the majority of WWTP operating costs. Self-sustained
   smouldering combustion is a new approach for organic waste treatment, in
   which the waste - the combustion fuel - is destroyed in an energy
   efficient manner after mixing it with sand. Smouldering has never been
   applied to biosolids. Column experiments, using biosolids obtained from
   a WWTP, were employed to identify if, and under what conditions,
   smouldering could be used for treating biosolids. The parameter space in
   which smouldering was self-sustaining was mapped as a function of key
   system metrics: (1) sand/biosolids mass fraction, (2) biosolids moisture
   content, and (3) forced air flux. It was found that a self-sustaining
   reaction is achievable using biosolids with water content as high as
   80\% (with a biosolids lower heating value greater than 1.6 kJ/g).
   Moreover, results suggest that operator-controlled air flux can assist
   in keeping the reaction self-sustaining in response to fluctuations in
   biosolids properties. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the potential
   for smouldering as a new energy efficient biosolids disposal method for
   very wet (i.e., minimally processed) biosolids that may offer WWTPs
   significant operating cost savings. This study emphasizes smouldering's
   usefulness as a novel waste management technique. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The suitability of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations on the
   built environment for the purpose of estimating average roughness
   characteristics and for studying wind flow patterns within the
   environment is assessed. Urban models of various levels of complexity
   are considered including an empty domain, array of obstacles arranged in
   regular and staggered manners, in-homogeneous roughness with multiple
   patches, a semi-idealized built environment, and finally a real built
   environment. For each of the test cases, we conducted CFD simulations
   using RANS turbulence closure and validated the results against
   appropriate methods: existing empirical formulas for the homogeneous
   roughness case, empirical wind speed models for the in-homogeneous
   roughness case, and wind tunnel tests for the semi-idealized built
   environment case. In general, results obtained from the CFD simulations
   show good agreement with the corresponding validation methods, thereby,
   giving further evidence to the suitability of CFD simulations for built
   environment studies consisting of wide-ranging roughness. This work also
   provides a comprehensive overview of roughness modeling in CFD-from the
   simplest approach of modeling roughness implicitly through wall
   functions to the most elaborate approach of modeling roughness
   explicitly for the sake of accurate wind flow simulations within the

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A multiple center milestone study of clinical vertebra segmentation is
   presented in this paper. Vertebra segmentation is a fundamental step for
   spinal image analysis and intervention. The first half of the study was
   conducted in the spine segmentation challenge in 2014 International
   Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention
   (MICCAI) Workshop on Computational Spine Imaging (CSI 2014). The
   objective was to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art
   vertebra segmentation algorithms on computed tomography (CT) scans using
   ten training and five testing dataset, all healthy cases; the second
   half of the study was conducted after the challenge, where additional 5
   abnormal cases are used for testing to evaluate the performance under
   abnormal cases. Dice coefficients and absolute surface distances were
   used as evaluation metrics. Segmentation of each vertebra as a single
   geometric unit, as well as separate segmentation of vertebra
   substructures, was evaluated. Five teams participated in the comparative
   study. The top performers in the study achieved Dice coefficient of 0.93
   in the upper thoracic, 0.95 in the lower thoracic and 0.96 in the lumbar
   spine for healthy cases, and 0.88 in the upper thoracic, 0.89 in the
   lower thoracic and 0.92 in the lumbar spine for osteoporotic and
   fractured cases. The strengths and weaknesses of each method as well as
   future suggestion for improvement are discussed. This is the first
   multi-center comparative study for vertebra segmentation methods, which
   will provide an up-to-date performance milestone for the fast growing
   spinal image analysis and intervention. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study sought to compare a new head impact-monitoring device, which
   is not limited to specific helmet styles, against reference
   accelerometer measurements. Laboratory controlled impacts were delivered
   using a linear pneumatic impactor to a Hybrid III headform (HIII) fitted
   with a football helmet and the impact monitoring device (gForce
   Tracker-GFT) affixed to the inside of the helmet. Linear regression
   analyses and absolute mean percent error (MAPE) were used to compare the
   head impact kinematics measured by the GFT to a reference accelerometer
   located at the HIII's center of mass. The coefficients of determination
   were strong for the peak linear acceleration, peak rotational velocity,
   and HIC15 across all impact testing locations (r (2) = 0.82, 0.94, and
   0.70, respectively), but there were large MAPE for the peak linear
   acceleration and HIC15 (MAPE = 49 +/- A 21\% and 108 +/- A 58\%). The
   raw GFT was accurate at measuring the peak rotational velocity at the
   center of mass of the HIII (MAPE = 9\%). Results from the impact testing
   were used to develop a correction algorithm. The coefficients of
   determination for all impact parameters improved using the correction
   algorithm for the GFT (r (2) > 0.97), and the MAPE were less than 14\%.
   The GFT appears to be a suitable impact-monitoring device that is not
   limited to specific styles of football helmets, however, correction
   algorithms will need to be developed for each helmet style.}},

Abstract = {{Developing suitable biomaterials for post-mastectomy or post-lumpectomy
   breast reconstruction is highly important. This study is aimed at
   evaluating biomechanical suitability of decellularized adipose tissue
   (DAT) for this purpose. The study involves computational experiments for
   evaluating deformation of the breast reconstructed using DAT under
   loading conditions pertaining to two common body position changes of
   prone-to-supine and prone-to-upright. This was conducted using nonlinear
   finite element models where the breast geometry was obtained from MRI
   image of a female breast. The experiments were performed using DAT
   sourced from various adipose tissue depots in comparison to natural
   adipose tissue. Data obtained from the conducted experiments showed no
   contour defects with various DAT materials for simulated post-mastectomy
   or post-lumpectomy breast reconstruction under the loading conditions.
   They also demonstrated that a breast reconstructed using DAT derived
   from the breast or subcutaneous abdominal depots exhibit significantly
   closer deformation, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to that of a
   normal breast under the same loading conditions. Similarity of DAT
   deformation to that of natural breast tissue in post-surgery breast
   reconstruction was assessed using nonlinear finite element analysis. Our
   results provide evidence that DAT derived from subcutaneous abdominal
   and breast depots yield more analogous deformation pattern to the
   natural tissue in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction applications.
   This is quite encouraging, as breast and subcutaneous adipose tissue can
   be readily obtained in large quantities from breast or abdominal
   lipo-reduction surgery procedures. Furthermore, in post-lumpectomy cases
   all DAT samples used in this research showed similar deformation, and
   thus are suitable as breast tissue substituents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) is a receptor for the ``eat me{''}
   signal, phosphatidylserine, on apoptotic cells. The specific
   upregulation of KIM-1 by injured tubular epithelial cells (TECs) enables
   them to clear apoptotic cells (also known as efferocytosis), thereby
   protecting from acute kidney injury. Recently, we uncovered that KIM-1
   binds directly to the alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric G(12) protein (G
   alpha(12)) and inhibits its activation by reactive oxygen species during
   renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (Ismail OZ, Zhang X, Wei J, Haig A,
   Denker BM, Suri RS, Sener A, Gunaratnam L. Am J Pathol 185: 1207-1215,
   2015). Here, we investigated the role that G alpha(12) plays in
   KIM-1-mediated efferocytosis by TECs. We showed that KIM-1 remains bound
   to G alpha(12) and suppresses its activity during phagocytosis. When we
   silenced G alpha(12) expression using small interefering RNA,
   KIM-1-mediated engulfment of apoptotic cells was increased
   significantly; in contrast overexpression of constitutively active G
   alpha(12) (QLG alpha(12)) resulted in inhibition of efferocytosis.
   Inhibition of RhoA, a key effector of G alpha(12), using a chemical
   inhibitor or expression of dominant-negative RhoA, had the same effect
   as inhibition of G alpha(12) on efferocytosis. Consistent with this,
   silencing G alpha(12) suppressed active RhoA in KIM-1-expressing cells.
   Finally, using primary TECs from Kim-1(+/+) and Kim-1(-/-) mice, we
   confirmed that engulfment of apoptotic cells requires KIM-1 expression
   and that silencing G alpha(12) enhanced efferocytosis by primary TECs.
   Our data reveal a previously unknown role for G alpha(12) in regulating
   efferocytosis and that renal TECs require KIM-1 to mediate this process.
   These results may have therapeutic implications given the known harmful
   role of G alpha(12) in acute kidney injury.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, adsorption equilibrium constants, dispersion coefficients,

   reaction of oleic acid with methanol, producing methyl oleate

   and catalyst in an HPLC column, which served as a packed bed reactor. A
   quasi-homogenous kinetic model coupled with a linear adsorption isotherm
   was explored. The elution profiles of the reactant and products were
   experimentally monitored and then compared with a mathematical model.
   The adsorption and kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the
   error between the experimentally obtained elution curves and the
   model-predicted values using the genetic algorithm optimization
   technique. Further experiments were conducted under varying conditions
   to establish the validity of the obtained model parameters. It was also
   found that the system is not affected by internal and external mass
   transfer resistances. The mathematical model predicted the experimental

Abstract = {{Vaginal epithelium is colonized by different bacterial strains and

   balance between health and disease. Little is known about the relative
   contribution of the epithelial and bacterial cell surfaces to bacterial
   adhesion and whether and how adhesion is regulated over cell membrane
   regions. Here, we show that bacterial adhesion forces with cell membrane
   regions not located above the nucleus are stronger than with regions
   above the nucleus both for vaginal pathogens and different commensal and
   probiotic lactobacillus strains involved in health. Importantly,
   adhesion force ratios over membrane regions away from and above the
   nucleus coincided with the ratios between numbers of adhering bacteria
   over both regions. Bacterial adhesion forces were dramatically decreased
   by depleting the epithelial cell membrane of cholesterol or sub-membrane
   cortical actin. Thus, epithelial cells can regulate membrane regions to
   which bacterial adhesion is discouraged, possibly to protect the
   nucleus.}},

Title = {{Modeling of Nonstationary Winds and Its Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A model is proposed to represent nonstationary fluctuating winds based
   on the concept of instantaneous power spectrum representation and
   amplitude modulation to model the fluctuating winds with time-varying
   mean wind speed. This results in the nonstationary fluctuating winds at
   a point to be characterized by a power spectral density function with a
   frequency modulation; it is proposed and shown that the frequency
   modulation can be assigned based on a time transformation defined
   through a dimensionless distance traveled by the winds that is
   calculated using the mean wind speed. In essence, nonstationary
   fluctuating winds are obtained by mapping the stationary fluctuating
   winds through a nonlinear time transformation and by applying an
   amplitude modulation. The proposed model is employed to simulate
   nonstationary winds for parametric investigation of the peak
   displacement of linear and nonlinear inelastic single-degree-of-freedom
   systems. It is shown that a structure designed by neglecting ductility
   capacity and/or for stationary winds of 10 to 60min has an unaccounted
   capacity to sustain nonstationary winds with a maximum mean wind speed
   that can be much greater than that for stationary winds. The use of the
   proposed model to represent the incoherent nonstationary fluctuating
   wind fields is also explored. An illustrative example focused on the
   fluctuating downburst winds at a few points within the downburst wind
   field is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The flow of a slipping fluid jet is examined theoretically as it emerges
   from a channel at moderate Reynolds number. The ratio of the slip length
   to the channel width S is assumed to he of order one, one order of
   magnitude larger than the perturbation parameter epsilon = Re-1/2, Re
   being the Reynolds number. Poiseuille flow conditions are assumed to
   prevail far upstream from the exit. The problem is solved using the
   method of matched asymptotic expansions. A similarity solution is
   obtained in the inner layer of the free surface, with the outer layer
   extending to the jet centreline. The inner layer thickness grows like
   root x/Re S. A slipping jet is found to contract like x/Re very near and
   far from the channel exit, but does not have a definite behaviour in
   between compared to (x/Re)(1/3) for an adhering jet, x being the
   distance from the channel exit. Eventually, the jet reaches uniform
   conditions far downstream. As in the case of entry flow there is a rapid
   departure in flow behaviour for a slipping jet from the S = 0. This
   rapid change is notably observed in the drop of boundary-layer
   thickness, ease in exit and relaxation lengths as well as in jet width
   with slip length. Finally, the connections with microchannel and
   hydrophobic flows are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{Biofuels and biomaterials are gaining increased attention because of
   their ecofriendly nature and renewable precursors. Biochar is a
   recalcitrant carbonaceous product obtained from pyrolysis of biomass and
   other biogenic wastes. Biochar has found many notable applications in
   diverse areas because of its versatile physicochemical properties. Some
   of the promising biochar applications discussed in this paper include
   char gasification and combustion for energy production, soil
   remediation, carbon sequestration, catalysis, as well as development of
   activated carbon and specialty materials with biomedical and industrial
   uses. The pyrolysis temperature and heating rates are the limiting
   factors that determine the biochar properties such as fixed carbon,
   volatile matter, mineral phases, surface area, porosity and pore size
   distribution, alkalinity, electrical conductivity, cation-exchange
   capacity, etc. A broad investigation of these properties determining
   biochar application is rare in literature. With this objective, this
   paper comprehensively reviews the evolution of biochar from several
   lignocellulosic biomasses influenced by pyrolysis temperature and
   heating rate. Lower pyrolysis temperatures produce biochar with higher
   yields, and greater levels of volatiles, electrical conductivity and
   cation-exchange capacity. Conversely, higher temperatures generate
   biochar with a greater extent of aromatic carbon, alkalinity and surface
   area with microporosity. Nevertheless, this coherent review summarizes
   the valorization potentials of biochar for various environmental,
   industrial and biomedical applications.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a practical robust controller that solves the
   problem of accurate motion control of ultrasonic motors (USMs) over
   prolonged durations, where temperature increases pose a significant
   challenge. This paper focuses on USMs with driver circuits that have a
   single user-controllable input. Prior to developing the robust
   controller, a nonlinear model of the system was identified by
   experimentally measuring the temporal relationship between motor speed
   and temperature to the applied input control signal. A linear
   approximation of this model was used to design two robust inverse
   dynamic controllers: one used temperature feedback and the other did
   not. Both control methods were implemented on a custom designed embedded
   control system and achieved highly consistent and accurate performance
   while under load over a range of working frequencies. Step-response
   experiments (1 rad) demonstrated a rise time of 0.1 s without any
   overshoot or steady-state error. A normalized RMSE below 3\% with a
   delay of 25 ms was achieved for reference inputs with frequencies up to
   1 Hz. This performance was maintained during prolonged continuous
   dynamic operation of several minutes, despite the great variation in the
   motor's dynamics due to the temperature effects (over a range of 25
   degrees C-45 degrees C) and modeling uncertainties.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and fast segmentation and volume estimation of the prostate
   gland in magnetic resonance (MR) images are necessary steps in the
   diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of prostate cancer. This paper
   presents an algorithm for the prostate gland volume estimation based on
   the semi-automated segmentation of individual slices in T2-weighted MR
   image sequences. The proposed sequential registration-based segmentation
   (SRS) algorithm, which was inspired by the clinical workflow during
   medical image contouring, relies on inter-slice image registration and
   user interaction/correction to segment the prostate gland without the
   use of an anatomical atlas. It automatically generates contours for each
   slice using a registration algorithm, provided that the user edits and
   approves the marking in some previous slices. We conducted comprehensive
   experiments to measure the performance of the proposed algorithm using
   three registration methods (i.e., rigid, affine, and nonrigid). Five
   radiation oncologists participated in the study where they contoured the
   prostate MR (T2-weighted) images of 15 patients both manually and using
   the SRS algorithm. Compared to the manual segmentation, on average, the
   SRS algorithm reduced the contouring time by 62 \% (a speedup factor of
   2.64x) while maintaining the segmentation accuracy at the same level as
   the intra-user agreement level (i.e., Dice similarity coefficient of 91
   versus 90 \%). The proposed algorithm exploits the inter-slice
   similarity of volumetric MR image series to achieve highly accurate
   results while significantly reducing the contouring time.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile learning (m-Learning) is considered to be one of the fastest
   growing learning platforms. The immense interest in m-Learning is
   attributed to the incredible rate of growth of mobile technology and its
   proliferation into every aspect of modern life. Despite this, m-Learning
   has not experienced a similar adoption rate in the education sector,
   chiefly higher education. Researchers have attempted to explain this
   anomaly by conducting several studies in the area. However, mostly the
   research in m-Learning is examined from the perspective of the students
   and educators. In this research, it is contended that there is a third
   important stakeholder group whose opinion is equally important in
   determining the success of m-Learning: the university management.
   Although diversified by nature, heads of departments, deans, and
   information technology system administrators are nevertheless considered
   members of any university management. The results of the research show
   that university commitment to m-Learning, university learning practices,
   and change management practices were the factors critical to the success
   of m-Learning, from the university management perspective.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The liquefaction behavior and cyclic resistance ratio (CRR) of
   reconstituted samples of non-plastic silt and sandy silts with 50\% and
   75\% silt content are examined using constant-volume cyclic and
   monotonic ring shear tests along with bender element shear wave velocity
   (V-s) measurements. Liquefaction occurred at excess pore water pressure
   ratios (r(u)) between 0.6 and 0.7 associated with cumulative cyclic
   shear strains (gamma) of 4\% to 7\%, after which cyclic liquefaction
   ensued with very large shear strains and excess pore water pressure
   ratio (r(u) > 0.8). The cyclic ring shear tests demonstrate that cyclic
   resistance ratio of silt and sandy silts decreases with increasing void
   ratio, or with decreasing silt content at a certain void ratio. The
   results also show good agreement with those from cyclic direct simple
   shear tests on silts and sandy silts. A unique correlation is developed
   for estimating CRR of silts and sandy silts (with more than 50\% silt
   content) from stress-normalized shear wave velocity measurements (V-s1)
   with negligible effect of silt content. The results indicate that the
   existing CRR-V-s1 correlations would underestimate the liquefaction
   resistance of silts and sandy silt soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study reviews the literature on the dynamic response of a
   Transmission Line (TL) system under synoptic wind (conventional
   atmospheric boundary layer) as well as non-synoptic wind loading
   (down-bursts). Gust-induced response for the conductors and the towers
   are covered and the limitations in the current structural design codes
   for wind loading are identified. Three main sections are considered in
   this study covering synoptic wind loading, downburst, and main
   conclusions and recommendations. For the case of synoptic wind events,
   four design codes (ASCE 74 2010, AS/NZS 2010, BS 2001, IEC 2003)
   specialized in TLs are considered for comparison. Using the ASCE 74 as a
   datum for normalization, a code ratio (CR) is evaluated for various
   parameters to assess the discrepancy between the codes. The code ratio
   for conductor forces CRFC is found to be ranging between 0.81 and 1.44.
   For tower forces code ratio CRFt, a discrepancy range of 0.68 and 1.85
   is noticed. The study highlights the main reasons behind these
   discrepancies. For the case of downbursts, the study reveals that the
   event's size and its relative location to the tower lead to a number of
   critical load cases that need to be considered. The study provides
   important design considerations for both synoptic and non-synoptic
   winds. At the end of the study, a list of the main gaps existing in
   current design codes and recommendations to fill out these gaps is
   provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several well-known equations for estimating the crack length in the
   single-edge notched bending (SE(B)) specimens from the normalized crack
   mouth opening displacement (CMOD) compliance are evaluated based on
   two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) finite element analyses
   (FEAs). Two-dimensional FEAs are first carried out to verify the
   reported accuracy and applicable ranges for each equation based on the
   plane strain models with six different crack lengths. Three-dimensional
   FEAs are then carried out to estimate the errors of prediction of
   equations that evaluate the crack length from the plane stress-and plane
   strain-based CMOD compliances. Both plane-sided and side-grooved models
   are included in 3D FEAs and have seven different thickness-to-width
   ratios. The error of prediction of a given equation is largely impacted
   by the thickness-to-width ratio, the crack length, the presence of side
   grooves, and the use of the plane stress-or plane strain-normalized CMOD
   compliance. Based on the errors of prediction, the relevance of the
   actual state of stress in the ligament of the SE(B) specimens to the
   plane strain condition or the plane stress condition is inferred.
   Knowledge of the relevance of the plane stress condition or the plane
   strain condition can be used to select the corresponding CMOD compliance
   in crack length-CMOD equations, and, therefore, the corresponding
   predictive accuracy can be improved.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{206}},
Pages = {{77-85}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Lipid extracted algae (LEA) is an attractive feedstock for alcohol fuel
   production as it is a non-food crop which is largely composed of readily
   fermented carbohydrates like starch rather than the more recalcitrant
   lignocellulosic materials currently under intense development. This
   study compares the suitability of ionic liquid extracted algae (ILEA)
   and hexane extracted algae (HEA) for acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE)
   fermentation. The highest butanol titers (8.05 g L-1) were achieved with
   the fermentation of the acid hydrolysates of HEA, however, they required
   detoxification to support product formation after acid hydrolysis while
   ILEA did not. Direct ABE fermentation of ILEA and HEA (without
   detoxification) starches resulted in a butanol titer of 4.99 and 6.63 g
   L-1, respectively, which significantly simplified the LEA to butanol
   process. The study demonstrated the compatibility of producing biodiesel
   and butanol from a single feedstock which may help reduce the feedstock
   costs of each individual process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Agglomeration of bed materials at high temperature is one of the most
   important and challenging problems for fluidized-bed biomass boilers for
   thermal/power generation. Inorganic alkali components from the fuel can
   be problematic as they form low-melting alkali compounds. In the present
   study, the critical amount of liquid (molten ash in real biomass boiler
   operations) that would result in severe bed agglomeration and
   defluidization was studied in a small pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed
   (BFB) rig, operated at elevated temperatures (415-420 degrees C) using
   low melting-point salt (KOH) to simulate molten ash. In the BFB
   fluidization system tested, the critical liquid amount of simulate
   molten ash that could cause the bed materials start to form
   agglomeration/channeling, and form severe agglomeration/channeling (poor
   fluidization) is approx. 0.5 wt.\% and 0.8 wt.\% at a lower fluidizing
   gas velocity (3.9 U-mf) and a higher fluidizing gas velocity (5.9 U-mf),
   respectively. With more low melting -point compound (KOH) present in the
   BFB, more agglomerates of bed material are formed. Increasing the amount
   of liquid could change the fluidization behavior of group B (bubbling)
   particles towards group A (Aerated) and even C (Cohesive) depending on
   the amount of the low-melting-point compound in the bed material. (C)

Abstract = {{Some pedestrian evacuation studies have employed game strategy to deal
   with moving conflicts involving two or three pedestrians. However, most
   of these have simply presented game strategies for pedestrians without
   analyzing the reasons why they choose to defect or cooperate. We believe
   that selfish and selfless behaviors are two main factors that should be
   considered in evacuation. In addition to these behaviors, human emotions
   such as sympathy and behaviors such as vying were also taken into
   account to investigate their impacts on pedestrians' strategies.
   Moreover, an essential objective factor, the building design factor of
   door width was tested and analyzed. Experimental results showed that the
   sense of self leads to more defectors and a longer evacuation time.
   However, sympathy does some good, leading to more cooperators and a
   shorter evacuation time. Moreover, the exit door width is an essential
   factor of the evacuation efficiency. When the width was less than 6
   cells in a rectangular room with a size greater than 50 x 50, the
   evacuation time greatly decreased when the width increased. However,
   this effect was less obvious when the width increased. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The exponential growth of biodiesel industries all around the world has
   produced a large amount of glycerol as a byproduct, which must be
   valorized for the sustainability of the biodiesel industry. Ketalization
   of glycerol with acetone to synthesize solketal-a potential fuel
   additive is one of the most promising routes for valorization of
   glycerol. In this article, state-of-the-art of glycerol ketalization is
   reviewed, focusing on innovative and potential technologies towards
   sustainable production of solketal. The glycerol ketalization processes
   developed in both batch and continuous reactors and performance of some
   typical catalysts are compared. The mechanisms for the acid-catalyzed
   conversion of glycerol into solketal are presented. The main operation
   issues related to catalytic conversion of crude glycerol in a
   continuous-flow process and the direct use of crude glycerol are
   discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions of diisobutyl dithiophosphinate with bare
   (un-activated) and lead -activated sphalerite were studied both
   experimentally and through DFT simulations. Sphalerite activated by lead
   in acidic and alkaline conditions showed considerably greater affinity
   for diisobutyl dithiophosphinate adsorption than bare sphalerite.
   Experimental observations supported by DFT simulations concur in that
   attachment of the solvated collector to the activated sphalerite surface
   is through adsorbed lead cations or lead hydroxides where as for the
   bare sphalerite, the collector was most stable in its solvated state and
   not as an adsorbed specie. Accounting for solvation effects by including
   a swarm of water molecules in DFT simulations was necessary to infer
   plausible surface interactions between collector, solvent, and bare or
   lead-activated sphalerite. The experimental data and DFT simulations
   indicate, affinity of the collector toward surface-adsorbed lead species
   was predicted to form stable covalent bonds between collector sulfur
   atoms and lead. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of social media environments that enable consumers to engage
   with a brand publicly is of increasing interest to marketers. In
   particular, contests in which consumers create user-generated content
   (UGC) offer the potential of actively engaging consumers with a brand
   and thereby directly affecting consumer purchases. This research
   demonstrates that prompting consumers to create UGC that engages
   consumers in actively thinking about or elaborating on a personal goal
   that is relevant to a brand does affect actual buying decisions. It
   shows that the impact of this engagement via content elaboration is not
   accounted for by mere participation in the social media activity or
   rewards offered to participants. The research adds to the growing
   literature on the importance of consumer engagement and validates the
   link between engagement and actual purchase behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{The unique optical properties of arrays of metallic nanoparticles are of
   great interest for many applications such as in optical data storage,
   sensing applications, optoelectronic devices or as platforms to increase
   the detection limit in spectroscopic measurements. Nonlinear optical
   phenomena can also be altered by metallic nanostructures opening new
   possible applications. In this work, arrays composed of
   non-centrosymmetric individual structures with three fold axial symmetry
   made of gold are designed and fabricated using electron beam
   lithography. The nonlinear optical properties of these structures are
   investigated using second-harmonic generation microscopy (SHGM) with a
   femtosecond excitation source set near the plasmon resonance frequency.
   Modeling of the electromagnetic field distribution around the metallic
   structures is performed using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
   method, highlighting the confinement of the SHG signal and its
   polarization dependence. Polarization-resolved measurements are
   conducted to correlate the SHG signal with the structure and symmetry of
   the individual nanostructures. Since both two-photon induced
   photoluminescence (TPPL) and SHG signals are produced upon excitation of
   these structures, lifetime measurements are performed to further
   evaluate the magnitude of these two effects.}},

Abstract = {{The photocatalytic degradation of Ofloxacin (OFL) was studied in aqueous
   solution using co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The catalyst samples were
   synthesized by sol-gel method from Titanium isopropoxide using different
   concentration of Bi and Ni metal as dopant. The co-doped catalysts were
   characterized by (X-ray Diffraction) XRD, (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) BET,
   (Scanning electron microscope) SEM and (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy)
   EDS. The results revealed that the catalyst possessed spherical
   morphology and excellent crystalline properties. The surface area of the
   catalyst was found to be 74, 55 and 18.66 m(2)/g for 0.25 wt\%, 0.5 wt\%
   and 1.0 wt\% dopant concentration, respectively. Photocatalytic
   capability of Bi/Ni co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were estimated by means
   of OFL degradation under different light sources. Parameters affecting
   the photocatalytic process such as type of catalyst, dopant
   concentration, catalyst concentration, different light sources and
   solution pH have been explored. The photo degradation kinetics follows a
   pseudo first-order reaction. Bi-Ni co-doped TiO2 showed higher activity
   for photocatalytic degradation of OFL under solar light compared to
   Degussa TiO2. The photo-degradation process was optimized using 25 mg/L
   Ofloxacin with dopant concentration of 0.25 wt\% and catalyst dose of
   1.5 g/L. Degradation efficiency of 86\% was attained at pH 3 after 6 h
   of solar irradiations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced method for the degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) over
   Pd/MCM-41 catalysts through a hydrogen-transfer was investigated. Formic
   acid (FA) was used instead of gaseous H-2 as the hydrogen resource. As a
   model H-carrier compound, FA has proven to yield less by-products and
   second-hand pollution during the reaction. Several factors have been
   studied, including: the property of catalyst supports, Pd loading and
   size, temperature, initial concentrations of FA and TCE (potential
   impact on the reaction rates of TCE degradation), and FA decomposition.
   The intrinsic kinetics for TCE degradation were measured, while the
   apparent activation energies and the reaction orders with respect to TCE
   and FA were calculated through power law models. On the basis of
   kinetics, we assumed a plausible reaction pathway for TCE degradation in
   which the catalytic degradation of TCE is most likely the

Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Thrombin plays a key role in thrombosis and hemostasis. The abnormal
   level of thrombin in body fluids may lead to different diseases, such as
   rheumatoid arthritis, glomerulonephritis, etc. Detection of thrombin
   level in blood and/or urine is one of important methods for medical
   diagnosis. Here, a bioluminescent sensor is developed for non-invasively
   and rapidly detecting thrombin in urine. The sensor is assembled through
   conjugating gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and a recombinant protein
   containing Renilla luciferase (pRluc) by a peptide, which is thrombin
   specific substrate. The luciferase-catalyzed bioluminescence can be
   quenched by peptide-conjugating Au NPs. In the presence of thrombin, the
   short peptide conjugating luciferase and Au NPs is digested and cut off,
   which results in the recovery of bioluminescence due to the release of
   luciferase from Au NPs. The bioluminescence intensity at 470 nm is
   observed, and increases with increasing concentration of thrombin. The
   bioluminescence intensity of this designed sensor is significantly
   recovered when the thrombin digestion time lasts for 10 min. In
   addition, a similar linear relationship between luminescence intensity
   and the concentration of thrombin is found in the range of 8 nM to 8 mu
   Mu in both buffer and human urine spiked samples. The limit of detection
   is as low as 80 pM. It is anticipated that our nanosensor could be a
   promising tool for clinical diagnosis of thrombin in human urine. (C)

Abstract = {{We employ renormalization group (RG) summation techniques to obtain
   portions of Laplace QCD sum rules for scalar gluon currents beyond the
   order to which they have been explicitly calculated. The first two of
   these sum rules are considered in some detail, and it is shown that they
   have significantly less dependence on the renormalization scale
   parameter mu(2) once the RG summation is used to extend the perturbative
   results. Using the sum rules, we then compute the bound on the scalar
   glueball mass and demonstrate that the 3 and 4-Loop perturbative results
   form lower and upper bounds to their RG summed counterparts. We further
   demonstrate improved convergence of the RG summed expressions with
   respect to perturbative results. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{As the next generation digital TV (DTV) standard, the ATSC 3.0 system is
   developed to provide significant improvements on the spectrum
   efficiency, the service reliability, the system flexibility, and system
   forward compatibility. One of the top-priority requirements for the ATSC
   3.0 is the capability to deliver reliable mobile TV services to a large
   variety of mobile and indoor devices. Layered-division-multiplexing
   (LDM) is a physical-layer non-orthogonal-multiplexing technology to
   efficiently deliver multiple services with different robustness and
   throughputs in one TV channel. A two-layer LDM structure is accepted by
   ATSC 3.0 as a baseline physical-layer technology. This LDM system is
   capable of delivering robust high-definition (HD) mobile TV and
   ultra-HDTV services in one 6 MHz channel, with a higher spectrum
   efficiency than the traditional time/frequency-division-multiplexing
   (T/FDM)-based DTV systems. This paper presents a detailed overview on
   the LDM technology, and its application in the ATSC 3.0 systems. First,
   the fundamental advantages of the LDM over the traditional TDM/FDM
   systems are analyzed from information theory point of view. The
   performance advantages of the LDM are then confirmed by extensive
   simulations of the ATSC 3.0 system. It is shown that, LDM can realize
   the potential gain offered by superposition coding over the TDM/FDM
   systems, by properly configuring the transmission power, channel coding,
   and modulation, and using different multiple antenna technologies in the
   multiple layers. Next, the efficient implementation of LDM in the ATSC
   3.0 system is presented to show that the performance advantages of the
   LDM are obtained with small additional complexity. This is achieved by
   carefully aligning the transmission signal structure and the signal
   processing chains in the multiple layers. Finally, we show that the LDM
   can be further integrated with different multiple antenna technologies
   to achieve further transmission capacity.}},

Title = {{An In Vitro Hemodynamic Flow System to Study the Effects of Quantified
   Shear Stresses on Endothelial Cells}},
Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{44-57}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Numerous in vitro systems have previously been developed and employed
   for studying the effects of hemodynamics on endothelial cell (EC)
   dysfunction. In the majority of that work, accurate flow quantification
   (e.g., uniformity of the flow over the ECs) remains elusive and wall
   shear stress (WSS) quantifications are determined using theoretical
   relationships (without considering the flow channel aspect ratio
   effects). In addition, those relationships are not applicable to flows
   other than steady laminar cases. The present work discusses the
   development of a novel hemodynamic flow system for studying the effects
   of various well-quantified flow regimes over ECs. The current work
   presents a novel hemodynamic flow system applying the concept of a
   parallel plate flow chamber (PPFC) with live microscopy access for
   studying the effects of quantified WSS on ECs. A range of steady
   laminar, pulsatile (carotid wave form) and low-Reynolds number turbulent
   WSSs were quantified through velocity field measurements by a laser
   Doppler velocimetry (LDV) system, to validate the functionality of the
   current hemodynamic flow system. Uniformity of the flow across the
   channel width can be analyzed with the current system (e.g., the flow
   was uniform across about 65-75\% of the channel width for the steady
   cases). The WSS obtained from the experiments had higher values in
   almost all of the cases when compared to the most commonly-used
   theoretical solution (9\%<error<16\%), whereas another relationship,
   which considers the channel dimensions, had better agreement with the
   experimental results (1\%<error<8\%). Additionally, the latter
   relationship predicted the uniform flow region in the PPFC with an
   average difference of <5\% when compared to the experimental results.
   The experimental data also showed that the WSS at various locations (D,
   E and F) at the test section differed by less than 4\% for the laminar
   cases representing a fully developed flow. WSS was also determined for a
   low-Re (Re = 2750) turbulent flow using (1) the Reynolds shears stress
   and (2) the time-averaged velocity profile gradient at the wall, with a
   good agreement (differences <16\%) between the two where the first
   method returned a higher value than the second. Porcine aortic
   endothelial cell (PAEC) viability in the system and morphological cell
   response to laminar WSS of about 11 dyne/cm(2), were observed. These
   results provide performance validation of this novel in vitro system
   with many improved features compared to previous similar prototypes for
   investigation of flow effects on ECs. The integration of the LDV
   technique in the current study and the comparison of the results with
   those from theory revealed that great care must be taken when using
   PPFCs since the commonly used theoretical relation for laminar steady
   flows is unable to predict the flow uniformity (which may introduce
   significant statistical bias in biological studies) and the predicted
   WSS was subjected to greater error when compared to a more comprehensive
   equation presented in the current work. Moreover, application of the LDV
   technique in the current system is essential for studies of more complex
   cases, such as disturbed flows, where the WSS cannot be predicted using
   theoretical or numerical modelling methods.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of flow in the human lung is of great practical interest as a
   means to study the detailed flow patterns within the airways for many
   physiological applications. While computational simulation techniques
   are quite mature, lung simulations are particularly complicated due to
   the vast separation of length scales between upper airways and alveoli.
   Many past studies have presented numerical results for truncated airway
   trees, however, there are significant difficulties in connecting such
   results with respiratory airway models. This article presents a new
   modeling paradigm for flow in the full lung, based on a conjugate
   fluid-porous formulation where the upper airway is considered as a fluid
   region with the remainder of the lung being considered as a coupled
   porous region. Results are presented for a realistic lung geometry
   obtained from computed tomography (CT) images, which show the method's
   potential as being more efficient and practical than attempting to
   directly simulate flow in the full lung.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results of the truck-induced wind gust pressure were used
   as the basis to develop the equivalent static truck-induced wind
   pressure for fatigue design in the American Association of State Highway

   development discuss the implied reliability. No recommendation is given
   to consider truck-induced pressure for fatigue design in the Canadian
   Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). This study quantifies the stress
   range due to truck traffic, and calibrates the equivalent static
   truck-induced wind pressure for fatigue design of overhead steel sign
   support structures. The reliability-based calibration is focused on the
   CHBDC. For the vertical excitations, the calibrated pressure is less
   than 50\% of that suggested in the AASHTO. For the horizontal
   excitations, the calibrated pressure can be greater or smaller than that
   for the site-dependent natural wind gusts. Therefore, the truck-induced
   horizontal wind pressure could govern the fatigue design for some sites.}},

Abstract = {{Current approaches to facial reconstruction are based on the assumption
   of facial symmetry, though this has yet to be established in the
   literature. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, symmetry of
   normal, male faces is examined here using the zygomatic complex as a
   bellwether for the rest of the facial skeleton. Three-dimensional models
   reconstructed from the computed tomography scans of 30 adult male
   patients displaying normal facial skeletal anatomy were analyzed. Seven
   zygomatic landmarks were identified on all craniofacial models, and
   asymmetry scores were calculated based on the average deviation distance
   upon reflection of 1 hemiface across the midfacial plane. Deviation maps
   were then generated for each zygomatic pair to enable visualization of
   the asymmetry. All landmarks displayed a slight (<3 mm) deviation from
   perfect symmetry, and analysis of zygomatic form asymmetry revealed an
   average of 0.4mm of surface deviation between hemifaces. The presence of
   such slight asymmetries in the zygoma warrants further investigation as
   to the clinical relevance of such skeletal asymmetries from both an
   esthetic and biomechanical consideration to provide insight as to the
   proper approach to zygomatic restoration in cases of zygomatic fracture.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{369-391}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Electricity is transmitted by transmission lines from the source of
   production to the distribution system and then to the end users. Failure
   of a transmission line can lead to devastating economic losses and to
   negative social consequences resulting from the interruption of
   electricity. A comprehensive in-house numerical model that combines the
   data of computational fluid dynamic simulations of tornado wind fields
   with three dimensional nonlinear structural analysis modelling of the
   transmission lines (conductors and ground-wire) is used in the current
   study. Many codes of practice recommend neglecting the tornado forces
   acting on the conductors and ground-wires because of the complexity in
   predicting the conductors' response to such loads. As such, real
   transmission line systems are numerically simulated and then analyzed
   with and without the inclusion of the lines to assess the effect of
   tornado loads acting on conductors on the overall response of
   transmission towers. In addition, the behaviour of the conductors under
   the most critical tornado configuration is described. The sensitivity of
   the lines' behaviour to the magnitude of tornado loading, the level of
   initial sag, the insulator's length, and lines self-weight is
   investigated. Based on the current study results, a recommendation is
   made to consider conductors and ground-wires in the analysis and design
   of transmission towers under the effect of tornado wind loads.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{48-56}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Air jet impingement is an effective enhanced heat transfer technique
   which has been widely applied in cooling of electronic components and
   drying of continuous sheets of materials, etc. Although steady and
   unsteady impingement systems have led to many studies on jet impingement
   flow and heat transfer, the vast majority of them focus on smooth
   surfaces. As the flow and thermal physics of jet impingement on a rough
   surface are significantly different from that on a smooth surface, a
   numerical study was performed on the two-dimensional air jet impingement
   with a model rough surface by computational fluid dynamics method. A
   sinusoidal wave was employed to model the rough impinging target surface
   subjected to a slot jet nozzle. A dimensionless heat transfer
   enhancement factor was introduced to quantify the effect of jet flow
   Reynolds number, jet impingement dimension, and surface roughness as
   well as temperature difference between jet flow and impinging target on
   the heat transfer of jet impingement. It is observed that the roughness
   effect is minimal in the impingement zone while it is prominent in the
   wall jet region, and the surface roughness plays a dominant role on the
   enhancement factor of heat transfer rate compared with jet geometrical
   dimension, Reynolds number of jet flow as well as temperature
   difference. Furthermore, entropy generation analysis was also performed
   on the heat and mass transfer in air jet impingement, and optimal
   designs were found with entropy generation minimization principle
   accordingly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Complex variable-structure systems (CVSSs) are a common type of complex
   systems that exhibit changes both at structural and behavior levels.
   Simulations of CVSSs challenge current collaborative execution methods

   paradigm presents an exciting opportunity to address such challenge, so
   an advanced parallel simulator under multi-core environments is
   proposed. The simulator: (1) provides thread simulation kernels and five
   kinds of management services to support dynamic model structure
   flexibly; (2) can explore both inherent and dynamic parallelism among
   models based on interaction relations, and employ the multi-thread
   paradigm to gain good speedup; (3) adopts an efficient dynamic
   load-balancing method, which can migrate models among cores with very
   low cost and support dynamic core allocation on demand, to address
   evident load-imbalance problems brought by variable-structure. The
   experiments show that structure changes can be supported while up to 23
   \% performance increase can be gained.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical algorithm has been formulated for calculating
   the charge magnitude on a spherical droplet created by breakup of a
   cylindrical ligament in an external electric field. The algorithm is
   based on the finite-element method and it determines the droplet charge
   as a function of the droplet radius and ligament length. It has been
   found that the droplet charge is a function of particle radius to some
   exponent, which is equal to 2 when the droplet is in direct contact with
   the atomizer and decreases dramatically to approach 1.1, as the ligament
   length increases. The effect of the ligament radius on the charging
   level has been found to be significant and increases with the ligament
   length. It was determined that the charging level is affected by the
   presence of adjacent ligaments and previously ejected droplets. To
   investigate the dynamics of the droplet atomization, the Navier-Stokes
   equations, describing the fluid motion, as well as the level-set
   equation for tracking the interfaces between air and liquid have been
   solved. A comparison between the charging level of the dynamically
   formed droplets and an assumed spherical one has been presented. It has
   been found that the predicted charging level of the spherical droplet is
   lower than the one of the actual shape in the range 15\%-26\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) for a dc
   distribution system for power system integration of plug-in electric
   vehicles (PEVs). The dc distribution system is intended to integrate
   electric vehicles in a parking lot with an ac grid through bidirectional
   dc-dc converters (battery chargers) and a central voltage-sourced
   converter. Using an online constrained optimization algorithm, the
   proposed EMS manages the power flow within the dc system. Thus, the PEV
   owners can charge or discharge their batteries based on the
   state-of-charge of the batteries and their upcoming trip plans. The EMS
   offers two energy exchange options to the PEV owners: 1) the fast energy
   exchange option for the owners wishing to minimize the energy exchange
   time; and 2) the optimal energy exchange option for the owners intend to
   either minimize their costs of charging or maximize their revenues
   through selling their stored energy. The proposed EMS seamlessly handles

Abstract = {{Pulmonary x-ray computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) research and development has been motivated, in part, by the quest
   to subphenotype common chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD). For thoracic CT and MRI, the main COPD
   research tools, disease biomarkers are being validated that go beyond
   anatomy and structure to include pulmonary functional measurements such
   as regional ventilation, perfusion, and inflammation. In addition, there
   has also been a drive to improve spatial and contrast resolution while
   at the same time reducing or eliminating radiation exposure. Therefore,
   this review focuses on our evolving understanding of patient-relevant
   and clinically important COPD endpoints and how current and emerging MRI
   and CT tools and measurements may be exploited for their identification,
   quantification, and utilization. Since reviews of the imaging physics of
   pulmonary CT and MRI and reviews of other COPD imaging methods were
   previously published and well-summarized, we focus on the current
   clinical challenges in COPD and the potential of newly emerging MR and
   CT imaging measurements to address them. Here we summarize MRI and CT
   imaging methods and their clinical translation for generating
   reproducible and sensitive measurements of COPD related to pulmonary
   ventilation and perfusion as well as parenchyma morphology. The key
   clinical problems in COPD provide an important framework in which
   pulmonary imaging needs to rapidly move in order to address the
   staggering burden, costs, as well as the mortality and morbidity
   associated with COPD.}},

Abstract = {{The trend of integrating more nondispatchable renewable sources into the
   electric grid and phasing out dispatchable fossil-fueled power plants in
   the near future reduces the operational flexibility, increases the
   chance of transmission congestion, and endangers the stability of
   electric system. Utilities are investigating the application of
   large-scale energy storage systems (ESSs) to address some of these
   imminent challenges to their power systems. In this paper, the
   application of privately owned large-scale ESSs for the purpose of
   congestion relief in transmission systems as an ancillary service is
   investigated. It is demonstrated that in conventional optimal dispatch
   algorithms for an ESS, the storage system cannot effectively contribute
   to congestion relief since the dispatch algorithm has not prepared the
   ESS in advance. Hence, a new real-time optimal dispatch (RTOD) algorithm
   is proposed that aims to generate revenue primarily by exploiting
   electricity price arbitrage opportunities in the day-ahead electricity
   market while optimally preparing the ESS to maximize its contribution to
   congestion relief as an ancillary service. A compressed-air ESS is sized
   and employed for evaluations of the proposed RTOD algorithm. The
   efficacy and feasibility of the proposed algorithm are validated using
   real-world price data from Ontario's wholesale electricity market. An
   analysis is presented regarding the appropriate amount of financial
   compensation for the ESS owner due to this contribution to congestion
   relief in the studied electricity market.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of inexpensive and abundant softwood into useful construction
   materials is of significant economic and environmental importance. The
   currently available methods for wood treatment are not sufficiently
   effective to overcome the drawbacks of softwood including warping and
   biodeterioration. In the present research, a novel process was developed
   to address these challenges by chemically attaching antibacterial
   quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) to hemlock using supercritical
   carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). Nine QACs containing at least one hydroxyl
   group were synthesized and characterized by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (NMR), attenuated total reflectance Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and high resolution mass
   spectroscopy (HRMS). The antibacterial activity of these QACs were
   screened against the representative bacteria Escherichia coli, revealing
   that the antibacterial activity is dependent on the QAC molecular
   structure. Two QACs that demonstrated strong antibacterial activity were
   selected and chemically attached to hemlock by using hexamethylene
   diisocyanate (HDI) as a linker via a carbamate/urethane linkage in
   scCO(2). The chemically modified hemlock demonstrated exceptional
   antibacterial activity and improved dimensional stability, suggesting
   potential application of this route in the conversion of softwood into
   advanced durable decking and fencing materials.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThe rise of medical humanities teaching in medical education
   has introduced pressure to prove efficacy and utility. Review articles
   on the available evidence have been criticised for poor methodology and
   unwarranted conclusions. To support a more nuanced discussion of how the
   medical humanities work, we conducted a scoping review of quantitative
   studies of medical humanities teaching.
   MethodsUsing a search strategy involving MEDLINE, EMBASE and ERIC, and
   hand searching, our scoping review located 11045 articles that referred
   to the use of medical humanities teaching in medical education. Of
   these, 62 studies using quantitative evaluation methods were selected
   for review. Three iterations of analysis were performed: descriptive,
   conceptual, and discursive.
   ResultsDescriptive analysis revealed that the medical humanities as a
   whole cannot be easily systematised based on simple descriptive
   categories. Conceptual analysis supported the development of a
   conceptual framework in which the foci of the arts and humanities in
   medical education can be mapped alongside their related epistemic
   functions for teaching and learning. Within the framework, art
   functioned as expertise, as dialogue or as a means of expression and
   transformation. In the discursive analysis, we found three main ways in
   which the relationship between the arts and humanities and medicine was
   constructed as, respectively, intrinsic, additive and curative.
   ConclusionsThis review offers a nuanced framework of how different types
   of medical humanities work. The epistemological assumptions and
   discursive positioning of medical humanities teaching frame the forms of
   outcomes research that are considered relevant to curriculum decision
   making, and shed light on why dominant review methodologies make some
   functions of medical humanities teaching visible and render others
   invisible. We recommend the use of this framework to improve the rigor
   and relevance of future explorations of the efficacy and utility of
   medical humanities teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Near-infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive optical method used
   primarily to monitor tissue oxygenation due to the absorption properties
   of hemoglobin. Accurate estimation of hemoglobin concentrations and
   other light absorbers requires techniques that can separate the effect
   of absorption from the much greater effect of light scattering. One of
   the most advanced methods is time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy
   (TR-NIRS), which measures the absorption and scattering coefficients of
   a turbid medium by modeling the recorded distribution time of flight of
   photons. A challenge with TR-NIRS is that it requires accurate
   characterization of the dispersion caused by the system. In this study,
   we present a method for circumventing this problem by applying
   statistical moment analysis to two time-of-flight distributions measured
   at separated source-detector distances. Simulations based on analytical
   models and Monte Carlo code, and tissue-mimicking phantoms, were used to
   demonstrate its accuracy for source-detector distances typically used in
   neuroimaging applications. The simplicity of the approach is well suited
   to real-time applications requiring accurate quantification of the
   optical properties of a turbid medium. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Title = {{Probabilistic risk assessment of contaminant transport in groundwater
   and vapour intrusion following remediation of a contaminant source}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Community-scale simulations were performed to investigate the risk to
   groundwater and indoor air receptors downgradient of a contaminated site
   following the remediation of a long-term source. Six suites of Monte
   Carlo simulations were performed using a numerical model that accounted
   for groundwater flow, reactive solute transport, soil gas flow, and
   vapour intrusion in buildings. The model was applied to a
   three-dimensional, community-scale (250 m x 1000 m x 14 m) domain
   containing heterogeneous, spatially correlated distributions of the
   hydraulic conductivity, fraction of organic carbon, and biodegradation
   rate constant, which were varied between realizations. Analysis
   considered results from both individual realizations as well as the
   suite of Monte Carlo simulations expressed through several novel,
   integrated parameters, such as the probability of exceeding a regulatory
   standard in either groundwater or indoor air. Results showed that
   exceedance probabilities varied considerably with the consideration of
   biodegradation in the saturated zone, and were less sensitive to changes
   in the variance of hydraulic conductivity or the incorporation of
   heterogeneous distributions of organic carbon at this spatial scale. A
   sharp gradient in exceedance probability existed at the lateral edges of
   the plumes due to variability in lateral dispersion, which defined a
   narrow region of exceedance uncertainty. Differences in exceedance
   probability between realizations (i.e., due to heterogeneity
   uncertainty) were similar to differences attributed to changes in the
   variance of hydraulic conductivity or fraction of organic carbon.
   Simulated clean-up times, defined by reaching an acceptable exceedance
   probability, were found to be on the order of decades to centuries in
   these community-scale domains. Results also showed that the choice of
   the acceptable exceedance probability level (e.g., 1 vs. 5 \%) would
   likely affect clean up times on the order of decades. Moreover, in the
   scenarios examined here, the risk of exceeding indoor air standards was
   greater than that of exceeding groundwater standards at all times and
   places. Overall, simulations of coupled transport processes combined
   with novel spatial and temporal quantification metrics for Monte Carlo
   analyses, provide practical tools for assessing risk in wider
   communities when considering site remediation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{122-153}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Flow in a horizontal channel exposed to external heating which results
   in sinusoidal temperature variations along the upper and lower walls
   with a phase shift between them has been studied using a combination of
   analytical and numerical methods. The most intense convection is
   observed when the upper and lower hot spots are located above each
   other. It has been demonstrated that the heating results in a
   significant reduction of the pressure gradient required to drive the
   flow when compared to a similar flow in an isothermal channel. The drag
   reduction is associated with the formation of separation bubbles which
   insulate the stream from direct contact with the bounding walls. The
   fluid inside of the bubbles rotates due to horizontal density gradients,
   which further reduces the required pressure gradient. The magnitude of
   the drag reduction depends on the phase shift between the heating
   patterns and can increase by up to threefold when compared to the drag
   reduction which can be achieved by heating only one wall. A detailed
   analysis of the associated heat fluxes has been presented.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{150}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Applying bio-mimicry intelligence to the aerodynamic performance of tall
   slender buildings has potential to lead to not only improved response to
   wind loading, but generate savings in material and construction costs,
   affect energy consumption by providing self-shading and controlling
   local air flow to promote local wind energy generation and ventilation
   strategies. To this end, the alongwind and crosswind responses of high
   aspect ratio (15:1) cylinders, (smooth, roughened and grooved) were
   obtained from wind tunnel tests in simulated smooth and rough
   atmospheric boundary layer flows. The influence of top, flat or domed
   was also studied. The Saguaro cactus-inspired cylinder with 24
   circumferential grooves was seen to have large reductions (similar to
   20\%) for mean and fluctuating alongwind base shear (drag) and
   overturning moments in comparison with smooth cylinders and is in
   agreement with 2D studies in uniform low turbulence flow. Domed tops
   also led to reduced drag over flat tops. Differences in fluctuating
   crosswind base shear (lift) and overturning moment were much less
   marked. In spectral terms the amplitudes of response near the pronounced
   vortex shedding frequency were almost unchanged, however the
   cactus-shape had a higher Strouhal Number indicating a shift to a higher
   frequency as might be attributed to a narrowing of the wake. (C) 2016

   research facilitates a better understanding of the business dimension of
   digital games. The main objective of this research is to investigate
   empirically the effect of business factors on the performance of digital
   games in the market and to answer the research questions asked in this
   study. Game development organizations are facing high pressure and
   competition in the digital game industry. Business has become a crucial
   dimension, especially for game development organizations. The main
   contribution of this paper is to investigate empirically the influence
   of key business factors on the business performance of games. This is
   the first study in the domain of game development that demonstrates the
   interrelationship between key business factors and game performance in
   the market. The results of the study provide evidence that game
   development organizations must deal with multiple business key factors
   to remain competitive and handle the high pressure in the digital game
   industry. Furthermore, the results of the study support the theoretical
   assertion that key business factors play an important role in game

Abstract = {{ObjectivesOur aim is to assess the subfield-specific histopathological
   correlates of hippocampal volume and intensity changes (T1, T2) as well
   as diff!usion MRI markers in TLE, and investigate the efficacy of
   quantitative MRI measures in predicting histopathology in vivo.
   Experimental DesignWe correlated in vivo volumetry, T2 signal,
   quantitative T1 mapping, as well as diffusion MRI parameters with
   histological features of hippocampal sclerosis in a subfield-specific
   manner. We made use of on an advanced co-registration pipeline that
   provided a seamless integration of preoperative 3 T MRI with
   postoperative histopathological data, on which metrics of cell loss and
   gliosis were quantitatively assessed in CA1, CA2/3, and CA4/DG.
   Principal ObservationsMRI volumes across all subfields were positively
   correlated with neuronal density and size. Higher T2 intensity related
   to increased GFAP fraction in CA1, while quantitative T1 and diffusion
   MRI parameters showed negative correlations with neuronal density in CA4
   and DG. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that in vivo
   multiparametric MRI can predict neuronal loss in all the analyzed
   subfields with up to 90\% accuracy.
   ConclusionOur results, based on an accurate co-registration pipeline and
   a subfield-specific analysis of MRI and histology, demonstrate the
   potential of MRI volumetry, diffusion, and quantitative T1 as accurate
   in vivo biomarkers of hippocampal pathology. Hum Brain Mapp

Pages = {{19-34}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Service discovery has been a very active research field attracting many
   researchers around the world. Most of the previous research efforts on
   service discovery have been based on the ternary classification of
   participant roles in web services, including service providers, brokers,
   and consumers. This classification is insufficient because it fails to
   make a difference between application developers and end users who both
   belong to service consumers. As a result, application developers usually
   take the responsibility of seeking services while end users who
   ultimately use the application are ignored. In order to address this
   issue, this paper presents an Intents-based approach for dynamic service
   discovery. The proposed approach is motivated from two industrial
   protocols: Android Intents and web Intents. It improves the two
   protocols by a generic model from the aspects of architecture, intent
   messages and their resolving process, Intents services, and user agents.
   It classifies the implicit intents into authoritative and na < ve
   intents and is compatible with the current web service triangular
   architecture. This paper also illustrates a way of creating Intents
   services from SOAP and REST web services and presents two cases to
   demonstrate some benefits of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Waste leaves from Acer saccharum (maple tree) were used for continuous
   removal of Cu (II) ions from aqueous solutions in a packed-bed column.
   Inlet metal concentrations of 15-110 mg/l and flowrates 5-30 ml/min were
   investigated in continuous column operations resulting in effluent
   concentration of 1 mg/l of Cu (II), which meets the Canadian drinking
   water standards. Eight adsorption-desorption cycles were carried out
   with regeneration efficiencies of 98\% using 0.1 N H2SO4. Adsorption
   capacity of the biosorbent remained fairly constant at 18.3 mg/g over
   eight cycles. The adsorption performance of the column was successfully
   predicted using a model based on non-linear local equilibrium and mass
   balance equations. The results showed that maple leaves can be employed
   as an easily accessible, abundant, and low cost biosorbent for the

Abstract = {{The activities of various supported catalysts were tested in a
   continuous flow reactor for production of CH4 and H-2 from glucose via
   supercritical water gasification (SCWG) at a relatively low temperature
   (500 degrees C). Based on this preliminary study, among all catalysts
   tested in this study Ni20\%Ru2\%/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst was found to be
   the most active, achieving complete conversion of all carbon in glucose
   at 500 degrees C and a weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3 h(-1).
   The addition of 2\% Ru to Ni-20\%/gamma-Al2O3 not only suppressed
   char/tar formation, promoted the carbon gasification efficiently, but
   also increased methane formation. Moreover, high stability of
   Ni20\%Ru2\%/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst was demonstrated in the experimental
   runs for 20 h on-stream. The roles of ruthenium as a co-catalyst in
   Ni/Al2O3 were found to be not only increasing nickel dispersion,
   enhancing nickel's reducibility, but also preventing leaching of Al and
   Ni metals in SCW. However, NiRu supported on either TiO2 and activated
   carbon led to lower catalytic activity and frequent plugging after only
   3 h on-stream. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Swelling and geo-environmental properties of bentonite treated with
   recycled bassanite}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{95-102}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an investigation of the use of recycled bassanite,
   which is derived from plasterboard waste, as an additive material to
   mitigate the swelling potential of bentonite considering its
   environmental impact. Recycled bassanite was mixed with furnace cement
   and with lime at 2:1 ratios, and then the admixture was mixed with the
   tested bentonite at four different content ratios. The effects of adding
   bassanite admixture on the swelling properties, mechanical properties,
   environmental properties, microstructure, and mineralogical composition
   of the tested bentonite were investigated. The test results indicated
   that recycled bassanite has the potential for use as a stabiliser to
   mitigate swelling in expansive clay. Increasing the admixture content
   reduced the potential for swelling, the plasticity, the montmorillonite
   intensity, the percentage of sodium ions and the cation exchange
   capacity of the bentonite. The compressive strength, unit weight and
   percentage of calcium ions were increased for all admixture contents
   used. The different bassanite-cement/lime admixture contents resulted in
   approximately the same reduction in the swelling potential of the tested
   bentonite. The bassanite-cement/lime admixture had much more pronounced
   effects on the swelling and mechanical properties of the bentonite than
   bassanite alone. The bentonite treated with 6\% admixture content
   exhibited the greatest reduction in swelling potential; hence, this
   admixture content ratio is considered optimal for stabilising bentonite
   and mitigating its swelling. The measurements of hydrogen sulphide gas,
   fluorine solubility and pH of the treated bentonite were found to be
   within the acceptable limits, indicating that bassanite-cement/lime
   admixtures used did not have any negative environmental effects.
   However, bassanite is not recommended for use alone as an amendment for
   expansive clay because it releases fluorine at amounts that may exceed
   the allowable limit in some cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, the solubility of rivaroxaban (form I) in binary solvent
   mixtures of ethyl acetate (EA) with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
   N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was firstly
   experimentally measured over the temperature range from (278.15 to
   318.15) K. Then the measured solubility data were correlated with such
   semiempirical thermodynamic models as Jouyban-Acree (JA) equation and
   Buchowski (lambda h) equation. The crystal form of the residual solids
   in equilibrium with liquids was identified by powder X-ray diffraction
   (PXRD). The melting temperature and fusion enthalpy were determined
   using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results show that,
   the solubility of rivaroxaban generally increases with the temperature
   and decreases with the increase in the content of EA in the binary
   solvent mixtures. Furthermore, when lambda h equation is used to
   correlate the solubility of rivaroxaban with the temperature in each
   solvent mixture, the average relative deviation (ARD) between the
   experimental and calculated values is about 0.0671, while it is about
   0.0905 when JA equation is employed to correlate the solubility with the
   temperature and the composition of solvent mixtures simultaneously. (C)

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to employ subject-specific computer models
   to evaluate the interaction of glenohumeral range-of-motion and
   Hill-Sachs humeral head bone defect size on engagement and shoulder
   dislocation. We hypothesized that the rate of engagement would increase
   as defect size increased, and that greater shoulder ROM would engage
   smaller defects. Three dimensional computer models of 12 shoulders were
   created. For each shoulder, additional models were created with
   simulated Hill-Sachs defects of varying severities (XS=15\%, S=22.5\%,
   M=30\%, L=37.5\%, XL=45\% and XXL=52.5\% of the humeral head diameter,
   respectively). Rotational motion simulations without translation were
   conducted. The simulations ended if the defect engaged the anterior
   glenoid rim with resultant dislocation. The results showed that the rate
   of engagement was significantly different between defect sizes (0.001 <
   p < 0.032). Defect engagement occurred for all specimens when defects
   size XL and XXL were simulated. Size M or L defects engaged in some (but
   not all) specimens. Defect engagement occurred at mean horizontal
   extension angles of -23.6 +/- 9.3 degrees, 17.9 +/- 10.8 degrees, -4.5
   +/- 9.0 degrees, and +6.4 +/- 8.8 degrees for M, L, XL, and XXL defect
   sizes, respectively. Differences in engagement angle between defect
   sizes were significant for all comparisons (p < 0.001). The model showed
   that XS and S size defects do not engage when only rotational motions
   are considered. Since engagement of XS and S size Hill-Sachs defects is
   believed to occur clinically, we suspect that some amount of joint
   translation may be occurring, causing these defects to engage.
   Therefore, further studies on clinical pre-operative joint laxity and
   ROM may enable the prediction of engagement. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Three dimensional self-assembled graphene aerogel (GA) anode materials

   morphologies and textural properties of as-obtained GA were investigated
   by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman and other spectroscopy techniques. The
   surface defects and electrical conductivities of GA can be controlled by
   adjusting the hydrothermal reaction time. The results indicate that GA
   with a reaction time of 6 h exhibits extremely high reversible capacity
   (1430 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 100 mAg(-1)) and superior rate
   capability (587 mAhg(-1) at 800 mA g(-1)) with excellent cycling
   stability (maintaining a reversible capacity of 960 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA
   g(-1) after 100 cycles). It is demonstrated that the 3D porous network
   with increased defect density, as well as the considerable electrical
   conductivity, results in the excellent electrochemical performance of
   the as-made GA anodes in lithium-ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{On account of in situ cross-linked reaction of epoxy SU-8 with
   poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) and its strong reactive bonding ability
   with different pretreated substrates, we developed a simple universal
   one-step solution-based coating method for fast surface modification of
   various objects. Through this method, a layer of P4VP molecules with
   controllable thickness can be tethered tightly onto substrates with the
   assistance of SU-8. P4VP molecules possess a lot of pyridine ligands to
   immobilize transitional metal ions that can behave as the catalyst of
   electroless copper plating for surface metallization while functioning
   as the adhesion-promoting layer between the substrate and deposited
   metal. Attributed to interpenetrated entanglement of P4VP molecules and
   as-deposited metal, ultrathick (>7 mu m) strongly adhesive high-quality
   copper layer can be formed on flexible substrates without any
   delamination. Then through laser printer to print toner mask, a variety
   of designed circuits can be easily fabricated on modified flexible PET

Abstract = {{Goal-directed reaching movements are guided by visual feedback from both
   target and hand. The classical view is that the brain extracts
   information about target and hand positions from a visual scene,
   calculates a difference vector between them, and uses this estimate to
   control the movement. Here we show that during fast feedback control,
   this computation is not immediate, but evolves dynamically over time.
   Immediately after a change in the visual scene, the motor system
   generates independent responses to the errors in hand and target
   location. Only about 200 ms later, the changes in target and hand
   positions are combined appropriately in the response, slowly converging
   to the true difference vector. Therefore, our results provide evidence
   for the temporal evolution of spatial computations in the human
   visuomotor system, in which the accurate difference vector computation
   is first estimated by a fast approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Extracellular vesicles released by prostate cancer present
   in seminal fluid, urine, and blood may represent a non-invasive means to
   identify and prioritize patients with intermediate risk and high risk of
   prostate cancer. We hypothesize that enumeration of circulating prostate
   microparticles (PMPs), a type of extracellular vesicle (EV), can
   identify patients with Gleason Score >= 4+4 prostate cancer (PCa) in a
   manner independent of PSA.
   Patients and Methods: Plasmas from healthy volunteers, benign prostatic
   hyperplasia patients, and PCa patients with various Gleason score
   patterns were analyzed for PMPs. We used nanoscale flow cytometry to
   enumerate PMPs which were defined as submicron events (100-1000nm)
   immunoreactive to anti-PSMA mAb when compared to isotype control labeled
   samples. Levels of PMPs (counts/mu L of plasma) were also compared to
   CellSearch CTC Subclasses in various PCa metastatic disease subtypes
   (treatment naive, castration resistant prostate cancer) and in serially
   collected plasma sets from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.
   Results: PMP levels in plasma as enumerated by nanoscale flow cytometry
   are effective in distinguishing PCa patients with Gleason Score >= 8
   disease, a high-risk prognostic factor, from patients with Gleason Score
   <= 7 PCa, which carries an intermediate risk of PCa recurrence. PMP
   levels were independent of PSA and significantly decreased after
   surgical resection of the prostate, demonstrating its prognostic
   potential for clinical follow-up. CTC subclasses did not decrease after
   prostatectomy and were not effective in distinguishing localized PCa
   patients from metastatic PCa patients.
   Conclusions: PMP enumeration was able to identify patients with Gleason
   Score >= 8 PCa but not patients with Gleason Score 4+3 PCa, but offers
   greater confidence than CTC counts in identifying patients with
   metastatic prostate cancer. CTC Subclass analysis was also not effective
   for post-prostatectomy follow up and for distinguishing metastatic PCa
   and localized PCa patients. Nanoscale flow cytometry of PMPs presents an
   emerging biomarker platform for various stages of prostate cancer.}},

Title = {{Kinematic and kinetic assessment of upper limb movements in patients
   with writer's cramp}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: The assessment and treatment of writer's cramp is
   complicated due to the variations in the forces and angles of involved
   joints. Additionally, in some cases compensatory movements for cramp
   relief further complicates assessment. Currently these variables are
   subjectively measured with clinical scales and visual assessments. This
   subjectivity makes it difficult to successfully administer interventions
   such as Botulinum toxin injection or orthotics resulting in poor
   efficacy and significant side effects.
   Method: A multi-sensor system was used to record finger and wrist forces
   along with deviation angles at the wrist, elbow and shoulder while 9
   patients with writer's cramp performed a series of standardized tasks on
   surfaces inclined at different angles. Clinical, kinetic, and kinematic
   information regarding cramping was collected.
   Results: First, four tasks appeared to best predict cramp occurrence.
   Second, unique biomechanical profiles emerged for patients regarding
   force, angles and cramp severity. Third, cluster analyses using these
   features showed a clear separation of patients into two severity
   classes. Finally, a relationship between severity and kinetic-kinematic
   information suggested that primary cramping versus compensatory
   movements could be potentially inferred.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that using a set of standardized
   tasks and objective measures, individual profiles for arm movements and
   applied forces associated with writer's cramp can be generated. The
   clinician can then accurately target the biomechanics specifically,
   whether it is with injection or other rehabilitative measures,
   fulfilling an important unmet need in the treatment of writer's cramp.}},

Abstract = {{beta-cyclodextrin functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (beta-CD-MNPs)
   having a core-shell structure were fabricated with a layer-by-layer
   method by combining 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane coated magnetic Fe3O4
   nanoparticles (AP-MNPs) with 6-O-toluenesulfonyl-P-cyclodextrin
   (6-TsO-beta-CD) at 70 degrees C. The characterization by transmission
   electron microscopy revealed beta-CD-MNPs having an average diameter of
   12 +/- 2 nm and an average hydrodynamic diameter of 56.8 nm in aqueous
   solution by dynamic light scattering. The beta-CD grafting was confirmed
   by Fourier-Transformed Infrared spectroscopy, and the amount of beta-CD
   grafted on MNPs was determined as 60 mg/g by thermogravimetric analysis.
   The uptake and release ability of beta-CD-MNPs was investigated using
   methylene blue (MB) as a biological staining dye by spectrophotometric
   method. The results showed that the uptake and release were greatly
   influenced by the pH value of dye solution, with a maximum loading
   capacity of 78.4 mg/g under pH = 8 at 25 degrees C, and the release was
   easily achieved at 73\% within the first hour at physiological
   condition. The adsorption isotherms were examined by Langmuir and
   Freundlich models, and the satisfactory fitting to the Langmuir model
   suggested the adsorption on beta-CD-MNPs as a mono-layer coverage. (C)

Abstract = {{The MiMeS (Magnetism in Massive Stars) project is a large-scale,
   high-resolution, sensitive spectropolarimetric investigation of the
   magnetic properties of O- and early B-type stars. Initiated in 2008 and
   completed in 2013, the project was supported by three Large Program
   allocations, as well as various programmes initiated by independent
   principal investigators, and archival resources. Ultimately, over 4800
   circularly polarized spectra of 560 O and B stars were collected with
   the instruments ESPaDOnS (Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the
   Observation of Stars) at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, Narval at
   the Telescope Bernard Lyot and HARPSpol at the European Southern
   Observatory La Silla 3.6 m telescope, making MiMeS by far the largest
   systematic investigation of massive star magnetism ever undertaken. In
   this paper, the first in a series reporting the general results of the
   survey, we introduce the scientific motivation and goals, describe the
   sample of targets, review the instrumentation and observational
   techniques used, explain the exposure time calculation designed to

Abstract = {{Objective:To determine the motor-behavioral and neural correlates of
   putative functional common variants in the sodium-channel Na(V)1.8
   encoding gene (SCN10A) in vivo in patients with multiple sclerosis
   (MS).Methods:We recruited 161 patients with relapsing-onset MS and 94
   demographically comparable healthy participants. All patients with MS
   underwent structural MRI and clinical examinations (Expanded Disability
   Status Scale {[}EDSS] and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite
   {[}MSFC]). Whole-brain voxel-wise and cerebellar volumetry were
   performed to assess differences in regional brain volumes between
   genotype groups. Resting-state fMRI was acquired from 62 patients with
   MS to evaluate differences in cerebellar functional connectivity. All
   participants were genotyped for 4 potentially functional SCN10A
   polymorphisms.Results:Two SCN10A polymorphisms in high linkage
   disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.95) showed significant association with MSFC
   performance in patients with MS (rs6795970: p = 6.2 x 10(-4); rs6801957:
   p = 0.0025). Patients with MS with rs6795970(AA) genotype performed
   significantly worse than rs6795970(G) carriers in MSFC (p = 1.8 x
   10(-4)) and all of its subscores. This association was independent of
   EDSS and cerebellar atrophy. Although the genotype groups showed no
   difference in regional brain volumes, rs6795970(AA) carriers
   demonstrated significantly diminished cerebellar functional connectivity
   with the thalami and midbrain. No significant SCN10A-genotype effect was
   observed on MSFC performance in healthy participants.Conclusions:Our
   data suggest that SCN10A variation substantially influences functional
   status, including prominent effects on motor coordination in patients
   with MS. These findings were supported by the effects of this variant on
   a neural system important for motor coordination, namely
   cerebello-thalamic circuitry. Overall, our findings add to the emerging
   evidence that suggests that sodium channel Na(V)1.8 could serve as a
   target for future drug-based interventions to treat cerebellar
   dysfunction in MS.}},

Abstract = {{High-damping displacement spectra and corresponding damping reduction
   factors (eta) are important ingredients in seismic design and analysis
   of structures equipped with seismic protection systems, as well as in
   displacement-based design methodologies. In this study, we investigated
   eta factors for three types of earthquake characterizing seismic hazard
   in southwestern British Columbia, Canada: shallow crustal, deep inslab,
   and interface subduction. We used a large and comprehensive database
   including records from recent relevant earthquakes, such as the 2011
   Tohoku event. Our key observations were as follows: (1) there is
   negligible dependence of eta on soil class; (2) there is significant
   dependence of eta on the frequency content and duration of ground
   motions that characterize the different record types, and (3) eta is
   dependent on period, particularly for inslab events. Period-dependent
   equations were proposed to predict eta for damping ratios between 5\%
   and 30\% corresponding to the three event types.}},

   evaluation of a prototype two degrees-of-freedom (DoF) haptic interface,
   which takes advantage of magneto-rheological fluid (MRF)-based clutches
   for actuation. These small-scale clutches were designed in our lab, and
   their evaluation were reported previously {[}1], {[}2]. MRF-based
   actuators exhibit superior characteristics, which can significantly
   contribute to transparency and stability of haptic devices. Based on
   these actuators, a distributed antagonistic configuration is used to
   develop the 2-DoF haptic interface. This device is incorporated in a
   master-slave teleoperation setup intended for medical percutaneous
   interventions and soft-tissue palpation. Preliminary studies on the
   stability and transparency of the haptic interface in this setup using
   phantom and ex vivo samples show the great potential of MRF-based
   actuators for integration in haptic devices that require reliable, safe,
   accurate, highly transparent, and stable force reflection.}},

Abstract = {{Registration and fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) and 3D transrectal
   ultrasound (TRUS) images of the prostate gland can provide high-quality
   guidance for prostate interventions. However, accurate MR-TRUS
   registration remains a challenging task, due to the great intensity
   variation between two modalities, the lack of intrinsic fiducials within
   the prostate, the large gland deformation caused by the TRUS probe
   insertion, and distinctive biomechanical properties in patients and
   prostate zones. To address these challenges, a personalized
   model-to-surface registration approach is proposed in this study. The
   main contributions of this paper can be threefold. First, a new
   personalized statistical deformable model (PSDM) is proposed with the
   finite element analysis and the patient-specific tissue parameters
   measured from the ultrasound elastography. Second, a hybrid point
   matching method is developed by introducing the modality independent
   neighborhood descriptor (MIND) to weight the Euclidean distance between
   points to establish reliable surface point correspondence. Third, the
   hybrid point matching is further guided by the PSDM for more physically
   plausible deformation estimation. Eighteen sets of patient data are
   included to test the efficacy of the proposed method. The experimental
   results demonstrate that our approach provides more accurate and robust
   MR-TRUS registration than state-of-the-art methods do. The averaged
   target registration error is 1.44 mm, which meets the clinical
   requirement of 1.9 mm for the accurate tumor volume detection. It can be
   concluded that the presented method can effectively fuse the
   heterogeneous image information in the elastography, MR, and TRUS to
   attain satisfactory image alignment performance.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose from microalgae offers potential value as a source of
   fermentable sugars. This cellulose can be used after the extraction of
   other valued products in the biomass such as bio-crude. In this paper,
   an integrated approach to bio-crude and glucose recovery from microalgae
   was studied. First the bio-crude recovery efficiency using high-pressure
   steaming was calculated for microalgae cultures with different lipid and
   cellulose contents. Next, enzymatic hydrolysis was applied to obtain
   fermentable sugars. The best extraction efficiency with high-pressure
   steaming was 97.9 +/- 8.3\% for the algae containing the lowest
   cellulose content. The algae treatment with high-pressure steaming at
   210 degrees C followed by hydrolysis with cellulase led to glucose
   yields of 0.28 g/g(biomass), indicating that high-pressure steaming is a
   suitable method for the production of two sources of bio-fuels
   (bio-crude and glucose) from microalgae.}},

Abstract = {{Among the different shapes available, conical vessels are commonly used
   as water reservoirs because of their large storage capacities. Motivated
   by the lack of guidelines available for their analysis and design in the
   existing codes of practice, this study focuses on analyzing reinforced
   concrete conical tanks under the effect of hydrostatic pressure. A
   finite element model (FEM), which accounts for material nonlinearity
   experienced in reinforced concrete, is developed. This nonlinearity is
   considered by implementing a concrete plasticity constitutive model in
   the developed FEM. Analysis of a set of 12 tanks with different
   practical dimensions is performed under hydrostatic water pressure. The
   variations of meridional and hoop stresses through the thickness of the
   tanks are determined by plotting the stresses at the outer faces of the
   tank's wall. The effect of including material nonlinearity in the FEM on
   the deformed shape is assessed. The developed FEM is used to find the
   location of maximum deflection and stresses. The variations in the
   maximum deflection and stresses with the dimensional parameters of the
   conical vessel are reported.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a single-phase full-bridge inverter that possesses
   limited current ripple at the dc link while providing a sinusoidal
   square power at the ac output. This is achieved through the addition of
   an extra pair of switches and complementary control for the full-bridge
   inverter. The extra switches operate to prevent the double-line
   frequency ripple current from flowing into the input of the inverter. In
   doing so, the pulsation component of the sinusoidal square output power
   is confined to flow between the output capacitors and the load. Thus,
   the dc link input only supplies the dc component of the output power.
   Simulation and experimental results validating the proposed solution are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{As spinal cord injury (SCI) trials begin to involve subjects with acute
   cervical SCI, establishing the property of an upper limb outcome measure
   to detect change over time is critical for its usefulness in clinical
   trials. The objectives of this study were to define responsiveness,
   sensitivity, and minimally detectable difference (MDD) of the Graded
   Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility, and Prehension (GRASSP).
   An observational, longitudinal study was conducted. International
   Standards of Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI), GRASSP,
   Capabilities of Upper Extremity Questionnaire (CUE-Q), and Spinal Cord
   Independence Measure (SCIM) were administered 0-10 days, 1, 3, 6, and 12
   months post-injury. Standardized Response Means (SRM) for GRASSP and
   ISNCSCI measures were calculated. Longitudinal construct validity was
   calculated using Pearson correlation coefficients. Smallest real
   difference for all subtests was calculated to define the MDD values for
   all GRASSP subtests. Longitudinal construct validity demonstrated GRASSP
   and all external measures to be responsive to neurological change for 1
   year post-injury. SRM values for the GRASSP subtests ranged from 0.25 to
   0.85 units greater than that for ISNCSCI strength and sensation,
   SCIM-SS, and CUE-Q. MDD values for GRASSP subtests ranged from 2-5
   points. GRASSP demonstrates good responsiveness and excellent
   sensitivity that is superior to ISNCSCI and SCIM III. MDD values are
   useful in the evaluation of interventions in both clinical and research
   settings. The responsiveness and sensitivity of GRASSP make it a
   valuable condition-specific measure in tetraplegia, where changes in
   upper limb neurological and functional outcomes are essential for
   evaluating the efficacy of interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, ionic liquids have been demonstrated to increase the
   efficiency of solvent extraction of lipids from microalgae. However, to
   date, mostly imidazolium-based ionic liquids have been investigated.
   This report extends the range of cations studied to over 30, including
   imidazolium, ammonium, phosphonium, and pyridinium derivatives, which
   were screened for their ability to increase hexane extraction efficiency
   of lipids from freeze-dried microalgae Chlorella vulgaris at ambient
   temperature. Promising ionic liquids were first identified using
   gravimetric analysis of total extractable oils. Oils extracted after
   ionic liquid pretreatment were further characterized with respect to
   fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) equal to biodiesel yield, FAME
   composition, and chlorophyll content. With few exceptions, all of the
   tested ionic liquids had lower chlorophyll content than standard solvent
   extraction techniques. The effect of process parameters such as mass
   ratio of algae to ionic liquid, incubation time, water content, and
   cosolvents were investigated for 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   ethylsulfate {[}C(2)mim] {[}EtSO4]. The results indicate that this ionic
   liquid can disrupt C. vulgaris in conjunction with methanol and allow
   facile recovery of lipids over a large degree of dewatered microalgae
   (0-82 wt \% water), in a small amount of time (75 min) at room
   temperature, resulting in the development of a low energy, water
   compatible, biodiesel production scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term batch dissolution experiments were performed on solid phase
   Pb3O4 under drinking water conditions simulating a depleting chlorine

   dissolved in the presence of chlorine through a nucleophilic attack to
   the Pb2+ centers in the solid, and is subsequently oxidized by free
   chlorine to form beta-PbO2, with a concomitant decrease in soluble lead
   concentrations. Following chlorine depletion, Pb3O4 dissolution
   regulates the process, resulting in surface deposition of beta-PbO2.
   Formation of lead carbonates controls the final observed lead
   concentrations for Pb3O4 dissolution. A dissolution model is presented
   to rationalize these observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new impedance-based supplementary fault-location
   algorithm for series capacitor-compensated transmission lines (SCCTLs),
   which improves the accuracy of the existing fault-location algorithms.
   The proposed algorithm utilizes the fact that the metal-oxide varistor
   (MOV) may become bypassed in faulted or all phases before the
   interruption of fault for certain fault scenarios. The removal of the
   nonlinear element, that is, MOV from the fault loop enables the proposed
   algorithm to provide more accurate fault-location results compared to
   the most advanced impedance-based technique. Another major advantage of
   the proposed algorithm is that the dedicated subroutines are not
   required for the location of a fault in a particular section of the
   transmission line. The proposed fault-location algorithm is rigorously
   tested for various fault scenarios in the 500-kV SCCTL simulated in
   PSCAD. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to a
   well-known existing impedance-based fault-location algorithm for SCCTLs
   to illustrate higher accuracy and improved sensitivity of the proposed
   technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper quantifies the impact of model error associated with the

   (PCORRC) models, are considered in the analyses. The time-dependent
   probabilities of burst of three hypothetical examples, which are
   representative of the oil and gas transmission pipelines in the United
   States, are evaluated by using the first-order reliability method (FORM)
   to carry out the comparative study. The analysis results indicate that
   the model error has a substantial effect on the burst probability
   evaluated. The probabilities of burst evaluated by considering the model
   error can be several orders of magnitude higher than those evaluated by
   ignoring the model error. The results underscore the critical importance

   oscillator under external excitation}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{As a category of soft electroactive materials, dielectric elastomers
   (DEs) show great potential for the development of tunable oscillators
   and resonators for actuating and sensing purposes. However, the dynamic
   performance of these DE-based vibration devices could be very
   susceptible to external environment (external loads and excitations) and
   material viscoelasticity of the DEs. Based on the finite-deformation
   viscoelasticity theory, this work first investigates the frequency
   tuning process of a viscoelastic DE membrane oscillator. A comparison of
   the frequency tuning process and the tunable frequency range between a
   viscoelastic and a purely elastic DE oscillator is presented. Moreover,
   particular considerations have been given to the nonlinear response of
   the oscillator to external harmonic excitation. It is found that the
   displacement transmissibility of the oscillator can also be actively
   tuned by changing the static voltage applied to the DE membrane. Under
   harmonic excitation, various vibration patterns of the oscillator could
   be actively achieved with the application of both static and alternating
   electric voltage. Simulation results in this work demonstrate that the
   material viscoelasticity has a significant effect on the
   electromechanical coupling and the dynamic performance of the DE-based
   vibration devices.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this work, an RVE model with embedded solid elements (RVE-ESE) is
   developed to predict the effective elastic constants of discontinuous
   fiber reinforced composites (DFRC). Unlike the traditional finite
   element (FE) modeling, the matrix and fibers can be meshed separately
   and independently due to the implementation of the embedded element
   technique, which enables the ease of RVE meshing without strictly
   satisfying the mesh conformity at the interfaces. Since the structured
   meshes can be used for the matrix, it becomes quite easy to impose the
   periodic boundary conditions on the RVE. In addition, a modified random
   sequential adsorption (RSA) algorithm based on the Boolean operation is
   proposed to generate the RVE by using the Python script in the
   ABAQUS/CAE. This algorithm can determine whether a new generated fiber
   overlaps with the pre-existing ones without looping calculation. Some
   important issues related to the modeling accuracy, such as the RVE size,
   the fiber separation effect and the mesh sensitivity of both matrix and
   fibers, are also investigated. It is found that the proposed model
   agrees very well with the traditional FE direct meshing approach when
   the element sizes of the matrix and fibers in the RVE-ESE model are
   sufficiently fine. Compared with commercial software Digimat, the
   current model yields relatively higher prediction on the elastic moduli
   of the composites with randomly distributed fibers. However, for the
   composites with aligned fibers, Digimat shows lower result for the
   transverse Young's modulus while a bit higher prediction for the
   longitudinal one. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Distal humeral hemiarthroplasty is a treatment option for
   elbow joint disease that predominantly affects the distal humerus,
   including distal humerus fractures, nonunions, and avascular necrosis.
   The effect of hemiarthroplasty implants on joint contact has not been
   reported. The purpose of this in vitro study was to quantify the effects
   of hemiarthroplasty and implant size on ulnohumeral joint congruency.
   Methods: Five fresh frozen cadaveric upper extremities were mounted to a
   custom elbow testing system. Active and passive motion were performed in
   dependent, horizontal, varus, and valgus positions. A registration and
   interbone distance algorithm was used to quantify ulnohumeral joint
   congruency throughout elbow flexion.
   Results: The optimally sized hemiarthroplasty implant demonstrated the
   greatest joint congruency with the ulna, followed by the oversized
   implant, then the undersized implant. Joint congruency was greater
   during active vs. passive flexion, indicating that the elbow joint is
   more reduced in active flexion than in passive flexion.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that undersized distal humeral
   hemiarthroplasty implants have the lowest joint congruency compared with
   an optimally sized or oversized implant. (C) 2016 Journal of Shoulder

Abstract = {{For the first time, we report a facile approach to fabricate metal
   organic framework derived carbon (MOF-C) with tunable porous structure.
   Different from direct pyrolysis of MOFs and blind attempt in
   application, the in-situ ammonia treatment enables MOF-C with desired
   porous structure from enriched microporous structure to hierarchically
   mesoporous structure. Further, NH3 treated MOF-C as carbon host for
   sulfur loading performing as the cathode for Li-S batteries results in
   twice higher capacity retention than that of pristine MOF-C. Besides,
   different Li-S electrochemical mechanisms regarding the different porous
   structures of carbon are also revealed and investigated in this paper.

Abstract = {{Olivine-type phosphates (LiMPO4, M = Fe, Mn, Co) are promising cathode
   materials for lithium-ion batteries that are generally accepted to
   follow first order equilibrium phase transformations. Herein, the phase
   transformation dynamics of sub-micro sized LiFePO4 particles with
   limited rate capability at a low current density of 0.14 C was
   investigated. An in-situ X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES)
   measurement was conducted at the Fe and P K-edge for the dynamic studies
   upon lithiation and delithiation. Fe K-edge XANES spectra demonstrate
   that not only lithium-rich intermediate phase LixFePO4 (x = 0.6-0.75),
   but also lithium-poor intermediate phase LiyFePO4 (y = 0.1-0.25) exist
   during the charge and discharge, respectively. Furthermore, during
   charge and discharge, a fluctuation of the FePO4 and LiFePO4 fractions
   obtained by liner combination fitting around the imaginary phase
   fractions followed Faraday's law and the equilibrium first-order
   two-phase transformation versus reaction time is present, respectively.
   The charging and discharging process has a reversible phase
   transformation dynamics with symmetric structural evolution routes. P
   K-edge XANES spectra reveal an enrichment of PF6-1 anions at the surface
   of the electrode during charging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Advances in sensor technologies and the proliferation of smart meters
   have resulted in an explosion of energy-related data sets. These Big
   Data have created opportunities for development of new energy services
   and a promise of better energy management and conservation. Sensor-based
   energy forecasting has been researched in the context of office
   buildings, schools, and residential buildings. This paper investigates
   sensor-based forecasting in the context of event-organizing venues,
   which present an especially difficult scenario due to large variations
   in consumption caused by the hosted events. Moreover, the significance
   of the data set size, specifically the impact of temporal granularity,
   on energy prediction accuracy is explored. Two machine-learning
   approaches, neural networks (NN) and support vector regression (SVR),
   were considered together with three data granularities: daily, hourly,
   and 15 minutes. The approach has been applied to a large entertainment
   venue located in Ontario, Canada. Daily data intervals resulted in
   higher consumption prediction accuracy than hourly or 15-min readings,
   which can be explained by the inability of the hourly and 15-min models
   to capture random variations. With daily data, the NN model achieved
   better accuracy than the SVR; however, with hourly and 15-min data,
   there was no definitive dominance of one approach over another. Accuracy
   of daily peak demand prediction was significantly higher than accuracy
   of consumption prediction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal cytoskeleton remodeling is pivotal for cell adhesion and
   migration. Here we investigated the function of Gas2-related protein on
   chromosome 22 (GAR22 beta), a poorly characterized protein that
   interacts with actin and microtubules. Primary and immortalized GAR22
   beta(-/-) Sertoli cells moved faster than wild-type cells. In addition,
   GAR22 beta(-/-) cells showed a more prominent focal adhesion turnover.
   GAR22 beta overexpression or its reexpression in GAR22 beta(-/-) cells
   reduced cell motility and focal adhesion turnover. GAR22 beta-actin
   interaction was stronger than GAR22 beta-microtubule interaction,
   resulting in GAR22 beta localization and dynamics that mirrored those of
   the actin cytoskeleton. Mechanistically, GAR22 beta interacted with the
   regulator of microtubule dynamics end-binding protein 1 (EB1) via a
   novel noncanonical amino acid sequence, and this GAR22 beta-EB1
   interaction was required for the ability of GAR22 beta to modulate cell
   motility. We found that GAR22 beta is highly expressed in mouse testes,
   and its absence resulted in reduced spermatozoa generation, lower actin
   levels in testes, and impaired motility and ultrastructural
   disorganization of spermatozoa. Collectively our findings identify GAR22
   beta as a novel regulator of cell adhesion and migration and provide a
   foundation for understanding the molecular basis of diverse
   cytoskeleton-dependent processes.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies investigated the mechanical performance of steel
   fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) pipes under the Three-Edge Bearing Test
   (TEBT). However, the field performance of buried full-scale SFRC pipes
   is yet to be duly investigated. This study is an exploratory
   investigation providing first time data on the behaviour of buried
   full-scale 600-mm diameter SFRC pipes under actual and simulated live
   loads. The first phase of this study monitored the behaviour of SFRC
   pipes under standard CL 625 truckloads. In the second phase, the
   post-cracking behaviour of SFRC pipes under artificial live loads was
   examined. Results showed that the current design recommendations for the
   pipe wall thickness in ASTM C76 for Type C wall are overly conservative.
   In addition, it was found that the SIDD method overestimates the
   vertical soil stress at the pipe crown and underestimates the horizontal
   soil stress at pipe spring-lines by 73\% and 272\%, respectively.
   Cracked SFRC pipes incorporating a relatively high fibre dosage
   exhibited less deformation than that of cracked regularly reinforced
   concrete pipes. Moreover, the post-cracking behaviour of SFRC pipes was
   more sensitive to the type of bedding installation rather than the type
   of steel fibres. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on line-of-sight extinction in northern Gale Crater, Mars as
   seen by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity from sol 100
   to sal 900; a little more than an entire martian year. Navcam images
   oriented due north, which show the distant crater rim, the near ground
   and the sky allow the extinction due to dust within the crater to be
   determined. This line-of sight extinction is compared to a complementary
   dataset of column extinctions derived from Mastcam. The line-of-sight
   extinction within the crater is less than the column extinction for the
   majority of the martian year. This implies that the relatively low
   mixing ratio of dust within the crater as compared to the atmosphere
   above the crater rim persists through most of the year. This suggests
   relatively little mixing between the atmosphere above the crater and the
   atmosphere inside the crater and suggests that northern Gale Crater is a
   net sink of dust in the current era. The data does however show a yearly
   convergence of the line-of-sight extinction and the column-averaged
   extinction around L-s = 270-290 degrees. This suggests that air above
   the crater mixes with air in the crater at this time, as predicted by
   mesoscale models. Matching line-of-sight and column extinction values
   are also seen around L-s approximate to 135 degrees, a season that has
   only been observed once in this dataset, this is particularly
   interesting as the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station onboard
   Curiosity reports increased convective boundary layer heights in the
   same season. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While beach sands are increasingly being studied as a reservoir of fecal
   indicator bacteria (FIB), less is known about the occurrence of FIB in
   other recreational sands (i.e., sandboxes and playgrounds). In this
   study, different culture-based FIB enumeration techniques were compared
   and microbial source tracking assays were conducted on recreational sand
   samples from beaches, playgrounds and sandboxes around Toronto, ON. FIB
   were detected in every sand sample (n=104) with concentrations not
   changing significantly over the five month sampling period.
   Concentrations of FIB and a gull-specific DNA marker were significantly
   higher in foreshore beach sands, and indicated these were a more
   significant reservoir of FIB contamination than sandbox or playground
   sands. Human-and dog-specific contamination markers were not detected.
   All culture-based FIB enumeration techniques were consistent in
   identifying the elevated FIB concentrations associated with foreshore
   beach sands. However, significant differences between differential agar
   media, IDEXX and Aquagenx Compartment Bag Test were observed, with DC
   media and Enterolert being the most sensitive methods to detect
   Escherichia coli and enterococci, respectively. To better understand the
   elevated occurrence of E. coli in foreshore sands, microcosm survival
   experiments were conducted at two different temperatures (15 degrees C
   and 28 degrees C) using non-sterile saturated foreshore beach sands
   collected from two urban freshwater beaches with different sand type
   (fine grain and sand-cobble). Microcosms were inoculated with a mixture
   of eight sand-derived E. coli strains and sampled over a 28-day period.
   E. coli levels were found to decline in all microcosms, although
   survival was significantly greater in the finer sand and at the cooler
   temperature (15 degrees C). These results indicate that FIB can be
   widespread in any type of recreational sand and, while E. coli can
   survive for many weeks, it is most likely to accumulate in cooler
   fine-grain sand as occurs below the foreshore sand surface. (C) 2015

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Two lab-scale anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactors (AnFBRs) treating
   primary sludge (PS) and thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) were
   studied to explore biofilm microbial characterization. COD and VSS
   removal for PS showed 62\% and 63\%, respectively at an organic loading
   rate (OLR) of 18 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) and an hydraulic retention times
   (HRTs) of 2.2 days. Similarly, TWAS was treated at 56\% COD removal and
   50\% VSS reduction efficiencies at an OLR of 12 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) and
   an HRT of 4 days. Furthermore, the specific bacterial community activity
   tests showed a significant difference between solids retention times
   (SRT) based on general VSS and retention times based on the activity of
   methanogenic, acidogenic, and acetogenic microbes. While SRT based on
   VSS measurements in the PS-AnFBR were 3.3 days, the activity-based
   retention times varied from 12.5 to 16.6 days. Similarly, in the
   TWAS-AnFBR, the SRT based on VSS measurements were 5.0 days, and the
   activity-based retention times ranged from 9.3 to 10.8 days. The BioWin
   model simulation predicted that conventional anaerobic digestion
   processes achieved lower VSS reduction efficiencies than the AnFBR
   process at the same SRT. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pt nanoparticles were prepared and deposited on carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   and graphene nano-sheets (GNs) to obtain composites of Pt/CNTs and
   Pt/GNs, respectively. The morphologies of Pt particles for the two
   catalysts were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It
   showed that the average Pt sizes for Pt/CNTs and Pt/GNs are similar,
   meaning that the differences in the electrochemical performance of the
   two catalysts could be ascribed to support effects. Pt/CNTs and Pt/GNs
   were quantitatively compared by simultaneously analyzing their cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) data for formate oxidation,
   showing that Pt/GNs is evidently superior to Pt/CNTs in terms of
   anti-poisoning performance. CO stripping on the two catalysts indicated
   that the strength of CO adsorption on GNs-supported Pt is weaker than
   that for CNTs-supported Pt. The Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   spectra showed that the binding energy of Pt 4f for Pt/GNs was higher
   than that for Pt/CNTs, indicating a stronger interaction of Pt with GNs
   than with CNTs and consequently a weaker adsorption of CO on
   GNs-supported Pt. We believe that this study can be used as a guide for
   future evaluation and screening of supports and/or anode catalysts for
   direct liquid fuel cells. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Use of the alpha shape to quantify finite helical axis dispersion during

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In biomechanical studies examining joint kinematics the most common
   measurement is range of motion (ROM), yet other techniques, such as the
   finite helical axis (FHA), may elucidate the changes in the 3D motion
   pathology more effectively. One of the deficiencies with the FHA
   technique is in quantifying the axes generated throughout a motion
   sequence. This study attempted to solve this issue via a computational
   geometric technique known as the alpha shape, which bounds a set of
   point data within a closed boundary similar to a convex hull. The
   purpose of this study was to use the alpha shape as an additional tool
   to visualize and quantify FHA dispersion between intact and injured
   cadaveric spine movements and compare these changes to the gold-standard
   ROM measurements. Flexion-extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending
   were simulated with five C5-C6 motion segments using a spinal loading
   simulator and Optotrak motion tracking system. Specimens were first
   tested intact followed by a simulated injury model. ROM and the FHAs
   were calculated post-hoc, with alpha shapes and convex hulls generated
   from the anatomic planar intercept points of the FHAs. While both ROM
   and the boundary shape areas increased with injury (p < 0.05), no
   consistent geometric trends in the alpha shape growth were identified.
   The alpha shape area was sensitive to the alpha value chosen and values
   examined below 2.5 created more than one closed boundary. Ultimately,
   the alpha shape presents as a useful technique to quantify sequences of
   joint kinematics described by scatter plots such as FHA intercept data.

Abstract = {{Evidence-based guidance for the use of airway clearance techniques (ACT)
   in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is lacking in-part
   because well-established measurements of pulmonary function such as the
   forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) are relatively insensitive to ACT.
   The objective of this crossover study was to evaluate daily use of an
   oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (oPEP) device for 21-28 days in
   COPD patients who were self-identified as sputum-producers or
   non-sputum-producers.COPD volunteers provided written informed consent
   to daily oPEP use in a randomized crossover fashion. Participants
   completed baseline, crossover and study-end pulmonary function tests,
   St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Patient Evaluation
   Questionnaire (PEQ), Six-Minute Walk Test and He-3 magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) for the measurement of ventilation abnormalities using the
   ventilation defect percent (VDP).Fourteen COPD patients, self-identified
   as sputum-producers and 13 COPD-non-sputum-producers completed the
   study. Post-oPEP, the PEQ-ease-bringing-up-sputum was improved for
   sputum-producers (p = 0.005) and non-sputum-producers (p = 0.04), the
   magnitude of which was greater for sputum-producers (p = 0.03). There
   were significant post-oPEP improvements for sputum-producers only for
   FVC (p = 0.01), 6MWD (p = 0.04), SGRQ total score (p = 0.01) as well as
   PEQ-patient-global-assessment (p = 0.02). Clinically relevant post-oPEP
   improvements for
   PEQ-ease-bringing-up-sputum/PEQ-patient-global-assessment/SGRQ/VDP were
   observed in 8/7/9/6 of 14 sputum-producers and 2/0/3/3 of 13
   non-sputum-producers. The post-oPEP change in He-3 MRI VDP was related
   to the change in PEQ-ease-bringing-up-sputum (r = 0.65, p = 0.0004) and
   FEV1 (r = -0.50, p = 0.009).In COPD patients with chronic sputum
   production, PEQ and SGRQ scores, FVC and 6MWD improved post-oPEP. FEV1
   and PEQ-ease-bringing-up-sputum improvements were related to improved
   ventilation providing mechanistic evidence to support oPEP use in COPD.

Abstract = {{The amount of solar radiation received on the earth's surface is known
   to be highly influenced by the weather conditions and the geography of a
   particular area. This paper presents some results of an investigation
   that was carried out to find the effects of weather patterns on the
   solar radiation in Brunei Darussalam, a small country that experiences
   equatorial climate due to its geographical location. Weather data were
   collected at a suitable location in the University Brunei Darussalam
   (UBD) and were compared with the available data provided by the Brunei
   Darussalam Meteorological Services (BDMS). It has been found that the
   solar radiation is directly proportional to the atmospheric temperature
   while it is inversely proportional to the relative humidity. It has also
   been found that wind speed has little influence on solar radiation.
   Functional relationships between the solar radiation and the atmospheric
   temperature, and between the solar radiation and the relative humidity
   have also been developed from the BDMS weather data. Finally, an
   artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed for training
   and testing the solar radiation data with the inputs of temperature and
   relative humidity, and a coefficient of determination of around 99\% was
   achieved. This set of data containing all the aforementioned results may
   serve as a guideline on the solar radiation pattern in the geographical
   areas around the equator.}},
