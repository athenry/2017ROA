   this approach reduces computational effort in design of the estimation
   filter and its implementation. The theoretical Mean Square Error (MSE)
   is developed for each case, verified through simulation and compared to
   that of a full Wiener filter. Results are then applied to evaluate
   performance of Alamouti coding Multiple Input Single Output (MISO)

Abstract = {{The Eastern Province of the Kingdom Saudi Arabia is the most important
   region economically and has a total population of about 6 million. The
   region witnessed massive socio-economic development over the last four
   decades which has produced substantial increase in municipal solid waste
   (MSW) generation and electricity demand. This research assesses the
   potential value of Waste-to-Energy (WTE) in alleviating the MSW and
   electricity demand challenges in the region. Two scenarios for WTE
   deployment were developed and projected up to the year 2035: The first
   scenario is Mass Burn and the second is Mass Burn with Recycling. The
   Mass Burn scenario implies complete incineration of the waste stream
   while Mass Burn with Recycling considers segregation of reusable
   materials and incinerates the leftover of the waste stream. The annual
   MSW generation was about 3 million ton/year. The MSW consists of organic
   food, agriculture and garden waste (48.21\%), paper and cardboard
   (1.03\%), plastics (5.8\%), glass (6.8\%), wood (9.63\%) textiles
   (5.77\%) and others (22.31\%). The study shows that the Mass Burn
   scenario has the potential to generate about 272 MW of electricity in
   2035, while Mass Burn with Recycling has the potential to generate about
   81 MW. The potential electrical generation coupled with the
   environmental values of the WTE, shows the substantial benefits of WTE
   facilities to eastern region. The results shall assist the decision
   makers in the region to deploy WTE facility in the region. Further
   investigations are recommended to evaluate the two scenarios based on
   socioeconomic, technical, and environmental criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics of coherent structures generated in channel flows during
   low Reynolds numbers mixed convection have been investigated in a square
   channel. The Gr/Re-2 ranged between 21 and 206 which indicates that
   natural convection was dominant over forced convection. Two-dimensional
   velocity fields were measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   technique in different planes to obtain a three-dimensional perspective
   of the flow field in the channel. The coherent structures were detected
   from the turbulent velocity fields using an algorithm based on the
   velocity gradient tensor second invariant (Q). The location of each
   detected coherent structure was recorded and its turbulent kinetic
   energy was computed. It was found that the strength of coherent
   structures increased with an increase in the bottom wall temperature.
   The results also indicate that the coherent structures present in the
   region away from the bottom heated wall were more energetic compared to
   the coherent structures present within the thermal boundary layer.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal energy storage systems are gaining significance due to their
   potential use to store renewable energy and waste heat. Phase change
   materials (PCMs) are considered to be an efficient way to store thermal
   energy. However, the heat transfer process during the phase change is
   not well understood. We report on an experimental study conducted to
   investigate the heat transfer process in a PCM during melting phase. A
   PCM storage system subjected to bottom heating from a horizontal heated
   cylinder was considered using wax as the PCM. An imaging technique was
   used to capture the movement of the solid-liquid interface. Temperature
   was measured at multiple locations to quantify the heat transfer
   process. The interface was found to move with a relatively uniform
   velocity throughout the melting process however, the heat transfer rate
   was significantly enhanced in the melted (liquid) phase. The local heat
   transfer coefficient was found to decrease with an increase in the
   liquid fraction.}},

Abstract = {{Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel industry and can be converted into
   high value-added applications. The heterogeneous ketalization of
   glycerol with acetone was conducted over a solid acid catalyst of
   Amberlyst-35 in a batch reactor. The thermodynamics and kinetics of the
   ketalization reaction for the synthesis of solketal were investigated.
   The reaction equilibrium constants were determined experimentally in the
   temperature range of 293-323 K, with which the following standard molar
   properties ( at 298 K) were obtained: Delta H-0 = -30.1 +/- 1.6 kJ mol 1
   1, Delta G(0) = -2.1 +/- 0.1 kJ mol (1), Delta S-0 = -0.1 +/- 0.01 kJ
   mol (1) K-1. Effects of various experimental conditions ( stirring
   speed, catalyst addition amount, pressure, temperature, moisture content
   and the feed composition) on the reaction kinetics ( glycerol conversion
   and solketal yield vs. time) were also investigated in this work. A
   two-parameter kinetic law based on a Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate
   expression was used. The activation energy of the overall ketalization
   reaction was determined to be 55.6 +/- 3.1 kJ mol (1). The obtained
   solketal could be synthesized from renewable resources like bioglycerol
   and biomass derived acetone, and seem to be a good candidate for
   different applications such as fuel additive and in pharmaceutical
   industries. The work is an important step for further development of a
   technology for the continuous synthesis and separation of solketal from
   glycerol and acetone. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   controllers are examined to achieve a bumpless transition through
   coordination. The developed scheme has been validated through extensive
   simulation studies. Finally, a physical experimental microgrid with a
   1.2 kW fuel cell power module is constructed to validate the performance
   of the proposed scheme in a physical environment. A grid connection
   interface has been designed and constructed to allow the microgrid to be
   connected to the utility grid ( university campus grid). Experimental
   studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The determination of moisture distribution in a sample of wet solids is
   important as it can provide information on how well a liquid reagent has
   been sprayed in a fluidized bed reactor. The moisture is divided into
   three groups: (i) free moisture, or water coating individual particles;
   (ii) micro-agglomerates, which are fluidized; and (iii)
   macro-agglomerates, which are too large to remain fluidized and,
   consequently, settle to the bottom of the bed. This study evaluates
   various methods for the determination of the moisture distribution in a
   sample of wet solids, such as funnel flow, angle of repose,
   compressibility index, avalanche tests and electrical conductance. In
   addition, a different method is implemented to obtain directly the
   moisture distribution from the bed fluidization quality, based on image
   processing and on the variation with time of the conductance of the
   de-fluidized bed after a liquid injection.
   A solids samplewas taken from the fluidized bed. Its free moisture was
   estimated through the abovementioned tests and its overall moisture was
   used to obtain the fraction of water trapped in micro-agglomerates. The
   amount of water in the macro-agglomerates was then obtained by
   subtracting the measured free and micro-agglomerates moistures from the
   total mass of liquid injected into the bed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The quality of a laser micro-polished (L mu P) surface is dependent upon
   the part material, initial surface topography and roughness, and the
   energy density of the beam used to produce a thin molten layer on the
   finished part. Prior research has shown that the amount of energy
   delivered to the work piece can also be controlled by adjusting the
   ``focal offset distance{''} (FOD) of the laser optics. In this paper,
   the impact of using multiple overlapping trajectories for laser
   polishing on the average surface roughness (R-a) is investigated. The
   analysis is performed on ball-end micromilled H13 tool steel specimens
   polished using a nanosecond Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. The initial surface
   roughness is dependent on the height and width of micromilled scallops.
   The trajectory overlap percentage (TO\%) is an advanced machining
   parameter used to describe the ratio between the size of the polishing
   step and the molten L mu P diameter. The average surface roughness of
   the ``best{''} experimental specimen was reduced from a R-a of 746 nm to
   205 nm (similar to 73\% improvement) using a short distance polishing
   regime (1.3 mm < FOD < 1.8 mm) with a TO\% = 96.8\% (or 2 mu m step
   trajectory). Similar, but less dramatic, reductions in profile R-a were
   also observed for the longer polishing regime (FOD > 2.2 mm). The
   experiments also illustrate that the quality of the final surface finish
   can be further improved by combining continuous wave laser polishing
   (CW-LP) and L mu P.}},

Abstract = {{Range scans of occupied building interiors will often generate a
   cumulative point cloud with disconnected regions due to varying data
   density and the presence of numerous partially occluded objects.
   Boundary detection methods based on surface normal vectors and curvature
   have difficulty in accurately representing occluded region boundaries
   because of the geometric uncertainty associated with the underlying
   polygonal surfaces used to determine the desired geometric parameters.
   An occluded boundary detection algorithm that works directly on point
   clouds without the need to reconstruct rough underlying surface models
   is presented in this paper. The algorithm uses a side-ratio constraint
   to identify the discontinuous boundary points which lie along successive
   scan lines. The basic principle is that the distance between the
   immediate neighboring points at the discontinuous boundary exhibits a
   large disparity when compared to the other points in a contiguous
   surface. The side ratio distance defines the spatial separation of the
   proceeding and succeeding data points on the local grid. The algorithm
   is also able to handle small density inconsistencies by continuously
   comparing the side-ratios of the nearest points within a preset window.
   Spurious point data incorrectly identified as discontinuous boundary
   points are removed using a density-based outlier detection technique.
   The effectiveness of the two-step algorithm is demonstrated on
   real-world data acquired using a FARO (R) LS 880 laser scanner.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology to evaluate the reliability of
   corroding pipelines by simultaneously considering the growth and
   generation of corrosion defects. The non homogeneous Poisson process is
   employed to model the generation of corrosion defects, whereas the
   non-homogeneous gamma process is used to characterize the growth of
   corrosion defects once generated. The parameters included in the non
   homogeneous Poisson process and non-homogeneous gamma process are
   evaluated from the inline inspection data using a hierarchical Bayesian
   model. The measurement errors associated with the inline inspection
   tools are taken into account in the Bayesian updating. The
   time-dependent failure probability of the corroding pipeline is
   evaluated using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. The methodology is
   illustrated using a natural gas pipeline that has been subjected to
   multiple inline inspections over a period of time. The results
   illustrate the necessity to incorporate the generation of new corrosion
   defects in the reliability analysis of corroding pipelines.}},

Abstract = {{The crack tip opening displacement (CTOD)-based fracture toughness has
   been widely used for structural integrity assessment and strain-based
   design of oil and gas pipelines. The double-clip on gauge method has
   been used to experimentally determine CTOD. In this study,
   threedimensional (3D) finite element analyses of clamped single edge
   tension (SE(T)) specimens are carried out to investigate the accuracy of
   the CTOD evaluation equation associated with the double-clip on gauge
   method. The analysis considers SE(T) specimens with ranges of crack
   lengths (0.3 <= a/W <= 0.7) and specimen thickness (B/W = 0.5, 1 and 2).
   Based on the analysis results, a modified CTOD evaluation equation
   based. on the double-clip on gauge method is developed to improve the
   accuracy of the CTOD evaluation. This study will facilitate the

Abstract = {{The primary aim of this work is to utilize a Kalman filter (KF) to
   predict reaching the trip set-point for a trip parameter in a nuclear
   power plant (NPP). To address uncertainty in the predicted measurements,
   prediction bounds are calculated by propagating the state error
   covariance. These predicted bounds enable the calculation of levels of
   confidence in making trip decisions. Further, to address uncertainty in
   the estimation model, the observed prediction error is used to offset
   the predicted measurements.
   The predictive trip detection routines are evaluated through simulations
   of a single NPP sub-system. More specifically, the water level parameter
   in a steam generator of a NPP is considered. The model of this
   sub-system is represented by the Irving linear parameter varying (LPV)
   model with inverse response characteristics. The simulations include a
   level low postulated initiating event (PIE) made to occur during two
   different common power transients for various estimation models. The
   results of this paper are a proof of concept for KF-based predictive
   trip detection which is demonstrated to achieve reduced time-to-trip

   investigate the two-phase flow in an Effervescent atomizer. A novel
   aerator tube base was implemented and tested. It is observed that the
   novel configuration suppresses the separation bubble at the trailing
   edge and results in more uniform and smaller bubbles compared to the
   standard flat base aerator. It has been found that the more uniform and
   smaller bubbles are generated as the mixing chamber length is reduced.
   It is concluded that by using a conical base aerator and by reducing the
   mixing chamber length, the spray steadiness and the atomization process
   can be significantly improved.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic overview and comparison is presented on the seismic hazard
   assessment based on the observations and seismic hazard model, and the
   characteristics of earthquake ground motions for a site, a local area

   using the observations could differ from that evaluated using an adopted
   seismic hazard model. It indicates the importance to judiciously select
   the seismic hazard model, as well as to understand that historical
   records for a limited period may not fully reflect the seismic hazard.
   The comparison is focused on the variability of the ground motion
   measures, the coherency for record components in two orthogonal
   orientations, and the spatial correlation and spatial coherency.
   Procedures for simulating bidirectional excitations at a site, and
   record components at multiple sites for a scenario seismic event are
   given. The application of the simulated record components to estimate
   the seismic loss for a portfolio of hypothetical buildings by
   considering a scenario event is shown, indicating the effectiveness of
   the presented methodology for seismic loss estimation.}},

Pages = {{31745-31753}},
Abstract = {{Owing to the presence of phenolic groups in the lignin structure, this
   provides the potential to substitute bisphenol-A in synthesis of epoxy
   resin. In this work, organosolv lignin (OL) was first depolymerized by
   reductive depolymerization in supercritical acetone at 350 degrees C in
   the presence of Ru/C catalyst and 10 MPa H-2. The obtained depolymerized
   organosolv lignin (DOL), with a low average molecular weight (M-w) and
   high hydroxyl number, was used to synthesize lignin-based epoxy
   pre-polymers. A set of experiments was designed by utilizing the central
   composite design (CCD) to synthesize lignin-based epoxy resin. Three
   synthesis variables including reaction temperature, reaction time and
   NaOH/DOL molar ratio were investigated and the synthesized epoxy
   pre-polymers were characterized by FTIR and potentiometric titration.
   The mathematical model derived from the CCD was found to be accurate to
   predict the optimum conditions. At the optimal synthesis conditions,
   i.e., 8 h at 55 degrees C with NaOH/DOL molar ratio of 6.3, a high
   product yield (99\%) and high epoxy content of similar to 8 were
   achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Components in engineered systems are subjected to stochastic
   deterioration due to the operating environmental conditions, and the
   uncertainty in material properties. The components need to be inspected
   and possibly replaced based on preventive or failure replacement
   criteria to provide the intended and safe operation of the system. In
   the present study, we investigate the influence of dependent stochastic
   degradation of multiple components on the optimal maintenance decisions.
   We use copula to model the dependent stochastic degradation of
   components, and formulate the optimal decision problem based on the
   minimum expected cost rule and the stochastic dominance rules. The
   latter is used to cope with decision maker's risk attitude. We
   illustrate the developed probabilistic analysis approach and the
   influence of the dependency of the stochastic degradation on the
   preferred decisions through numerical examples. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{In this work, the viability of using aqueous-phase sugars derived from
   the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass was analyzed using

   typical constituents and composition ranges and then used to determine
   the fermentation viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effects of
   inhibitory compounds in pyrolytic bio-oil were assessed by fitting
   measured growth kinetics to the model of Baranyi and Roberts (Int. J.
   Food Microbiol. 1994, 23, 277), specifically on the fitted growth rates,
   initial microorganism adaptation, and maximum biomass densities. It was
   found that even a dilution to approximately 10\% of the hypothetical
   inhibitor concentration in aqueous bio-oil was significantly inhibitory
   to growth, although the presence of additional sugars was able to
   moderate this impact slightly. The high-throughput screening used in
   this work allowed for the rapid measurement of a variety of inhibitors

Abstract = {{In cyclic delay diversity orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
   systems, the excessive channel delay spread and corresponding high
   frequency selectivity makes channel estimation a challenging task. In
   this paper, we propose a two-stage scheme to estimate and track the
   highly frequency selective channel. At the preamble reception stage,
   least squares channel estimation with L-0 norm regularization is
   proposed to exploit the channel sparsity. At the data demodulation
   stage, an expectation-maximization algorithm with the most significant
   tap selection is developed to track channel variations by using the
   channel order obtained from the first stage. Compared with other
   estimation methods, the proposed scheme requires no prerequisite
   knowledge of delay parameter settings, which leads to more flexibility.
   Furthermore, the scheme can exploit the channel sparse structure by
   detecting the nonzero taps and, consequently, has better mean squared
   error performance. Simulation results show that the proposed estimation
   scheme can retain the provided diversity gain of cyclic delay diversity
   effectively in time-varying fading channels. Copyright (c) 2011 John

Abstract = {{This study reports a simple and efficient method for the direct
   iodination of substituted anilines with molecular iodine and copper
   acetate in acetic acid producing 2-iodoacetanilies and 2-iodoanilines.
   Employing density functional theory (B3LYP) and MidiX basis set,
   computational study is performed to calculate equilibrium geometries, IR
   vibrational frequencies, and thermodynamic properties including change
   of energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energies. The optimized geometries
   indicated longer C-I bond distance (2.133 angstrom) which makes iodine
   slightly positive. The partial atomic charge profile and electrostatic
   potential further confirmed that most of the iodinated products are
   capable of forming a distinct ``halogen bonding{''}. The thermodynamic
   properties disclosed that all iodination reactions are endothermic.
   Understanding the substituents' effect, molecular frontier orbital (MO)
   calculations are conducted finding the HOMO, LUMO and HOMO-LUMO gaps for
   all compounds. The MO calculations revealed that two
   electron-withdrawing iodine groups have significant influence on
   lowering the HOMO-LUMO gap compared to one iodine group in the products.

Abstract = {{This study reports a mechanistic based kinetics for the catalytic

   based on H-ZSM5. An original ``parallel{''} heterogeneous kinetic model
   assuming a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism is developed. It is based on
   the experimental data obtained in the CREC Riser Simulator, using
   benzothiophene/n-dodecane mixtures at mild temperatures (350-450 degrees
   C) and short contact times (3, 5, and 7 s). A lump reaction network is
   proposed involving benzothiophene, coke-on-catalyst,
   alkyl-benzothiophene, n-dodecane, and n-dodecane cracking products
   (paraffins, olefins, and aromatics). The adsorption and intrinsic
   kinetic model parameters are successfully estimated using regression
   analysis and a rigorous statistical analysis. The estimated parameters
   with low spans for the 95\% confidence interval and low cross
   correlation coefficients are able to predict well the experimentally
   observed products. This developed kinetic model is of great value for
   the scaling-up of the proposed desulfurization downer/riser technology.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a proprietary catalyst (VN-TiO2) was compared with
   standard P25 TiO2 for removal of methylene blue in water using
   immobilized photocatalysis. Using a fiberglass disk as the support
   medium dip coated in the VN-TiO2 solution and calcining, porous films
   with a high surface area (up to 109 m(2)/g) were produced without any
   modification. Although films formed with VN-TiO2 on fiberglass disks had
   a reaction rate 50\% lower than that of P25, the disks coated with
   VN-TiO2 were mechanically robust in the reactor, compared to those
   coated with P25. The addition of only 15 wt \% P25 in the VN-TiO2
   solution increased the reaction rate by 40\%, while maintaining the
   mechanical stability. The reuse potential of both catalysts was tested,
   and the rates of deactivation were comparable for both catalysts.
   Deactivation occurred due to sustained adsorption of Methylene Blue
   intermediates, as well as a loss of active sites, because of heat
   treatment for reactivation. Low-priced fiberglass in combination with
   the easily impregnable polymer-encapsulated titania is a viable option
   for producing mechanically robust and uniform catalyst coating for
   immobilized photoreactors.}},

Abstract = {{Calcite microbialites in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia, exhibit a
   diverse range in macro-morphology, biomass abundance, porosity, and
   mineral content To evaluate the role of microorganisms in their
   formation, samples collected from a range of depths were examined by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and synchrotron radiation-based
   micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) spectroscopy to characterize both
   their outer surfaces as well as internal structures. Observed trends in
   both surface colonization as well as microbialite framework with
   increasing lake depth include decreasing microbial abundance on outer
   surfaces as well as increasing ratios of carbonate :biomass in the
   microbialites. Microscopic investigations of the interiors show bacteria
   and algae entrapped within calcite, with this calate exhibiting
   micropores and casts similar in size and shape to microorganisms. Based
   on these observations, it is hypothesized that microbialite development
   in Pavilion Lake initiates calcite precipitation in phototrophic
   microbial mats, i.e., combined phototrophy and heterotrophy, followed by
   heterotrophic oxidation of organic matter leading to eventual carbonate
   infilling of the microbial-mineral matrix. In addition, an observed
   shift from cyanobacteria to algae with increasing lake depth suggests
   variability in contemporary conditions controlling microbialite growth
   and diagenesis. High photosynthetic growth rates at shallower depths
   result in significant porosity and friability due to biomass
   accumulation outpacing carbonate precipitation. At intermediate depths,
   lower light levels and slower growth rates of phototrophs lead to a
   greater proportion of the microbialite matrix being in-filled by
   carbonate. Carbonates precipitate initially within the bacteria-EPS
   matrix, with abundant uncalcified algae maintaining microbialite
   porosity. In the deepest waters, the presence of only sparse algal
   colonization as well as fine-grained, laminated metal-rich sediments
   covering microbialites suggests that present-day insolation levels are
   too low to support the development of photosynthetic microbial mats. As
   a consequence, heterotrophic carbonate precipitation has progressively
   in-filled these microbialite interiors to create lithified calcite
   fabrics that exhibit minimal porosity but preserve the casts of
   microorganisms as biosignatures. While the origin of microbialites in
   Pavilion Lake remains unknown, current observations provide valuable
   information in evaluating how environmental conditions influence
   microbialite growth in a freshwater, lacustrine environment Published by

Title = {{A review of binders used in cemented paste tailings for underground and
   surface disposal practices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{Increased public awareness of environmental issues coupled with
   increasingly stringent environmental regulations pertaining to the
   disposal of sulphidic mine waste necessitates the mining industry to
   adopt more competent and efficient approaches to manage acid rock
   drainage. Cemented paste tailings (CPT) is an innovative form of
   amalgamated material currently available to the mining industry in
   developed countries. It is made usually from mill tailings mingled with
   a small amount of binder (customarily Portland cement) and water. The
   high cost associated with production and haulage of ordinary Portland
   cement and its alleged average performance as a sole binder in the long
   term (due to vulnerability to internal sulphate attack) have prompted
   users to appraise less expensive and technically efficient substitutes
   for mine tailings paste formulations. Generally, these binders include
   but are not limited to sulphate resistant cements, and/or as a partial
   replacement for Portland cement by artificial pozzolans, natural
   pozzolans, calcium sulphate substances and sodium silicates. The
   approach to designing environmentally efficient CPT is to ensure
   long-term stability and effective control over environmental
   contaminants through the use of composite binder systems with enhanced
   engineering properties to cater for inherit deficiencies in the
   individual constituents. The alkaline pore solution created by high free
   calcium rich cement kiln dust (CKD) (byproduct of cement manufacturing)
   is capable of disintegrating the solid glassy network of artificial
   pozzolans to produce reactive silicate and aluminate species when
   attacked by (OH-) ions. The augmented pozzolanic reactivity of CKD-slag
   and CKD-fly ash systems may produce resilient CPT. Since cemented paste
   comprising mine tailings and binders is a relatively new technology, a
   review of the binding materials used in such formulations and their
   performance evaluation in mechanical fill behaviour was considered
   pertinent in the study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Prevention of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy by Non-Mitogenic Acidic

   Oxidative Stress and Damage}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: Emerging evidence showed the beneficial effect of acidic
   fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) on heart diseases. The present study
   investigated whether non-mitogenic aFGF (nm-aFGF) can prevent diabetic
   cardiomyopathy and the underlying mechanisms, if any.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Type 1 diabetes was induced in mice by
   multiple intraperitoneal injections of low-dose streptozotocin.
   Hyperglycemic and age-matched control mice were treated with or without
   nm-aFGF at 10 mu g/kg daily for 1 and 6 months. Blood pressure and
   cardiac function were assessed. Cardiac H9c2 cell, human microvascular
   endothelial cells, and rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to high glucose
   (25 mM) for mimicking an in vitro diabetic condition for mechanistic
   studies. Oxidative stress, DNA damage, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis
   were assessed by real-time qPCR, immunofluorescent staining, Western
   blotting, and pathological examination. Nm-aFGF significantly prevented
   diabetes-induced hypertension and cardiac dysfunction at 6 months.
   Mechanistic studies demonstrated that nm-aFGF showed the similar
   preventive effect as the native aFGF on high glucose-induced oxidative
   stress (increase generation of reactive oxygen species) and damage
   (cellular DNA oxidation), cell hypertrophy, and fibrotic response
   (increased mRNA expression of fibronectin) in three kinds of cells.
   These in vitro findings were recaptured by examining the heart of the
   diabetic mice with and without nm-aFGF.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that nm-aFGF can prevent diabetic
   cardiomyopathy, probably through attenuation of cardiac oxidative
   stress, hypertrophy, and fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene substrates are known to have randomly located functional groups
   on their surface, particularly at their edges, including carboxylate,
   carbonyl, epoxy, and alcohol functionalities. However, the detailed
   interactions of these graphene functionalities with metal oxide
   nanoclusters are unexplored. This work examined the interaction of
   titania nanostructures with both graphene and functionalized graphene
   nanoribbons (GNRs) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
   The interactions of TiO2 (anatase, rutile, and molecular) with graphene
   were found to favor the physisorption of rutile titania. The
   interactions of TiO2 with GNRs were found to considerably improve the
   strength of the nanostructure binding to the substrate with rutile and
   anatase showing similar chemisorption. Charge density maps showed the
   importance of the electron distribution in the interaction between
   titania and graphene with chemisorption sites. Valuable information on
   the strength of the binding energies was determined by studying the
   electronic structure using partial density of states (PDOS) of the
   TiO2/graphene systems at specific adsorption sites. These results show
   the potential for controlled and oriented growth mechanisms that have
   applications in next generation photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical and inclined piles are used in seismic areas where they could
   be subjected to oblique harmonic vibration loads. The effect of closely
   spaced battered piles on the pile soil pile interaction has not yet been
   fully recognized. A simple analytical method, based on the
   elasto-dynamic theory by Novak and his associates, is used in the
   present study to characterize vertical and inclined isolated cylindrical
   piles subjected to inclined harmonic vibrations. The free field movement
   of the ground in the vicinity of the piles is determined using an
   approximate approach based on the interference of the cylindrical wave
   field originating along each pile shall and spreading radially outward.
   In calculating the interaction factor between two battered piles, an
   analysis has been carried out to demonstrate the effect of the presence
   of a neighboring pile (receiver) while the first pile (source) is
   loaded. In this situation, it has been found that the movement of the
   source pile head is decreased when a receiver pile is present. Also, the
   effects of the pile pile distance, the group geometry, the length of the
   piles, and the inclined angle for each or all of the piles have been
   studied and the corresponding results will be presented. (C) 2013 The

   impairment.
   Design: A systematic review followed by a primary economic analysis with
   computer-based econometric modeling.
   Participants: Not applicable.
   Methods: We constructed a decision analytic model from the perspective
   of the public third-party payer (i.e., the Ministry of Health) to
   conduct a CEA of both surgeries, ISBCS and DSBCS. Cost data consisted of
   the costs of the surgery, intravitreal injections, medications, and
   drops, all of which were obtained from a comprehensive literature search
   and from records at St. Joseph's Hospital, London, Ont. The
   effectiveness was measured by the utility values associated with visual
   acuity in the better seeing eye.
   Results: ISBCS resulted in an incremental effectiveness of 0.08 utility
   at an incremental cost of \$1607. Discounting the qualityadjusted
   life-years (QALYs) gained by an annual interest rate of 3\% resulted in
   0.932 QALYs gained. The cost-effectiveness of ISBCS was calculated to be
   \$1431 per QALY gained. A 1-way sensitivity analysis was performed by
   varying costs, utility values, probabilities, and discounting rates.
   This analysis varied the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio but did
   not change the conclusion.
   Conclusions: Health economics assessment showed that, compared with
   DSBCS, ISBCS is a cost-effective procedure. This finding will be highly
   useful to policy-makers, decision-makers, clinicians, hospital
   administrators, and payers in making cost-efficient decisions.}},

   transmission tower}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{493-501}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Electrical transmission structures play a vital role in power
   transmission networks throughout the world and are often subject to
   strong wind loads. The present study investigates the inelastic response
   of a self-supported lattice transmission tower under different wind
   events, including traditional atmospheric boundary layer wind (ABL) and
   downburst wind, and for wind loading at different directions relative to
   the tower. The nonlinear static pushover (NSP) analysis is, used to
   obtain the capacity curve of the tower, defined by the force-deformation
   relationship, at each considered wind direction. The results show that
   the yield and maximum capacities vary with wind direction. The
   deformation trajectory is projected on the horizontal plan for each wind
   direction, illustrating the out-of-plane loading deformation. Since the
   trajectories are sufficiently smooth and do not overlap for closely
   spaced wind directions, it is suggested that the capacity curves
   obtained for different wind directions can be used to form the capacity
   surface of the tower. Moreover, the results indicate that the capacity
   for ABL and rectangular (uniform) winds could provide an approximate
   envelope for the capacity estimated for different sizes of downburst
   events. These findings could assist in the evaluation of the adequacy of
   existing towers under downburst events, as well as in the design of new
   towers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network that consists of
   one cognitive base station (CBS) and multiple cognitive users (CUs) in
   the presence of multiple eavesdroppers, where CUs transmit their data
   packets to CBS under a primary user's quality of service (QoS)
   constraint while the eavesdroppers attempt to intercept the cognitive
   transmissions from CUs to CBS. We investigate the physical-layer
   security against eavesdropping attacks in the cognitive radio network
   and propose the user scheduling scheme to achieve multiuser diversity
   for improving the security level of cognitive transmissions with a
   primary QoS constraint. Specifically, a cognitive user (CU) that
   satisfies the primary QoS requirement and maximizes the achievable
   secrecy rate of cognitive transmissions is scheduled to transmit its
   data packet. For the comparison purpose, we also examine the traditional
   multiuser scheduling and the artificial noise schemes. We analyze the
   achievable secrecy rate and intercept probability of the traditional and
   proposed multiuser scheduling schemes as well as the artificial noise
   scheme in Rayleigh fading environments. Numerical results show that
   given a primary QoS constraint, the proposed multiuser scheduling scheme
   generally outperforms the traditional multiuser scheduling and the
   artificial noise schemes in terms of the achievable secrecy rate and
   intercept probability. In addition, we derive the diversity order of the
   proposed multiuser scheduling scheme through an asymptotic intercept
   probability analysis and prove that the full diversity is obtained by
   using the proposed multiuser scheduling.}},

   Numerical simulations were carried out for an SMBR unit consisting of
   four columns and operated with various temperature distributions in the
   range of 308-323 K. SMBR productivities were evaluated and compared
   under the constraints of complete conversion and complete product

Abstract = {{Objective measurement of real-world fall events by using body-worn
   sensor devices can improve the understanding of falls in older people
   and enable new technology to prevent, predict, and automatically
   recognize falls. However, these events are rare and hence challenging to
   capture. The FARSEEING (FAII Repository for the design of Smart and
   sElf-adapaive Environments prolonging INdependent livinG) consortium and
   associated partners strongly argue that a sufficient dataset of
   real-world falls can only be acquired through a collaboration of many
   research groups. Therefore, the major aim of the FARSEEING project is to
   build a meta-database of real-world falls. To establish this
   meta-database, standardization of data is necessary to make it possible
   to combine different sources for analysis and to guarantee data quality.
   A consensus process was started in January 2012 to propose a standard
   fall data format, involving 40 experts from different countries and
   different disciplines working in the field of fall recording and fall
   prevention. During a web-based Delphi process, possible variables to
   describe participants, falls, and fall signals were collected and rated
   by the experts. The summarized results were presented and finally
   discussed during a workshop at the 20th Conference of the International
   Society of Posture and Gait Research 2012, in Trondheim, Norway. The
   consensus includes recommendations for a fall definition, fall reporting
   (including fall reporting frequency, and fall reporting variables), a
   minimum clinical dataset, a sensor configuration, and variables to
   describe the signal characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the displacement interpolations and curvature-displacement
   relationship of spatial curved beam theory, a finite element model of
   iced conductor galloping is presented, which involves 3 translational
   degrees of freedom (DOE) and 3 rotational DOF. The nonlinearity and
   coupling of translational and torsional movement can be taken into
   account in this model. A nonlinear iteration algorithm is employed to
   solve for the equilibrium position under eccentric gravity loads and the
   quasi-steady aerodynamic forces. The linearized movement equations are
   derived and the stability of the equations is judged according to the
   initial equilibrium solution (IES). Time integration is also performed

Abstract = {{An investigation of the wind field around roof-mounted solar arrays has
   been undertaken, utilizing synchronized time-resolved particle image
   velocimetry and pressure measurements, in order to better understand the
   flow structures and aerodynamic mechanisms which cause the peak wind
   loads. The study focused on wall normal wind directions, which result in
   critical loads on panels within the separation bubble. The mean flow is
   not significantly altered above the array as compared to that for a bare
   roof. However, the array has a significant effect on the turbulence
   above and around the panels in the separation bubble. When panels are
   installed on the roof, both Reynolds normal and Reynolds shear stresses
   are markedly reduced when compared to the flow over the bare roof in the
   region of the separated shear layer. Ensemble averaged flow fields,
   conditioned on peak panel uplift, were used to investigate the
   mechanisms associated with peak uplifts on the array. As the tilt angle
   of the solar array is increased, a progression from purely vortex driven
   suctions, which cause peak uplifts on a bare roof, towards local flow
   driven uplifts is observed. For small tilt angle (2) arrays this local
   flow is established by large-scale building generated vortices, while
   for the larger tilt angle (20) arrays the instantaneous reattachment of
   the (building generated) separated shear layer sets up the local flow.
   For the larger tilt angles, south wind peak uplifts are driven by large
   vertical gusts, while peaks for northern winds are the result of
   streamwise gusts. The interaction of these large-scale features with the
   panels, in the form of locally oriented drag, results in the peak
   uplifting loads. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most boundary-layer wind tunnels (BLWTs) were built for testing models
   of large civil engineering structures that have geometric scales ranging
   from 1:500 to 1:100. However, producing aerodynamic models of the solar
   panels at such scales makes the modules too small, resulting in at least
   two technical problems. First, the resolution of pressure data on such
   small models becomes low. Second, the test model may be placed in the
   lower portion of the boundary-layer that is not a true representative of
   a real world scenario, due to high uncertainty in wind velocity. To
   alleviate these problems, development of a standardized testing protocol
   is very important. Such protocol should account for different time and
   geometric scales to design appropriate wind tunnel experiments that can
   allow accurate assessment of wind loads on the solar panels. The current
   paper systematically investigates the sensitivity of wind loads to
   testing ground-mounted solar panels, both experimentally (in a BLWT) and
   numerically (by computational fluid dynamics (CFD)), at, different
   geometric scales. While mean loads are not significantly affected by the
   model size, peak loads are sensitive to both the geometric scale and the
   spectral content of the test flow. However, when the objective is to
   predict 3-s (three seconds) peak loads, large models can be tested in a
   flow that has reduced high-frequency turbulence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{During reconstructive surgery of the face, one side may be used as a
   template for the other, exploiting assumed bilateral facial symmetry.
   The best method to calculate this plane, however, is debated. A new
   semi-automatic technique for calculating the symmetry plane of the
   facial skeleton is presented here that uses surface models reconstructed
   from computed tomography image data in conjunction with principal
   component analysis and an iterative closest point alignment method. This
   new technique was found to provide more accurate symmetry planes than
   traditional methods when applied to a set of 7 human craniofacial
   skeleton specimens, and showed little vulnerability to missing model
   data, usually deviating less than 1.5 degrees and 2 mm from the intact
   model symmetry plane when 30 mm radius voids were present. This new
   technique will be used for subsequent studies measuring symmetry of the
   facial skeleton for different patient populations. (C) 2013 IPEM.

Abstract = {{A butyl rubber derivative that can be cured upon exposure to UV light in
   the absence of additional chemical additives was developed. This polymer
   was prepared by the reaction of hydroxyl-functionalized butyl rubber
   with cinnamoyl chloride to provide a cinnamate functionalized rubber.
   The cinnamate content was varied by starting with derivatives prepared
   from butyl rubber containing either 2 or 7 mol\% isoprene. The kinetics
   of the cross-linking was studied by UV-visible spectroscopy and it was
   found to vary according to the film thickness. The changes in gel
   content and volume swelling ratio with irradiation time were dependent
   on the cinnamate content. Toxicity studies suggested that the
   cross-linked materials do not leach toxic molecules. The approach was
   also applied to obtain crosslinked films of butyl rubber-poly(ethylene
   oxide) graft copolymers, leading to surfaces that resisted the adhesion
   and growth of cells. Thus the approach is versatile and is of particular
   interest when non-leaching coatings of cross-linked butyl rubber are
   desired for biomedical or other applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{PurposeTo compare hyperpolarized helium-3 (He-3) and xenon-129 (Xe-129)
   MRI in asthmatics before and after salbutamol inhalation.
   Materials and MethodsSeven asthmatics provided written informed consent
   and underwent spirometry, plethysmography, and MRI before and after
   salbutamol inhalation. He-3 and Xe-129 ventilation defect percent (VDP)
   and ventilation coefficient of variation (COV) were measured. To
   characterize the airways spatially related to ventilation defects, wall
   area percent (WA\%) and lumen area (LA) were evaluated for two subjects
   who had thoracic x-ray computed tomography (CT) acquired 1 year before
   MRI.
   ResultsBefore salbutamol inhalation, Xe-129 VDP (8 5\%) was
   significantly greater than He-3 VDP (6 +/- 5\%, P = 0.003).
   Post-salbutamol, there was a significant improvement in both Xe-129 (5
   +/- 4\%, P < 0.0001) and He-3 (4 +/- 3\%, P = 0.001) VDP, and the
   improvement in Xe-129 VDP was significantly greater (P = 0.008). Xe-129
   MRI COV (Pre: 0.309 +/- 0.028, Post: 0.296 +/- 0.036) was significantly
   greater than He-3 MRI COV (Pre: 0.282 +/- 0.018, Post: 0.269 +/- 0.024),
   pre- (P < 0.0001) and post-salbutamol (P < 0.0001) and the decrease in
   COV post-salbutamol was significant (Xe-129, P = 0.002; He-3, P <
   0.0001). For a single asthmatic, a sub-segmental Xe-129 MRI ventilation
   defect that was visible only before salbutamol inhalation but not
   visible using He-3 MRI was spatially related to a remodeled fourth
   generation sub-segmental airway (WA\% = 78\%, LA = 2.9 mm(2)).
   ConclusionIn asthma, hyperpolarized Xe-129 MRI may help reveal
   ventilation abnormalities before bronchodilation that are not observed
   using hyperpolarized He-3 MRI. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

Abstract = {{Typical SPICE models for characterization of package/board power
   distribution networks (PDNs) are based on a 2-D discretization of the
   Helmholtz wave equation and hence require high computational costs. In
   this paper, a novel waveform relaxation (WR) algorithm for the
   parallelizable simulation of PDNs is presented. The key feature of this
   paper is the development of a 2-D partitioning methodology with
   overlapping, which addresses the slow convergence of conventional
   nonoverlapping-based WR algorithms for PDNs. In addition, a hybrid
   iterative technique is proposed that can provide additional exchange of
   information between the overlapping subcircuits to further improve the
   convergence of traditional Gauss-Jacobi-based relaxation iterations. The
   overall algorithm is highly parallelizable and exhibits good scaling
   with both the size of the circuit matrices involved and the number of
   CPUs available. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
   validity and efficiency of the proposed paper.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundDevelopment of new imaging technologies and advances in
   computing power have enabled the physicians to perform medical
   interventions on the basis of high-quality 3D and/or 4D visualization of
   the patient's organs. Preoperative imaging has been used for planning
   the surgery, whereas intraoperative imaging has been widely employed to
   provide visual feedback to a clinician when he or she is performing the
   procedure. In the past decade, such systems demonstrated great potential
   in image-guided minimally invasive procedures on different organs, such
   as brain, heart, liver and kidneys. This article focuses on image-guided
   interventions and surgery in renal and hepatic surgeries.
   MethodsA comprehensive search of existing electronic databases was
   completed for the period of 2000-2011. Each contribution was assessed by
   the authors for relevance and inclusion. The contributions were
   categorized on the basis of the type of operation/intervention, imaging
   modality and specific techniques such as image fusion and augmented
   reality, and organ motion tracking.
   ResultsAs a result, detailed classification and comparative study of
   various contributions in image-guided renal and hepatic interventions
   are provided. In addition, the potential future directions have been
   sketched.
   ConclusionWith a detailed review of the literature, potential future
   trends in development of image-guided abdominal interventions are
   identified, namely, growing use of image fusion and augmented reality,
   computer-assisted and/or robot-assisted interventions, development of
   more accurate registration and navigation techniques, and growing
   applications of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The growth of surface-immobilized gold nanoparticles with organometallic
   (OM)CVD on amine-terminated surfaces, utilizing a

   Samples fabricated using various deposition times are characterized by
   UV-vis spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Particle
   stability on the samples is tested by washing and rinsing treatments
   with various organic solvents. A biotin-streptavidin scheme is applied
   to demonstrate the biosensing capabilities of the samples. The size,
   interparticle distance, and shape of the gold nanoparticles demonstrates
   that OMCVD is a simple, economic, and fast way of fabricating
   surface-bonded and stable gold nanoparticles. The plasmonic properties,
   the stability of the particles, and the biotin-streptavidin test show
   that these OMCVD-grown gold nanoparticles are suitable for reproducible,
   low noise, and highly sensitive biosensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{We report the results of a new 60 ks Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced
   CCD Imaging Spectrometer S-array (ACIS-S) observation of the reddened,
   radio-selected, highly polarized `FeLoBAL' quasar FIRST J1556+3517. We
   investigated a number of models of varied sophistication to fit the
   531-photon spectrum. These models ranged from simple power laws to power
   laws absorbed by hydrogen gas in differing ionization states and degrees
   of partial covering. Preferred fits indicate that the intrinsic X-ray
   flux is consistent with that expected for quasars of similarly high
   luminosity, i.e. an intrinsic, dereddened and unabsorbed optical to
   X-ray spectral index of -1.7. We cannot tightly constrain the intrinsic
   X-ray power-law slope, but find indications that it is flat (photon
   index Gamma = 1.7 or flatter at a > 99 per cent confidence for a neutral
   hydrogen absorber model). Absorption is present, with a column density a
   few times 10(23) cm(-2), with both partially ionized models and
   partially covering neutral hydrogen models providing good fits. We
   present several lines of argument that suggest the fraction of X-ray
   emissions associated with the radio jet is not large. We combine our
   Chandra data with observations from the literature to construct the
   spectral energy distribution of FIRST J1556+3517 from radio to X-ray
   energies. We make corrections for Doppler beaming for the pole-on radio
   jet, optical dust reddening and X-ray absorption, in order to recover a
   probable intrinsic spectrum. The quasar FIRST J1556+3517 seems to be an
   intrinsically normal radio-quiet quasar with a reddened optical/UV
   spectrum, a Doppler-boosted but intrinsically weak radio jet and an
   X-ray absorber not dissimilar from that of other broad absorption line
   quasars.}},

Abstract = {{The compressive capacity of helical piles in sand and clay is
   investigated by means of field testing and numerical modeling. The
   numerical models are conducted using the computer program ABAQUS and are
   calibrated and verified using full-scale load testing data. The
   calibration was accomplished by using reasonable assumptions regarding
   soil-pile interaction and soil parameters reported from the literature.
   The model was verified by comparing its predictions with observed
   load-displacement curves obtained from full-scale pile load tests. The
   verified numerical model was used to perform a parametric study
   considering different pile configurations and soil parameters to
   evaluate the compressive capacity and load-transfer mechanism of helical
   piles. The compressive capacity obtained from the numerical models is
   compared with that obtained from existing theoretical methods for
   calculating the capacity. It is found that the predictions of
   theoretical equations for piles in cohesionless soil vary largely
   depending on the choice of bearing capacity factors and proper failure
   criteria. The interaction of closely spaced helices on the capacity of a
   helical pile is also evaluated. A bearing capacity reduction factor, R,
   and helix efficiency factor, EH, are proposed to evaluate the
   compressive capacity of helical piles in cohesionless soil considering
   an industry-acceptable ultimate load criterion corresponding to
   settlement equal to 5\% of helix diameter, D.}},

Title = {{An evaluation of Sherwood-Gilland models for NAPL dissolution and their
   relationship to soil properties}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{87-98}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the longevity of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) source zones
   has proven to be a difficult modeling problem that has yet to be
   resolved. Research efforts towards understanding NAPL depletion have
   focused on developing empirical models that relate lumped mass transfer
   rates to velocities and organic saturations. These empirical models are
   often unable to predict NAPL dissolution for systems different from
   those used to calibrate them, indicating that system-specific factors
   important for dissolution are not considered. This introduces the need
   for a calibration step before these models can be reliably used to
   predict NAPL dissolution for systems of arbitrary characteristics.
   In this paper, five published Sherwood-Gilland models are evaluated
   using experimental observations from the dissolution of two
   laboratory-scale complex three-dimensional NAPL source zones. It is
   shown that the relative behavior of the five models depends on the
   system and source zone characteristics. Through a theoretical analysis,
   comparing Sherwood-Gilland type models to a process-based, thermodynamic
   dissolution model, it is shown that the coefficients of the
   Sherwood-Gilland models can be related to measurable soil properties.
   The derived dissolution model with soil-dependent coefficients predicts
   concentrations identical to those predicted by the thermodynamic
   dissolution model for cases with negligible hysteresis. This
   correspondence breaks down when hysteresis has a significant impact on
   interfacial areas. In such cases, the derived dissolution model will
   slightly underestimate dissolved concentrations at later times, but is
   more likely to capture system-specific dissolution rates than
   Sherwood-Gilland models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Critical state soil mechanics is a useful framework to understand sand
   behavior. In this paper, a relationship is developed for estimating
   undrained critical shear strength of sands based on the critical state
   framework. The relationship is validated by comparison with laboratory
   test results and sand liquefied strength from field liquefaction failure
   case histories. Using this relationship, the influence of fines content
   on undrained critical shear strength is studied for different
   combinations of effective stress and density. The parametric study
   indicates that depending on soil void ratio, effective stress, and the
   shape and mineralogy of the fine particles, undrained critical strength
   may increase, remain the same, or decrease as the amount of fines
   content increases. Both the susceptibility to liquefaction and the
   severity of strain-softening are affected by adding fines. It is
   suggested that the critical state parameter is inadequate for describing
   the behavior of liquefiable sands and sand shearing-compressibility
   should be taken into account in liquefaction analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The isolation of vibrations from the surroundings is one of the
   important problems in the design of machine foundations. The use of open
   trenches, infilled trenches, single and multiple pile rows have been
   widely studied. In this paper, the vibration screening efficiency of an
   inclined secant micro-pile wall positioned as an active vibration
   barrier is investigated. The study is performed using three-dimensional
   time domain finite element analyses. Various parameters such as barrier
   depth, inclination, barrier distance and load excitation frequency were
   studied. The results show that inclined secant micro-pile walls are a
   viable vibration isolation option for a multitude of vibration problems.
   It is shown that varying barrier inclination angle from 90 degrees to
   120 degrees improved vibration isolation performance as high as 44\%
   relative to the vertical barrier for the active isolation case. The
   effectiveness of the barrier increases as its depth increases and also
   as the excitation frequency increases. The orientation of the inclined
   barrier towards or against vibration source is shown to be a fundamental
   design consideration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large megathrust subduction earthquakes generate prolific aftershock
   sequences which last over an extended period of time and affect wide
   spatial areas. Among those aftershocks, the largest ones can cause
   additional damage and pose significant risks to population and
   infrastructure. Therefore, modeling aftershock sequences of large
   subduction earthquakes is of considerable importance for seismic-hazard
   assessment and earthquake risk mitigation. It can also play a prominent
   role in the ground-shaking modeling of major mainshock-aftershock
   sequences. In this work, we analyze statistical properties of aftershock
   sequences of large subduction earthquakes worldwide which occurred from
   1973 to present, including recent catastrophic events in Sumatra, Chile,
   and Japan. We use information provided in the National Earthquake
   Information Center (NEIC) catalog to extract 70 aftershock sequences
   generated by main-shocks of M 7.0 and above. We construct their temporal
   decay rates and magnitude-frequency statistics. To model their temporal
   behavior, we estimate the parameters of the modified Omori law. In the
   magnitude domain, we model the frequency-magnitude statistics using the
   Gutenberg-Richter scaling relationship. We also analyze statistically
   the difference between the magnitude of the mainshock and the
   corresponding largest aftershock in the sequence and discuss this in
   terms of Bath's law. One of the main goals of this work is to
   investigate the variation in parameter values of the above empirical
   laws with respect to the magnitude of the mainshock. Our main finding
   indicates that most parameters do not depend on the magnitude of the
   mainshock. However, they show some variation in values across different
   subduction settings.}},

Abstract = {{This study is motivated by the fact that no design provisions currently
   exist specifically for conical tanks under seismic excitations. The
   design of liquid storage structures is governed by the American Water
   Works Association (AWWA), American Petroleum Institute (API), or
   Eurocode 8. An approximate method based on replacing the conical tank
   with an equivalent cylinder is given in these design codes. The state of
   stresses in conical tanks is different than that of cylindrical tanks. A
   previously established equivalent mechanical model is used to determine
   the response of a number of conical tanks under horizontal excitations.
   The models incorporate the different components of the hydrodynamic
   pressure and account for flexibility of the tank walls. Using an
   assortment of seismic hazard areas, the maximum base shear force and
   overturning moment are evaluated for a number of conical tanks. Those
   are compared to the corresponding values predicted by the design codes
   using the equivalent cylinder approach. The results reveal that this
   approximate approach is not adequate for designing conical tanks to
   resist seismic excitations.}},

Abstract = {{Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a minimally invasive
   alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement for severe aortic
   stenosis in high-risk patients in which a stent-based bioprosthetic
   valve is delivered into the heart via a catheter. TAVI relies largely on
   single-plane fluoroscopy for intraoperative navigation and guidance,
   which provides only gross imaging of anatomical structures. Inadequate
   imaging leading to suboptimal valve positioning contributes to many of
   the early complications experienced by TAVI patients, including valve
   embolism, coronary ostia obstruction, paravalvular leak, heart block,
   and secondary nephrotoxicity from excessive contrast use. Improved
   visualization can be provided using intraoperative registration of a
   CT-derived surface to transesophageal echo (TEE) images. In this study,
   the accuracy and robustness of a surface-based registration method
   suitable for intraoperative use are evaluated, and the performances of
   different TEE surface extraction methods are compared. The use of
   cross-plane TEE contours demonstrated the best accuracy, with
   registration errors of less than 5 mm. This guidance system uses minimal
   intraoperative interaction and workflow modification, does not require
   tool calibration or additional intraoperative hardware, and can be
   implemented at all cardiac centers at extremely low cost.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{613-626}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Natural convection of non-Fourier fluid of the single-phase-lagging
   (SPL) type between two horizontal walls (Rayleigh-Benard) has been
   investigated. These fluids possess a relaxation time, reflecting the
   delay in the response of the heat flux and the temperature gradient with
   respect to one another. By invoking the role of the eigenvectors to
   detect and quantify short-time behavior, transient growth of energy of
   disturbances has been illustrated. The energy of the perturbations is
   introduced in terms of the primary variables as a disturbance measure in
   order to quantify the size of the disturbance. In contrast to linear
   stability analysis, one does not assume exponential time dependence, but
   monitor the evolution of initial conditions in the pre- and
   post-critical ranges of Rayleigh numbers. Different growth functions for
   different levels of non-Fourier effects have been found, which should be
   thought of as the envelope of the energy evolution of individual initial
   conditions. Also, it is found that nonlinearities are not required for
   the energy growth. Energy growth can occur if non-orthogonal
   eigenfunctions are available. A fundamental implication of the
   non-normality is that there can be significant energy growth in the
   energy of perturbations even if the flow is stable. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile
   biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent
   apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3) peptide on
   multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy.
   Methods: Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus
   mutans, and Entero coccus faecalis were cultured in a
   peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined
   in equal proportions. The mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile
   coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the
   formation of mixed species biofilm. After incubation for 3 weeks, the
   samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated
   calcium hydroxide solution (CH), 2\% chlorhexidine solution (CHX), and
   50 mu g/mL HBD3 solution. A commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was
   used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture
   of biofilms. The percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio
   of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. Results:
   Three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume
   within the biofilms compared, with the control group (P < .001). The
   HBD3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the
   other medication groups (P < .05). The CH and CHX groups showed higher
   levels of bactericidal activity than saline (P < .05), and there was no
   significant difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). Conclusions: HBD3
   peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature
   multispecies biofilms in vitro than either CH or CHX.}},

Title = {{Inter-slice bidirectional registration-based segmentation of the
   prostate gland in MR and CT image sequences}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Accurate segmentation and volume estimation of the prostate
   gland in magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images are
   necessary steps in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of prostate
   cancer. This paper presents an algorithm for the prostate gland volume
   estimation based on the semiautomated segmentation of individual slices
   in T2-weighted MR and CT image sequences.
   Methods: The proposed Inter-Slice Bidirectional Registration-based
   Segmentation (iBRS) algorithm relies on interslice image registration of
   volume data to segment the prostate gland without the use of an
   anatomical atlas. It requires the user to mark only three slices in a
   given volume dataset, i. e., the first, middle, and last slices. Next,
   the proposed algorithm uses a registration algorithm to autosegment the
   remaining slices. We conducted comprehensive experiments to measure the
   performance of the proposed algorithm using three registration methods
   (i.e., rigid, affine, and nonrigid techniques).
   Results: The results with the proposed technique were compared with
   manual marking using prostate MR and CT images from 117 patients. Manual
   marking was performed by an expert user for all 117 patients. The median
   accuracies for individual slices measured using the Dice similarity
   coefficient (DSC) were 92\% and 91\% for MR and CT images, respectively.
   The iBRS algorithm was also evaluated regarding user variability, which
   confirmed that the algorithm was robust to interuser variability when
   marking the prostate gland.
   Conclusions: The proposed algorithm exploits the interslice data
   redundancy of the images in a volume dataset of MR and CT images and
   eliminates the need for an atlas, minimizing the computational cost
   while producing highly accurate results which are robust to interuser
   variability. (c) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a simplified method to define local seismic damage
   for reinforced concrete frames considering the horizontal seismic

   experimental and analytical results by other researchers. Further
   validation of the method is achieved by conducting incremental dynamic
   analyses for a concrete frame using five earthquake records. Results
   have also provided an assessment of the use of residual and maximum

Abstract = {{We consider amplify-and-forward multi-antenna relaying between a single
   pair of source and destination under relay per-antenna power
   constraints. We design the optimal relay processing matrix to minimize
   the maximum per-antenna power budget for a received SNR target. With
   given transmit and receive beamformers at the source and destination,
   respectively, we first focus on the equivalent system with
   single-antenna source and destination. Although non-convex, we show that
   the optimization satisfies strong Lagrange duality and can be solved in
   the Lagrangian dual domain. We reveal a prominent structure of this
   problem, by establishing its duality with direct SIMO beamforming system
   with an uncertain noise. This enables us to derive a semi-closed form
   expression for the optimal relay processing matrix that depends on a set
   of dual variables, which can be determined through numerical
   optimization with a significantly reduced problem space. We further show
   that the dual problem has a semi-definite programming form, which
   enables efficient numerical optimization methods to determine the dual
   variables with polynomial complexity. Using this result, the reverse
   problem of SNR maximization under a set of relay per-antenna power
   constraints is then addressed. We then consider the maximum relay
   beamforming achievable rate under different combinations of antenna
   setups at source and destination. In particular, we generalize the
   duality to MIMO relay beamforming vs. direct MIMO beamforming, and
   establish the dual relation of the two systems for different
   multi-antenna setups at source and destination.}},

Abstract = {{In the present paper, an assessment is presented of the indentation
   depth and strain rate dependency of ``geometrically necessary{''}
   dislocations. Pyramidal indentation tests were performed at various
   loading rates from 1 to 1000 mN/s on annealed samples of pure copper,
   70/30 brass, and 5052 aluminum alloy to study the effect of indentation
   strain rate on the indentation depth dependence of the average
   indentation stress. The model of Nix and Gao was applied to calculate
   the density of statistically stored dislocations (SSDs) and
   geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) as a function of indentation
   depth. The GND density displayed the characteristic decrease with
   increasing h. The average indentation stress, sigma(ind) was observed to
   decrease with increasing h and, for any given h increase with increasing
   loading rate. This observed dependence of sigma(ind) upon epsilon(ind)
   was analyzed for the data obtained from small indentation depths, up to
   800 nm, to assess the operative mechanism of time-dependent deformation
   associated with the GNDs. It was observed that for the high and medium
   stacking fault energy (SFE) 5052 aluminum and pure copper, the thermal
   activation energy Delta G(Thermal) of the deformation rate followed
   essentially the same dependence upon sigma(ind) regardless of
   epsilon(ind), however in the 70/30 brass test material, which possess a
   lower value of SFE, the Delta G(Thennal) showed a dependence upon
   sigma(ind) that was highly strain rate dependent. In the case of the
   high SFE material, the apparent activation volume, V{*} of the
   deformation process was found to decrease with increasing PONDS in a way
   indicative of deformation occurring by a process that is listed by
   dislocation/dislocation interactions. Our data indicate that in fcc
   materials of low SFE (i.e. 70/30 brass) the deformation during
   nano/micro-indentation occurs by a more complex mechanism than simple
   time dependent dislocation glide limited by dislocation-obstacle
   interaction. The operative deformation mechanism most likely involves
   micro-twinning and geometrically necessary twins (GNTs). Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Automatic segmentation of the carotid plaques from ultrasound images has
   been shown to be an important task for monitoring progression and
   regression of carotid atherosclerosis. Considering the complex structure
   and heterogeneity of plaques, a fully automatic segmentation method
   based on media-adventitia and lumen-intima boundary priors is proposed.
   This method combines image intensity with structure information in both
   initialization and a level-set evolution process. Algorithm accuracy was
   examined on the common carotid artery part of 26 3-D carotid ultrasound
   images (34 plaques ranging in volume from 2.5 to 456 mm(3)) by comparing
   the results of our algorithm with manual segmentations of two experts.
   Evaluation results indicated that the algorithm yielded total plaque
   volume (TPV) differences of -5.3 +/- 12.7 and -8.5 +/- 13.8 mm(3) and
   absolute TPV differences of 9.9 +/- 9.5 and 11.8 +/- 11.1 mm(3).
   Moreover, high correlation coefficients in generating TPV (0.993 and
   0.992) between algorithm results and both sets of manual results were
   obtained. The automatic method provides a reliable way to segment
   carotid plaque in 3-D ultrasound images and can be used in clinical
   practice to estimate plaque measurements for management of carotid
   atherosclerosis. (E-mail: myding@hust.edu.cn) (C) 2013 World Federation

Abstract = {{Leftover paint is considered as a hazardous material and is associated
   with costly disposal around the world. In this study, a novel green
   roofing membrane system having a primered composite overlay
   incorporating leftover paint was developed and experimentally evaluated.
   Its performance was compared with that of more conventional low-slope
   roofing systems. The experimental program included static puncture,
   dynamic impact, peeling, pull-off and exposure to fire testing. Two
   series of specimens were tested: unaged specimens cured at normal
   conditions and accelerated-aged specimens exposed to cold and arid
   conditions for different time periods. Results indicated that the
   primered composite overlay significantly improved the static puncture
   resistance, dynamic impact performance and fire resistance. The peeling
   and pull-off test results mainly depended on the method of installation
   for the single-ply membranes. The fully adhered system showed best
   performance. The exposure condition did not induce significant changes
   in measured properties by the end of the investigated period. It is
   demonstrated that beneficiating leftover paint in producing roofing
   systems can consume large volumes of this hazardous waste, yielding
   significant economic and environmental benefits and enhanced roofing
   membranes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) assisted control
   system design methodology has been described in detail. The entire
   design and evaluation procedure has been illustrated through a feedback
   control system synthesis for a central processing unit (CPU) chip
   cooling system. The design methodology starts with a full-scale CFD
   simulation of the nonlinear dynamic process to generate the input and
   output databases of the process. Using this data set, linear dynamic
   models around specified operating points are obtained using system
   identification techniques. Based on these models, one can design
   appropriate control systems to meet the required closed-loop control
   system specifications. To illustrate the effectiveness of this
   technique, it has been used to design a controller for a PC chip cooling
   system. In particular, the coupling issues between `real-time' dynamic
   controllers with non real-time CFD simulation have been resolved. A
   physical experimental test bench based on a cooling system of a Pentium
   III CPU has been constructed. The feedback linear control systems
   designed by the proposed CFD approach have been evaluated experimentally

Abstract = {{The rotational flow of viscoplastic fluids between concentric cylinders
   is examined while dissipation due to viscous effects through the energy
   balance. The viscosity of fluid is simultaneously dependent on shear
   rate and temperature. Exponential dependence of viscosity on temperature
   is modeled through Nahme law, and the shear dependency is modeled
   according to the Carreau equation. Hydrodynamically, stick boundary
   conditions are applied, and thermally, both constant temperature and
   constant heat flux on the exterior of cylinders are considered. The
   governing motion and energy balance equations are coupled adding
   complexity to the already highly correlated set of differential
   equations. Introduction of Nahme number has resulted in a nonlinear base
   flow between the cylinders. As well, the condition of constant heat flux
   has moved the point of maximum temperature toward the inner cylinder.
   Taking viscous heating into account, the effects of parameters such as
   Nahme and Brinkman numbers, material time and pseudoplasticity constant
   on the stability of the flow are investigated. Moreover, the study shows
   that the total entropy generation number decreases as the fluid
   elasticity increases. It, however, increases with increasing Nahme and
   Brinkman numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy (AFM) was employed to
   investigate the forces of interaction between aluminum silicates (mica
   and a synthetic aluminum-silicate) and iron particles, both bare and
   coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) polymer. Experiments were
   conducted in water and salt solutions (100 mM NaCl and 100 mM CaCl2) at
   pH 5.5, in water at pH 4 and 8, and in 10 mg/l humic acid solutions. In
   addition, humic acid sorption onto the synthetic aluminum-silicate was
   probed with a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
   (QCM-D). Interactions between bare iron particles and aluminum silicate
   were attractive except at pH 8 and in the presence of humic acids in
   which case forces upon approach were repulsive. Interactions between
   bare iron and mica were similar, except that repulsive forces upon
   approach were measured in 100 mM NaCl solutions, possibly due to
   increased hydration of mica compared to aluminum silicate. Interactions
   between CMC coated iron particles and aluminum-silicates were either
   repulsive or at most weakly attractive, likely due to repulsive
   electro-steric forces associated with the CMC. QCM-D results indicated
   that humic acids adsorbed to aluminum silicate, producing electro-steric
   repulsion to coated and uncoated iron. AFM data were successfully
   modeled using extended DLVO theory and a modified Ohshima's model. This
   modeling provided insights into the contributions of various processes
   to the measured interaction forces, highlighting the importance of van
   der Waals and hydration forces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Novel pore-filled polyelectrolyte membrane (PEM) was produced using
   track etched polycarbonate (PC) as porous substrate and poly(vinyl
   alcohol) (PVA) as pore filling material. PVA in PC pores was stabilized
   through cross-linking of PVA matrix with glutaraldehyde (GA). Cross-link
   time was varied from 24 h to 96 h while keeping the membranes in GA
   solution. Pore sizes of substrate PC membrane tested were 0.01, 0.1 and
   0.2 nm. The membranes were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Ionic conductivity, water
   uptake, contact angle and gel content have been measured to determine
   membranes performance. The ionic crossover (iron ions and protons)
   through membranes was studied in a complete fuel cell. The single-cell
   performance of membrane was tested in a cathodic microbial fuel cell
   (MFC, Biogenerator). The physiochemical properties and membranes fuel
   cell performance were highly depended on the cross-link density of PVA
   matrices. Membranes cross-liked with GA for 72 h showed maximum gel
   content and their peak power density has reached 110 mW cm(-2) at
   current density of 378 mA cm(-2). Among all, membrane cross-linked for
   72 h was studied for continuous long-term stability, which showed
   consistency for application in MFC. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published

Title = {{Thermal convection of non-Fourier fluids. Linear stability}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{14-23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The natural convection of non-Fourier fluids is examined. These fluids
   possess a relaxation time that reflects the delay in the response of the
   heat flux with respect to the temperature gradient. Non-Fourier fluids
   span a wide range of applications, including low-temperature liquids,
   nanofluids, convection in nano-devices, and fluids subjected to fast
   heat transfer processes. The constitutive equation for heat flux is
   frame invariant. For small relaxation time, the neutral stability curve
   comprises a Fourier branch and an oscillatory branch, intersecting at
   some wavenumber. Both stationary and oscillatory convection become
   equally probable as the relaxation time increases, suggesting the
   existence of a bistable mode. With increasing relaxation time,
   oscillatory convection becomes increasingly the mode of preference, at
   the expense of both conduction and stationary convection, with
   increasing roll size. Although the oscillation frequency decreases
   monotonically with roll size, it exhibits a maximum against the
   relaxation time. Finally, the parallels between non-Fourier and
   non-Newtonian effects are emphasized at the formulation and
   phenomenological levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Title = {{A Nonlinear Controller Based on a Discrete Energy Function for an AC/DC
   Boost PFC Converter}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12, SI}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{AC/DC converter systems generally have two stages: an input power factor
   correction (PFC) boost ac/dc stage that converts input ac voltage to an
   intermediate dc voltage while reducing the input current harmonics
   injected to the grid, followed by a dc/dc converter that steps up or
   down the intermediate dc-bus voltage as required by the output load and
   provides high-frequency galvanic isolation. Since a low-frequency ripple
   (second harmonic of the input ac line frequency) exists in the output
   voltage of the PFC ac/dc boost converter due to the power ripple, the
   voltage loop in the conventional control system must have a very low
   bandwidth in order to avoid distortions in the input current waveform.
   This results in the conventional PFC controller having a slow dynamic
   response against load variations with adverse overshoots and
   undershoots. This paper presents a new control approach that is based on
   a novel discrete energy function minimization control law that allows
   the front-end ac/dc boost PFC converter to operate with faster dynamic
   response than the conventional controllers and simultaneously maintain
   near unity input power factor. Experimental results from a 3-kW ac/dc
   converter built for charging traction battery of a pure electric vehicle
   are presented in this paper to validate the proposed control method and
   its superiority over conventional controllers.}},

Title = {{A Computational Model of a Microfluidic Device to Measure the Dynamics
   of Oxygen-Dependent ATP Release from Erythrocytes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Erythrocytes are proposed to be involved in blood flow regulation
   through both shear- and oxygen-dependent mechanisms for the release of
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a potent vasodilator. In a recent study,
   the dynamics of shear-dependent ATP release from erythrocytes was
   measured using a microfluidic device with a constriction in the channel
   to increase shear stress. The brief period of increased shear stress
   resulted in ATP release within 25 to 75 milliseconds downstream of the
   constriction. The long-term goal of our research is to apply a similar
   approach to determine the dynamics of oxygen-dependent ATP release. In
   the place of the constriction, an oxygen permeable membrane would be
   used to decrease the hemoglobin oxygen saturation of erythrocytes
   flowing through the channel This paper describes the first stage in
   achieving that goal, the development of a computational model of the
   proposed experimental system to determine the feasibility of altering
   oxygen saturation rapidly enough to measure ATP release dynamics. The
   computational model was constructed based on hemodynamics, molecular
   transport of oxygen and ATP, kinetics of luciferin/luciferase reaction
   for reporting ATP concentrations, light absorption by hemoglobin, and
   sensor characteristics. A linear model of oxygen saturation-dependent
   ATP release with variable time delay was used in this study. The
   computational results demonstrate that a microfluidic device with a 100
   gm deep channel will cause a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation over
   the oxygen permeable membrane that yields a measurable light intensity
   profile for a change in rate of ATP release from erythrocytes on a
   timescale as short as 25 milliseconds. The simulation also demonstrates
   that the complex dynamics of ATP release from erythrocytes combined with
   the consumption by luciferin/luciferase in a flowing system results in
   light intensity values that do not simply correlate with ATP
   concentrations. A computational model is required for proper
   interpretation of experimental data.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Wing flapping is one of the most widespread propulsion methods found in
   nature; however, the current understanding of the aerodynamics in bird
   wakes is incomplete. The role of the unsteady motion in the flow and its
   contribution to the aerodynamics is still an open question. In the
   current study, the wake of a freely flying European starling has been
   investigated using long-duration high-speed Particle Image Velocimetry
   (PIV) in the near wake. Kinematic analysis of the wings and body of the
   bird has been performed using additional high-speed cameras that
   recorded the bird movement simultaneously with the PIV measurements. The
   wake evolution of four complete wingbeats has been characterized through
   reconstruction of the time-resolved data, and the aerodynamics in the
   wake have been analyzed in terms of the streamwise forces acting on the
   bird. The profile drag from classical aerodynamics was found to be
   positive during most of the wingbeat cycle, yet kinematic images show
   that the bird does not decelerate. It is shown that unsteady
   aerodynamics are necessary to satisfy the drag/thrust balance by
   approximating the unsteady drag term. These findings may shed light on
   the flight efficiency of birds by providing a partial answer to how they
   minimize drag during flapping flight.}},

   (sensitivity/linewidth) of the array is optimized at the same time. The
   peak-sharpening effect of the array caused by coherent interaction plays
   a central role in the optimization. The optimized array has a lattice
   constant in the range {[}1000 nm; 1060 nm], a bulk index sensitivity of
   around 450 nm = RIU and a figure of merit larger than 4. It is an
   enabling sensor element for a near-infrared sensor chip with ultrahigh

Abstract = {{In the present study, batch adsorption experiments involving the
   adsorption of Cd(II) ions from aqueous solutions have been carried out
   using mixed maghemite-magnetite as adsorbent. The uptake capacity of
   Cd(II) ions by mixed maghemite-magnetite increased with an increase in
   the pH of the adsorbate solution. An increase in adsorbent dosage
   increased Cd(II) removal but decreased adsorption capacity and it was
   found to follow the pseudo-second-order model. Cd removal from a
   solution containing 1.5 mg/L initial concentration of Cd(II) decreased
   from 1.9 to 1.3 mg/g upon increasing the temperature from 10 to 50
   degrees C. Cadmium adsorption may be partly diffusion controlled and
   partly due to electrostatic effect along with specific adsorption
   involving the adsorption of Cd++ and CdOH+ on mixed maghemite-magnetite
   nanoparticles in the alkaline pH range. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (XPS) surveys confirmed that Cd2+ ions may undergo oxidation-reduction
   reactions upon exposure to mixed maghemite-magnetite, or may be fixed by
   complexation to oxygen atoms in the oxyhydroxy groups at the surface of
   the iron oxide nanoparticles. After Cd(II) adsorption by the
   maghemite-magnetite mixture, the percent maghemite decreased from 74.8
   to 68.5\%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A 500-kiloton airburst over Chelyabinsk and an enhanced hazard from
   small impactors}},

Volume = {{503}},

Pages = {{238-241}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Most large (over a kilometre in diameter) near-Earth asteroids are now
   known, but recognition that airbursts (or fireballs resulting from
   nuclear-weapon-sized detonations of meteoroids in the atmosphere) have
   the potential to do greater damage(1) than previously thought has
   shifted an increasing portion of the residual impact risk (the risk of
   impact from an unknown object) to smaller objects(2). Above the
   threshold size of impactor at which the atmosphere absorbs sufficient
   energy to prevent a ground impact, most of the damage is thought to be
   caused by the airburst shock wave(3), but owing to lack of observations
   this is uncertain(4,5). Here we report an analysis of the damage from
   the airburst of an asteroid about 19 metres (17 to 20 metres) in
   diameter southeast of Chelyabinsk, Russia, on 15 February 2013,
   estimated to have an energy equivalent of approximately 500 (+/- 100)
   kilotons of trinitrotoluene (TNT, where 1 kiloton of TNT = 4.185x10(12)
   joules). We show that a widely referenced technique(4-6) of estimating
   airburst damage does not reproduce the observations, and that the
   mathematical relations(7) based on the effects of nuclear weapons-almost
   always used with this technique-overestimate blast damage. This suggests
   that earlier damage estimates(5,6) near the threshold impactor size are
   too high. We performed a global survey of airbursts of a kiloton or more
   (including Chelyabinsk), and find that the number of impactors with
   diameters of tens of metres may be an order of magnitude higher than
   estimates based on other techniques(8,9). This suggests a
   non-equilibrium(if the population were in a long-term collisional steady
   state the size-frequency distribution would either follow a single power
   law or there must be a size-dependent bias in other surveys) in the
   near-Earth asteroid population for objects 10 to 50 metres in diameter,
   and shifts more of the residual impact risk to these sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the high-pressure behavior of carbon dioxide (CO2), an
   important planetary material found in Venus, Earth, and Mars, is vital
   to the study of the evolution and dynamics of the planetary interiors as
   well as to the fundamental understanding of the C-O bonding and
   interaction between the molecules. Recent studies have revealed a number
   of crystalline polymorphs (CO2-I to -VII) and an amorphous phase under
   high pressure-temperature conditions. Nevertheless, the reported phase
   stability field and transition pressures at room temperature are poorly
   defined, especially for the amorphous phase. Here we shed light on the
   successive pressure-induced local structural changes and the
   molecular-to-nonmolecular transition of CO2 at room temperature by
   performing an in situ study of the local electronic structure using
   X-ray Raman scattering, aided by first-principle exciton calculations.
   We show that the transition from CO2-I to CO2-III was initiated at
   around 7.4 GPa, and completed at about 17 GPa. The present study also
   shows that at similar to 37 GPa, molecular CO2 starts to polymerize to
   an extended structure with fourfold coordinated carbon and minor CO3 and
   CO-like species. The observed pressure is more than 10 GPa below
   previously reported. The disappearance of the minority species at 63(+/-
   3) GPa suggests that a previously unknown phase transition within the
   nonmolecular phase of CO2 has occurred.}},

Abstract = {{In vertebrates, nerve muscle communication is mediated by the release of
   the neurotransmitter acetylcholine packed inside synaptic vesicles by a
   specific vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Here we used a
   mouse model (VAChT KDHOM) with 70\% reduction in the expression of VAChT
   to investigate the morphological and functional consequences of a
   decreased acetylcholine uptake and release in neuromuscular synapses.
   Upon hypertonic stimulation, VAChT KDHOM mice presented a reduction in
   the amplitude and frequency of miniature endplate potentials, FM 1-43
   staining intensity, total number of synaptic vesicles and altered
   distribution of vesicles within the synaptic terminal. In contrast,
   under electrical stimulation or no stimulation, VAChT KDHOM
   neuromuscular junctions did not differ from WT on total number of
   vesicles but showed altered distribution. Additionally, motor nerve
   terminals in VAChT KDHOM exhibited small and flattened synaptic vesicles
   similar to that observed in WT mice treated with vesamicol that blocks
   acetylcholine uptake. Based on these results, we propose that decreased
   VAChT levels affect synaptic vesicle biogenesis and distribution whereas
   a lower ACh content affects vesicles shape.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Steady and transient two-dimensional thin-jet flow of a viscoelastic is
   examined theoretically. The influence of inertia, elasticity, and
   gravity is emphasized. The fluid is assumed to emerge from a vertical
   channel and to be driven by a pressure gradient and/or gravity. The
   boundary-layer equations are generalized for a viscoelastic thin film
   obeying the Oldroyd-B constitutive model. In contrast to the commonly
   used depth-averaging solution method, the strong nonlinearities are
   preserved in the present formulation as the viscoelastic boundary-layer
   equations are solved by expanding the flow field in terms of orthonormal
   shape functions. It is found that elasticity and gravity have the most
   profound effect on the steady state as well as the transient behavior of
   the viscoelastic film. The initial conditions strongly determine the
   stability of the film, which for all transient cases examined were shown
   to be stable despite the presence of initial instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Corona charge spraying has been widely used in the powder coating
   application, thanks to its outstanding charging performance leading to
   high coating efficiency. Yet, this spraying technology has not been
   working very well with fine powders that started to be used by powder
   industry in recent years. Fine powders are known as the powders that
   have median sizes smaller than 30 mu m. Utilizing fine powders can
   improve coating quality and reduce film thickness. However, it has been
   experienced that the fine powders have much lower first pass transfer
   efficiency (FPTE). This study provided a solution for the problem by
   humidifying the powder coating particles. The gained moisture on the
   particle surfaces can reduce the powder resistivity. As a result, the
   electric field strength inside the deposited particle layer on the
   target is reduced, allowing more charged particles to be deposited.
   Therefore the FPTE of the fine powder is increased. Discovered by the
   experiments, a maximum of 17\% increase in the FPTE was achieved with
   the humidified fine powder. The improved FPTE of the fine powder was
   comparable to the regular powder. The study also evaluated the influence
   of the increased humidity on the fine powder flowability. Based on the
   results obtained from the powder characterization tests, the suggested
   humidification process would not significantly deteriorate the fine
   powder flowability. (C) 2013 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient technique to jointly mitigate the
   severe bit error rate (BER) performance degradation caused by impulsive
   noise (IN) and multipath fading in broadband transmission systems. The
   proposed system is based on a low complexity interleaving process
   applied after the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) in orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, hence it is denoted as
   time-domain interleaving (TDI). The proposed TDI introduces both time
   and frequency diversity, which can be used to effectively combat
   impairments such as IN and frequency-selective fading. In addition to
   its substantial BER reduction capability, the TDI does not degrade the
   spectral efficiency and has low computational complexity. In
   frequency-selective fading channels, the BER of the proposed system is
   mathematically equal to that of Walsh-Hadamard precoded OFDM systems {[}
   1]. In presence of IN, analytical and simulation results show that TDI
   can remarkably reduce the level of the error floors that are commonly
   observed. Specifically, TDI can achieve a BER of 10(-5) for less than 1
   dB difference from the IN-free case.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This study aimed to use video analysis techniques to
   determine the velocity, impact force, angle of impact, and impulse to
   fracture involved in a video-recorded bicycle accident resulting in
   facial fractures. Computed tomographic images of the resulting facial
   injury are presented for correlation with data and calculations. To our
   knowledge, such an analysis of an actual recorded trauma has not been
   reported in the literature.
   Materials and Methods: A video recording of the accident was split into
   frames and analyzed using an image editing program. Measurements of
   velocity and angle of impact were obtained from this analysis, and the
   force of impact and impulse were calculated using the inverse dynamic
   method with connected rigid body segments. These results were then
   correlated with the actual fracture pattern found on computed
   tomographic imaging of the subject's face.
   Results: There was an impact velocity of 6.25 m/s, impact angles of 14
   and 6.3 degrees of neck extension and axial rotation, respectively, an
   impact force of 1910.4 N, and an impulse to fracture of 47.8 Ns. These
   physical parameters resulted in clinically significant bilateral
   mid-facial Le Fort II and III pattern fractures.
   Discussion: These data confer further understanding of the biomechanics
   of bicycle-related accidents by correlating an actual clinical outcome
   with the kinematic and dynamic parameters involved in the accident
   itself and yielding a concrete evidence of the velocity, force, and
   impulse necessary to cause clinically significant facial trauma. These
   findings can aid in the design of protective equipment for bicycle
   riders to help avoid this type of injury.}},

Abstract = {{A full-scale, timber-framed, truss, hip roof was subjected to simulated
   wind loads. Spatially and temporally varying pressures were applied
   using an array of 58 Pressure Loading Actuators, together with air-boxes
   covering all roof surfaces. Load cells were incorporated at the top of
   the wall frame, just below the top plate, to measure the reactions at
   the toe-nailed roof-to-wall connections. Changes in influence functions
   and load sharing between adjacent trusses were observed to occur during
   withdrawal (slip) of the toe-nail connections caused by large magnitude,
   short duration peak pressures. Even for relatively small displacements,
   it was observed that the effective tributary area is substantially
   increased by the incremental withdrawals. This acts to increase the
   resilience of the roof by allowing more limber and/or more highly loaded
   connections to transfer loads to stiffer and/or less highly loaded
   connections. Influence functions, measured both prior to and following
   damage, were able to predict this behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Optimal shapes of laminar, drag reducing longitudinal grooves in a
   pressure driven flow have been determined. It has been shown that such
   shapes can be characterized using reduced geometry models involving only
   a few Fourier modes. Two classes of grooves have been studied, i.e., the
   equal-depth grooves, which have the same height and depth, and the
   unequal-depth grooves. It has been shown that the optimal shape in the
   former case can be approximated by a certain universal trapezoid. There
   exists an optimum depth in the latter case and this depth, combined with
   the corresponding groove shape, defines the optimal geometry; this shape
   is well-approximated by a Gaussian function. Drag reduction due to the
   use of the optimal grooves has been determined. The analysis has been
   extended to kinematically driven flows. It has been shown that in this
   case the longitudinal grooves always increase the flow resistance. (C)

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented to evaluate the time-dependent system
   reliability of pressurized pipelines that contain multiple active
   metal-loss corrosion defects and have been subjected to at least one
   inline inspection (ILI). The methodology incorporates a homogeneous
   gamma process-based corrosion growth model and a Poisson square wave
   process-based internal pressure model, and separates three distinctive
   failure modes, namely small leak, large leak and rupture. The
   hierarchical Bayesian method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   simulation are employed to characterize the parameters in the corrosion
   growth model based on data obtained from high-resolution inline
   inspections (ILIs). An example involving an in-service gas pipeline is
   used to validate the developed corrosion growth model and illustrate the
   proposed methodology for the system reliability analysis. Results of the
   parametric analysis indicate that both the uncertainties in the
   parameters of the growth model as well as their correlations must be
   accounted for in the reliability analysis. The proposed methodology will
   facilitate the application of reliability-based pipeline corrosion

Abstract = {{The world's tallest skyscrapers are taking concrete to ever higher
   altitudes. Indeed, high-strength flowable concrete has become a material
   of choice for the construction of tall buildings. However, technological
   challenges associated with using concrete in super-tall buildings are
   daunting. For instance, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest
   building completed in 2010 standing 828-m tall with 163 floors, had
   plans to take concrete higher abandoned somewhere around an altitude of
   580-m due to pumping challenges. In 2012, the Holy City of Makah's Royal
   Clock Tower became the world's second tallest building, standing 601-m
   tall. This building also experienced the dares of pumping concrete
   beyond 520-m in height. The City of Jeddah's Kingdom Tower is expected
   to exceed one kilometer in height upon completion and will take concrete
   higher than ever before in stringent hot weather conditions. This
   article discusses the experience with flowable and self-consolidating
   concrete in skyscrapers, examines the opportunities and technical
   challenges facing SCC construction in super-tall buildings and
   highlights needed innovations and technological breakthroughs. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The feedback based integrated assessment model ANEMI\_2 represents the
   society-biosphere-climate-economy-energy system of the earth and
   biosphere. The ANEMI\_2 model is based on the system dynamics simulation
   approach that (a) allows for the understanding and modeling of complex
   global change and (b) assists in the investigation of possible policy
   options for mitigating, and/or adapting to changing global conditions
   within an integrated assessment modeling framework. This paper outlines
   the ANEMI\_2 model and its nine system components: climate, carbon
   cycle, land-use, population, food production, hydrologic cycle, water
   demand, water quality, and energy-economy. To evaluate market and
   nonmarket costs and benefits of climate change, the ANEMI\_2 model
   integrates an economic optimization approach, with a focus on the
   international energy stock and fuel price, climate interrelations and
   temperature change. The model takes into account all major greenhouse
   gases (GHG) influencing global temperature and sea-level variation.
   Results from several scenarios (a) compare well with other information
   available in the scientific literature, (b) present comprehensive
   response of the society-biosphere-climate-economy-energy system to the

   reveal that the coding gain advantage of the soft over hard decoding is
   reduced significantly when throughput is adopted as the performance

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a utility computing paradigm that has become a solid
   base for a wide array of enterprise and end-user applications. Providers
   offer varying service portfolios that differ in resource configurations
   and provided services. A comprehensive solution for resource allocation
   is fundamental to any cloud computing service provider. Any resource
   allocation model has to consider computational resources as well as
   network resources to accurately reflect practical demands. Another
   aspect that should be considered while provisioning resources is energy
   consumption. This aspect is getting more attention from industrial and
   government parties. Calls for the support of green clouds are gaining
   momentum. With that in mind, resource allocation algorithms aim to
   accomplish the task of scheduling virtual machines on the servers
   residing in data centers and consequently scheduling network resources
   while complying with the problem constraints. Several external and
   internal factors that affect the performance of resource allocation
   models are introduced in this article. These factors are discussed in
   detail, and research gaps are pointed out. Design challenges are
   discussed with the aim of providing a reference to be used when
   designing a comprehensive energy-aware resource allocation model for

Title = {{A 3D ultrasound scanning system for image guided liver interventions}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) imaging is commonly used for
   diagnostic and intraoperative guidance of interventional liver
   procedures; however, 2D US lacks volumetric information that may benefit
   interventional procedures. Over the past decade, three-dimensional
   ultrasound (3D US) has been developed to provide the missing spatial
   information. 3D US image acquisition is mainly based on mechanical,
   electromagnetic, and freehand tracking of conventional 2D US
   transducers, or 2D array transducers available on high-end machines.
   These approaches share many problems during clinical use for
   interventional liver imaging due to lack of flexibility and
   compatibility with interventional equipment, limited field-of-view
   (FOV), and significant capital cost compared to the benefits they
   introduce. In this paper, a novel system for mechanical 3D US scanning
   is introduced to address these issues.
   Methods: The authors have developed a handheld mechanical 3D US system
   that incorporates mechanical translation and tilt sector sweeping of any
   standard 2D US transducer to acquire 3D images. Each mechanical scanning
   function can be operated independently or may be combined to allow for a
   hybrid wide FOV acquisition. The hybrid motion mode facilitates
   registration of other modalities (e.g., CT or MRI) to the intraoperative
   3D US images by providing a larger FOV in which to acquire anatomical
   information. The tilting mechanism of the developed mover allows image
   acquisition in the intercostal rib space to avoid acoustic shadowing
   from bone. The geometric and volumetric scanning validity of the 3D US
   system was evaluated on tissue mimicking US phantoms for different modes
   of operation. Identical experiments were performed on a commercially
   available 3D US system for direct comparison. To replicate a clinical
   scenario, the authors evaluated their 3D US system by comparing it to CT
   for measurement of angle and distance between interventional needles in
   different configurations, similar to those used for percutaneous
   ablation of liver tumors.
   Results: The mean geometrical hybrid 3D reconstruction error measured
   from scanning of a known string phantom was less than 1 nun in two
   directions and 2.5 mm in the scanning direction, which was comparable or
   better than the same measurements obtained from a commercially available
   3D US system. The error in volume measurements of spherical phantom
   models depended on depth of the object. For a 20 cm(3) model at a depth
   of 15 cm, a standard depth for liver imaging, the mean error was 3.6\%
   +/- 4.5\% comparable to the 2.3\% +/- 1.8\% error for the 3D US
   commercial system. The error in 3D US measurement of the tip distance
   and angle between two microwave ablation antennas inserted into the
   phantom was 0.9 +/- 0.5 mm and 1.1 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: A 3D US system with hybrid scanning motions for large
   field-of-view 3D abdominal imaging has been developed and validated. The
   superior spatial information provided by 3D US might enhance
   image-guidance for percutaneous interventional treatment of liver
   malignancies. The system has potential to be integrated with other liver
   procedures and has application in other abdominal}},

Abstract = {{A processing map is developed on the basis of the Dynamic Material Model
   for Mg-9Al-1Zn. The model considers the work piece as a dissipator of
   power and power loss variation with temperature and strain rate
   constitutes the power dissipation map. To this end, the thermomechanical
   (i.e., hot compression) characteristics of a Mg-9Al-1Zn alloy was
   studied in the temperature range of 250-425 A degrees C and strain rates
   of 0.001-1 s(-1). The strain rate sensitivity (m), power dissipation
   efficiency (eta), and instability parameter (xi) are computed based on
   the experimental hot compression data. The deformation mechanisms of
   different regions in the maps are analyzed and corresponding
   microstructures are investigated. The processing map of Mg-9Al-1Zn alloy
   exhibits five workability domains. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) was
   observed in three of the domains, while in the two other domains grain
   boundary sliding, twining, and precipitation are the dominant
   mechanisms. The optimum hot working conditions of Mg-9Al-1Zn alloy are
   located in the two domains where DRX takes place. They correspond to 375

Abstract = {{Understanding changes in microbial structure due to biodiesel storage is
   important both for protecting integrity of storage systems and fuel
   quality management. In this work a simulated storage system was used to
   study the effect of biodiesel (0\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\% and 100\%) on a
   microbial population, which was followed by community level
   physiological profiling (CLPP), 16s rDNA analysis and plating in
   selective media. Results proved that structure and functionality were
   affected by biodiesel. CLPP showed at least three populations: one
   corresponding to diesel, one to biodiesel and one to blends of diesel
   and biodiesel. Analysis of 16s rDNA revealed that microbial composition
   was different for populations growing in diesel and biodiesel. Genera
   identified are known for degradation of hydrocarbons and emulsifier
   production. Maximum growth was obtained in biodiesel; however, microbial
   counts in standard media were lower for this samples. Acidification of
   culture media was observed at high biodiesel concentration. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We propose a navigation system for transcatheter aortic valve
   implantation that employs a magnetic tracking system (MTS) along with a
   dynamic aortic model and intra-operative ultrasound (US) images. This
   work is motivated by the desire of our cardiology and cardiac surgical
   colleagues to minimize or eliminate the use of radiation in the
   interventional suite or operating room. The dynamic 3-D aortic model is
   constructed from a preoperative 4-D computed tomography dataset that is
   animated in synchrony with the real time electrocardiograph input of
   patient, and then preoperative planning is performed to determine the
   target position of the aortic valve prosthesis. The contours of the
   aortic root are extracted automatically from short axis US images in
   real-time for registering the 2-D intra-operative US image to the
   preoperative dynamic aortic model. The augmented MTS guides the
   interventionist during positioning and deployment of the aortic valve
   prosthesis to the target. The results of the aortic root segmentation
   algorithm demonstrate an error of 0.92+/-0.85 mm with a computational
   time of 36.13+/-6.26 ms. The navigation approach was validated in
   porcine studies, yielding fiducial localization errors, target
   registration errors, deployment distance, and tilting errors of
   3.02+/-0.39 mm, 3.31+/-1.55 mm, 3.23+/-0.94 mm, and 5.85+/-3.06 degrees,

Abstract = {{We present results of an experimental study of buoyant miscible
   displacement flows of a yield-stress fluid (Carbopol) by a higher
   density Newtonian fluid along a long inclined pipe. We focus on the
   industrially interesting case where the yield stress is significantly
   larger than a typical viscous stress in the displacing fluid, but where
   buoyancy forces may be significant. We find that the slump and
   centre-type displacements identified in our earlier work on
   near-horizontal flows are in fact observed over the full range of pipe
   inclinations. Interestingly, the occurrence of these regimes is
   primarily governed by approximately the same ratio of Reynolds number to
   densimetric Froude number, Re/Fr, as in near-horizontal case. However,
   we do observe a range of exotic behaviour for slump flows at higher
   inclinations associated with the progressive break-up of the Carbopol
   layer. We give a detailed description of these secondary regimes and
   their formation. We also observe a third regime which we refer to as
   turbulent-mixed flow. In this case, despite the existence of the yield
   stress, the flow is very similar to that for a Newtonian displacement
   when the mixing is very efficient. In the absence of an imposed flow of
   the displacing fluid, we observe that flows may nonetheless develop
   under the action of buoyancy despite the yield stress. We discuss the
   probable mechanisms and potential implications for the plug cementing
   process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The existing rigid body attitude controllers (without angular velocity
   measurements) involve explicitly the attitude in the feedback.
   Unfortunately, there does not exist any sensor that directly measures
   the orientation of a rigid body (without any estimation procedure).
   Therefore the attitude must be generated from the available sensors via
   some attitude determination (estimation) algorithms. The most recent and
   efficient attitude estimation algorithms rely on the body vector
   measurements and the angular velocity (which is assumed to be
   unavailable in velocity-free attitude controllers). To overcome this
   circular reasoning-like problem, we propose a velocity-free attitude
   stabilization control scheme relying solely on body vector measurements.
   Moreover, the proposed control law is a priori bounded and does not lead
   to the so-called unwinding phenomenon(1) encountered in some
   unit-quaternion based attitude control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate needle biopsy
   requires registering preoperative 3D TRUS or MR image, in which tumors
   and other suspicious areas are visible, to intraoperative 2D TRUS
   images. Such image registration is time-consuming while its real-time
   implementation is yet to be developed. To bypass this registration step,
   robotic needle biopsy systems can be used to place the US probe at the
   same position relative to the prostate during the 3D and 2D image
   acquisition to ensure similar prostate deformation. To have such similar
   deformation, only visual feedback is not sufficient as such feedback can
   be used to only guarantee that the whole prostate is within the field of
   view irrespective of the probe's orientation. As such, contact pressure
   feedback can be utilized to ensure consistent minimum contact between
   the probe and prostate.
   A robotic system is proposed where a TRUS probe with pressure sensor
   array is used. The contact pressure can be measured during imaging and
   used to provide feedback in conjunction with an optimization algorithm
   for consistent probe positioning. The robotic system is driven by the
   feedback to position the probe such that pressure pattern of the sensors
   during 2D image acquisition is similar to the pressure pattern during 3D
   image acquisition. The proposed method takes into account the patient's
   body movement expected during image acquisition. In this study, an in
   silico phantom is used where the simulated contact pressure distribution
   required in the optimization algorithm is obtained using a prostate
   finite element model.
   Starting from an arbitrary position where the probe contacts the
   phantom, this position was varied systematically until a position
   corresponding to maximum pressure pattern similarity between contact
   pressure patterns corresponding to the 2D and 3D imaging was achieved
   successfully.
   Results obtained from the in silico phantom study indicate that the
   proposed technique is capable of ensuring having only minimal relative
   prostate deformation between preoperative image acquisition and
   intraoperative imaging used for guiding needle biopsy, paving the way
   for faster and more accurate registration.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetics of isothermal crystallization of hydrogenated castor oil in
   water emulsions exhibiting multiple crystal morphologies have been
   studied experimentally by DSC and polarized light microscopy. The

   growth has been observed by microscopy showing that both crystal
   morphologies, fibers and rosettes, grow linearly at the initial stage of
   crystallization and then slow down to reach a plateau value. The Avrami
   model, which has been widely used in kinetics studies of triacylglycerol
   systems, was employed to fit experimental results at different
   isothermal temperatures. It was found that experimental trends could be
   captured by introducing the volume fraction of each type of morphology
   into three-dimensional and one-dimensional full Avrami models.}},

Title = {{Concrete Girders with Exposed Flexural Reinforcement}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{427-435}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Deteriorated reinforced concrete highway bridge girders are regularly
   repaired by replacing existing concrete with new concrete, temporarily
   exposing the flexural reinforcement. The absence of bond between the
   concrete and the steel reinforcement makes it difficult to compute the
   flexural capacity of the girder and current code criteria provide no
   guidance to assist practitioners. In Canada, it is common for the
   reinforcement to be exposed for periods of days or even weeks while
   unrestricted traffic continues in the lane supported by the girder being
   repaired. Two analytical approaches are developed to predict the longest
   length of exposed flexural reinforcement that ensures a girder will
   still exhibit a ductile failure with no reduction in yield capacity. A
   news experimental investigation is reported comprising five 4 m concrete
   T-section specimens with reinforcement ratios of 0,37\%, and exposed
   flexural reinforcement, loaded with a simulated uniformly distributed
   load and a concurrent single-point load to realistically simulate the
   loading applied to a typical bridge girder. All specimens yielded,
   exhibited ductile behavior with no strain hardening, and failed by the
   crushing of the concrete compression region at applied moments of 75 to
   81\% of the predicted moment of the original specimen without exposed
   reinforcement. The results validated a strain-compatibility-based
   analysis with an average test-to-predicted ratio of 1,00 and a standard
   deviation of 0,068. A strut-and-tie-based analysis could only be
   indirectly validated. These approaches will assist practicing engineers
   in designing rehabilitations.}},

Title = {{Pulmonary Functional Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Noble Gas MRI: Six
   Years of Start-up Experience at a Single Site}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1344-1356}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: In this review, we summarize our experience
   evaluating pulmonary function in 330 different subjects using
   hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after
   enrollment and screening of >1100 subjects with and without respiratory
   disease during the period February 1, 2006, through November 1, 2012.
   Materials and Methods: We discuss the feasibility of hyperpolarized gas
   MRI research in a small nonhospital research unit and provide an
   overview of our experience since we initiated patient-based studies. We
   also discuss the importance of infrastructure support, collaboration,
   research trainees, and a large and willing patient population that
   helped to advance the research and technological deliverables. A summary
   of patient safety and tolerability, key feasibility, and research
   milestones is provided, as well as a roadmap for future studies.
   Results: Hyperpolarized He-3 and Xe-129 gas MRI is feasible at smaller
   centers without significant human resources for large and small
   longitudinal studies by virtue of its excellent patient safety and
   tolerability, the speed with which images can be acquired and
   quantitatively analyzed and the high spatial-temporal dynamics of the
   method that allows for acute and chronic therapy studies.
   Conclusions: The hyperpolarized noble gas MRI community's highly
   collaborative efforts and motivation to further the development and
   application of this tool has resulted in a moment-of-opportunity to
   translate the method clinically to provide an improved understanding of
   pulmonary disease. There are, as well, new and unprecedented
   opportunities for the evaluation of disease progression and to help
   develop the new treatments and interventions critically required for
   chronic pulmonary disease.}},

Abstract = {{The use of three-dimensional (3D) models for education, pre-operative
   assessment, presurgical planning, and measurement have become more
   prevalent. With the increase in prevalence of 3D models there has also
   been an increase in 3D reconstructive software programs that are used to
   create these models. These software programs differ in reconstruction
   concepts, operating system requirements, user features, cost, and no one
   program has emerged as the standard. The purpose of this study was to
   conduct a systematic comparison of three widely available 3D
   reconstructive software programs, Amira((R)), OsiriX, and Mimics((R)),
   with respect to the software's ability to be used in two broad themes:
   morphometric research and education to translate morphological
   knowledge. Cost, system requirements, and inherent features of each
   program were compared. A novel concept selection tool, a decision
   matrix, was used to objectify comparisons of usability of the interface,
   quality of the output, and efficiency of the tools. Findings indicate
   that Mimics was the best-suited program for construction of 3D
   anatomical models and morphometric analysis, but for creating a learning
   tool the results were less clear. OsiriX was very user-friendly;
   however, it had limited capabilities. Conversely, although Amira had
   endless potential and could create complex dynamic videos, it had a
   challenging interface. These results provide a resource for morphometric
   researchers and educators to assist the selection of appropriate
   reconstruction programs when starting a new 3D modeling project. Anat

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We developed a semi-automated tool to quantify emphysema from
   thoracic X-ray multi-detector (64-slice) computed tomography (CT) for
   training purposes and multi-reader studies.
   Materials and Methods: Thoracic X-ray CT was acquired in 93 ex-smokers,
   who were evaluated by six trainees with little or no expertise
   (trainees) and a single experienced thoracic radiologist (expert). A
   graphic user interface (GUI) was developed for emphysema quantification
   based on the percentile of lung where a score of 0 = no abnormalities, 1
   = 1-25\%, 2 = 26-50\%, 3 = 51-75\% and 4 = 76-100\% for each lung
   side/slice. Trainees blinded to subject characteristics scored
   randomized images twice; accuracy was determined by comparison to expert
   scores, density histogram 15th percentile (HU15), relative area at -950
   HU (RA(950)), low attenuation clusters at -950 HU (LAC(950)), -856 HU
   (LAC(856)) and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO\%pred).
   Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was evaluated using
   coefficients-of-variation (Coy), intra-class (ICC) and Pearson
   correlations.
   Results: Trainee-expert correlations were significant (r = 0.85-0.97, p
   < 0.0001) and a significant trainee bias (0.15 +/- 0.22) was observed.
   Emphysema score was correlated with RA(950) (r = 0.88, p < 0.0001),HU15
   (r = -0.77, p < 0.0001), LAC(950) (r = 0.76, p < 0.0001), LAC(856) (r =
   0.74, p = 0.0001) and DLCO\%pred (r = -0.71, p < 0.0001). Intra-observer
   reproducibility (COV = 4-27\%; ICC = 0.75-0.94) was moderate to high for
   trainees; intra- and inter-observer COV were negatively and non-linearly
   correlated with emphysema score.
   Conclusion: We developed a GUI for rapid and interactive emphysema
   scoring that allows for comparison of multiple readers with clinical and
   radiological standards. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A nonlinear spectral approach is proposed to simulate the post critical
   convective state for thermogravitational instability in a Newtonian
   fluid layer heated from below. The spectral methodology consists of
   expanding the flow and temperature fields periodically along the layer,
   and using orthonormal shape functions in the transverse direction. The
   Galerkin projection is then implemented to generate the equations for
   the expansion coefficients. Since most of the interesting bifurcation
   picture is close to criticality, a perturbation approach is developed to
   solve the nonlinear spectral system in the weakly post critical range.
   To leading order, the Lorenz model is recovered. The problem is also
   solved using amplitude equations for comparison. The similarity and
   difference among the three models are emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Algae have recently received growing attention given its prospects as a
   source of renewable energy and its potential for CO2 capture. Algae
   culture is of increasing value given that: (i) algae can be cultivated
   on non-agricultural land using wastewater, (ii) algae can provide a high
   yield on a per unit of light irradiated area, (iii) algae growth
   requires CO2 and nutrients that can be obtained from wastewater and
   fossil fuel combustion and (iv) algae contains high oil and starch
   making possible the production of high quality biodiesel. Thus, algae
   culture can contribute to CO2 fixation, wastewater treatment and can be
   a source of bioenergy. This article presents a critical review, focusing
   on various microalgae species that consume CO2 and nutrients from
   wastewater, and provide high quality biofuel. In this respect, a number
   of relevant topics are discussed in this review: (a) the media for algae
   culture, (b) the photobioreactor, (c) the associated wastewater
   treatment processes, (d) the CO2 capture mechanism and (e) microalgal
   harvesting. This review also considers various aspects of the biomass
   processing such as (a) lipid extraction, (b) thermodynamics of the
   produced biomass conversion, (c) biomass gasification, (d) biodiesel
   production, (e) catalysts, (f) reaction pathways/mechanisms and (g)
   reaction kinetics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The brain is able to determine angular self-motion from visual,
   vestibular, and kinesthetic information. There is compelling evidence
   that both humans and non-human primates integrate visual and inertial
   (i.e., vestibular and kinesthetic) information in a statistically
   optimal fashion when discriminating heading direction. In the present
   study, we investigated whether the brain also integrates information
   about angular self-motion in a similar manner. Eight participants
   performed a 2IFC task in which they discriminated yaw-rotations (2-s
   sinusoidal acceleration) on peak velocity. Just-noticeable differences
   (JNDs) were determined as a measure of precision in unimodal
   inertial-only and visual-only trials, as well as in bimodal
   visual-inertial trials. The visual stimulus was a moving stripe pattern,
   synchronized with the inertial motion. Peak velocity of comparison
   stimuli was varied relative to the standard stimulus. Individual
   analyses showed that data of three participants showed an increase in
   bimodal precision, consistent with the optimal integration model; while
   data from the other participants did not conform to maximum-likelihood
   integration schemes. We suggest that either the sensory cues were not
   perceived as congruent, that integration might be achieved with fixed
   weights, or that estimates of visual precision obtained from non-moving
   observers do not accurately reflect visual precision during self-motion.}},

Title = {{Microscale Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulation for Wind Mapping Over
   Complex Topographic Terrains}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Wind mapping is of utmost importance in various wind energy and wind
   engineering applications. The available wind atlases usually provide
   wind data with low spatial resolution relative to the wind turbine
   height and usually neglect the effect of topographic features with
   relatively large or sudden changes in elevation. Two benchmark cases are
   studied for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model evaluation on
   smooth two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hills.
   Thereafter, a procedure is introduced to build CFD model of a complex
   terrain with high terrain roughness heights (dense urban area with
   skyscrapers) starting from existing topography maps in order to properly
   extend the wind atlas data over complex terrains. CFD simulations are
   carried out on a 1:3000 scale model of complex topographic area using
   Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations along with shear stress
   transport (SST) k-omega turbulence model and the results are compared
   with the wind tunnel measurements on the same model. The study shows
   that CFD simulations can be successfully used in qualifying and
   quantifying the flow over complex topography consisting of a wide range
   of roughness heights, enabling to map the flow structure with very high
   spatial resolution.}},

   wind loads and wind effects on main wind force resisting systems and
   components and/or cladding; aerodynamic pressure coefficients; pressures
   on rooftop equipment; component and cladding pressures on arched roofs;
   and the wind tunnel procedure. It is noted that the ASCE 49 standard

Abstract = {{Process dynamic modelling for service business is the key technique for
   Service-Oriented information systems and service business management,
   and the workflow model of business processes is the core part of service
   systems. Service business workflow simulation is the prevalent approach
   to be used for analysis of service business process dynamically. Generic
   method for service business workflow simulation is based on the discrete
   event queuing theory, which is lack of flexibility and scalability. In
   this paper, we propose a service workflow-oriented framework for the
   process simulation of service businesses using multi-agent cooperation
   to address the above issues. Social rationality of agent is introduced
   into the proposed framework. Adopting rationality as one social factor
   for decision-making strategies, a flexible scheduling for activity
   instances has been implemented. A system prototype has been developed to
   validate the proposed simulation framework through a business case
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon materials have been widely used as cathodes in lithium oxygen
   batteries but the detailed influence of the structure of these materials
   on their performance is not very clear yet. In this study, the same
   starting pristine commercial carbon black (N330) was treated under
   different atmospheres and the resultant carbons were employed as cathode
   materials for lithium oxygen batteries. It was demonstrated that the
   porosity and surface topology of these carbons tremendously changed as
   their treating time increased. The parameters that influenced the
   battery performance were identified. It was found that the main factor
   determining the battery performance is the specific surface area of the
   carbon mesopores, while nitrogen- or oxygen-bearing functionalities,
   introduced in these carbons during their heat-treatment or by contact
   with air after their pyrolysis, had little or no influence on the
   battery performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and Mg2+ modified pumice were used for the removal of
   phosphorous. The adsorbents were characterized using XRF, XRD, SEM and
   FTIR instrumental techniques. In the optimal conditions, namely at
   equilibrium time (30 min), for a phosphorus concentration of 15 mg/L and
   pH 6, 69 and 97\% phosphorus removals were achieved using 10 g/L of
   natural and modified pumice adsorbents, respectively. Maximum adsorption
   capacities were 11.88 and 17.71 mg/g by natural and modified pumice,
   respectively. Pseudo-second order kinetic model was the most relevant to
   describe the kinetic of phosphorus adsorption. External mass transfer
   coefficient decreased for increasing phosphorous concentration and film
   diffusion was found to be the rate-controlling step. Only a very low
   dissolution of the adsorbent was observed, leading to a low increase in
   conductivity and turbidity. Removal efficiency decreased for increasing
   ionic strength. It also decreased in the presence of competing ions;
   however modified pumice remained effective, since 67\% of phosphorus was
   removed, versus only 17\% for the natural pumice. The efficiency of the
   modified pumice was confirmed during the regeneration tests, since 96\%
   regeneration yield was obtained after 510 min experiment, while only
   22\% was observed for the raw pumice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{Single-phase power factor correction (PFC) ac-dc converters are widely
   used in the industry for ac-dc power conversion from single phase
   ac-mains to an isolated output dc voltage. Typically, for high-power
   applications, such converters use an ac-dc boost input converter
   followed by a dc-dc full-bridge converter. A new ac-dc single-stage
   high-power universal PFC ac input full-bridge, pulse-width modulated
   converter is proposed in this paper. The converter can operate with an
   excellent input power factor, continuous input and output currents, and
   a non-excessive intermediate dc bus voltage and has reduced number of
   semiconductor devices thus presenting a cost-effective novel solution
   for such applications. In this paper, the operation of the proposed
   converter is explained, a steady-state analysis of its operation is
   performed, and the results of the analysis are used to develop a
   procedure for its design. The operation of the proposed converter is
   confirmed with results obtained from an experimental prototype.}},

Title = {{Multimodal neuroimaging of frontal white matter microstructure in early
   phase schizophrenia: the impact of early adolescent cannabis use}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: A disturbance in connectivity between different brain
   regions, rather than abnormalities within the separate regions
   themselves, could be responsible for the clinical symptoms and cognitive
   dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia. White matter, which comprises
   axons and their myelin sheaths, provides the physical foundation for
   functional connectivity in the brain. Myelin sheaths are located around
   the axons and provide insulation through the lipid membranes of
   oligodendrocytes. Empirical data suggests oligodendroglial dysfunction
   in schizophrenia, based on findings of abnormal myelin maintenance and
   repair in regions of deep white matter. The aim of this in vivo
   neuroimaging project is to assess the impact of early adolescent onset
   of regular cannabis use on brain white matter tissue integrity, and to
   differentiate this impact from the white matter abnormalities associated
   with schizophrenia. The ultimate goal is to determine the liability of
   early adolescent use of cannabis on brain white matter, in a vulnerable
   brain.
   Methods/Design: Young adults with schizophrenia at the early stage of
   the illness (less than 5 years since diagnosis) will be the focus of
   this project. Four magnetic resonance imaging measurements will be used
   to assess different cellular aspects of white matter: a) diffusion
   tensor imaging, b) localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy with
   a focus on the neurochemical N-acetylaspartate, c) the transverse
   relaxation time constants of regional tissue water, d) and of
   N-acetylaspartate. These four neuroimaging indices will be assessed
   within the same brain region of interest, that is, a large white matter
   fibre bundle located in the frontal region, the left superior
   longitudinal fasciculus.
   Discussion: We will expand our knowledge regarding current theoretical
   models of schizophrenia with a more comprehensive multimodal
   neuroimaging approach to studying the underlying cellular abnormalities
   of white matter, while taking into consideration the important
   confounding variable of early adolescent onset of regular cannabis use.}},

Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{259-266}},

Abstract = {{Novel methods are needed for the development of nanodispersed drug
   formulations to enhance bioavailability of many hydrophobic
   pharmaceuticals. The poorly water-soluble quinine is a well-known
   anti-malaria drug which can be used as a promising model compound for
   the development of novel nanodispersed formulations. In addition to
   hydrophobic drug's own affecting properties, surfactants play an
   important role for the enhancement of their low bioavailability by
   preparing stable dispersions. Amphiphilic compounds can efficiently be
   used to stabilize colloidal fragments by preventing the precipitation or
   crystallization of poorly water-soluble active ingredients during
   fabrication. A novel biopolymer derivative based on the
   biotechnologically produced gamma-polyglutamic acid (gamma-PGA) from
   Bacillus licheniformis cultivation was developed for encapsulation of
   the active ingredient. High-molecular gamma-PGA is an anionic
   polyelectrolyte that was optimized and modified with hydrophobic
   L-phenylalanine ethyl ester (L-PAE) to form an amphiphilic comb polymer
   P(gamma-GA-r-L-PAE) with surfactive properties. The approach of the
   nanodispersion polymer concentration, molecular weight and grafting
   degree enables the efficient stabilization of the poorly water-soluble
   model drug. The research presented in this report indicates the
   potential benefits of hydrophobically modified gamma-PGA and suggests
   its potential role in forming stable dispersions for future
   pharmaceutical applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The brain must dynamically integrate, coordinate, and respond to
   internal and external stimuli across multiple time scales. Non-invasive
   measurements of brain activity with fMRI have greatly advanced our
   understanding of the large-scale functional organization supporting
   these fundamental features of brain function. Conclusions from previous
   resting-state fMRI investigations were based upon static descriptions of
   functional connectivity (FC), and only recently studies have begun to
   capitalize on the wealth of information contained within the temporal
   features of spontaneous BOLD FC. Emerging evidence suggests that dynamic
   FC metrics may index changes in macroscopic neural activity patterns
   underlying critical aspects of cognition and behavior, though
   limitations with regard to analysis and interpretation remain. Here, we
   review recent findings, methodological considerations, neural and
   behavioral correlates, and future directions in the emerging field of
   dynamic FC investigations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Genetic diversities of cytochrome B in Xinjiang Uyghur unveiled its
   origin and migration history}},
Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Uyghurs are one of the many populations of Central Eurasia
   that is considered to be genetically related to Eastern and Western
   Eurasian populations. However, there are some different opinions on the
   relative importance of the degree of Eastern and Western Eurasian
   genetic influence. In addition, the genetic diversity of the Uyghur in
   different geographic locations has not been clearly studied.
   Results: In this study, we are the first to report on the DNA
   polymorphism of cytochrome B in the Uyghur population located in
   Xinjiang in northwest China. We observed a total of 102 mutant sites in
   the 240 samples that were studied. The average number of mutated
   nucleotides in the samples was 5.126. A total of 93 different haplotypes
   were observed. The gene diversity and discrimination power were 0.9480
   and 0.9440, respectively. There were founder and bottleneck haplotypes
   observed in Xinjiang Uyghurs. Xinjiang Uyghurs are more genetically
   related to Chinese population in genetics than to Caucasians. Moreover,
   there was genetic diversity between Uyghurs from the southern and
   northern regions. There was significance in genetic distance between the
   southern Xinjiang Uyghurs and Chinese population, but not between the
   northern Xinjiang Uyghurs and Chinese. The European vs. East Asian
   contribution to the ten regional Uyghur groups varies among the groups
   and the European contribution to the Uyghur increases from north to
   south geographically.
   Conclusion: This study is the first report on DNA polymorphisms of
   cytochrome B in the Uyghur population. The study also further confirms
   that there are significant genetic differences among the Uyghurs in
   different geographical locations.}},

Title = {{Forcing lateral electron disequilibrium to spare lung tissue: a novel
   technique for stereotactic body radiation therapy of lung cancer}},

Abstract = {{Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has quickly become a
   preferred treatment option for early-stage lung cancer patients who are
   ineligible for surgery. This technique uses tightly conformed
   megavoltage (MV) x-ray beams to irradiate a tumour with ablative doses
   in only a few treatment fractions. Small high energy x-ray fields can
   cause lateral electron disequilibrium (LED) to occur within low density
   media, which can reduce tumour dose. These dose effects may be
   challenging to predict using analytic dose calculation algorithms,
   especially at higher beam energies. As a result, previous authors have
   suggested using low energy photons (<10 MV) and larger fields (>5 x 5
   cm(2)) for lung cancer patients to avoid the negative dosimetric effects
   of LED. In this work, we propose a new form of SBRT, described as
   LED-optimized SBRT (LED-SBRT), which utilizes radiotherapy (RT)
   parameters designed to cause LED to advantage. It will be shown that
   LED-SBRT creates enhanced dose gradients at the tumour/lung interface,
   which can be used to manipulate tumour dose, and/or normal lung dose. To
   demonstrate the potential benefits of LED-SBRT, the DOSXYZnrc (National
   Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, ON) Monte Carlo (MC) software was
   used to calculate dose within a cylindrical phantom and a typical lung
   patient. 6 MV or 18 MV x-ray fields were focused onto a small tumour
   volume (diameter similar to 1 cm). For the phantom, square fields of 1 x
   1 cm(2), 3 x 3 cm(2), or 5 x 5 cm(2) were applied. However, in the
   patient, 3 x 1 cm(2), 3 x 2 cm(2), 3 x 2.5 cm(2), or 3 x 3 cm(2) field
   sizes were used in simulations to assure target coverage in the
   superior-inferior direction. To mimic a 180 degrees SBRT arc in the
   (symmetric) phantom, a single beam profile was calculated, rotated, and
   beams were summed at 1 degrees segments to accumulate an arc dose
   distribution. For the patient, a 360 degrees arc was modelled with 36
   equally weighted (and spaced) fields focused on the tumour centre. A
   planning target volume (PTV) was generated by considering the extent of
   tumour motion over the patient's breathing cycle and set-up
   uncertainties. All patient dose results were normalized such that at
   least 95\% of the PTV received at least 54 Gy (i.e. D95 = 54 Gy).
   Further, we introduce `LED maps' as a novel clinical tool to compare the
   magnitude of LED resulting from the various SBRT arc plans. Results from
   the phantom simulation suggest that the best lung sparing occurred for
   RT parameters that cause severe LED. For equal tumour dose coverage,
   normal lung dose (2 cm outside the target region) was reduced from 92\%
   to 23\%, comparing results between the 18 MV (5 x 5 cm(2)) and 18 MV (1
   x 1 cm(2)) arc simulations. In addition to reduced lung dose for the 18
   MV (1 x 1 cm(2)) arc, maximal tumour dose increased beyond 125\%. Thus,
   LED can create steep dose gradients to spare normal lung, while
   increasing tumour dose levels (if desired). In the patient simulation, a
   LED-optimized arc plan was designed using either 18 MV (3 x 1 cm(2)) or
   6 MV (3 x 3cm(2)) beams. Both plans met the D95 dose coverage
   requirement for the target. However, the LED-optimized plan increased
   the maximum, mean, and minimum dose within the PTV by as much as 80 Gy,
   11 Gy, and 3 Gy, respectively. Despite increased tumour dose levels, the
   18 MV (3 x 1 cm(2)) arc plan improved or maintained the V20, V5, and
   mean lung dose metrics compared to the 6 MV (3 x 3 cm(2)) simulation.
   We conclude that LED-SBRT has the potential to increase dose gradients,
   and dose levels within a small lung tumour. The magnitude of tumour dose
   increase or lung sparing can be optimized through manipulation of RT
   parameters (e.g. beam energy and field size).}},

Abstract = {{3D all-solid-state microbatteries are promising onboard power systems
   for autonomous devices. The fabrication of 3D rnicrobatteries needs
   deposition of active materials, especially solid-state electrolytes, as
   conformal and pinhole free thin films in 3D architectures, which has
   proven very difficult for conventional deposition techniques, such as
   chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition. Herein, we
   report an alternative technique, atomic layer deposition (ALD), for
   achieving ideal solid-state electrolyte thin films for 3D
   microbatteries. Lithium tantalate solid-state electrolytes, with
   well-controlled film composition and film thickness, were grown by ALD
   at 225 degrees C using subcycle combination of 1 x Li2O + n X Ta2O5 (1
   <= n <= 10). The film composition was tunable by varying Ta2O5 subcycles
   (n), whereas the film thickness displayed a linear relationship with ALD
   cycle number, due to the self-limiting nature of the ALD process.
   Furthermore, the lithium tantalate thin films showed excellent
   uniformity and conformity in 3D anodic aluminum oxide template.
   Moreover, impedance testing showed that the lithium tantalate thin film
   exhibited a lithium ion conductivity of 2 X 10(-8) S/cm at 299 K. The
   lithium tantalate thin films by ALD, featured with well thickness and
   composition, excellent step coverage, and moderate ionic conductivity at
   room temperature, would be promising solid-state electrolytes for 3D
   microbatteries.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional multiphase numerical model was used to simulate the
   infiltration and dissolution of a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)
   release in two experimental flow cells containing different
   heterogeneous and well-characterized permeability fields. DNAPL
   infiltration was modeled using Brooks-Corey-Burdine hysteretic
   constitutive relationships. DNAPL dissolution was simulated using a
   rate-limited mass transfer expression with a velocity-dependent mass
   transfer coefficient and a thermodynamically based calculation of
   DNAPL-water interfacial area. The model did not require calibration of
   any parameters. The model predictions were compared to experimental
   measurements of high-resolution DNAPL saturations and effluent
   concentrations. The predicted concentrations were in close agreement
   with measurements for both domains, indicating that important processes
   were effectively captured by the model. DNAPL saturations greatly
   influenced mass transfer rates through their effect on relative
   permeability and velocity. Areas with low DNAPL saturation were
   associated with low interfacial areas, which resulted in reduced mass
   transfer rates and nonequilibrium dissolution. This was captured by the
   thermodynamic interfacial area model, while a geometric model
   overestimated the interfacial areas and the overall mass transfer. This
   study presents the first validation of the thermodynamic dissolution
   model in three dimensions and for high aqueous phase velocities; such
   conditions are typical for remediation operations, especially in
   heterogeneous aquifers. The demonstrated ability to predict DNAPL
   dissolution, only requiring prior characterization of soil properties
   and DNAPL release conditions, represents a significant improvement
   compared to empirical dissolution models and provides an opportunity to
   delineate the relationship between source zone architecture and the
   remediation potential for complex DNAPL source zones.}},

Abstract = {{The differential evolution (DE) algorithm is a powerful search technique
   for solving global optimization problems over continuous space. The
   search initialization for this algorithm is handled stochastically and
   therefore does not adequately capture vague preliminary knowledge. This
   paper proposes a novel Fuzzy Differential Evolution (FOE) algorithm, as
   an alternative approach, where the vague information on the search space
   can be represented and used to deliver a more focused search. The
   proposed FOE algorithm utilizes (a) fuzzy numbers to represent vague
   knowledge and (b) random alpha-cut levels for the search initialization.
   The alpha-cut intervals created during the initialization are used for
   fuzzy interval based mutation in successive search iterations. Four
   benchmark functions are used to demonstrate performance of the new FOE
   and its practical value. Additionally, the application of the FDE
   algorithm is illustrated through a reservoir operation case study
   problem. The new algorithm shows faster convergence in most of these
   functions.}},

   and Temperature Programmed Decarbonation (TPDC) are developed using a
   temperature programmed fixed bed unit. Sorbents are kept in contact with
   a gas stream containing a 10\% CO2 mole fraction, and are subjected to a
   5 degrees C/min temperature ramp. Calcium carbonate, lithium
   orthosilicate and a novel lithium orthosilicate modified sorbent are
   considered for these runs. TPC-TPDC runs confirm thermodynamic
   predictions for thermal inversion points. Furthermore. TPD-TPDC runs
   show that the novel lithium orthosilicate based sorbent provides a very
   stable and increased CO2 sorption capacity over 10
   absorption-regeneration cycles, while calcium carbonate displays a
   reduced CO2 sorption capacity with cyclic operation. This fluidizable
   novel sorbent can significantly contribute towards CO2 removal from flue
   gases emitted by power plants. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The impact of calcium concentrations on the biofilm morphology,
   structure, detachment and denitrification efficiency in denitrifying
   fluidized bed bioreactors (DFBBRs) was investigated. The DFBBRs were
   operated on a synthetic municipal wastewater at five different calcium
   concentrations ranging from the typical Ca2+ concentration of the tap
   water (20 mg Ca2+/L) to 240 mg Ca2+/L at two different C/N ratios of 5
   and 3.5 in phases I and II, respectively for a period of 200 days.
   Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), Ca2+ concentration, water
   quality parameters, and microscopic images were monitored regularly in
   both phases. Calcium concentrations played a significant role in biofilm
   morphology with the detachment rates for R-120Ca, (bioreactor with a
   Ca2+ concentration of 120 mg/L), R-180Ca, and R-240Ca 90\% and 70\%
   lower than for R-20Ca and R-60Ca, respectively. The optimum influent
   calcium concentration at both organic and nitrogen loading rates was 120
   mg Ca2+/L, with higher concentrations exhibiting fractured and weak
   biofilms. Specific denitrification rates did not change with changing
   the C/N ratio at elevated Ca2+ concentration bioreactors while with
   lower Ca2+ concentrations, the specific denitrification rates dropped by
   20-40\%. Nutrients and Ca2+ mass balances were closed with reasonable
   accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   resonant elliptical slot used in microwave imaging arrays for
   nondestructive testing applications is considered. The proposed feed is

   using an out-of-plane (perpendicular) microstrip line. An imaging array
   prototype with this slot, a 90 degrees-bent microstrip-line feed and a
   coplanar waveguide (CPW) to microstrip line transition was designed and
   experimentally validated. The design readily accommodates placement of
   the switching and PIN diode biasing networks on the feeding plane using
   CPWs, enabling one-sided imaging measurements. The relevant design steps
   and imaging results obtained with this prototype, in mono-static and
   bi-static modes, are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators are a popular type
   of actuator used in active flow control. However, their performance and
   broader application are restricted by the manufacturing methods
   currently employed. A methodology is proposed, with an emphasis on
   material durability when exposed to plasma, to build more robust plasma
   actuators, which takes advantage of microfabrication techniques. Thin
   film electrodes are precisely deposited onto alkali free borosilicate
   glass substrates, which resist degradation in the presence of plasma,
   resulting in the batch construction of repeatable actuators with
   consistent physical and operational properties. The robustness of
   different electrode materials to the plasma environment is considered
   via SEM images, EDX elemental analysis and through the homogeneity of
   the plasma formation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Radical prostatectomy is performed on approximately 40\% of men with
   organ-confined prostate cancer. Pathologic information obtained from the
   prostatectomy specimen provides important prognostic information and
   guides recommendations for adjuvant treatment. The current pathology
   protocol in most centers involves primarily qualitative assessment. In
   this paper, we describe and evaluate our system for automatic prostate
   cancer detection and grading on hematoxylin \& eosin-stained tissue
   images. Our approach is intended to address the dual challenges of large
   data size and the need for high-level tissue information about the
   locations and grades of tumors. Our system uses two stages of
   AdaBoost-based classification. The first provides high-level tissue
   component labeling of a superpixel image partitioning. The second uses
   the tissue component labeling to provide a classification of cancer
   versus noncancer, and low-grade versus high-grade cancer. We evaluated
   our system using 991 sub-images extracted from digital pathology images
   of 50 whole-mount tissue sections from 15 prostatectomy patients. We
   measured accuracies of 90\% and 85\% for the cancer versus noncancer and
   high-grade versus low-grade classification tasks, respectively. This
   system represents a first step toward automated cancer quantification on
   prostate digital histopathology imaging, which could pave the way for
   more accurately informed postprostatectomy patient care.}},

Abstract = {{The absorbed energy distribution (AED) in X-ray imaging detectors is an
   important factor that affects both energy resolution and image quality
   through the Swank factor and detective quantum efficiency. In the
   diagnostic energy range (20-140 keV), escape of characteristic photons
   following photoelectric absorption and Compton scatter photons are
   primary sources of absorbed-energy dispersion in X-ray detectors. In
   this paper, we describe the development of an analytic model of the AED
   in compound X-ray detector materials, based on the cascaded-systems
   approach, that includes the effects of escape and reabsorption of
   characteristic and Compton-scatter photons. We derive analytic
   expressions for both semi-infinite slab and pixel geometries and
   validate our approach by Monte Carlo simulations. The analytic model
   provides the energy-dependent X-ray response function of arbitrary
   compound materials without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. We
   believe this model will be useful for correcting spectral distortion
   artifacts commonly observed in photon-counting applications and optimal
   design and development of novel X-ray detectors.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The annual bark yield in Canada is as much as 17 million m(3).
   Currently, more than half of the bark is incinerated or landfilled and
   the remainder of the bark is mainly used as a cheap source of energy in
   saw/pulp mills. Both bark incineration and landfilling can lead to
   environmental problems. Due to the abundance of ash in bark and the
   lower sintering point of bark ash than that of wood ash, the combustion
   of bark can lead to fouling which would damage the combustors. Bark
   contains a large fraction of extractives and lignin (up to 50 wt\% on a
   dry basis), which can be utilized as a renewable source of chemicals,
   particularly aromatic chemicals. The technical routes and technologies
   on the valorization of tree barks for chemicals and materials are
   reviewed in this paper. These include direct utilization of bark for
   wooden panels, and extraction for extractives (mainly tannin) and their
   the application in resins and foam materials, as well as conversion of
   bark via thermochemical technologies, mainly phenolysis, direct
   liquefaction in alcohols and pyrolysis. Finally, some challenges and
   perspectives on the production of chemicals and materials from bark are
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of adding partially hydrated cementitious materials (PHCM) on
   the early-age shrinkage of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is
   investigated. UHPC mixtures incorporating a shrinkage-reducing admixture
   (SRA) are also tested for comparison. Combined effects of PHCM and SRA
   in reducing early-age shrinkage are explored. Results indicate a
   significant improvement in the early-age compressive strength of UHPC
   mixtures due to PHCM addition. SRA was effective in reducing shrinkage;
   however, PHCM achieved excellent early-age shrinkage reduction when used
   alone or combined with SRA. PHCM mitigates undesirable behaviour induced
   by SRA, including setting time delays and reduction in mechanical
   properties. The addition of PHCM provides an ecological and economic
   technique for producing precast and cast-in-place self-restraining
   shrinkage concrete. Indeed, unused/returned concrete can be recycled in
   new mixtures to enhance mechanical strength and resistance to shrinkage,
   and to mitigate set retardation effects.}},

Abstract = {{Critical-state soil mechanics is a useful framework to understand sand
   behavior. In this paper, a relationship is developed for estimating
   undrained critical shear strength of sands based on the critical-state
   framework. The application of this relationship is demonstrated by
   comparison with laboratory test results and sand liquefied strength from
   field liquefaction flow failure case histories. Using this relationship,
   the effects of effective stress variation and density on undrained
   critical shear strength are studied for different combinations of
   critical-state line parameters corresponding to several reference sands.
   The parametric study indicates that depending on sand void ratio,
   undrained critical shear strength may increase, remain the same or
   decrease as sand shearing-compressibility (represented by the slope of
   the critical-state line) increases. The underlying mechanisms of field
   failures in dense sands and reverse behavior of compressible sands are
   explained through this relationship. It is suggested that the
   critical-state parameter alone is insufficient for describing the
   behavior of liquefiable sands and sand shearing-compressibility should
   be also taken into account for estimating undrained shear strength
   corresponding to the changes in density and effective confining stress.}},

Abstract = {{A new algorithm has been developed for phasor estimation of the current
   signal within numerical protective relays which effectively filters out
   harmonics, noise, and decaying dc offset. Analytical analysis is
   presented to show the effect of decaying dc on discrete Fourier
   transform (DFT)-based phasor estimation. Based on the presented theory,
   a new method is proposed to first estimate the decaying dc
   characteristic of the current signal and second to compensate the
   unwanted effect of decaying dc on current phasor in the phasor domain.
   The proposed technique adds few basic mathematical operations to
   conventional DFT by employing the proposed two interim variables to
   characterize the decaying dc component. The proposed algorithm has been
   comprehensively evaluated in Matlab and compared with the conventional
   methods used in modern commercial relays for a wide variety of signals
   including different levels of decaying dc magnitude and time constants,
   offnominal frequency operation, signal distortion due to current
   transformer saturation, and transmission-line series compensation in the
   presence of harmonics and noise. Standard performance indices including
   rise time, settling time, and overshoot are considered for evaluation

Abstract = {{Using the ultra-high frequency method to detect partial discharge (PD)
   is considered effective for the insulation diagnosis of the
   gas-insulated switchgear (GIS). In this research, in order to gain a
   clear understanding of the propagation attenuation property of PD, a
   220-kV real GIS is utilized and four types of typical PD sources are
   designed and fabricated, including floating metal, protrusion, void in
   solid insulation and particle on the spacer. Three common GIS structures
   are considered in the paper, which are the straight structure with
   spacer, as well as the L-shaped and T-shaped structures. The attenuation
   can be caused by these GIS structures when the PD signal emitted from
   the defect propagates through them. In this study, research is focused
   on the variations of the time-domain amplitude, the frequency spectrum,
   and the cumulative energy of the PD signal. Based on the three aspects,
   the changes of PD signal through GIS structures are described
   comprehensively, and the propagation properties are presented in detail.
   The lowpass (<800 MHz) and bandpass (800 MHz-1600 MHz) filters are
   applied to elaborate the propagation property of different frequency
   bands. Since the characteristics of PD caused by the four types of
   defects are different, their attenuation properties will also be
   different. These typical PD sources are tested in each GIS structure,
   respectively.}},

Title = {{Instabilities of natural convection in a periodically heated layer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{733}},
Pages = {{33-67}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Natural convection in an infinite horizontal layer subject to periodic
   heating along the lower wall has been investigated using a combination
   of numerical and asymptotic techniques. The heating maintains the same
   mean temperatures at both walls while producing sinusoidal temperature
   variations along one horizontal direction, with its spatial distribution
   characterized by the wavenumber alpha and the amplitude expressed in
   terms of a Rayleigh number Rap. The primary response of the system takes
   the form of stationary convection consisting of rolls with the axis
   orthogonal to the heating wave vector and structure determined by the
   particular values of Ra-p and alpha. It is shown that for sufficiently
   large alpha convection is limited to a thin layer adjacent to the lower
   wall with a uniform conduction zone emerging above it; the temperature
   in this zone becomes independent of the heating pattern and varies in
   the vertical direction only. Linear stability of the above system has
   been considered and conditions leading to the emergence of secondary
   convection have been identified. Secondary convection gives rise to
   either longitudinal rolls, transverse rolls or oblique rolls at the
   onset, depending on alpha. The longitudinal rolls are parallel to the
   primary rolls and the transverse rolls are orthogonal to the primary
   rolls, and both result in striped patterns. The oblique rolls lead to
   the formation of convection cells with aspect ratio dictated by their
   inclination angle and formation of rhombic patterns. Two mechanisms of
   instability have been identified. In the case of alpha = O(1),
   parametric resonance dominates and leads to a pattern of instability
   that is locked in with the pattern of heating according to the relation
   delta(cr) = alpha/2, where delta(cr) denotes the component of the
   critical disturbance wave vector parallel to the heating wave vector.
   The second mechanism, the Rayleigh-Benard (RB) mechanism, dominates for
   large alpha, where the instability is driven by the uniform mean
   vertical temperature gradient created by the primary convection, with
   the critical disturbance wave vector delta(cr) -> 1.56 for alpha ->
   infinity and the fluid response becoming similar to that found in the
   case of a uniformly heated wall. Competition between these mechanisms
   gives rise to non-commensurable states in the case of longitudinal rolls
   and the appearance of soliton lattices, to the formation of distorted
   transverse rolls, and to the appearance of the wave vector component in
   the direction perpendicular to the forcing direction. A rapid
   stabilization is observed when the heating wavenumber is reduced below
   alpha approximate to 2.2 and no instability is found when alpha < 1.6 in
   the range of Ra-p considered. It is shown that alpha plays the role of
   an effective pattern control parameter and its judicious selection
   provides a means for the creation of a wide range of flow responses.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamics in a 76 mm i.d., 10.2 m high circulating fluidized bed
   (CFB) riser and a 76 mm id., 5.8 m high CFB downer were studied for
   superficial gas velocities ranging from 2 to 5 m/s and solid circulation
   rates up to 100 kg/(m(2)s). Solid holdup, particle velocity and solid
   flux profiles in the radial and axial positions were presented. Under
   these operating conditions, axial solid holdup profiles in the riser and
   the downer could be approximated by an exponential decay function. The
   radial gradients of the solid holdup profiles in the riser were much
   higher than those in the downer, showing that the downer had much more
   uniform solid distribution. The average solid holdup for the entire
   riser was about 1.5 times higher than the predicted value from G(s)/(rho
   U-p(g)). However, for the downer reactor this ratio dropped to 0.45-0.98
   which increased with increasing superficial gas velocity and decreasing
   solid circulation rate. Solid flow developed much slower in the riser
   than in the downer. Negative particle velocity was observed in the
   near-wall region for nearly the entire height of the riser. The average
   particle velocity for the entire riser was 0.8-0.96 times higher than
   the superficial gas velocity, and increased with increasing superficial
   gas velocity and decreasing solid circulation rate. However, in the
   downer the average particle velocity was 1.13-2.13 times higher than the
   superficial gas velocity, and increased with both superficial gas
   velocity and solid circulation rate. High local solid fluxes were
   observed in the near wall region of the CFB riser and downer reactor.
   Over-estimation of the calculated cross-sectional average solid flux
   over the solid circulation rate in the CFB riser was attributed to the
   fluctuations of the solid holdup and particle velocity. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the physical-layer security in cooperative
   wireless networks with multiple relays where both amplify-and-forward
   (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols are considered. We propose
   the AF and DF based optimal relay selection (i.e., AFbORS and DFbORS)
   schemes to improve the wireless security against eavesdropping attack.
   For the purpose of comparison, we examine the traditional AFbORS and
   DFbORS schemes, denoted by T-AFbORS and T-DFbORS, respectively. We also
   investigate a so-called multiple relay combining (MRC) framework and
   present the traditional AF and DF based MRC schemes, called T-AFbMRC and
   T-DFbMRC, where multiple relays participate in forwarding the source
   signal to destination which then combines its received signals from the
   multiple relays. We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions
   of the proposed AFbORS and DFbORS (i.e., P-AFbORS and P-DFbORS) as well
   as the T-AFbORS, T-DFbORS, T-AFbMRC and T-DFbMRC schemes in the presence
   of eavesdropping attack. We further conduct an asymptotic intercept
   probability analysis to evaluate the diversity order performance of
   relay selection schemes and show that no matter which relaying protocol
   is considered (i.e., AF and DF), the traditional and proposed optimal
   relay selection approaches both achieve the diversity order M where M
   represents the number of relays. In addition, numerical results show
   that for both AF and DF protocols, the intercept probability performance
   of proposed optimal relay selection is strictly better than that of the
   traditional relay selection and multiple relay combining methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simple synchrophasor estimation algorithm has been
   proposed considering power system steady state, dynamic conditions, and
   protection requirements. The new IEEE Standard C37.118.1-2011 for
   synchrophasor measurements includes the dynamic performance requirements
   for the phasor measurement units. It is shown that the proposed method
   satisfies all the steady state and dynamic requirements of the new IEEE
   Standard. Presently, synchrophasors are mainly used for wide area
   monitoring. Increasingly, synchrophasors are being considered for
   protection applications in smart grids. Protection applications require
   shorter response times and lower overshoot/undershoot values for
   estimated phasors during large disturbances. It is shown that the
   proposed method performs satisfactorily during system faults, which is
   an important requirement for protection applications. A detailed
   performance comparison with the existing phasor estimation algorithms
   has also been presented.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating data implicate a pathological role for sympathetic
   neurotransmitters like neuropeptide Y (NPY) in breast cancer
   progression. Our group and others reported that NPY promotes
   proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells, however the
   angiogenic potential of NPY in breast cancer is unknown. Herein we
   sought to determine if NPY promotes angiogenesis in vitro by increasing
   vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and release from
   4T1 breast cancer cells. Western blot analysis revealed that NPY
   treatment caused a 52 +/- 14\% increase in VEGF expression in the 4T1
   cells compared to nontreated controls. Using selective NPY Y-receptor
   agonists (Y1R, Y2R and Y5R) we observed an increase in VEGF expression
   only when cells were treated with Y5R agonist. Congruently, using
   selective Y1R, Y2R, or Y5R antagonists, NPY-induced increases in VEGF
   expression in 4T1 cells were attenuated only under Y5R antagonism.
   Endothelial tube formation assays were conducted using conditioned media
   (CM) from NPY treated 4T1 cells. Concentration-dependent increases in
   number of branch points and complete endothelial networks were observed
   in HUVEC exposed to NPY CM. CM from Y5R agonist treated 4T1 cells caused
   similar increases in number of branch points and complete endothelial
   networks. VEGF concentration was quantified in CM (ELISA) from agonist
   experiments; we observed a 2-fold and 2.5-fold increase in VEGF release
   from NPY and Y5R agonist treated 4T1 cells respectively. Overall these
   data highlight a novel mechanism by which NPY may promote breast cancer
   progression, and further implicate a pathological role of the NPY Y5R.

   both cells cultured on the functionalized MWCNTs displayed higher cell

   nonhemolytic materials. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray

   indicated the existence of hydroxyl and carboxyl moieties on the

Abstract = {{The behavior of bone cells is influenced by the surface chemistry and
   topography of implants and scaffolds. Our purpose was to investigate how
   the topography of biomimetic hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings influences the
   attachment and differentiation of osteoblasts, and the resorptive
   activity of osteoclasts. Using strategies reported previously, we
   directly controlled the surface topography of HA coatings on
   polycaprolactone discs. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts were incubated on HA
   coatings having distinct isotropic topographies with submicrometer and
   micro-scale features. Osteoblast attachment and differentiation were
   greater on more complex, micro-rough HA surfaces (Ra similar to 2 mu m)
   than on smoother topographies (Ra similar to 1 mu m). In contrast,
   activity of the osteoclast marker tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
   was greater on smoother than on micro-rough surfaces. Furthermore,
   scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of resorption lacunae
   exclusively on smoother HA coatings. Inhibition of resorption on
   micro-rough surfaces was associated with disruption of filamentous actin
   sealing zones. In conclusion, HA coatings can be prepared with distinct
   topographies, which differentially regulate responses of osteoblasts, as
   well as osteoclastic activity and hence susceptibility to resorption.
   Thus, it may be possible to design HA coatings that induce optimal rates
   of bone formation and degradation specifically tailored for different
   applications in orthopedics and dentistry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Novel imaging modalities are pushing the boundaries of what is possible
   in medical imaging, but their signal properties are not always well
   understood. The evaluation of these novel imaging modalities is critical
   to achieving their research and clinical potential.
   Image registration of novel modalities to accepted reference standard
   modalities is an important part of characterizing the modalities and
   elucidating the effect of underlying focal disease on the imaging
   signal. The strengths of the conclusions drawn from these analyses are
   limited by statistical power. Based on the observation that in this
   context, statistical power depends in part on uncertainty arising from
   registration error, we derive a power calculation formula relating
   registration error, number of subjects, and the minimum detectable
   difference between normal and pathologic regions on imaging, for an
   imaging validation study design that accommodates signal correlations
   within image regions.
   Monte Carlo simulations were used to evaluate the derived models and
   test the strength of their assumptions, showing that the model yielded
   predictions of the power, the number of subjects, and the minimum
   detectable difference of simulated experiments accurate to within a
   maximum error of 1\% when the assumptions of the derivation were met,
   and characterizing sensitivities of the model to violations of the
   assumptions. The use of these formulae is illustrated through a
   calculation of the number of subjects required for a case study, modeled
   closely after a prostate cancer imaging validation study currently
   taking place at our institution.
   The power calculation formulae address three central questions in the
   design of imaging validation studies: (1) What is the maximum acceptable
   registration error? (2) How many subjects are needed? (3) What is the
   minimum detectable difference between normal and pathologic image
   regions? (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{193-202}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Hydrotreatment of glycerol (a byproduct of bio-diesel production) was
   conducted in the presence of a number of different supported metal
   catalysts at a temperature of 300 degrees C under 5 MPa initial pressure
   of H-2. The bio-oil products were comprehensively characterized to
   determine their physical/chemical properties. Experiments with supported
   catalyst metals revealed a positive correlation between support acidity
   and bio-oil yield. It was determined that MoCoP is the most effective
   combination of catalyst metals, and the bio-oil yield from
   hydro-treatment of glycerol with the MoCoP catalysts is strongly
   dependent on the support materials, following the trend of MgO < AC <
   Al2O3 < zeolite. With the MoCoP/zeolite catalyst, a maximum yield of
   similar to 40 wt.\% bio-oil, and >90\% glycerol conversion was achieved
   for 60 min reaction. The volatile components of the bio-oil were found
   to consist mostly of substituted phenols and ketones in the C6-C9 range.
   The bio-oils obtained had a maximum HHV of 33 MJ/kg and the majority
   (similar to 95\%) of the compounds present was found to have boiling
   points lower than 165 degrees C, making these bio-oils potential
   oxygenated fuel additives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fitting the extreme value distributions to samples is needed in many
   reliability analysis problems. The ordinary, weighted and generalized
   least-squares methods (OL, WL and GL method) are used to fit extreme
   value distributions based on the moments of order statistics and adopted
   plotting positions. An analyst may consider the observed ordered sample
   or the reduced variate as the regressand. The choice of the regressand
   for the least-squares methods and their corresponding relative accuracy
   are not always clear. Simulation results are presented in this study to
   rank the performance of the OL, WL and GL methods in combination with
   the choice of the regressands to estimate the distribution parameters,
   quantiles and nonexceedance probability. Analysis results for the OL
   method are also presented by adopting different plotting positions. The
   results indicate that the use of the ordered sample as the regressand is
   preferred. In such a case, the GL method outperforms the OL and WL
   methods for small sample size; the performance of the OL, WL and GL
   methods are similar for the sample size greater than about 20. The
   application of the OL method can be of value, if the adopted plotting
   position approximates well the mean of order statistics. (c) 2013

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{329-344}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{The liquid-liquid dispersion of two immiscible viscous fluids was
   studied in an SMX static mixer in the laminar flow regime. The dispersed
   and continuous liquid phases were silicone oils and aqueous solutions of
   high fructose corn syrup, respectively. Several different phase
   viscosities were used and the effect of interfacial tension was examined
   by adding different concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulphate in the
   aqueous phase. Flow rates of the two phases were varied, and the effect
   of the volume fraction (holdup) of dispersed phase was explored for a
   few cases. The droplets were photographed with backlighting and the
   images were analysed using the Hough transform method. The drop size
   distributions for each set of conditions were typically obtained on the
   basis of about 200 images. Mean drop size was expressed as the mass mean
   diameter D-43.
   It was found that the ``tail{''} at the higher end of the droplet size
   distribution decreased with increasing superficial velocity and
   continuous phase viscosities and the same effect was seen in the values
   of D-43. It was also found that D-43 decreased with lowering of the
   interfacial tension. The effect of the dispersed phase viscosity was
   significant only at non-zero surfactant concentrations. The holdup was
   found to have a minimal effect on D-43.
   A two-stage breakup model has been developed relating D-43 to the
   capillary number. The model uses the concept that primary drops are
   formed near the entry to the mixer, with a size determined by the
   spacing between the cross bars in the element. They are then further
   broken up by a hydrodynamic mechanism based on an energy balance between
   the energy input clue to the viscous flow, and the surface energy
   increase clue to the breakup of the primary drops. This model provides
   an approximate basis for correlating the data on D-43. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   CaCl2), and in 10 mg/l humic acid solutions (pH 6.75). pH values of 4
   and 5.5 produced attraction between magnetite and iron particles (either
   bare or polymer coated), promoting attachment. Attractive forces between
   uncoated particles and magnetite were also measured in 100 mM NaCl and
   CaCl2 at pH 8. Attachment of uncoated and CMC-coated iron particles was
   unfavorable in water at pH 8 and in humic acid solutions, as the forces
   upon approach were repulsive and, in addition, adhesive forces were on
   average weaker than in the other chemistries. A quartz-crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring was used to probe humic acid
   sorption onto magnetite, and assess its impact on the forces of
   interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Various WSi2 nanostructures including networked nanorods (NNWs),
   networked nanoribbons (NNRs), and nanosheets (NSs) were sequentially
   (spatial) synthesized in a controlled manner via a single-step chemical
   vapor deposition method. Their morphology, structure, and composition
   were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopes and
   X-ray diffraction. The nanostructures are 6-10 nm in thickness and
   several micrometers in length. The results reveal that the formation of
   WSi2 nanostructures is governed by a vapor solid mechanism and the
   concentration of reactive species plays a crucial role in controlling
   the formation of the various morphologies of the synthesized
   nanostructures. The time-dependent growth study shows that the
   nanostructures feature two-dimensional growth of WSi2, resulting in
   nanonets and nanosheets. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of these
   nanostructures demonstrate the chemical capacitance characteristics of
   WSi2 nanosheets and nanoribbons. Not only has this study paved a new
   route for preparing various nanostructures, but also these
   nanostructures are of great interest for nanodevices and electrochemical
   applications.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{127-140}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Immersed boundary conditions (IBC) method provides an opportunity for
   spectrally accurate and computationally efficient analysis of flows in
   complex geometries. The method is limited to domains that are periodic
   in one direction with top and bottom walls whose heights can be
   accurately described using Fourier expansions. It is shown that
   efficiency of this method can be significantly enhanced by the use of a
   specialized direct linear solver. This solver takes advantage of the
   particular structure of the coefficient matrix resulting in a
   significant reduction of both the processing time as well as the memory
   requirements. Various tests demonstrate a significantly reduced
   processing time compared to the standard LIN-PAK/LAPACK solvers. The IBC
   method combined with the new solver is close to two orders of magnitude
   faster than algorithms relying on the use of boundary conforming grids.
   The new solver provides a significant acceleration of time-dependent
   simulations making the cost of three-dimensional unsteady simulations
   involving irregular domains comparable to the costs of simulations for
   regular domains. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene-polymer nanocomposites have significant potential in many
   applications such as photovoltaic devices, fuel cells, and sensors.
   Functionalization of graphene is an essential step in the synthesis of
   uniformly distributed graphene-polymer nanocomposites, but often results
   in structural defects in the graphitic sp 2 carbon framework. To address
   this issue, we synthesized graphene oxide (GO) by oxidative exfoliation
   of graphite and then reduced it into graphene via self-polymerization of
   dopamine (DA). The simultaneous reduction of GO into graphene, and
   polymerization and coating of polydopamine (PDA) on the reduced graphene
   oxide (RGO) surface were confirmed with XRD, UV-Vis, XPS, Raman, TGA,
   and FTIR. The degree of reduction of GO increased with increasing DA/GO
   ratio from 1/4 to 4/1 and/or with increasing temperature from room
   temperature to 60 degrees C. A RAFT agent,
   2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio) 22methylpropionic acid, was linked onto
   the surface of the PDA/RGO, with a higher equivalence of RAFT agent in
   the reaction leading to a higher concentration of RAFT sites on the
   surface. Graphene-poly(methyl methacrylate), graphene-poly(tert-butyl
   acrylate), and graphene-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) nanocomposites were
   synthesized via RAFT polymerization, showing their characteristic
   solubility in several different solvents. This novel synthetic route was
   found facile and can be readily used for the rational design of
   graphene-polymer nanocomposites, promoting their applications. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{LiFePO4 has been extensively studied in recent years because of superior
   thermal stability for the next generation of lithium-ion batteries.
   Nevertheless, LiFePO4 still undergo iron dissolution at high temperature
   or moisture-contaminated electrolyte, and the detailed mechanism is
   still not clear. Few efforts have been devoted to the correlations
   between surface chemistry and aging mechanisms. Here, we present a
   direct visual observation of surface corrosion process at olivine
   LiFePO4, and found the direct relationship between impurity phases and
   LiFePO4 corrosion. By using the LiFePO4 ingot sample with a flat surface
   as model materials, two types of impurity phase (iron-rich and
   phosphorus-rich) can be clearly observed and their influences on LiFePO4
   corrosion were investigated in detail by SEM, Tof-SIMS, and
   electrochemical Tafel analysis. Similar to the electrochemical cell
   mechanism in a common metal corrosion process, an oxidation reduction
   mechanism was suggested at the impurity phases-relevant corrosion
   behavior. Iron-rich impurity phases are seriously corroded due to the
   lower corrosion potentials, which inhibit the corrosion of the adjacent
   LiFePO4 bulk. On the contrary, phosphorus-rich impurity phase is stable
   due to higher corrosion potentials, which evokes the serious corrosion
   occurring at the adjacent LiFePO4 bulk. These findings provide the deep
   understanding the underlying mechanism in the LiFePO4 aging. (C) 2013

Title = {{Quantification of cervical spine muscle fat: a comparison between
   T1-weighted and multi-echo gradient echo imaging using a variable
   projection algorithm (VARPRO)}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous data using T1-weighted MRI demonstrated neck muscle
   fat infiltration (MFI) in patients with poor functional recovery
   following whiplash. Such findings do not occur in those with milder
   symptoms of whiplash, chronic non-traumatic neck pain or healthy
   controls, suggesting traumatic factors play a role. Muscle degeneration
   could potentially represent a quantifiable marker of poor recovery, but
   the temporal constraints of running a T1-weighted sequence and
   performing the subsequent analysis for muscle fat may be a barrier for
   clinical translation. The purpose of this preliminary study was to
   evaluate, quantify and compare MFI for the cervical multifidus muscles
   with T1-weighted imaging and a more rapid quantitative 3D multi-echo
   gradient echo (GRE) Dixon based method in healthy subjects.
   Methods: 5 asymptomatic participants with no history of neck pain
   underwent cervical spine MRI with a Siemens 3 Tesla system. The muscle
   and fat signal intensities on axial spin-echo T1-weighted images were
   quantitatively classified for the cervical multifidii from C3-C7,
   bilaterally. Additional axial GRE Dixon based data for fat and water
   quantification were used for comparison via paired t-tests. Inter-tester
   reliability for fat and water measures with GRE images were examined
   using 1) Pearson's Intra-class correlation coefficient 2) Bland-Altman
   Plots and 3) Lin's-Concordance Coefficient. P < 0.05 was used to
   indicate significance.
   Results: Total mean (SD) MFI (C3-C7) for the multifidii obtained with
   T1-weighted imaging and GRE were 18.4\% (3.3) (range 14-22\%) and 18.8\%
   (2.9) (range 15-22\%), respectively. The Pearson correlation
   coefficients for inter-tester reliability on the GRE sequences for the
   C3-C7 multifidii ranged from .83 - .99, indicating high levels of
   agreement with segmental MFI measures. Bland-Altman Plots revealed all
   data points were within 2 SDs and concordance was established between
   2-blinded raters, suggesting good agreement between two raters measuring
   fat and water with GRE imaging.
   Conclusions: Results of this preliminary study demonstrate reliability
   between 2 raters of varying experience for MRI analysis of MFI with 3D
   GRE MRI. The quantification of MFI for healthy cervical musculature is
   comparable to T1-weighted images. Inclusion of larger samples of
   symptomatic data and histological comparison with the reference standard
   biopsy is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The Liupanshan Arcuate Tectonic Belt (LATB) is located at the
   northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Major strike-slip and
   thrust faults in the Liupanshan area are prominent Cenozoic structures,
   which are critical in understanding and reconstructing the tectonic
   deformation history. This paper not only provides detailed
   investigations on geometric and kinematic characteristics of these
   faults in the LATB, but also dates the faults' movements by electron
   spin resonance (ESR). The LATB underwent a succession of compression,
   extension and again compression tectonic deformation processes since the
   Cenozoic. The Liupanshan Curved Faults first experienced sinistral
   strike-slip shear during 57-61 Ma. The Liupanshan Curved Faults
   responded to the deformation caused by the eastward escape of the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and acted as the northeastern boundary of the
   deformation. Timing for the formation of the Liupanshan Curved Faults
   shows that the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates must have
   occurred earlier than these faults' activity because the latter is
   reflected the far-field effect of the collision. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present a two-dimensional (2D) snapshot multispectral imager that
   utilizes the optical transmission characteristics of nanohole arrays
   (NHAs) in a gold film to resolve a mixture of input colors into multiple
   spectral bands. The multispectral device consists of blocks of NHAs,
   wherein each NHA has a unique periodicity that results in transmission
   resonances and minima in the visible and near-infrared regions. The
   multispectral device was illuminated over a wide spectral range, and the
   transmission was spectrally unmixed using a least-squares estimation
   algorithm. A NHA-based multispectral imaging system was built and tested
   in both reflection and transmission modes. The NHA-based multispectral
   imager was capable of extracting 2D multispectral images representative
   of four independent bands within the spectral range of 662 nm to 832 nm
   for a variety of targets. The multispectral device can potentially be
   integrated into a variety of imaging sensor systems.}},

Title = {{Size-dependent bending and vibration behaviour of piezoelectric

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{35}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Flexoelectricity, representing a spontaneous electric polarization
   induced by a non-uniform strain field (or strain gradient), is believed
   to become manifest and be responsible for the size-dependent properties
   of dielectric materials at the nanoscale. In this paper, the influence
   of the flexoelectric effect on the static bending and free vibration of
   a simply supported piezoelectric nanobeam is investigated based on the
   extended linear piezoelectricity theory and the Timoshenko beam model.
   The governing equations of the piezoelectric nanobeam with
   non-homogeneous boundary conditions are obtained from Hamilton's
   principle. Explicit expressions of the beam deflection and resonant
   frequency are derived to show the size-dependency of the flexoelectric
   effect. It is found that the flexoelectricity has a significant effect
   on the deflection of the bending beam and may reverse the deflection
   direction under certain loading conditions. Simulation results also
   indicate that the influence of the flexoelectricity on the vibration
   behaviour of the piezoelectric nanobeam is more prominent for beams with
   smaller thickness. Thus, it is suggested that possible frequency tuning
   of piezoelectric nanobeams by adjusting the applied electrical load
   should incorporate the flexoelectric effect. The current study can be
   claimed as helpful for qualitatively characterizing the trend of the
   flexoelectric effect on the mechanical responses of piezoelectric
   nanobeams.}},

Abstract = {{Strain energy-based adaptive material models are used to predict bone
   resorption resulting from stress shielding induced by prosthetic joint
   implants. Generally, such models are governed by two key parameters: a
   homeostatic strain-energy state (K) and a threshold deviation from this
   state required to initiate bone reformation (s). A refinement procedure
   has been performed to estimate these parameters in the femur and
   glenoid; this study investigates the specific influences of these
   parameters on resulting density distributions in the distal ulna. A
   finite element model of a human ulna was created using micro-computed
   tomography (mu CT) data, initialized to a homogeneous density
   distribution, and subjected to approximate in vivo loading. Values for K
   and s were tested, and the resulting steady-state density distribution
   compared with values derived from mu CT images. The sensitivity of these
   parameters to initial conditions was examined by altering the initial
   homogeneous density value. The refined model parameters selected were
   then applied to six additional human ulnae to determine their
   performance across individuals. Model accuracy using the refined
   parameters was found to be comparable with that found in previous
   studies of the glenoid and femur, and gross bone structures, such as the
   cortical shell and medullary canal, were reproduced. The model was found
   to be insensitive to initial conditions; however, a fair degree of
   variation was observed between the six specimens. This work represents
   an important contribution to the study of changes in load transfer in
   the distal ulna following the implementation of commercial orthopedic
   implants.}},

Abstract = {{The capabilities of time-resolved laser-induced incandescence

   which specifies the heat conduction rate between the laser-energized
   nanoparticles and the surrounding gas. This paper extends a molecular
   dynamics (MD) methodology to calculate alpha for Fe/He, Fe/Ar, Mo/He,
   and Mo/Ar systems. A comparative analysis of the results shows that
   alpha is most strongly influenced by the potential well between the gas
   molecule and nanoparticle surface. Finally, the MD-derived value for
   alpha is used to recover the nanoparticle size distribution for TiRe-LII
   measurements made on molybdenum nanoparticles in argon.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The ulnar component of a total elbow replacement can fail by
   ``pistoning.{''} Stem surface treatments have improved stability at the
   stem-cement interface but with varied success. This study investigated
   the role of surface treatment and stem substrate material on implant
   stability under axial loading.
   Materials and methods: Sixty circular stems (diameter, 8 mm) made of
   cobalt chrome (n = 30) or titanium (n 30) had different surfaces:
   smooth, sintered beads, and plasma spray. The surface treatment length
   was either 10 mm or 20 mm. Stems were potted in bone cement, allowed to
   cure for 24 hours, and tested in a materials testing machine under a
   compressive staircase loading protocol. Failure was defined as 2 mm of
   push-out or completion of the protocol. Two-way analyses of variance
   compared the effects of surface treatment and substrate material on
   interface strength and motion.
   Results: Significant interactions were found between surface treatment
   and substrate material for both interface strength and motion (P<.05).
   For titanium, the 20-mm beaded stems had greater interface strength than
   all other stems (P<.05) and had less motion than the 10-mm plasma-spray
   and smooth stems (P<.05). For cobalt chrome, the 20-mm beaded stems
   showed greater interface strength (P<.05) and similar motion (P>.05) to
   the 20-mm plasma-spray stems (P<.05), which outperformed all other stems
   (P<.05). Mechanisms of catastrophic failure varied: smooth stems
   debonded at the stem-cement interface, beaded stems experienced
   debonding of the beads from the stem, and plasma-spray stems showed loss
   of frictional force between the surface treatment and cement.
   Discussion and conclusion: Stem surface treatment can enhance ulnar
   component stability but is dependent on substrate material.

Abstract = {{The present work describes the in vitro aerosol deposition and enhanced
   deaggregation behavior of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoaggregates
   (SPIONs). SPIONs were surface-coated with amine functionalized
   polyrotaxane and were proposed as a carrier for inhalation dry powders.
   Polyrotaxane is primarily composed of beta cyclodextrin rings which are
   spontaneously threaded on the block copolymer, poly(propylene glycol)
   bis(2-aminopropylether). Variable concentrations of surface coating
   polymers showed controlled manipulation of the crystal size and
   morphology. Magnetic nanoaggregates fabricated with low concentration of
   polyrotaxane showed cubic crystal morphology. However, these
   nanoaggregates exhibited rhombic dodecahedron crystal structure upon
   increasing the coating polymer concentration. In comparison to the
   spherical uncoated magnetic nanoparticles, cubic phase magnetic
   nanoaggregates demonstrated an enhanced in vitro aerosol deposition
   using magnetic field alignment. This enhancement can be accomplished at
   low inhalation flow rates (15 and 30 L/min). However, transformation to
   the cubic crystal structure was observed to be associated with a
   reduction in the powder geometric standard deviation. Using a
   mathematical modeling approach, we noted significant enhancement in the
   deaggregation behavior of inhalation dry powders; that can be achieved
   with small amounts of magnetic nanoaggregates. Aggregates of cubic
   nanoparticles showed promise for targeted pulmonary deposition of
   anticancer drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmaceutical tablets are manufactured through a series of batch steps
   finishing with compression into a form using a tablet press. Lubricants
   are added to the powder mixture prior to the tabletting step to ensure
   that the tablet is ejected properly from the press. The addition of
   lubricants also affects tablet properties and can affect the behavior of
   the powder mixture. The objective of this research was to investigate
   the effect of lubricants on powder flowability as flowability into the
   tablet press is critical. Four lubricants (magnesium stearate, magnesium
   silicate, stearic acid, and calcium stearate) were mixed, in varying
   amounts, with spray-dried lactose. In addition, magnesium stearate was
   also mixed with placebo granules from a high-shear granulator.
   Measurements based on avalanche behavior indicated flowability potential
   and dynamic density and were more sensitive to changes in the mixture
   and provided a more accurate and reproducible indication of flowability
   than traditional static measurements. Of the tested lubricants,
   magnesium stearate provided the best increase in flowability even in the
   low amounts commonly added in formulations.}},

   bulk boiling, the deposition amount of B4C microparticles increased with
   an increase of heater power. However, a maximum deposition condition was
   observed between bulk boiling and film boiling states. The amount of
   deposited B4C microparticles decreased in the presence of metal ions (Fe
   or Ca). The metal ions acted as flocculants to decrease the dispersive
   stability of B4C microparticles rather than a source material for a
   porous oxide layer to increase the deposition of B4C microparticles. It
   was observed that B4C microparticles deposited much easier on bare

Abstract = {{The selective synthesis of SWCNTs with narrow chirality and diameter

   nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed
   reduction (TPR), and UV-Vis-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to
   elucidate the structure and chemical state of the species responsible
   for SWCNT growth. The results established a clear link between the
   degree of dispersion of Co species inside the MgO lattice and the
   catalyst activity and selectivity for SWCNT growth. High dispersion and
   stabilization of Co species influenced catalytic activity for methane
   decomposition and the high SWCNT selectivity. The yield of carbon and
   SWCNT selectivity increased with an increase in temperature, however,
   SWCNTs diameter distribution shifts to larger diameter tubes as
   synthesis temperature was increased. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{3D prostate histology reconstruction: An evaluation of image-based and
   fiducial-based algorithms}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Evaluation of in vivo prostate imaging modalities for
   determining the spatial distribution and aggressiveness of prostate
   cancer ideally requires accurate registration of images to an accepted
   reference standard, such as histopathological examination of radical
   prostatectomy specimens. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of
   prostate histology facilitates these registration-based evaluations by
   reintroducing 3D spatial information lost during histology processing.
   Because the reconstruction accuracy may constrain the clinical questions
   that can be answered with these data, it is important to assess the
   tradeoffs between minimally disruptive methods based on intrinsic image
   information and potentially more robust methods based on extrinsic
   fiducial markers.
   Methods: Ex vivo magnetic resonance (MR) images and digitized
   whole-mount histology images from 12 radical prostatectomy specimens
   were used to evaluate four 3D histology reconstruction algorithms. 3D
   reconstructions were computed by registering each histology image to the
   corresponding ex vivo MR image using one of two similarity metrics
   (mutual information or fiducial registration error) and one of two
   search domains (affine transformations or a constrained subset thereof).
   The algorithms were evaluated for accuracy using the mean target
   registration error (TRE) computed from homologous intrinsic point
   landmarks (3-16 per histology section; 232 total) identified on
   histology and MR images, and for the sensitivity of TRE to rotational,
   translational, and scaling initialization errors.
   Results: The algorithms using fiducial registration error and mutual
   information had mean +/- standard deviation TREs of 0.7 +/- 0.4 and 1.2
   +/- 0.7 mm, respectively, and one algorithm using fiducial registration
   error and affine transforms had negligible sensitivities to
   initialization errors. The post-optimization values of the mutual
   information-based metric showed evidence of errors due to both the
   optimizer and the similarity metric, and variation of parameters of the
   mutual information-based metric did not improve its performance.
   Conclusions: The extrinsic fiducial-based algorithm had lower mean TRE
   and lower sensitivity to initialization than the intrinsic
   intensity-based algorithm using mutual information. A model relating
   statistical power to registration error for certain imaging validation
   study designs estimated that a reconstruction algorithm with a mean TRE
   of 0.7 mm would require 27\% fewer subjects than the method used to
   initialize the algorithms (mean TRE 1.3 +/- 0.7 mm), suggesting the
   choice of reconstruction technique can have a substantial impact on the
   design of imaging validation studies, and on their overall cost. (C)

Abstract = {{Nitrogen ion implanted graphene (N/graphene) was investigated for its

   transformer infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) measurements proved that N ion implantation induced
   introduction of N element and appearance of N=C functional groups on

Abstract = {{The preparation of multilayered polymer films is of significant interest
   for various applications, but is often hindered by the inherent
   incompatibilities between polymers. Described here is the use of an
   epoxidized butyl rubber as a compatibilizer layer. This polymer can be
   coated onto butyl rubber, despite the small number of epoxidized units
   (similar to 2.2 mol\%), allows for the deposition of uniform layers of a
   diverse array of polymers including poly(vinyl stearate) (PVS),
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and
   poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). The films on epoxidized rubber were compared
   with those prepared directly on unmodified rubber using techniques
   including atomic force microscopy and contact angle measurements. In
   addition, in the case of PEO, it was demonstrated that the uniformity of
   the coating plays a significant role in conferring the desirable
   property of resistance to protein adsorption. Thus, this oxygenated
   rubber derivative may serve as a versatile material for various coating

Abstract = {{A series of eight wear tests with six different calf serum lubricants
   were performed on a displacement-controlled knee simulator. The calf
   serum lubricants varied in constituent fractions, dilutive media, and
   antimicrobial agent. The difference in low-molecular weight polypeptide
   concentration was determined in all calf serum lubricants and this
   allowed exploration of its role in the PE wear process. Sodium azide was
   not an effective antimicrobial agent. The subsequently used
   antibiotic-antimycotic mixture was initially effective in eliminating
   bacterial growth but its efficacy became exhausted as the testing period
   progressed. In the present pilot study, a predator bacterium
   Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was shown to prey on the antibiotic resistant
   bacterium, suggesting its potential use in knee simulator wear testing.

Abstract = {{The actual state of stress in the remaining ligament of a single-edge
   bending (SE(B)) specimen, which is neither plane stress nor plane
   strain, is critical in accurately predicting the crack length in the
   specimen involved in the unloading compliance method. Three-dimensional
   finite element analyses were carried out in this study to evaluate the
   effective modulus of elasticity that reflects the actual state of stress
   corresponding to the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) compliance
   of the SE(B) specimen. Both plane-sided and side-grooved specimens with
   a wide range of geometric configurations and crack lengths were included
   in the study. A practical approach is further proposed to quickly
   evaluate the effective modulus from the CMOD compliance determined based
   on the test data. The proposed approach was verified using experimental
   data and numerical analysis results. The results of the verification
   suggest that replacing the elastic modulus corresponding to the plane
   stress or plane strain condition with the effective modulus in commonly
   used a/W-CMOD compliance equations can markedly improve the accuracy of
   the predicted crack length.}},

Abstract = {{A better understanding of the anatomic structure and physiological
   function of the lung is fundamental to understanding the pathogenesis of
   pulmonary disease and how to design and deliver better treatments and
   measure response to intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
   the hyperpolarised noble gases helium-3 (He-3) and xenon-129 (Xe-129)
   provides both structural and functional pulmonary measurements, and
   because it does not require the use of x-rays or other ionising
   radiation, offers the potential for intensive serial and longitudinal
   studies in paediatric patients. These facts are particularly important
   in the evaluation of chronic lung diseases such as asthma and cystic
   fibrosis- both of which can be considered paediatric respiratory
   diseases with unmet therapy needs. This review discusses MRI-based
   imaging methods with a focus on hyperpolarised gas MRI. We also discuss
   the strengths and limitations as well as the future work required for
   clinical translation towards paediatric respiratory disease. (C) 2013

Title = {{The Application of Velocity Spectral Stacking to Extract Information on

Abstract = {{We analyzed over 3000 Fourier spectra from 370 earthquakes of energy
   magnitude (M-E) 1.1-6.0 recorded by the Southern Ontario Seismic Network
   (SOSN)/POLARIS networks during the period 1991-2010 in the area of
   southern Ontario and western Quebec. We employed a range of velocity
   stacking methods to significantly reduce the problem of variability due
   to wave scattering. This enabled us to determine underlying nonrandom
   spectral features, including source effects, site effects, and anelastic
   attenuation effects on spectral shape. The analysis technique is that we
   stack the velocity spectra of the whole observed data set into one or
   two bins and then compare that sum (the observed stack) with the
   theoretical expectation for corresponding stacks of simulated signals
   (the theoretical stack) for a given set of input parameters. A
   grid-search technique is used to find the input-parameter combination
   that optimizes the agreement between the observed and theoretical
   stacks. By stacking the spectra in different ways, different underlying
   spectral features are explored. We find the method works surprisingly
   well, allowing us to determine the apparent anelastic attenuation
   effects on the spectral shape, the average effect of site response, and
   some basic features of the source spectra. The key results of our paper:
   (1) there is no unique pair of values of the coefficients Q(0) and n of
   the frequency-dependent Quality factor relationship Q=Q(0)f(n), but
   there exist pairs of Q(0) and n along a curve in Q(0)-n space that are
   equivalent in terms of their effect on spectral shape; (2) the
   relationship between log corner frequency and energy magnitude (M-E) is
   linear, with a slope close to (-0.22) that is consistent with
   constant-width faulting for the studied small-to-moderate events; (3)
   the relation between moment magnitude M and energy magnitude M-E was
   found to be M = 8/9 M-E.}},

Abstract = {{Human adenovirus E1A makes extensive connections with the cellular
   protein interaction network. By doing so, E1A can manipulate many
   cellular programs, including cell cycle progression. Through these
   reprogramming events, E1A functions as a growth-promoting oncogene and
   has been used extensively to investigate mechanisms contributing to
   oncogenesis. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the C-terminal region
   of E1A contributes to oncogenic transformation. Although this region is
   required for transformation in cooperation with E1B, it paradoxically
   suppresses transformation in cooperation with activated Ras. Previous
   analysis has suggested that the interaction of E1A with CtBP plays a
   pivotal role in both activities. However, some C-terminal mutants of E1A
   retain CtBP binding and yet exhibit defects in transformation,
   suggesting that other targets of this region are also necessary. To
   explore the roles of these additional factors, we performed an extensive
   mutational analysis of the C terminus of E1A. We identified key residues
   that are specifically required for binding all known targets of the C
   terminus of E1A. We further tested each mutant for the ability to both
   localize to the nucleus and transform primary rat cells in cooperation
   with E1B-55K or Ras. Interaction of E1A with importin alpha 3/Qip1,
   dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A), HAN11, and CtBP
   influenced transformation with E1B-55K. Interestingly, the interaction
   of E1A with DYRK1A and HAN11 appeared to play a role in suppression of
   transformation by activated Ras whereas interaction with CtBP was not
   necessary. This unexpected result suggests a need for revision of
   current models and provides new insight into transformation by the C
   terminus of E1A.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric elastomer actuators, a promising transducer technology, have
   received much attention due to their high efficiency and large
   deformation. However, in addition to electrical breakdown, dielectric
   elastomer actuators may also be easily affected by electromechanical
   instability. These failure modes inhibit the full potential actuation of
   dielectric elastomers. This study examines the parametric range for
   which electromechanical instability can be avoided for a dielectric
   elastomer plate actuator while achieving large actuation. It is found
   that the electromechanical instability can altogether be eliminated by
   boundary constraints. With control of the boundary conditions,
   consideration should also be given to the possible mechanical buckling
   failure that may occur. Simulation results based on Gent constitutive
   model are presented to show how these failure modes can be controlled
   and to what extent the performance of the dielectric elastomer actuator
   can be improved. This work should provide a better understanding on how
   to achieve the desired actuation performance of dielectric elastomers,
   thus leading to a better and controlled design for the applications of
   these smart materials in transduction technologies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we intend to have a game theoretic study on the concept
   learning problem in a multi-agent system. Concept learning is a very
   essential and well-studied domain of machine learning when it is studied
   under the characteristics of a multi-agent system. The most important
   reasons are the partiality of the environment perception for any agent
   and also the communication holdbacks, resulting into a deep need for a
   collaborative protocol in favor of multi-agent transactions. Here we
   wish to investigate multi-agent concept learning with the help of its
   components, thoroughly with a game theoretic taste, esp. on the
   pre-learning processes. Based on two standard notations, we address the
   non-unanimity of concepts, classification of objects, voting and
   communicating protocol, and also the learning itself. In such a game of
   concept learning, we consider a group of agents, communicating and
   consulting to upgrade their ontologies based on their conceptualizations
   of the environment. For this purpose, we investigate the problem in two
   separate and standard distinctions of game theory study, cooperation and
   competition. Several solution concepts and innovative ideas from the
   multi-agent realm are used to produce an approach that contains the
   reasoning process of the agents in this system. Some experimentations
   come at the end to show the functionality of our approach. These
   experimentations come distinctly for both cooperative and competitive
   views.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional design and evaluation procedures usually classify steel
   through-truss bridges as single-load-path structures; however, their
   historic performance has demonstrated considerable structural
   resiliency. This paper presents a study of the Grand River Bridge, a
   Pratt through-truss bridge in Cayuga, Ontario, Canada, that
   systematically investigates the load paths not conventionally assumed in
   design and evaluation. The bridge with individual truss members removed
   was analyzed using nonlinear finite-element analyses to investigate the
   alternative load paths and associated critical members and responses. A
   system reliability analysis was conducted to evaluate the failure
   probabilities of the bridge accounting for the member resistance
   uncertainties. The bridge was found to be sufficient to carry its
   nominal dead load, even for the worst case of removal of an end post.
   The end bottom chord and hanger vertical were found to be the critical
   tension chord and web member, respectively. If multiple alternative load
   paths exist, the variability of the system collapse load is much less
   than that of the critical member resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Nano zerovalent iron (nZVI) is an effective remediant for removing
   various organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated water
   sources. Batch experiments were conducted to characterize the nZVI
   surface and to investigate the effects of various solution properties
   such as pH, initial cadmium concentration, sorbent dosage, ionic
   strength, and competitive ions on cadmium removal by nZVI.
   Energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results
   confirmed removal of Cd2+ ions by nZVI through adsorption. Cd2+
   adsorption decreased in the presence of competitive cations in the
   order: Zn2+ > Co2+ > Mg2+ > Mn2+ = Cu2+ > Ca2+ > Na2+ = K+. Higher
   concentrations of Cl- significantly decreased the adsorption. Cadmium
   removal increased with solution pH and reached a maximum at pH 8.0. The
   effects of various solution properties indicated Cd2+ adsorption on nZVI
   to be a chemisorption (inner-sphere complexation) process. The three
   surface complexation models (diffuse layer model, constant capacitance
   model, and triple layer model) fitted well to the adsorption edge
   experimental data indicating the formation of nZVI-Cd bidentate
   inner-sphere surface complexes. Our results suggest that nZVI can be
   effectively used for the removal of cadmium from contaminated water
   sources with varying chemical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study is to examine commercial ion exchange
   resins (IER) as heterogeneous catalysts at high temperatures for
   biodiesel production from triolein in a batch reaction system. Various
   commercial IER were screened as catalysts in transesterification of
   triolein and methanol. Of the catalysts tested, Amberlyst 15 was the
   most active catalyst in screening experiments. Reaction conditions were
   optimized within the experimental bounds using central composite design
   (CCD). At the optimized conditions, triolein conversion to products was
   97 mol\%. In longevity experiments Amberlyst 15 was reused once with no
   loss in catalytic activity, while successive experiments demonstrated
   decreases in catalytic activity. Product acid value, addition of free
   fatty acids as well as water addition to the reactants indicate that
   hydrolysis and esterification side reactions are taking place at the
   optimized conditions. Reaction kinetics were examined at 100-120 degrees
   C. A mathematical model of transesterification was developed in MATLab
   and demonstrated a close approximation to experimental data. For the
   three forward reactions: triglyceride to diglyceride, diglyceride to
   monoglyceride, and monoglyceride to glycerol, reaction rate constants
   are reported to be 9.3 x 10(-7), 2.5 x 10(-6), and 7.5 x 10(-5) L/mol/s.
   The first reversible reaction step converting triglycerides to
   diglycerides was found to be the rate limiting step. Activation energy
   for this step was 120 kJ/mol. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{ODEP-DPS: Ontology-driven engineering process for the collaborative
   development of semantic data providing services}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1563-1579}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context: Data services are services that handle operations involving the
   management of data. A problem with data services is that their
   interfaces are defined by their syntax alone. Consequently, Data
   Providing Services (DPSs) have been proposed to explicitly define
   semantics using ontologies for services that only retrieve data.
   However, the semantic annotations of DPSs are developed as afterthoughts
   to deployed data services.
   Objective: The objective of this work is to present a DPS development
   process that considers all of a DPS's dimensions including its data
   acquisition logic, syntax and semantics thus addressing the issue of
   semantic annotations developed as afterthoughts. This shall decrease the
   cost of deploying and maintaining DPSs.
   Method: This paper contributes a holistic and collaborative process -
   ODEP-DPS - for the development of DPSs. It is holistic as it considers
   both semantics and syntax from requirements to implementation. And it is
   collaborative as it separates responsibilities between the roles of
   those who require the data and those who own them. The process is to be
   ontology-driven as an ontological model shall be utilized through each
   phase of the process; it shall formalize the requirements domain, be
   used as a basis for the syntactic data model, and serve as the domain
   ontology for annotating the deployed DPSs.
   Results: This paper proposes the ODEP-DPS development process, in
   addition to defining three artefacts used throughout the process. In
   particular, a message descriptor is defined that binds semantics and
   syntax into a single reusable unit. A comprehensive definition of a DPS
   is also provided. ODEP-DPS is evaluated using a real-life case study
   from a mental health institution.
   Conclusion: This study contributes a holistic and collaborative
   development process that provides an end-to-end solution for the
   development of semantic data providing services. It addresses semantics
   being developed as afterthoughts by tightly coupling semantics and
   syntax. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   exhibit high mechanical strength and flexibility even after being
   annealed at 800 degrees C. Electrochemical properties of the hybrid
   papers are strongly dependent on the CNT/GN ratios. Highest lithium ion
   storage capacities were obtained in the paper with a CNT/GN ratio of
   2:1. The initial reversible specific capacities are similar to 375 mAh
   g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). The capacities remain above 330 mAh g(-1) after
   100 cycles, which are about 100 mAh g(-1) higher than those of the
   graphene paper with nearly the same mass. The improved capacities were
   attributed to the contribution of the CNTs, which prevent restacking of
   the GNS, increase cross-plane electric conductivity of the paper and
   simultaneously, store Li ions. These results suggest that graphene-CNT
   hybrid paper has a high potential to be used as collector and binder
   free anodes for lithium ion batteries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The removal of pharmaceutical micropollutant 4-isobutylacetophenone
   (4-IBAP) from water using immobilized solvent was investigated. In the
   first part, extraction performance of flat membrane sheets with two
   immobilized solvents, a green solvent (canola oil) and octanol, was
   characterized in batch operation. Sodium hydroxide (approximate to 0.1
   M) solution was used to regenerate the saturated sheets with 4-IBAP.
   Experiments were conducted with varying aqueous feed pH, initial aqueous
   concentration of 4-IBAP, and the initial concentration of sodium
   hydroxide. While octanol had a faster initial extraction rate K-ov =
   1.83 x 10(-7) m/s of 4-IBAP compared to canola oil, the flat sheet
   impregnated with canola oil exhibited better renewal capacity rinsing
   with NaOH stripping solution with mass transfer coefficient of 1.33 x
   10(-7) m/s in repeated experiments. In the second part, continuous
   extraction of 4-IBAP in the immobilized solvent and simultaneous
   regeneration of the solvent were carried out in a hollow fiber membrane
   contactor. Canola oil was impregnated into the pores of the membrane to
   extract 4-IBAP from the aqueous phase passing through the shell side of
   the fiber with simultaneous regeneration of the immobilized solvent
   using a 0.1 M NaOH stripping solution passing through the lumen of the
   fibers. Using this continuous membrane process with a green solvent,
   about 70-100 mL of canola oil removed an average of 80\% of 4-IBAP from
   40 L of water. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity between brain regions during swallowing tasks is
   still not well understood. Understanding these complex interactions is
   of great interest from both a scientific and a clinical perspective. In
   this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was utilized to
   study brain functional networks during voluntary saliva swallowing in
   twenty-two adult healthy subjects (all females, 23:1 +/- 1:52 years of
   age). To construct these functional connections, we computed mean
   partial correlation matrices over ninety brain regions for each
   participant. Two regions were determined to be functionally connected if
   their correlation was above a certain threshold. These correlation
   matrices were then analyzed using graph-theoretical approaches. In
   particular, we considered several network measures for the whole brain
   and for swallowing-related brain regions. The results have shown that
   significant pairwise functional connections were, mostly, either local
   and intra-hemispheric or symmetrically inter-hemispheric. Furthermore,
   we showed that all human brain functional network, although varying in
   some degree, had typical small-world properties as compared to regular
   networks and random networks. These properties allow information
   transfer within the network at a relatively high efficiency.
   Swallowing-related brain regions also had higher values for some of the
   network measures in comparison to when these measures were calculated
   for the whole brain. The current results warrant further investigation
   of graph-theoretical approaches as a potential tool for understanding
   the neural basis of dysphagia.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the synthesis, characterization and environmental
   applications of nitrogen doped TiO2 photocatalyst in the form of powder
   and film. N-TiO2 photocatalysts were synthesized via the hydrolysis of
   titanium tetraisopropoxide using urea as the nitrogen source. The
   crystalline structure, particle size and specific surface area of the
   resultant N-TiO2 nanoparticles were investigated by x-ray powder
   diffraction and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The results showed
   that a mixture of anatase and brookite phases was formed at pH 1 after
   annealing the powder at 450 degrees C for 4 h, in contrast to a pure
   anatase phase at pH 3. UV-vis spectral characterization showed that the
   absorption region of the as-prepared N-TiO2 was extended to the visible
   light region. Stable sols could be achieved by controlling the molar
   ratio of water-to-titanium precursor and pH of the sols. During the
   photocatalytic test, in comparison to the standard commercial
   photocatalyst Evonik-Degussa P25 and home-made bare TiO2 nanoparticles,
   the N-TiO2 particles exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance for
   degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye. The visible light induced
   photocatalytic inactivation of the obtained nanopowders and nanofilms on
   bacteria (Escherichia coli) was evaluated. The N-TiO2 nanomaterials
   showed higher bactericidal activity under visible light irradiation.}},

Abstract = {{It is essential to capture carbon dioxide from flue gas because it is
   considered one of the main causes of global warming. Several materials
   and different methods have been reported for CO2 capturing including
   adsorption onto zeolites and porous membranes, as well as absorption in
   amine solutions. All such methods require high energy input and high
   cost. A new class of porous materials called Metal Organic Frameworks
   (MOFs) exhibited excellent performance in extracting carbon dioxide from
   a gas mixture. In this study, the breakthrough curves for the adsorption
   of carbon dioxide on CPM-5 (crystalline porous materials) were obtained
   experimentally and theoretically using a laboratory-scale fixed-bed
   column at different experimental conditions such as feed flow rate,
   adsorption temperature, and feed concentration. It was found that the
   CPM-5 has a dynamic CO2 adsorption capacity of 11.9 wt \% (2.7 mmol/g)
   (corresponding to 8 mL/min, 298 K, and 25\% v/v CO2). The tested CPM-5
   showed an outstanding adsorption equilibrium capacity (e.g., 2.3 mmol/g
   (10.2 wt \%) at 298 K) compared to other adsorbents, which can be
   considered as an attractive adsorbent for separation of CO2 from flue
   gas.}},

Title = {{Core set analysis in inconsistent decision tables}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{241}},
Pages = {{138-147}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Core set inconsistency always causes confusion regarding how to select
   the proper core set for data reduction in inconsistent decision tables.
   In this paper, partitions of knowledge granules are introduced to
   analyze this inconsistency, and it is concluded that there are only
   three types of effective partitions: those that focus on exact
   information, those that focus on exact, partial, and negative
   information and those that focus on exact, partial, negative, and
   probabilistic information. All useful core sets are calculated
   systematically by converting the three types of partitions to
   corresponding discernibility matrices. Then, we define three types of
   rules, positive, inexact, and confidence rules, based on the three types
   of partitions. Using these rules, an intelligible rule-based strategy is
   proposed to select the proper core set for a practical application,
   which resolves the confusion caused by core set inconsistency and
   completes the process of data reduction. Experimental analysis and
   industrial results demonstrate the effectiveness of the selection
   strategy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Series compensation of transmission networks is being increasingly
   considered for integration of large wind farms to transfer bulk power.
   This article presents an extensive analysis of the potential of
   subsynchronous resonance in wind farms connected to a series-compensated
   line. The impact of symmetrical faults at different locations in the
   network is studied in detail. An equivalent circuit model is presented
   to calculate the resonant speeds of the aggregated induction generator
   for varying power outputs and series compensation levels. This study is
   validated by electromagnetic transient simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC
   software. Two sets of results are presented: one for wind farms of
   different megawatt ratings, and the other for a wind farm with different
   megawatt outputs. Scenarios are described for a wind farm connected to a
   line with a realistic level of series compensation, when a symmetrical
   fault at the wind plant terminal may result in high shaft torques.
   Recurrence of such faults can potentially lead to generator shaft
   failure due to cyclic fatigue. To mitigate subsynchronous resonance, a
   static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is proposed at the terminals of
   the wind farm. The STATCOM not only stabilizes the wind farm but also
   reduces the peak shaft torque, thereby obviating the potential of shaft
   damage due to subsynchronous resonance.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a new method for synthesis of faujasite nanoparticles was
   developed and tested for the catalytic activity. Zeolite Y
   nanoparticles, were prepared from dense aluminosilicate precursor by
   hydrothermal treatment at 100 degrees C. The influence of organic
   template agent and ageing times on the crystalline size of zeolite Y was
   studied. Among three silica sources of precipitated silica, fumed silica
   and silica sol used for the synthesis, precipitated silica was chosen
   due to low cost and the easy preparation from the soluble silicate, and
   between five quaternary ammonium salts, using tetramethylammonium
   hydroxide (TMA) as crystal size reduction agent gave rise to the desired
   results. The catalytic cracking activity of zeolites Y synthesized with
   different particle sizes was carried out in a fluidized bench-scale
   batch riser simulator reactor. The starting zeolites NaY of different
   particle sizes were subjected to two cycles of ion exchange treatment
   and subsequent calcination. The mean particle size of the supported
   zeolites Y was varied between 150 and 1,800 nm. The preparation of
   catalysts was conducted by mixing the calcined rare earth ion-exchanged
   (CREY) zeolite with amorphous silica-alumina as a matrix and silica sol
   as binder. The results of catalytic cracking of 1,3,5 TIPB
   (triisopropylbenzene) demonstrated the significant effect of size
   reduction of the starting zeolite Y on catalytic performance of the

Abstract = {{Butyl rubber-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) graft copolymers with high PEO
   content (40-83 wt \%) were synthesized by the functionalization and
   activation of the double bond moiety of butyl rubber containing high (7
   mol \%) isoprene content and subsequent reaction with PEO of different
   molecular weights from 750 to 5000 g/mol. The properties of these
   copolymers, along with other butyl rubber-PEO graft copolymers were
   studied in films and in aqueous solution. Despite the high PEO content,
   films of the copolymers were quite stable in water with respect to mass
   loss and were capable of releasing an encapsulated probe molecule in a
   manner that was dependent on the PEO content. At high PEO content they
   were resistant to the adhesion and growth of C2C12 cells. Despite the
   resistance of films to dissolution, it was possible to prepare nanosized
   aqueous assemblies via a THF-water exchange process and the sizes of the
   assemblies were tuned by their method of preparation. The assemblies
   were also able to encapsulate a probe molecule and were found to be
   nontoxic in vitro. Combined, this set of properties makes these new
   amphiphilic copolymers promising for a wide range of potential
   applications. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A:

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) bioactive organic-inorganic (O/I) hybrid fibrous
   scaffolds are attractive extracellular matrix (ECM) surrogates for bone
   tissue engineering. With the aim of regulating osteoblast gene
   expression in 3D, a new class of hybrid fibrous scaffolds with two
   distinct fiber diameters (260 and 600 nm) and excellent
   physico-mechanical properties were fabricated from tertiary
   (SiO2-CaO-P2O5) bioactive glass (BG) and poly (epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PCL) by in situ sol-gel and electrospinning process. The PCL/BG hybrid
   fibrous scaffolds exhibited accelerated wetting properties, enhanced
   pore sizes and porosity, and superior mechanical properties that were
   dependent on fiber diameter. Contrary to control PCL fibrous scaffolds
   that were devoid of bonelike apatite particles, incubating PCL/BG hybrid
   fibrous scaffolds in simulated body fluid (SBF) revealed bonelike
   apatite deposition. Osteoblast cells cultured on PCL/BG hybrid fibrous
   scaffolds spread with multiple attachments and actively proliferated
   suggesting that the low temperature in situ sol-gel and electrospinning
   process did not have a detrimental effect. Targeted bone-associated gene
   expressions by rat calvarial osteoblasts seeded on these hybrid
   scaffolds demonstrated remarkable spatiotemporal gene activation.
   Transcriptional-level gene expressions for alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
   osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and osteocalcin (OCN) were
   significantly higher on the hybrid fibrous scaffolds (p < 0.001) that
   were largely dependent on fiber diameter compared. Taken together, our
   results suggest that PCL/BG fibrous scaffolds may accelerate bone
   formation by providing a favorable microenvironment.}},

Abstract = {{The functionalization of polyisobutylene-co-isoprene, commonly referred
   to as butyl rubber, was investigated with the aim of preparing
   multifunctional materials. First, the acid catalyzed ring-opening of
   epoxidized butyl rubber was investigated. Ring-opening followed by
   elimination resulted in the formation of different dienes depending on
   the reaction conditions. It was possible to cleanly isolate the
   exo-diene, which readily undergoes Diels-Alder {[}4 + 2] cycloaddition
   reactions and it was demonstrated that this chemistry could be used to
   prepare multifunctional graft copolymers. For example, poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PEO) or polystyrene (PS) could be grafted while at the same time
   introducing carboxylic acid moieties along the polymer backbone, and
   both polymers could be simultaneously grafted to form mixed graft
   copolymers with tunable tensile properties. Furthermore, it was
   demonstrated that reaction with a dimaleimide led to efficient
   cross-linking of the rubber and this cross-linking could be reversed
   upon heating due to the thermoreversible nature of the Diels-Alder
   reaction. Thus, this chemistry allows for clean and facile synthesis of
   new rubber derivatives, opening possibilities for new rubber
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Transfer molding has been increasingly used to process polymer
   composites with various shaped nanoparticles, including platelet type
   nanoparticles. Platelet nanoparticles exhibit high aspect ratios (length
   to thickness); therefore their distributions in polymer matrix can be
   greatly affected by the flow trajectories in the mold. In present study,
   the clay platelet-polyethylene nanocomposite was prepared by transfer
   molding. The orientation of clay platelets developed during molding
   process was analyzed and measured with wide angle X-ray diffraction. Due
   to large velocity and shear stress gradients in the mold, the platelets
   caught in surface regions were rotated towards the flow direction and
   formed the oriented morphologies. With weaker shear stresses at the
   central region, the platelets were mostly randomly distributed. The
   shear stresses may be amplified locally at regions near the mold walls,
   which can further lead to or accelerate the orientations of clay
   particles. The orientation distribution was found to depend upon the
   clay fraction and sample size. The oriented platelets can be
   re-randomized through the annealing process. The orientation of clay
   platelets enhanced the orientation of polyethylene lamellae and caused
   shear band formation in composites when deformed.}},

Abstract = {{Background The functional effects of abnormal diffusing capacity for
   carbon monoxide (DLCO) in ex-smokers without chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) are not well understood.
   Objective We aimed to evaluate and compare well established clinical,
   physiological and emerging imaging measurements in ex-smokers with
   normal spirometry and abnormal DLCO with a group of ex-smokers with
   normal spirometry and DLCO and ex-smokers with Global Initiative for
   Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I COPD.
   Methods We enrolled 38 ex-smokers and 15 subjects with stage I COPD who
   underwent spirometry, plethysmography, St George's Respiratory
   Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6 min Walk Test (6MWT), x-ray CT and
   hyperpolarised helium-3 (He-3) MRI. The 6MWT distance (6MWD), SGRQ
   scores, He-3 MRI apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and CT
   attenuation values below -950 HU (RA(950)) were evaluated.
   Results Of 38 ex-smokers without COPD, 19 subjects had abnormal DLCO
   with significantly worse ADC (p=0.01), 6MWD (p=0.008) and SGRQ (p=0.01)
   but not RA950 (p=0.53) compared with 19 ex-smokers with normal DLCO.
   Stage I COPD subjects showed significantly worse ADC (p=0.02), RA950
   (p=0.0008) and 6MWD (p=0.005), but not SGRQ (p=0.59) compared with
   subjects with abnormal DLCO. There was a significant correlation for
   He-3 ADC with SGRQ (r=0.34, p=0.02) and 6MWD (r=-0.51, p=0.0002).
   Conclusions In ex-smokers with normal spirometry and CT but abnormal
   DLCO, there were significantly worse symptoms, 6MWD and He-3 ADC
   compared with ex-smokers with normal DLCO, providing evidence of the
   impact of mild or early stage emphysema and a better understanding of
   abnormal DLCO and hyperpolarised He-3 MRI in ex-smokers without COPD.}},

Abstract = {{Based on logs of ten wells in the El-Wastani gas field, onshore Nile
   Delta, Egypt, petrophysical evaluation for the Upper-Miocene Qawasim
   Formation and Abu Madi Formation in the El-Wastani gas field was
   accomplished. The lithology of these formations was analyzed using cross
   plots of logging parameters, and petrophysical parameters including
   shale volume, porosity, water saturation and hydrocarbon pore volume
   were assessed. The Neutron/Density, Neutron/Gamma-ray and
   Litho-saturation cross plots of the wells show that the main lithology
   of the Lower Abu Madi unit is sandstone with shale intercalations, while
   the lithology of the Qawasim Formation is mainly composed of shale with
   sandstone intercalations. The cut-offs of shale volume, porosity and
   water saturation for productive hydrocarbon pay zones are 50\%, 10\% and
   70\%, respectively, which were got based on cross-plots and Gamma-ray
   log data. Contour maps for parameters such as net pay thickness, average
   porosity, shale volume and water saturation were prepared and it is
   found out that the Abu Madi Formation and Qawasim Formation in the study
   area have promising reservoir characteristics; A prospective region for
   gas accumulation trends northwest-southeast in the study area,
   especially favorable in the central part.}},

Title = {{Non-axisymmetric annular curtain stability}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A stability analysis of non-axisymmetric annular curtain is carried out
   for an axially moving viscous jet subject in surrounding viscous gas
   media. The effect of inertia, surface tension, gas-to-liquid density
   ratio, inner-to-outer radius ratio, and gas-to-liquid viscosity ratio on
   the stability of the jet is studied. In general, the axisymmetric
   disturbance is found to be the dominant mode. However, for small
   wavenumber, the non-axisymmetric mode is the most unstable mode and the
   one likely observed in reality. Inertia and the viscosity ratio for
   non-axisymmetric disturbances show a similar stability influence as
   observed for axisymmetric disturbances. The maximum growth rate in
   non-axisymmetric flow, interestingly, appears at very small wavenumber
   for all inertia levels. The dominant wavenumber increases (decreases)
   with inertia for non-axisymmetric (axisymmetric) flow. Gas-to-liquid
   density ratio, curvature effect, and surface tension, however, exhibit
   an opposite influence on growth rate compared to axisymmetric
   disturbances. Surface tension tends to stabilize the flow with
   reductions of the unstable wavenumber range and the maximum growth rate
   as well as the dominant wavenumber. The dominant wavenumber remains
   independent of viscosity ratio indicating the viscosity ratio increases
   the breakup length of the sheet with very little influence on the size
   of the drops. The range of unstable wavenumbers is affected only by
   curvature in axisymmetric flow, whereas all the stability parameters
   control the range of unstable wavenumbers in non-axisymmetric flow.
   Inertia and gas density increase the unstable wavenumber range, whereas
   the radius ratio, surface tension, and the viscosity ratio decrease the
   unstable wavenumber range. Neutral curves are plotted to separate the
   stable and unstable domains. Critical radius ratio decreases linearly
   and nonlinearly with the wavenumber for axisymmetric and
   non-axisymmetric disturbances, respectively. At smaller Weber numbers, a
   wider unstable domain is predicted for non-axisymmetric modes. For both
   axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes, the disturbance frequency is
   found to be the same and equal to the negative of axial wavenumber.
   Finally, comparison between theory and existing experiment leads to good
   qualitative agreement. A more accurate comparison is not possible given
   the difference in flow conditions. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Today's power grid is facing many challenges due to increasing load
   growth, aging of existing power infrastructures, high penetration of
   renewable, and lack of fast monitoring and control. Utilizing recent
   developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the
   power-distribution level, various smart-grid applications can be
   realized to achieve reliable, efficient, and green power. Interoperable
   exchange of information is already standardized in the globally accepted
   smart-grid standard, IEC 61850, over the local area networks (LANs). Due
   to low installation cost, sufficient data rates, and ease of deployment,
   the industrial wireless LAN technologies are gaining interest among
   power utilities, especially for less critical smart distribution network
   applications. Extensive work is carried out to examine the wireless LAN
   (WLAN) technology within a power distribution substation. The first
   phase of the work is initiated with the radio noise interference
   measurements at 27.6- and 13.8-kV distribution substations, including
   circuit breaker switching operations. For a detailed investigation, the
   hardware prototypes of WLAN-enabled IEC 61850 devices are developed
   using industrial embedded systems, and the performance of smart
   distribution substation monitoring, control, and protection applications
   is analyzed for various scenarios using a round trip-time of IEC 61850
   application messages. Finally, to examine the real-world field
   performance, the developed prototype devices are installed in the
   switchyard and control room of 27.6 power distribution substation, and
   testing results of various applications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an asynchronous bi-directional relay network, consisting of
   two single-antenna transceivers and multiple single-antenna relays,
   where the transceiver-relay paths are subject to different relaying
   and/or propagation delays. Such a network can be viewed as a multipath
   channel which can cause inter-symbol-interference (ISI) in the signals
   received by the two transceivers. Hence, we model such a communication
   scheme as a frequency selective multipath channel which produces ISI at
   the two transceivers, when the data rates are high. To tackle ISI, the
   transceivers can employ an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
   (OFDM) scheme to diagonalize the end-to-end channel. The relays use
   simple amplify-and-forward relaying, thereby materializing a distributed
   beamformer. For such a scheme, we propose two different algorithms,
   based on the max-min fair design approach, to calculate the subcarrier
   power loading at the transceivers as well as the relay beamforming
   weights. We develop computationally efficient solutions to these two
   approaches. Simulation results are presented to show that our proposed
   schemes outperform equal or maximum power allocation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Composite nanostrucutres of TiSi2Ox. coated nitrogen-doped carbon
   nanotubes (NCNTs) were synthesized by a combination of chemical vapor
   deposition (CVD) and magnetron sputtering processes. The synthesized
   nanostructures were used as supports for Pt catalyst for oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange memberane fuel cells
   (PEMFCs). An amorphous layer of TiSi2Ox with controlled thicknesses was
   sputtered on NCNTs and followed by post-treatment at high temperature
   (1000 degrees C, An-TiSi2Ox-NCNTs), inducing TiO2 nanoparticles of
   around 5 nm in diameter embedded in the amorphous layer. Further
   analyses via X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Ti K edge and Si K
   edge revealed the Ti atoms were in a TiO2 rutile environment and the Si
   atoms were in a SiO2 environment. Pt nanopartides with an average
   diameter of 3 nm were deposited on the composite support, and their
   electrochemical behaviors toward ORR were studied. It was revealed that,
   even with lower electrochemical surface area (ECSA), Pt/An-TiSi2Ox-NCNTs
   showed better catalytic activity toward ORR than Pt/NCNT catalysts. The
   origin of enhanced activity of Pt/An-TiSi2Ox-NCNTs was examined by high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and the X-ray
   absorption near edge structure spectra (XANES) of the deposited Pt
   nanoparticles.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{The Gumbel model is often used to fit annual maximum wind speed or wind
   velocity pressure. The commonly used fitting methods include the method
   of moments, the method of maximum likelihood, the method of L-moments,
   and the Lieblein BLUE (i.e., generalized least-squares method (GLSM)).
   Previously, the coefficients of the estimators for the latter method
   have not been available for large sample size, and the relative
   performance of the GLSM to other fitting methods such as the method of
   L-moments is unknown. In this study, we evaluate these coefficients for
   a sample size up to 100, and identify trends in the calculated
   coefficients. The relative performance of commonly used fitting methods
   for the Gumbel distribution, including the GLSM, is evaluated in terms
   of efficiency, bias, and root-mean square error. We illustrate their
   application and impact on the estimated return period values of the
   annual maximum wind speed for 14 locations in Canada. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Series compensation of transmission networks is being increasingly
   considered for integration of large wind farms to transfer bulk power.
   This paper presents the potential of subsynchronous resonance in large
   wind farms based on double-cage induction generators connected to a
   series-compensated line. A detailed linear state space model is
   presented for the wind plant and the transmission system. Eigenvalues
   are determined for a wide range of series compensation levels for
   various sizes of wind farms as well as a wind farm producing different
   power outputs. The potential of SSR involving both induction generator
   effect and torsional interaction is investigated in-depth. Eigen-value
   analysis results obtained through MATLAB simulations are validated by
   detailed electromagnetic transient simulation using PSCAD/EMTDC
   software. Studies are conducted for different commercially available
   double-cage induction generator-based wind turbines. SSR analysis in a
   realistic wind farm with identical wind turbine generators subjected to
   different wind speeds, and different sizes of wind turbine generators
   subjected to same wind speed are also carried out. It is shown that
   induction generator effect-based SSR can potentially occur for wind
   farms even at realistic levels of series compensation.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The increasingly popular performance-based design approach requires that
   soil-structure interaction (SSI) analysis become an integral part of the
   seismic evaluation. This is particularly important for structures with
   substantial embedment. The primary objectives of this study are twofold:
   (i) evaluate the SSI effects for buildings with a basement and (ii)
   evaluate the ability of two analytical methods to account for SSI
   effects in seismic design - an analytical solution for kinematic SSI and
   a nonlinear finite element model. Scaled model shaking table tests were
   performed on a model building with an embedded basement founded in a
   synthetic stiff clay deposit enclosed in a laminar soil container. The
   model structure used in this study comprised a simple
   single-degree-of-freedom structure with a modular box foundation
   designed to permit consideration of structures with different basement
   embedment depths. The experimental results showed that the ratio of
   effective period of the soil-structure system to that of the structure
   (T/T) decreased for the long-period structure and increased for the
   short-period structure, with increasing embedment. The results confirm
   the ability of the analytical techniques to predict with reasonable
   accuracy the SSI effects for buildings with embedded parts.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and validate an analytical technique to estimate the
   heating of metallic rods by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gradient
   fields to aid developers of MRI-compatible devices.
   Materials and Methods: Twelve rods (12.7 mm diameter, 127 mm long) were
   used. The magnetic field was provided by a custom-made water-cooled
   solenoid driven by a 1 kHz sinusoidal waveform with a 7.2 A peak
   current. The sample was insulated with polystyrene and the temperature
   measured using an MR-compatible thermocouple system (Sa1-E from Omega).
   Measurements were recorded using a National Instruments SCXI-1303. The
   AC/DC module of COMSOL 3.4 was used for finite element analysis of the
   power deposited.
   Results: Finite element analysis (FEA) showed good correspondence with
   the analytical estimates for the rod parallel to the field and then FEA
   was used to determine the scaling function for the rod perpendicular to
   the field. The experimental results showed good correlation with the
   theoretical estimate when the finite length of the test coil was
   accounted for.
   Conclusion: A new scaling function for the rod perpendicular to the
   field was developed. Heating in this orientation is double that of the
   parallel case. The results will aid developers of MRI-compatible devices
   in estimating heating before testing in the MRI. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging

   with computerized independent jaw collimation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To design, construct, and commission a set of
   computer-controlled motorized jaws for a micro-CT/RT system to perform
   conformal image-guided small animal radiotherapy.
   Methods: The authors designed and evaluated a system of custom-built
   motorized orthogonal jaws, which allows the delivery of off-axis
   rectangular fields on a GE eXplore CT 120 preclinical imaging system.
   The jaws in the x direction are independently driven, while the
   y-direction jaws are symmetric. All motors have backup encoders,
   verifying jaw positions. Mechanical performance of the jaws was
   characterized. Square beam profiles ranging from 2 x 2 to 60 x 60 mm(2)
   were measured using EBT2 film in the center of a 70 x 70 x 22 mm(3)
   solid water block. Similarly, absolute depth dose was measured in a
   solid water and EBT2 film stack 50 x 50 x 50 mm(3). A calibrated Farmer
   ion chamber in a 70 x 70 x 20 mm3 solid water block was used to measure
   the output of three field sizes: 50 x 50, 40 x 40, and 30 x 30 mm(2).
   Elliptical target plans were delivered to films to assess overall system
   performance. Respiratory-gated treatment was implemented on the system
   and initially proved using a simple sinusoidal motion phantom. All films
   were scanned on a flatbed scanner (Epson 1000XL) and converted to dose
   using a fitted calibration curve. A Monte Carlo beam model of the
   micro-CT with the jaws has been created using BEAMnrc for comparison
   with the measurements. An example image-guided partial lung irradiation
   in a rat is demonstrated.
   Results: The averaged random error of positioning each jaw is less than
   0.1 mm. Relative output factors measured with the ion chamber agree with
   Monte Carlo simulations within 2\%. Beam profiles and absolute depth
   dose curves measured from the films agree with simulations within
   measurement uncertainty. Respiratory-gated treatments applied to a
   phantom moving with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 5 mm showed improved
   beam penumbra (80\%-20\%) from 3.9 to 0.8 mm.
   Conclusions: A set of computer-controlled motorized jaws for a
   micro-CT/RT system were constructed with position reliably better than a
   tenth of a millimeter. The hardware system is ready for image-guided
   conformal radiotherapy for small animals with capability of
   respiratory-gated delivery. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{Microbial electrochemical cells (MXCs) using cation and anion exchange
   membranes (CEM and AEM) were tested in batch mode for ammonium recovery.
   Experimental results showed superior ammonium recovery of 61\% in
   CEM-MXC. Migration effect accounted for 61\% of the total ammonium
   recovery in CEM-MXC where other ammonium ions (39\%) were transferred by
   diffusion. Current density was significant for improving the recovery
   rate of ammonium nitrogen, but proton accumulation deteriorated current
   density in CEM-MXC. The dissolution of ammonia hydrolyzed by urea
   produces hydroxyl ions, which can neutralize protons in the anode and
   maintain high current density in CEM-MXC. However, anodic pH increased
   over 9 at high current density (>2 A/m(2)) in CEM-MXC fed by urea, which
   indicates that the rate of ammonia dissolution becomes faster than
   proton accumulation rate at high current density. Balancing
   proton-accumulating rate with ammonia dissolution rate in the anode is
   significant for improving ammonium recovery in CEM-MXC. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Laser micropolishing (L mu P) is an innovative part-finishing process
   that reduces machining roughness by melting a thin layer of material on
   the micromilled surface using a focused laser beam. The quality of the
   final polished surface is dependent upon the part material, initial
   surface topography and roughness, and the energy density of the beam.
   The focal offset distance (FOD) is one critical parameter that controls
   the amount of energy delivered to the workpiece. The impact of varying
   the FOD on final laser-polished surface quality is investigated by
   performing a series of experiments on carefully prepared AISI H13 test
   samples with known initial surface roughness and waviness due to the
   milled track periodicity. Three well-defined polishing regimes were
   observed when adjusting the FOD for a Q-switched Nd/YAG L mu P system
   between 1.3 and 2.9 mm. Given the same initial micromilled surface
   geometry, each L mu P regime (i.e., short FOD, < 1.8 mm; long FOD, > 2.2
   mm; and intermediate FOD) reduced the surface roughness and periodic
   waviness in a distinct manner. For a micromilled sample with a 33-mu m
   periodicity, the L mu P with FOD of > 2.2 mm was determined to be the
   most effective regime by improving surface quality by 39.7 \%. The
   affects of repetitive exposure to the beam and increasing the applied
   laser power on improving surface quality are also investigated for the 3
   L mu P regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The present study reports quantum yields for hydrogen production using a
   Pt modified titanium dioxide (DP25) photocatalyst in a slurry medium,
   under near-UV irradiation. The photocatalyst was prepared using the
   incipient wetness impregnation method. The modified photocatalyst
   exhibited a reduced energy band of 2.73 eV upon Pt addition. Experiments
   were performed in a Photo CREC Water II Reactor. This unit allows the
   establishment of macroscopic radiation balances. These irradiation
   balances showed a maximum LVREA (local volumetric rate of energy
   absorption) of 0.15 g/L. Regarding hydrogen formation via H-center dot
   radicals, the addition of a 2 vol.\% ethanol scavenger allowed achieving
   significant amounts of hydrogen free of oxygen. It was noticed that the
   rate of hydrogen formation in the presence of ethanol is a function of
   the pH of the water solution. It was also observed that the calculated
   7.8\% quantum efficiency showed good degree of photon utilization and
   confirmed the value of the Pt modified TiO2 photocatalyst and Photo CREC
   Water II Unit set up for hydrogen production, via water splitting. (C)

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of myocardial ischemia are examined from the standpoint
   of the neural control system of the heart, a hierarchy of three neuronal
   centers residing in central command, intrathoracic ganglia, and
   intrinsic cardiac ganglia. The basis of the investigation is the premise
   that while this hierarchical control system has evolved to deal with
   ``normal{''} physiological circumstances, its response in the event of
   myocardial ischemia is unpredictable because the singular circumstances
   of this event are as yet not part of its evolutionary repertoire. The
   results indicate that the harmonious relationship between the three
   levels of control breaks down, because of a conflict between the
   priorities that they have evolved to deal with. Essentially, while the
   main priority in central command is blood demand, the priority at the
   intrathoracic and cardiac levels is heart rate. As a result of this
   breakdown, heart rate becomes less predictable and therefore less
   reliable as a diagnostic guide as to the traumatic state of the heart,
   which it is commonly used as such following an ischemic event. On the
   basis of these results it is proposed that under the singular conditions
   of myocardial ischemia a determination of neural control indexes in
   addition to cardiovascular indexes has the potential of enhancing
   clinical outcome.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{The import of proteins into the nucleus in response to drought is
   critical for mediating the reprogramming of gene expression that leads
   to drought tolerance. However, regulatory mechanisms involved in nuclear
   protein import remain largely unknown. Here, we have identified an
   Arabidopsis gene (AtKPNB1) as a homolog of human KPNB1 (importin 1).
   AtKPNB1 was expressed in multiple organs, and the protein was localized
   in the cytoplasm and nucleus. AtKPNB1 was able to facilitate nuclear
   import of a model protein. Null mutation of AtKPNB1 delayed development
   under normal growth conditions and increased sensitivity to abscisic
   acid (ABA) during seed germination and cotyledon development.
   Inactivation of AtKPNB1 increased stomatal closure in response to ABA,
   reduced the rate of water loss, and substantially enhanced drought
   tolerance. AtKPNB1 interacted with several importin proteins,
   nucleoporin AtNUP62, and the Arabidopsis Ran proteins. Inactivation of
   AtKPNB1 did not affect the ABA responsiveness or the expression level or
   subcellular localization of ABI1, ABI2 or ABI5, key regulators of the
   ABA signaling pathway. Moreover, phenotypic analysis of epistasis
   revealed that AtKPNB1 modulates the ABA response and drought tolerance
   through a pathway that is independent of ABI1 and ABI5. Collectively,
   our results show that AtKPNB1 is an Arabidopsis importin that functions
   in ABA signaling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an inverse Gaussian process-based model to
   characterize the growth of the depth of corrosion defects on underground
   energy pipelines based on inspection data. The model is formulated in a
   hierarchical Bayesian framework, which allows consideration of
   uncertainties from different sources. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) simulation techniques are used to evaluate the probabilistic
   characteristics of the model parameters by incorporating the defect
   depths reported by multiple in-line inspections (ILIs) as well as the
   prior knowledge about these parameters. The bias and random scattering
   error associated with the ILI tool as well as the correlation between
   the random scattering errors associated with different ILL tools are
   considered in the analysis. An example involving real ILL data collected
   from an in-service pipeline is employed to illustrate the application of
   the growth model. The results indicate that the model in general can
   predict the growth of corrosion defects reasonably well. The proposed
   model can be used to facilitate the development and application of
   reliability-based pipeline corrosion management. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A series of stress-controlled and undrained cyclic triaxial tests were

   that the axial strain, excess pore water pressure, and damping ratio
   increase with the number of loading cycles, whereas the effective stress
   and dynamic shear modulus decrease with increasing number of loading
   cycles. The effect of void ratio on shear modulus was significant in the
   small strain range, and thereafter, the effect was not significant among
   the tailings studied. It was also observed that the cyclic strength of
   the tailings varies with the type of dominant clay mineral present in

Abstract = {{The microalgae Chlorella vulgaris produce lipids that after extraction
   from cells can be converted into biodiesel. However, these lipids cannot
   be efficiently extracted from cells due to the presence of the
   microalgae cell wall, which acts as a barrier for lipid removal when
   traditional extraction methods are employed. Therefore, a microalgae
   system with high lipid productivity and thinner cell walls could be more
   suitable for lipid production from microalgae. This study addresses the
   effect of culture conditions, specifically carbon dioxide and sodium
   nitrate concentrations, on biomass concentration and the ratio of lipid
   productivity/cellulose content. Optimization of culture conditions was
   done by response surface methodology. The empirical model for biomass
   concentration (R2=96.0\%) led to a predicted maximum of 1123.2mgdwL-1
   when carbon dioxide and sodium nitrate concentrations were 2.33\% (v/v)
   and 5.77mM, respectively. For lipid productivity/cellulose content ratio
   (R2=95.2\%) the maximum predicted value was 0.46 (mglipidL-1day-1)(mg
   cellulose mg biomass-1)-1 when carbon dioxide concentration was 4.02\%
   (v/v) and sodium nitrate concentration was 3.21mM. A common optimum
   point for both variables (biomass concentration and lipid
   productivity/cellulose content ratio) was also found, predicting a
   biomass concentration of 1119.7mgdwL-1 and lipid productivity/cellulose
   content ratio of 0.44 (mglipidL-1day-1)(mg cellulose mg biomass-1)-1 for
   culture conditions of 3.77\% (v/v) carbon dioxide and 4.01mM sodium
   nitrate. The models were experimentally validated and results supported
   their accuracy. This study shows that it is possible to improve lipid
   productivity/cellulose content by manipulation of culture conditions,
   which may be applicable to any scale of bioreactors. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{130-139}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We report a method for controllably fabricating a structurally stable
   array of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with greatly enhanced
   surface area for catalyst loading as compared with a vertically aligned
   MWCNT forest. These structures may provide increased electrocatalytic
   activity for methanol oxidation reactions and oxygen reduction reactions
   in fuel cells. Potentiodynamic pretreatment is shown to allow the
   controlled restructuring of a vertically aligned MWCNT forest on a
   silicon substrate into walled domains of honeycomb-like polygons.
   Electrochemical parameters, such as the potential scanning ranges and
   cycles, were found to be capable of tuning the carbon nanotube surface
   interaction with a solvent and thereby the density and homogeneity of
   walled-domains that form under solvent dilation stress. Confocal Raman
   microspectroscopy with a spatial resolution of 200 nm was used to
   characterize these assemblies along with scanning electron microscopy
   and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The MWCNTs in general retained their
   pristine structural characteristics except in places where they were
   bent, which showed a slightly reduced wall thickness. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Catalytic cracking reactions exhibit complex pathways because of the
   simultaneous reactions and transport phenomena taking place. In
   Fluidized-bed Catalytic Cracking (FCC), fast reactions take place
   concurrently with mass transport at the gas-solid interphases and inside
   the catalyst particles. In addition, the phenomenon known as
   ``deactivation{''} is involved, with this leading to a selective
   decrease of reaction rates. Deactivation is associated to coke formation
   on the catalyst's external and internal surfaces. Since coke deposition
   blocks chemical species accessibility to catalyst active sites, located
   inside micropores, both fast primary reactions and slow secondary
   reactions are affected. This behaviour can be evaluated using the
   Thiele's modulus for each reaction involved. The Thiele's modulus is a
   function of the chemical species effective diffusivity and intrinsic
   kinetic parameters. This work reports the experimental evaluation of
   specific surface area and cumulative pore volume distribution of a
   commercial equilibrium catalyst, prior and after catalytic cracking of
   1,3,5-tri-iso-prophyl benzene (TIPB). Observed changes in TIPB
   conversion and cracked product distribution are correlated with coke
   deposition. It is found that catalyst activity decay is strongly related
   to the accessibility of hydrocarbon species to the catalyst inner
   micropore network; therefore an activity decay model is postulated based
   on micropore volume fraction changes, this approach allows explaining
   the reduction of cracking reaction rates. The methodology described can
   be extended to the cracking of other hydrocarbon molecules on FCC
   catalysts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{771-774}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, we study the problem of joint power allocation and
   channel design for an active link which conveys information from a
   source to a destination through multiple orthogonal subchannels. In such
   a link, the power can be injected into the channel not only at the
   source but also at each subchannel. For such a parallel channel, we
   study the problem of sum-rate maximization under the assumption that the
   source power as well as the total power of the active channel are
   limited. Although this problem is not convex, we present an efficient
   solution to this sum-rate maximization. An interesting aspect of this
   solution is that it requires only a subset of the subchannels to be
   active and the remaining subchannels should be turned off. This is in
   contrast with passive parallel channels with equal subchannel
   signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs), where water-filling solution to the
   sum-rate maximization under a source total power constraint leads to an
   equal power allocation among all subchannels. Furthermore, we prove that
   the number of active subchannels depends on the product of the source
   and channel powers. We also prove that if the total power available to
   the source and to the channel is limited, then in order to maximize the
   sum-rate via optimal power allocation to the source and to the active
   channel, half of the total available power should be allocated to the
   source and the remaining half should be allocated to the active channel.}},

   acoustic resonant elements has been proposed, which generated similar

   particle movements in the structural microchannel were investigated and
   particle focusing was also achieved. The proposed particle focusing

Abstract = {{The adsorption equilibrium and diffusion of CO2 in CPM-5 (crystalline
   porous materials) were experimentally studied using a volumetric
   approach at three different temperatures 273, 298, and 318 K and gas
   pressures up to 105 kPa. The Freundlich adsorption equilibrium model was
   applied to correlate the adsorption isotherms, and the classical
   microspore diffusion model was applied to obtain the adsorption kinetic
   curves and diffusivity of CO2 in CPM-5. The selectivity of CO2 over N-2
   was estimated from the single component isotherms at conditions relevant
   to post combustion applications (0.15 bar P-CO2 and 0.75 bar p(N2)). It
   was found that at pressures up to 105 kPa, the CPM-5 adsorbent has CO2
   adsorption capacity of 3 mmol/g, 2.3 mmol/g, at 273 K and 298 K,
   respectively, which is significantly higher than those of MOF-5 under
   the same conditions. The selectivity factor was 14.2 and 16.1 at 273 and
   298 K, respectively. The CO2 diffusivity in CPM-5, estimated from the
   adsorption kinetic data measured at low pressures, are 1.86 x 10(-12)
   m(2)/s, 7.04 x 10(-12) m(2)/s, and 7.87 x 10(-12) m(2)/s at 273 K, 298 K
   and 318 K, respectively. The initial isosteric heat of adsorption of CO2
   on the CPM-5 is 36.1 kJ/mol. CPM-5 shows attractive adsorption
   properties as an adsorbent for separation of CO2 from flue gas. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Ceramic coatings were created on the surface of 6061 aluminum alloy
   using a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process employing a pulsed
   direct current (DC) power mode in an alkaline electrolyte. The effect of
   electrical parameters including frequency and duty cycle on the
   microdischarge behavior and coating growth was investigated at constant
   current. Surface features of coatings were studied using scanning
   electron microscopy. Energy dispersive spectroscopy was employed to
   investigate elemental distribution on the coating surfaces and
   cross-sections. Applying lower duty cycles was found to result in
   increased breakdown voltages and microdischarges with higher spatial
   density and lower intensity. Further, applying a lower duty cycle was
   also found to promote the uniformity of silicon distribution in the
   coating. Based on these new findings, a new conceptual model is proposed
   to explain the concentration distribution of Si on the surface of
   coatings prepared at different duty cycles. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{The attachment of the sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) onto
   iron oxide and various silicate substrates in aqueous solution as a
   function of salt concentration and pH was studied by atomic force
   microscopy-based force spectroscopy (AFM) and quartz-crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Both ionic strength
   and cation valency were found to influence substrate binding. Notably,
   QCM-D experiments strongly suggested that the solubility of CMC is
   directly impacted by the presence of CaCl2. Such data are critical for
   the design of new molecules for stabilizing mineral floc dispersions and
   for assessing the mobility of CMC-coated particles in the subsurface.
   Modeling of AFM data with an extended Ohshima theory showed that van der
   Waals and steric forces played a major role in the interactions between
   CMC and mineral substrates, and that hydration forces were also
   important. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emergency department access block is an urgent problem faced by many
   public hospitals today. When access block occurs, patients in need of
   acute care cannot access inpatient wards within an optimal time frame. A
   widely held belief is that access block is the end product of a long
   causal chain, which involves poor discharge planning, insufficient bed
   capacity, and inadequate admission intensity to the wards. This paper
   studies the last link of the causal chainthe effect of admission
   intensity on access block, using data from a metropolitan hospital in
   Australia. We applied several modern statistical methods to analyze the
   data. First, we modeled the admission events as a nonhomogeneous Poisson
   process and estimated time-varying admission intensity with penalized
   regression splines. Next, we established a functional linear model to
   investigate the effect of the time-varying admission intensity on
   emergency department access block. Finally, we used functional principal
   component analysis to explore the variation in the daily time-varying
   admission intensities. The analyses suggest that improving admission
   practice during off-peak hours may have most impact on reducing the
   number of ED access blocks. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{13}},

Abstract = {{We describe here a study demonstrating that the degradation time of
   self-immolative linear polymers is dependent on chain length. These
   materials are unique relative to most degradable polymers, in that they
   undergo end-to-end depolymerization in response to the cleavage of an
   end-cap. Although one of their cited attributes is a dependence of their
   degradation time on chain length, no conclusive study has been conducted
   to demonstrate and study this effect. In this work, using a linear
   self-immolative polymer backbone derived from alternating
   4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine based spacers,
   we show that there is a proportional relationship between chain length
   and depolymerization time. This is first accomplished using a series of
   oligomers synthesized using a convergent, iterative route and then
   applied to the polydisperse case on a set of polymers displaying varying
   molecular weights. We also report the first development and validation
   of a self-immolative degradation model relating monomer kinetics to
   polymer degradation and show its application in explaining oligomeric
   and polymeric degradation profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Acknowledging the relevance of social networks on (social) travel
   behaviour, the objective of this paper is to comparatively study the
   distance patterns between the home locations of social contacts.
   Analyses are based on five recent collections of personal network data
   from four countries: Canada, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Chile.
   Multilevel models, which explicitly account for the hierarchical
   structure of the data sets, are used to study the role of explanatory
   variables to understand the distance patterns of social contacts.
   Modelling results suggest that alters' characteristics (such as type of
   relationship, emotional closeness, and duration of the relationship) as
   well as personal network composition (alters with a certain relationship
   to the ego) constitute stronger predictors than an ego's
   socio-demographic information across these countries. In addition,
   comparative analyses suggest differences between countries on relevant
   key variables such as an ego's income and the ego-alter tie strength.

Abstract = {{Global Positioning System (GPS) total electron content (TEC)
   measurements, although highly precise, are often rendered inaccurate due
   to satellite and receiver differential code biases (DCBs). Calculated
   satellite DCB values are now available from a variety of sources, but
   receiver DCBs generally remain an undertaking of receiver operators and
   processing centers. A procedure for removing these receiver DCBs from
   GPS-derived ionospheric TEC at high latitudes, using Canadian Advanced
   Digital Ionosonde (CADI) measurements, is presented. Here, we will test
   the applicability of common numerical methods for estimating receiver
   DCBs in high-latitude regions and compare our CADI-calibrated GPS
   vertical TEC (vTEC) measurements to corresponding International GNSS
   Service IONEX-interpolated vTEC map data. We demonstrate that the bias
   values determined using the CADI method are largely independent of the
   topside model (exponential, Epstein, and alpha-Chapman) used. We further
   confirm our results via comparing bias-calibrated GPS vTEC with those
   derived from incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements. These CADI
   method results are found to be within 1.0 TEC units (TECU) of ISR
   measurements. The numerical methods tested demonstrate agreement varying
   from within 1.6 TECU to in excess of 6.0 TECU when compared to ISR
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has, for a considerable length
   of time, been considered promising for subsurface characterization
   activities at sites contaminated with dense, nonaqueous phase liquids
   (DNAPLs). The relatively few field studies available exhibit mixed
   results, and the technique has not yet become a common tool for mapping
   such contaminants or tracking mass reduction during their remediation.
   To help address this, a novel, coupled DNAPL-ERT numerical model was
   developed that can provide a platform for the systematic evaluation of
   ERT under a wide range of realistic, field-scale subsurface
   environments. The coupled model integrated a 3D multiphase flow model,
   which generates realistic DNAPL scenarios, with a 3D ERT forward model
   to calculate the corresponding resistivity response. Central to the
   coupling, and a key contribution, was a new linkage between the main
   hydrogeologic parameters (including hydraulic permeability, porosity,
   clay content, groundwater salinity and temperature, and air, water, and
   DNAPL contents evolving with time) and the resulting bulk electrical
   resistivity by integration of a variety of published relationships.
   Sensitivity studies conducted for a single node compared well to
   published correlations and for a field-scale domain demonstrated that
   the model is robust and sensitive to heterogeneity in DNAPL distribution
   and soil structure. A field-scale simulation of a DNAPL release and its
   subsequent remediation, monitored by ERT surface surveys, demonstrated
   that ERT is promising for mapping DNAPL mass reduction. The developed
   model provides a cost-effective avenue to test optimum ERT data
   acquisition, inversion, and interpretative tools, which should assist in
   deploying ERT strategically at contaminated sites.}},

Abstract = {{Rechargeable lithium-air (O-2) batteries have received much attention
   due to their extremely high theoretical energy densities, which far
   exceeds that of current lithium-ion batteries. The considerable high
   energy densities come from (i) pure metal lithium as anode and (ii) the
   cathode oxidant, oxygen, which comes from the surrounding air. However,
   there are still many scientific and technical challenges especially
   nanomaterial challenges to overcome before it turns into reality. In
   this review, the fundamental principles and understanding of the
   electrochemical reaction in the aprotic lithium-air batteries are first
   presented. We emphasized on the discussion of the nanomaterial's issues
   which prevent their practical implementation, including the material
   status and challenges from cathode, electrolyte, anode and other
   components. These problems will be discussed in detail and possible
   solutions are also suggested. Finally, we explore future research
   directions in the field of aprotic rechargeable lithium-air batteries.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new concept for reducing early-age shrinkage in
   hydrating cement-based materials. The concept consists of adding a
   partially hydrated cementitious material (PHCM) as a concrete admixture.
   The added PHCM stimulates the formation of a hydrated cement paste
   structure and provides microcrystals of hydration products, which act as
   passive internal restraining clusters within the fresh concrete. The
   passive restraining system thus developed resists bulk deformations,
   leading to lower shrinkage. In this paper, the concept of a
   self-restraining shrinkage system is proposed and discussed, and its
   effect is examined experimentally including compressive strength,
   setting time, heat of hydration, autogenous shrinkage, thermal analysis,
   nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   micrograph analysis. Experimental results indicate a high potential for
   producing self-restraining shrinkage concrete. In particular, using
   concrete returned to batch plants and intended for disposal as a PHCM,
   with sufficient precautions to maintain the quality of concrete, can
   yield significant economical and environmental benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization, treatment and releases of eight polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) congeners and sixteen polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) in wastewater were evaluated along the treatment
   processes of a typical secondary treatment municipal sewage treatment
   plant (STP) (in Hefei City) situated the beside Nanfei River, East
   China. The findings showed that the average concentrations of the total
   PBDEs in raw wastewater and treated effluent were 188.578 and 36.884
   ng/L respectively. Brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) 209 congener, the
   predominant PBDE in the STP and Nanfei River, could be related to the
   discharge of car-industry-derived wastes. For PAHs, the average
   concentrations in raw wastewater and treated effluent were 5758.8 and
   2240.4 ng/L respectively, with naphthalene, benzo{[}a]pyrene and
   indeno{[}1,2,3-c,d]pyrene being detected at the highest concentrations.
   PAHs mainly originate from the combustion of biomass/coal and petroleum.
   The STP reduced about 80\% of the PBDEs and 61\% of the PAHs, which were
   eliminated mainly by sedimentation processes. The removal rates of
   PBDEs/PAHs increased with the increase of their solid-water partitioning
   coefficients. Accordingly, the STP's effluent, containing some PBDE
   congeners (e.g., BDE 47, 99 and 209, etc.) and low-molecular-weight
   PAHs, could be an important contributor of these contaminants' input to
   Nanfei River. It resulted in a significant increase of PBDE/PAH
   concentrations and PAH toxicological risk in the river water downstream.
   About 4.040 kg/yr of PBDEs and 245.324 kg/yr of PAHs could be released
   into the Nanfei River. The current conventional wastewater treatment
   processes should be improved to remove the relatively
   low-molecular-weight PBDEs/PAHs more effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Kraft lignin (KL) was successfully depolymerized into polyols of
   moderately high hydroxyl number and yield with moderately low

   process parameters including reaction temperature, reaction time,
   NaOH/lignin ratio (w/w) and substrate concentration were investigated
   and the polyols/depolymerized lignins (DLs) obtained were characterized
   with GPC-UV, FTIR-ATR, H-1 NMR, Elemental \& TOC analyzer. The best
   operating conditions appeared to be at 250 degrees C, 1 h, and
   NaOH/lignin ratio approximate to 0.28 with 20 wt.\% substrate

   M-w approximate to 3310 g/mole), suitable for replacement of polyols in
   polyurethane foam synthesis. The overall \% carbon recovery under the
   above best conditions was similar to 90\%. A higher temperature favored
   reduced M-w of the polyols while a longer reaction time promoted

Abstract = {{The effect of tool orientation on the final surface geometry and quality
   in five-axis micro-milling of brass using ball-end mills is
   investigated. Straight grooves with a semicircular cross section are cut
   with different tool inclination and tilt angles, and the resulting
   surfaces are characterized using an optical profilometer and microscope.
   Micro-milling cutting forces are recorded synchronously with spindle
   electric current and cutting motions in order to investigate the
   correlation between the tool orientation and the achieved surface
   quality. Results of various cutting experiments and analysis of the
   final surface geometry show that varying the tool orientation reduces
   rubbing of the material at the bottom of the grooves, which often occurs
   in ball-end milling of brass, and improves the final surface quality.
   The experimental analysis for surface roughness shows that applying a
   tool inclination angle of 15A degrees can considerably improve the
   surface roughness at the bottom of the grooves. Analysis of static and
   averaged peak-to-valley (P-to-V) values of the cutting forces show that
   the static cutting force values are reduced by half when the tool
   inclination was increased from 0 to 15A degrees. P-to-V cutting force
   values in along-the-feed direction were also decreased in the inclined
   machining.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested the hypothesis that acute hyperglycemia reduces
   sciatic nerve blood flow in Sprague-Dawley rats. Anesthetized rats
   underwent cannulation of their right jugular vein (for
   anesthetic/nutrient/drug infusion) and right carotid artery (for
   continuous blood pressure measurement via pressure transducer). The left
   sciatic nerve was exposed and nerve blood velocity (NBV) was assessed
   from an arterial segment lying superficially along the sciatic nerve
   (Doppler ultrasound, 40 MHz). NBV and mean arterial pressure (MAP)
   values were collected, and an index of nerve vascular conductance (NVC)
   was established (NBV/MAP) at baseline and at 5, 10, 20, and 30 min (and
   80 min for insulin) following 1) low glucose infusion, 1 g/kg (50\%
   solution); 2) high glucose infusion, 3 g/kg; 3) high glucose infusion in
   the absence of a functioning pancreas; 4) euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
   clamp-insulin infusion (10 mU.kg(-1).min(-1); 0.4 IU/ml); 5) high
   glucose infusion + N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) infusion
   (30 mg/kg); and 6) L-NAME alone followed 20 min later by high glucose
   infusion. High glucose infusion increased NVC by similar to 120\%
   relative to baseline (P < 0.001), and this dilation was attenuated in
   rats without a functioning pancreas (i.e., without insulin secretion) (P
   = 0.004) and following L-NAME infusion (P = 0.011). Therefore, the
   vasodilation in rat sciatic nerve during glucose infusion was dependent
   upon the insulin response and acted through a nitric oxide synthase
   pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The Dines pressure tube anemometer was the primary wind speed recording
   instrument used in Australia until it was replaced by Synchrotac cup
   anemometers in the 1990s. Simultaneous observations of the gust wind
   speeds recorded using both types of anemometers during tropical cyclones
   have, however, raised questions about the equivalency of the gust wind
   speeds recorded using the two instruments. An experimental study of the
   response of both versions of the Dines anemometer used in Australia
   shows that the response of the anemometer is dominated by the motion of
   the float manometer used to record the wind speed. The amplitude
   response function shows the presence of two resonant peaks, with the
   amplitude and frequency of the peaks depending on the instrument version
   and the mean wind speed. Comparison of the gust wind speeds recorded
   using Dines and Synchrotac anemometers using random process and linear
   system theory shows that, on average, the low-speed Dines anemometer
   records values 2\%-5\% higher than those recorded using a Synchrotac
   anemometer under the same conditions, while the high-speed Dines
   anemometer records values 3\%-7\% higher, depending on the mean wind
   speed and turbulence intensity. These differences are exacerbated with
   the adoption of the WMO-recommended 3-s moving average gust wind speed
   when reporting the Synchrotac anemometer gust wind speeds, rising to
   6\%-12\% and 11\%-19\% for low- and high-speed Dines anemometers,
   respectively. These results are consistent with both field observations
   and an independent extreme value analysis of simultaneously observed
   gust wind speeds at seven sites in northern Australia.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the development of a Ni based oxygen carrier (OC)
   over La-modified and Co-doped gamma-Al2O3 suitable for a fluidized bed
   chemical-looping combustion (CLC) process. La is found to stabilize the
   bulk phase transformation of gamma-Al2O3 whereas Co minimizes the
   formation of irreducible bulk nickel aluminate. Apart from these
   beneficial effects, the reducibility and the structural properties of
   the prepared OCs are found to be modified by the different preparation
   methods used. The N-2 adsorption isotherm shows that gamma-Al2O3 retains
   its structural integrity in only one preparation method. Reducibility as
   determined by consecutive temperature programmed reduction and oxidation
   techniques resembles the chemical properties of delta- and theta-Al2O3
   for the other two preparation methods. However, no bulk phase change is
   detected for the three OCs using XRD. This suggests that the observed
   changes occur mainly at the molecularly thin surface layers of the OCs
   which display structural properties (geometric, electronic,
   coordination) significantly different from those of the bulk. The
   prepared OCs are also tested under CLC operating condition of the
   Chemical Reactor Engineering Center (CREC) fluidized Riser Simulator,
   using multiple reduction/oxidation cycles. Reactivity results obtained
   show expected reducibility, oxygen carrying capacity and stability with
   the three different preparation techniques. (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{Accurate detection of the human metaphase chromosome centromere is an
   important step in many chromosome analysis and medical diagnosis
   algorithms. The centromere location can be utilized to derive
   information such as the chromosome type, polarity assignment, etc.
   Methods available in the literature yield unreliable results mainly due
   to high variability of morphology in metaphase chromosomes and boundary
   noise present in the image. In this paper, we have proposed a
   multistaged algorithm which includes the use of discrete curve
   evolution, gradient vector flow active contours, functional
   approximation of curve segments, and support vector machine
   classification. The standard Laplacian thickness measurement algorithm
   was enhanced to incorporate both contour information as well as
   intensity information to obtain a more accurate centromere location. In
   addition to segmentation and width profile measurement, the proposed
   algorithm can also correct for sister chromatid separation in cell
   images. The proposed method was observed to be more accurate and
   statistically significant as compared to a centerline-based method when
   tested with 226 human metaphase chromosomes.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular occlusion remains the leading cause of death in Western
   countries, despite advances made in balloon angioplasty and conventional
   surgical intervention. Vascular surgery, such as CABG surgery,
   arteriovenous shunts, and the treatment of congenital anomalies of the
   coronary artery and pulmonary tracts, requires biologically responsive
   vascular substitutes. Autografts, particularly saphenous vein and
   internal mammary artery, are the gold-standard grafts used to treat
   vascular occlusions. Prosthetic grafts have been developed as
   alternatives to autografts, but their low patency owing to short-term
   and intermediate-term thrombosis still limits their clinical
   application. Advances in vascular tissue engineering technology-such as
   self-assembling cell sheets, as well as scaffold-guided and
   decellularized-matrix approaches-promise to produce responsive, living
   conduits with properties similar to those of native tissue. Over the
   past decade, vascular tissue engineering has become one of the
   fastest-growing areas of research, and is now showing some success in
   the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of the dynamics of the flow over a street canyon immersed in
   an atmospheric boundary layer is presented, using particle image
   velocimetry measurements in a wind tunnel. Care was taken to generate a
   1:200 model scale urban type boundary layer that is correctly scaled to
   the size of the canyon buildings. Using proper orthogonal decomposition
   (POD) of the velocity field and conditional averaging techniques, it is
   first shown that the flow above the opening of the canyon consists of a
   shear layer separating from the upstream obstacle, animated by a
   coherent flapping motion and generating large-scale vortical structures.
   These structures are alternately injected into the canyon or shed off
   the obstacle into the outer flow. It is shown that unsteady fluid
   exchanges between the canyon and the outer flow are mainly driven by the
   shear layer. Finally, using POD, the non-linear interaction between the
   large-scale structures of the oncoming atmospheric boundary layer and
   the flow over the canyon is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This research work presents a framework to build a hybrid expert
   recommendation system that integrates the characteristics of
   content-based recommendation algorithms into a social network-based
   collaborative filtering system. The proposed method aims at improving
   the accuracy of recommendation prediction by considering the social
   aspect of experts' behaviors. For this purpose, content-based profiles
   of experts are first constructed by crawling online resources. A
   semantic kernel is built by using the background knowledge derived from
   Wikipedia repository. The semantic kernel is employed to enrich the
   experts' profiles. Experts' social communities are detected by applying
   the social network analysis and using factors such as experience,
   background, knowledge level, and personal preferences. By this way,
   hidden social relationships can be discovered among individuals.
   Identifying communities is used for determining a particular member's
   value according to the general pattern behavior of the community that
   the individual belongs to. Representative members of a community are
   then identified using the eigenvector centrality measure. Finally, a
   recommendation is made to relate an information item, for which a user
   is seeking an expert, to the representatives of the most relevant
   community. Such a semantic social network-based expert recommendation
   system can provide benefits to both experts and users if one looks at
   the recommendation from two perspectives. From the user's perspective,
   she/he is provided with a group of experts who can help the user with
   her/his information needs. From the expert's perspective she/he has been
   assigned to work on relevant information items that fall under her/his
   expertise and interests.}},

Title = {{Temporal processing of self-motion: modeling reaction times for
   rotations and translations}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{228}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-62}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that differences in reaction times (RT) to
   self-motion depend not only on the duration of the profile, but also on
   the actual time course of the acceleration. We previously proposed
   models that described direction discrimination thresholds for rotational
   and translational motions based on the dynamics of the vestibular
   sensory organs (otoliths and semi-circular canals). As these models have
   the potential to describe RT for different motion profiles (e.g.,
   trapezoidal versus triangular acceleration profiles or varying profile
   durations), we validated these models by measuring RTs in human
   observers for a direction discrimination task using both translational
   and rotational motions varying in amplitude, duration and acceleration
   profile shape in a within-subjects design. In agreement with previous
   studies, amplitude and duration were found to affect RT, and
   importantly, we found an influence of the profile shape on RT. The
   models are able to fit the measured RTs with an accuracy of around 5 ms,
   and the best-fitting parameters are similar to those found from
   identifying the models based on threshold measurements. This confirms
   the validity of the modeling approach and links perceptual thresholds to
   RT. By establishing a link between vestibular thresholds for self-motion
   and RT, we show for the first time that RTs to purely inertial motion
   stimuli can be used as an alternative to threshold measurements for
   identifying self-motion perception models. This is advantageous, since
   RT tasks are less challenging for participants and make assessment of
   vestibular function less fatiguing. Further, our results provide strong
   evidence that the perceived timing of self-motion stimulation is largely
   influenced by the response dynamics of the vestibular sensory organs.}},

Abstract = {{An array of highly fluorinated polymerizable phosphonium salts (HFPPS)
   were synthesized from PH3 and utilized in UV-curable formulations.
   Inclusion of these salts at very low loading (0.1-1 wt \%) into
   hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA) resulted in hydrophobic surfaces. The water
   repellency was achieved with short C4F9 fluorocarbon appendages in the
   monomer as opposed to the bioaccumulative C8F17 appended polymers. The
   physical properties of these new monomers were also characterized. The
   molecular architecture of the monomers had a pronounced effect on both
   their physical properties along with the degree of hydrophobicity
   imparted in the polymer. Salts utilizing the
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion displayed excellent
   compatibility with HDDA, while the chloride salts were insoluble.
   Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) confirmed the
   presence of the HFPPS at the surface of the polymer coating. For the
   first time this demonstrates how these salts may be used to
   functionalize the surface of a UV-cured film with ionic species. (c)

Abstract = {{Catalytic ozone decomposition reaction was used to study the performance
   of a 76 mm i.d. and 10.2 m high gas-solid circulating fluidized bed
   (CFB) riser reactor. Optical fiber probes and an ultraviolet (UV) ozone
   analyzer were used to obtain comprehensive information about local solid
   holdup and ozone concentration profiles at different axial and radial
   positions. The operating conditions were at superficial gas velocities
   of 2-5 m/s and solid circulation rates of 50 and 100 kg/(m(2).s). Axial
   ozone concentration profiles significantly deviated from the plug-flow
   behavior, with most conversion occurring in the entrance region or flow
   developing zone of the riser reactor. Strong correlation was observed
   between the spatial distributions of solids and ozone; higher local
   solid holdups cause lower ozone concentrations due to greater reaction.
   Radial gradients of the reactant (ozone) concentrations increased with
   the height of the riser, and decreased with increasing superficial gas
   velocity and solid circulation rate. Contact efficiency, a measure of
   the interaction between gas and solid phases indicated high efficiency
   in the flow developing zone and decreased with increasing height in the
   fully developed region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines activities of scavengers in the waste management
   sector in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Data on socioeconomic
   activities and demographic characteristics of scavengers were obtained
   using a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire included basic
   information such as gender, age, level of education, residential status,
   number of working hours, alternative occupation, income level, type of
   material recovered, source of the material, processing of material, peak
   seasons for each material and uses of recovered material. Scavenging in
   Greater Accra is carried out mainly at landfill sites and commercial
   areas of the city, and is male dominated. Materials recovered include
   plastics and metals such as iron, copper and aluminium. On the average,
   scavengers earn between US \$7 and US \$17 per day depending on items
   recovered and market trends. Their average daily earnings surpass the US
   \$1 a day target for poverty reduction under the Millennium Development
   Goals. The activities of scavengers contribute to waste recovery and
   recycling through their sorting and cleaning activities. Local
   authorities in Ghana could improve waste recycling and resource
   utilization if they recognize scavengers of waste materials as important
   stakeholders in the waste management sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Homeostasis is essential for cell survival. However, homeostatic
   regulation of surface epithelia is poorly understood. The eye surface,
   lacking the cornified barrier of skin, provides an excellent model.
   Tears cover the surface of the eye and are deficient in dry eye, the
   most common eye disease affecting at least 5\% of the world's
   population. Only a tiny fraction of the tear proteome appears to be
   affected, including lacritin, an epithelium-selective mitogen that
   promotes basal tearing when topically applied to rabbit eyes. Here we
   show that homeostasis of cultured corneal epithelia is entirely
   lacritin-dependent and elucidate the mechanism as a rapid autophagic
   flux to promptly restore cellular metabolism and mitochondrial fusion in
   keeping with the short residence time of lacritin on the eye.
   Accelerated flux appears to be derived from lacritin-stimulated
   acetylation of FOXO3 as a novel ligand for ATG101 and coupling of
   stress-acetylated FOXO1 with ATG7(which remains uncoupled without
   lacritin) and be sufficient to selectively divert huntingtin mutant
   Htt103Q aggregates largely without affecting non-aggregated Htt25Q. This
   is in keeping with stress as a prerequisite for lacritin-stimulated
   autophagy. Lacritin targets the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan-1 via
   its C-terminal amino acids Leu(108)-Leu(109)-Phe(112) and is also
   available in saliva, plasma, and lung lavage. Thus, lacritin may promote
   epithelial homeostasis widely.}},

Title = {{`artificial' electron disequilibrium due to cone-beam CT density errors:
   implications for on-line adaptive stereotactic body radiation therapy of
   lung (vol 58, pg 4157, 2013)}},

Abstract = {{Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has rapidly become a clinically
   useful imaging modality for image-guided radiation therapy.
   Unfortunately, CBCT images of the thorax are susceptible to artefacts
   due to scattered photons, beam hardening, lag in data acquisition, and
   respiratory motion during a slow scan. These limitations cause dose
   errors when CBCT image data are used directly in dose computations for
   on-line, dose adaptive radiation therapy (DART). The purpose of this
   work is to assess the magnitude of errors in CBCT numbers (HU), and
   determine the resultant effects on derived tissue density and computed
   dose accuracy for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of lung
   cancer. Planning CT (PCT) images of three lung patients were acquired
   using a Philips multi-slice helical CT simulator, while CBCT images were
   obtained with a Varian On-Board Imaging system. To account for erroneous
   CBCT data, three practical correction techniques were tested: (1)
   conversion of CBCT numbers to electron density using phantoms, (2)
   replacement of individual CBCT pixel values with bulk CT numbers,
   averaged from PCT images for tissue regions, and (3) limited replacement
   of CBCT lung pixels values (LCT) likely to produce artificial lateral
   electron disequilibrium. For each corrected CBCT data set, lung SBRT
   dose distributions were computed for a 6 MV volume modulated arc therapy
   (VMAT) technique within the Philips Pinnacle treatment planning system.
   The reference prescription dose was set such that 95\% of the planning
   target volume (PTV) received at least 54 Gy (i. e. D95). Further, we
   used the relative depth dose factor as an a priori index to predict the
   effects of incorrect low tissue density on computed lung dose in regions
   of severe electron disequilibrium. CT number profiles from co-registered
   CBCT and PCT patient lung images revealed many reduced lung pixel values
   in CBCT data, with some pixels corresponding to vacuum (-1000 HU).
   Similarly, CBCT data in a plastic lung phantom were reduced by 200 HU
   compared with known CT number values. For the three patients, dose
   results using the CBCT number data registered with PCT showed a
   prescription dose reduction ranging from 4 to 13\% (D95 = 47 Gy).
   Therefore, accurate determination of lung density, especially for very
   low lung density (< 0.2 g cm(-3)) is essential, but difficult to achieve
   using the CBCT data. Applying corrective techniques (1) and (2) to CBCT
   patient data produced unacceptable dose differences. For one typical
   VMAT SBRT patient, the D95 for the corrected CBCT and BCT image-based
   plans differed by -4\% (D95 = 52 Gy) and 9\% (D95 = 59 Gy) compared to
   the co-registered PCT image-based plan. However, corrective technique
   (3) produced negligible dose differences comparing LCT and PCT
   imagebased plans. With regard to implementing on-line DART, dose errors
   must be minimized because they affect re-optimization decisions, and
   prevent accurate accumulation of the dose distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, gamma-polyglutamic acid (gamma-PGA) and chitosan (CS)
   nanoparticles were characterized as a carrier for the anti-cancer drug
   doxorubicin (DOX). Using ionic complexation between the positively
   charged DOX and the negatively charged polyelectrolyte gamma-PGA,
   DOX:gamma-PGA complexes were produced with an efficiency of
   approximately 99\%. SEM micrographs demonstrated that the complexation
   of gamma-PGA and DOX alone does not lead to the formation of
   nanoparticles and that the addition of a third component, chitosan, is
   required. Drug-loaded DOX:gamma-PGA:CS nanoparticles were produced with
   particle sizes ranging from similar to 150 to similar to 630 nm. The
   stability of the DOX:gamma-PGA:CS nanoparticles was examined by
   suspending the nanoparticles in different kinds of aqueous media. For
   the first time, in vitro studies with DOX-loaded nanoparticles
   demonstrated the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles against a human oral
   squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HN-5a). Non-drug-loaded gamma-PGA:CS
   nanoparticles did not display cytotoxic effects. It was shown that the
   encapsulated or surface-bound DOX did not lose its bioactivity and the
   prepared drug-loaded particles exhibited a considerable
   anti-proliferative activity against the human cancer cell line. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The results of constant strain rate nanoindentation tests performed on
   annealed and 80\% cold-worked 70/30 brass are presented which address
   the effect of indentation strain rate and indentation depth upon the
   indentation stress and the kinetics of the deformation process. At any
   given indentation depth from 0.2 to 2.0 mu m the strain rate sensitivity
   m, and the apparent activation energy Delta G(0) of the deformation
   process show a clear dependence upon indentation depth and prior
   cold-work. The data from all indentation tests, regardless of
   indentation depth, fall on the same linear trend of apparent activation
   work Delta W'versus Delta G(0); however, the annealed material displayed
   a distinctly different linear trend than the 80\% cold-worked material.
   This suggests that the operative dislocation-obstacle mechanism that
   occurs during the indentation is essentially independent of indentation
   depth but depends upon the prior dislocation density of the indented
   material. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: The uncertainty in the P-29(p, gamma)S-30 reaction rate over
   0.1 <= T <= 1.3 GK was previously determined to span approximately four
   orders of magnitude due to the uncertain location of two previously
   unobserved 3(+) and 2(+) resonances in the E-x = 4.7-4.8 MeV region in
   S-30. Therefore, the abundances of silicon isotopes synthesized in
   novae, which are relevant for the identification of presolar grains of
   putative nova origin, were uncertain by a factor of 3.
   Purpose: (a) To investigate the level structure of S-30 above the proton
   threshold {[}4394.9(7) keV] via charged-particle spectroscopy using the
   S-32(p, t) S-30 reaction and in-beam gamma-ray spectroscopy using the
   Si-28(He-3, n gamma)S-30 reaction to calculate the P-29(p, gamma)S-30
   reaction rate. (b) To explore the impact of this rate on the abundances
   of silicon isotopes synthesized in novae.
   Methods: Differential cross sections of the S-32(p, t)S-30 reaction were
   measured at 34.5 MeV. Distorted-wave Born approximation calculations
   were performed to constrain the spin-parity assignments of the observed
   levels, including the two astrophysically-important levels. An
   energy-level scheme was deduced from gamma-gamma coincidence
   measurements using the Si-28(He-3, n gamma)S-30 reaction. Spin-parity
   assignments based on measurements of gamma-ray angular distributions and
   gamma-gamma directional correlation from oriented nuclei were made for
   most of the observed levels of S-30.
   Results: The resonance energies corresponding to the states with 4.5 MeV
   less than or similar to E-x less than or similar to 6 MeV, including the
   two astrophysically important states predicted previously, are measured
   with significantly better precision than before. The spin-parity
   assignments of both astrophysically important resonances are confirmed.
   The uncertainty in the rate of the P-29(p, gamma)S-30 reaction is
   substantially reduced over the temperature range of interest. Finally,
   the influence of this rate on the abundance ratios of silicon isotopes
   synthesized in novae are obtained via 1D hydrodynamic nova simulations.
   Conclusions: The uncertainty in the P-29(p, gamma)S-30 reaction rate is
   reduced to the point that it no longer affects the silicon isotopic
   abundance ratios significantly, and, thus, the results of our nova
   hydrodynamic simulation for the nucleosynthesis in the Si-Ca mass region
   are more reliable than before.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a framework for vascular image segmentation
   evaluation. Since the size of vessel wall and plaque burden is defined
   by the lumen and wall boundaries in vascular segmentation, these two
   boundaries should be considered as a pair in statistical evaluation of a
   segmentation algorithm. This work proposed statistical metrics to
   evaluate the difference of local vessel wall thickness (VWT) produced by
   manual and algorithm-based semi-automatic segmentation methods (Delta T)
   with the local segmentation standard deviation of the wall and lumen
   boundaries considered. Delta T was further approximately decomposed into
   the local wall and lumen boundary differences (Delta W and Delta L
   respectively) in order to provide information regarding which of the
   wall and lumen segmentation errors contribute more to the VWT
   difference. In this study, the lumen and wall boundaries in 3D carotid
   ultrasound images acquired for 21 subjects were each segmented five
   times manually and by a level-set segmentation algorithm. The (absolute)
   difference measures (i.e., Delta T, Delta W, Delta L and their absolute
   values) and the pooled local standard deviation of manually and
   algorithmically segmented wall and lumen boundaries were computed for
   each subject and represented in a 2D standardized map. The local
   accuracy and variability of the segmentation algorithm at each point can
   be quantified by the average of these metrics for the whole group of
   subjects and visualized on the 2D standardized map. Based on the results
   shown on the 2D standardized map, a variety of strategies, such as
   adding anchor points and adjusting weights of different forces in the
   algorithm, can be introduced to improve the accuracy and variability of
   the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The structural arrangement of type I collagen in vivo is critical for
   the normal functioning of tissues, such as bone, cornea, tendons, and
   blood vessels. At present, there are no established low-cost techniques
   for fabricating aligned collagen structures for applications in
   regenerative medicine. Here, we report on a straightforward approach to
   fabricate collagen films, with defined orientation distributions of
   collagen fibrillar aggregates within a matrix of oriented collagen
   molecules on flat sample surfaces. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technology was
   used to deposit thin films of oriented type I,collagen onto flat
   substrates exhibiting various shapes. By varying the shapes of the
   substrates (e.g., rectangles, squares, circles, parallelograms, and
   various shaped triangles) as well as their sizes, a systematic study on
   collagen alignment patterns was conducted. It was found that the
   orientation and the orientation distribution of collagen along these,
   various shaped substrates are directly depending on the geometry of the
   substrate and the dipping direction of that sample with respect to the
   collagen/water subphase. An important factor in tissue engineering is
   the stability, durability, and,endurance of the constructed artificial
   tissue and thus its functioning in regenerative medicine applications.
   By testing these criteria, we found that the coated films and their
   alignments were stable for at least three months under different
   conditions and, moreover, that these films can withstand temperatures of
   up to 60 degrees C for a short time. Therefore these constructs may have
   widespread applicability in the engineering of collagen-rich tissues.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical compositions of titanite in igneous rocks, hydrothermal
   veins, skarns, and hornfels from eight tungsten and molybdenum deposits
   in Yukon and British Columbia, Canada, were examined by electron probe
   and LA-ICP-MS. Four kinds of titanite were grouped in our study on the
   basis of genesis: magmatic titanite from the igneous rocks, hydrothermal
   titanite from the igneous rocks and hydrothermal veins, metasomatic
   titanite from the skarn samples, and metamorphic titanite from the
   hornfels samples. Magmatic titanite is hundreds of mu m long, euhedral
   or subhedral, and in planar contact with magmatic K-feldspar,
   plagioclase, and quartz. Compared to hydrothermal titanite, early
   magmatic titanite (cores) is enriched in Ti, HSFE, and REE, but depleted
   in Al and F. Magmatic titanite can be enriched in W or Mo, reflecting
   high concentrations of these elements in the source melt and suggesting
   that titanite has potential for identifying fertile W or Mo intrusions.
   The titanite from W skarn samples are enriched in W, Sn, and Nb, which
   also has a potential application as an indicator for W exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering scaffolds act as a structural template for seeded
   cells and play a significant role in dictating the performance of the
   final tissue construct. Scaffold properties are governed by the
   fabrication method and must be tailored to meet the intended
   application. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) polyurethane vascular
   scaffolds were fabricated by a pressure differential solvent
   casting/particulate leaching (SCPL) and by electrospinning for
   comparative studies. For SCPL, two different porogens, namely, alginate
   beads and D-fructose particles were used. A novel scaffold fabricating
   strategy with a regular geometry of pores and enhanced microporosity was
   developed by partially solubilising D-fructose porogens in situ using a
   solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylfornnamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide
   (DMSO). Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and mercury intrusion
   porosimetry characterizations combined with scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) imaging revealed that scaffolds with 80-90\% porosity, distinct
   pore morphology and pore parameters were fabricated using the two
   porogens, while fibrous scaffolds having an average fiber diameter of
   similar to 200 nm were fabricated by electrospinning. Electrospun
   scaffolds were included in the study to gain insight on the effect of
   the fibrous scaffold morphology on cell behavior on the basis of its
   fibrous nature. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC)
   culture studies indicated that scaffolds fabricated both by SCPL using
   alginate beads and D-fructose and by electrospinning, all have provided
   a favorable environment for cell growth.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal operation models for a hydropower system using new fuzzy
   multiobjective mathematical programming models are developed and
   evaluated in this study. The models use (i) mixed integer nonlinear
   programming (MINLP) with binary variables and (ii) integrate a new
   turbine unit commitment formulation along with water quality constraints
   used for evaluation of reservoir downstream impairment. Reardon method
   used in solution of genetic algorithm optimization problems forms the
   basis for development of a new fuzzy multiobjective hydropower system
   optimization model with creation of Reardon type fuzzy membership
   functions. The models are applied to a real-life hydropower reservoir
   system in Brazil. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are used to (i) solve the
   optimization formulations to avoid computational intractability and
   combinatorial problems associated with binary variables in unit
   commitment, (ii) efficiently address Reardon method formulations, and
   (iii) deal with local optimal solutions obtained from the use of
   traditional gradient-based solvers. Decision maker's preferences are
   incorporated within fuzzy mathematical programming formulations to
   obtain compromise operating rules for a multiobjective reservoir
   operation problem dominated by conflicting goals of energy production,
   water quality and conservation releases. Results provide insight into
   compromise operation rules obtained using the new Reardon fuzzy
   multiobjective optimization framework and confirm its applicability to a
   variety of multiobjective water resources problems.}},

Abstract = {{Energy services in and related to buildings are responsible for
   approximately one-third of total global final energy demand and
   energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. They also contribute to the
   other key energy-related global sustainability challenges including lack
   of access to modern energy services, climate change, indoor and outdoor
   air pollution, related and additional health risks and energy
   dependence. The aim of this paper is to summarize the main
   sustainability challenges related to building thermal energy use and to
   identify the key strategies for how to address these challenges. The
   paper's basic premises and results are provided by and updated from the
   analysis conducted for the Global Energy Assessment: identification of
   strategies and key solutions; scenario assessment; and the comparison of
   the results with other models in the literature. The research has
   demonstrated that buildings can play a key role in solving
   sustainability challenges: close to one-third of 2005 building energy
   use can be eliminated by the proliferation of state-of-the-art
   construction and retrofit know-how in each world region, while
   maintaining wealth and amenity increases. In contrast, approximately
   80\% of this 2005 energy use will be locked in by the middle of the
   century if policies are not sufficiently ambitious in targeting
   regionally specific state-of-the-art performance levels.}},

Abstract = {{Selection of compatible materials for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   is a challenging task as severe restrictions are imposed on materials
   used in and around the scanner due to the static and dynamic magnetic
   fields involved. Much of the data available for MRI-compatible materials
   are scattered throughout the literature and are often too device
   specific. This paper focuses on engineering materials with sufficient
   strength and stiffness, and with low enough susceptibility to be used in
   this environment. Experimental results of generic test specimens are
   used to give comparable performance indicators for candidate materials.
   As expected, the force varies linearly with susceptibility with good
   correlation with the theoretical predictions except for brass 360. It is
   believed the susceptibility for brass 360 in the literature was
   mistakenly recorded, and our results suggest a value of 112 ppm. The
   image artifacts were compared based on the radius of the affected area
   in the image. The theory greatly overpredicts the affected area;
   however, the trends in terms of susceptibility seem fairly accurate. The
   size of the artifact increases with susceptibility, echo time, and the
   use of turbo spin echo over gradient echo sequences. However, the
   experimental data contradicted the theory by showing no appreciable
   effect due to bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive surgery minimizes trauma to the patient, however, the
   loss of tactile feedback impedes the surgeon's ability to locate tumors
   among healthy tissue. In this paper, a resonance-based instrument to
   measure the stiffness, damping, and effective mass of a soft material
   such as biological tissue is presented. It was designed to be small yet
   has two natural frequencies below 100 Hz so that the effective mass of
   the tissue would not impact the determination of the stiffness. A
   state-space model was used to develop a fast and accurate method of
   extracting the tissue parameters by measuring the natural frequencies
   and the bandwidth at the first natural frequency. A fast and robust
   phased-locked-loop-based feedback system is described, which was used to
   measure the required frequencies. Simulations showed that the system was
   robust, while subjected to disturbances including hand tremor, tissue
   parameter variation, and preload. A prototype system showed that the
   instrument could accurately predict the stiffness, damping, and mass
   with an average error of 6\%, 6\%, and 7\%, respectively. Experiments on
   a simulated tissue phantom showed the ability of the instrument to
   detect a tumour while it was stationary and in motion.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Glenohumeral instability with glenoid bone loss is
   commonly treated with the Latarjet procedure. The procedure involves
   transfer of the coracoid and conjoint tendon, which is thought to
   provide a stabilizing sling effect; however, its significance is
   unknown. This study evaluated the effects of the Latarjet procedure,
   with and without conjoint tendon loading, on shoulder stability and
   range of motion (ROM).
   Materials and methods: A custom simulator was used to evaluate anterior
   shoulder stability and ROM in 8 cadaveric shoulders. Testing conditions
   included intact, 30\% glenoid defect, and Latarjet with and without
   conjoint loading. Unloaded and 10-N loaded states were tested in
   adduction and 90 degrees abduction. Outcome variables included
   dislocation, stiffness (neutral and 60 degrees external rotation), and
   internal-external rotational ROM.
   Results: All 30\% defects dislocated in abduction external rotation. The
   loaded Latarjet prevented dislocation in all specimens, whereas the
   unloaded Latarjet stabilized 6 of 8 specimens. In abduction external
   rotation, there were no significant differences in stiffness between
   loaded and unloaded transfers (P=.176). In adduction, there were no
   significant differences between the intact and the loaded Latarjet (P
   >=.228); however, in neutral rotation, the unloaded Latarjet (P=.015)
   and the 30\% defects (P=.011) were significantly less stiff. Rotational
   ROM in abduction was significantly reduced with the loaded Latarjet
   (P=.014) compared with unloaded Latarjet, and no differences were found
   in adduction.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that glenohumeral stability is
   improved, but not fully restored to intact, with conjoint tendon
   loading. The results support the existence of the sling effect and its
   importance in augmenting stability provided by the transferred coracoid.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Background: This biomechanical study evaluated the effects of 3
   remplissage techniques on shoulder stability and motion in a Hill-Sachs
   (HS) instability model.
   Materials and methods: Cadaveric forequarters were tested on an active
   shoulder simulator. Three remplissage techniques were performed for 15\%
   and 30\% HS defects. Testing conditions included intact and 15\% and
   30\% HS defects, and the 3 remplissage techniques: T1, anchors in the
   defect valley; T2, anchors in humeral head rim; and T3, anchors in
   valley with medial suture placement. Outcomes included stability,
   internal-external rotation range of motion (IE-ROM), and joint
   stiffness.
   Results: All remplissage techniques improved shoulder stability. In 15\%
   HS defects tested in adduction, T3 significantly reduced IE-ROM
   (P=.037), whereas T1 and T2 did also (mean IE-ROM reductions: T1, 14
   degrees; T2, 11 degrees; T3, 21 degrees), but not to significance (P
   >=.088). In abduction, no significant reductions in IE-ROM occurred (P
   >=.060). In 30\% HS defects tested in adduction (mean reduction IE-ROM:
   T1, 11 degrees; T2, 19 degrees; T3, 28 degrees) and abduction (mean
   reduction: T1, 9 degrees; T2, 15 degrees; T3, 21 degrees), all
   techniques significantly reduced IE-ROM (P<.046). All techniques
   increased joint stiffness from 100\% to 320\% beyond the Bankart repair
   alone. A significant increase in joint stiffness was observed for T3
   compared with the 30\% HS group (P=.004), whereas T2 trended toward an
   increase (P=.078). There was no significant increase in joint stiffness
   with T1 (P=.249).
   Conclusions: All remplissage techniques enhanced shoulder stability,
   restricted ROM, and increased joint stiffness. No significant
   differences were found between anchors placed in the valley (T1) vs
   those placed in the humeral head rim (T2). Medial suture placement (T3)
   resulted in the greatest joint stiffness values and mean restriction in
   motion.

Abstract = {{We report a 3D plasmonic nanostructure having an extraordinary optical
   transmission due to localized surface plasmon (LSP) coupling between
   nanoholes and nanodisks. The nanostructure contains a free-standing gold
   nanohole array (NHA) film above a cavity and an array of nanodisks at
   the bottom of the cavity that is aligned with the NHA. For the device,
   the LSP-mediated resonance position was dependent on the hole and
   nanodisk diameter as well as the separation distance. Also, the effect
   of LSP coupling between each hole and corresponding nanodisk became
   negligible for cavities deeper than 200 nm as observed as a
   disappearance of the LSP resonance. The greatest LSP resonance
   transmission and the highest electric field intensity were observed for
   the structure with the shallowest cavity. In addition, the structure had
   high surface plasmon resonance sensitivity and may have potential for
   surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and optical trapping applications.}},

Abstract = {{Existing algorithms, including the stochastic point-source method, used
   to simulate synthetic ground-motion records are aimed at sampling
   records at a single station or records at multiple stations. The
   application of the algorithms may not adequately reproduce the observed
   coherency structure of the actual records and the intraevent spatial
   correlation characteristics of peak ground acceleration or spectral
   accelerations. To improve these, we suggest an extension to the
   stochastic point-source method by introducing a target spatial coherency
   structure and the spatially correlated uncertainties in the Fourier
   amplitude spectrum for each recording station. The use of the extended
   model to simulate the multiple-station records is illustrated, and the
   spatial correlation of the ground-motion measures for the simulated
   records are compared with the empirical spatial correlation model
   derived based on the 1999 Chi-Chi Taiwan earthquake.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium/fluorapatite (Ti/FA) composites with various FA additions were
   fabricated by powder metallurgy. The decomposition of FA during
   sintering was accelerated by the presence of Ti. The main reaction
   products of FA and Ti were identified as CaO, Ti phosphides, and CaTiO3.
   The addition of FA significantly inhibited the densification of Ti. The
   in vitro bioactivity of the composites was evaluated in a simulated body
   fluid (SBF). After immersion into the SBF, all the Ti/FA composites
   induced nucleation and growth of bone-like carbonated apatite on the
   surface. Co-precipitation of CaCO3 and Mg(OH)(2) was also detected on
   the surface of the composite with high FA addition at an early stage of
   immersion. Furthermore, the release of fluorine ions from the composite
   was confirmed, which could promote bone regeneration and retard the
   formation of caries in the biological environment. The in vitro behavior
   was attributed to multiple factors, including the surface conditions and
   the constituents of the composite. The results demonstrated that the
   Ti/FA composites were bioactive in nature even with a low FA addition
   and they could introduce the benefit of fluorine ions in the service.}},

Abstract = {{Doxorubicin causes damage to the heart, which may present as
   cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms by which doxorubicin induces
   cardiotoxicity remain not fully understood and no effective prevention
   for doxorubicin cardiomyopathy is available. Calpains, a family of
   calcium-dependent thiol-proteases, have been implicated in
   cardiovascular diseases. Their activities are tightly controlled by
   calpastatin. This study employed transgenic mice over-expressing
   calpastatin to investigate the role of calpain in doxorubicin-induced
   cardiotoxicity.
   Doxorubicin treatment decreased calpain activities in cultured neonatal
   mouse cardiomyocytes and in vivo mouse hearts, which correlated with
   down-regulation of calpain-1 and calpain-2 proteins. Over-expression of
   calpastatin or incubation with pharmacological calpain inhibitors
   enhanced apoptosis in neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes induced by
   doxorubicin. In contrast, over-expression of calpain-2 but not calpain-1
   attenuated doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. The
   pro-apoptotic effects of calpain inhibition were associated with
   down-regulation of protein kinase B (AKT) protein and mRNA expression,
   and a concomitant reduction in glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3)
   phosphorylation (Ser9) in doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytes. Blocking
   AKT further increased doxorubicin-induced cardiac injuries, suggesting
   the effects of calpain inhibition may be mediated by inactivating the
   AKT signalling. In an in vivo model of doxorubicin-induced
   cardiotoxicity, over-expression of calpastatin exacerbated myocardial
   dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography and haemodynamic measurement
   in transgenic mice 5 days after doxorubicin injection. The 5-day
   mortality was higher in transgenic mice (29.16) compared with their
   wild-type littermates (8) after doxorubicin treatment.
   Over-expression of calpastatin enhances doxorubicin-induced cardiac
   injuries through calpain inhibition and thus, calpains may protect
   cardiomyocytes against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Typical modeling algorithms for multilayered irregular shaped power
   distribution networks are based on a finite difference solution of the
   Helmholtz equation. In this paper, the finite difference solution is
   demonstrated to be equivalent to a discretization of the Telegraphers
   partial differential equations for multiconductor transmission lines
   (MTL). With this concept, an efficient macromodeling algorithm for
   multilayered structures based on MTL theory is presented. The
   electromagnetic coupling between the plane layers due to wraparound
   currents is captured by the inductive and capacitive coupling between
   the multiconductor lines. A delay extraction-based macromodel is used to
   represent the MTL in SPICE that can better capture the distributed
   effects of the structure than existing lumped models. This approach is
   successfully implemented for multilayered structures with irregular
   geometries and is shown to be more accurate and efficient compared with
   existing SPICE lumped models.}},

Volume = {{725}},
Pages = {{23-54}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The effects of small-amplitude, two-dimensional grooves on pressure
   losses in a laminar channel flow have been analysed. Grooves with an
   arbitrary shape and an arbitrary orientation with respect to the flow
   direction have been considered. It has been demonstrated that losses can
   be expressed as a superposition of two parts, one associated with change
   in the mean positions of the walls and one induced by flow modulations
   associated with the geometry of the grooves. The former effect can be
   determined analytically, while the latter has to be determined
   numerically and can be captured with an acceptable accuracy using
   reduced-order geometry models. Projection of the wall shape onto a
   Fourier space has been used to generate such a model. It has been found
   that in most cases replacement of the actual wall geometry with the
   leading mode of the relevant Fourier expansion permits determination of
   pressure losses with an error of less than 10 \%. Detailed results are
   given for sinusoidal grooves for the range of parameters of practical
   interest. These results describe the performance of arbitrary grooves
   with the accuracy set by the properties of the reduced-order geometry
   model and are exact for sinusoidal grooves. The results show a strong
   dependence of the pressure losses on the groove orientation.
   Longitudinal grooves produce the smallest drag, and oblique grooves with
   an inclination angle of similar to 42 degrees exhibit the largest flow
   turning potential. Detailed analyses of the extreme cases, i.e.
   transverse and longitudinal grooves, have been carried out. For
   transverse grooves with small wavenumbers, the dominant part of the drag
   is produced by shear, while the pressure form drag and the pressure
   interaction drag provide minor contributions. For the same grooves with
   large wavenumbers, the stream lifts up above the grooves due to their
   blocking effect, resulting in a change in the mechanics of drag
   formation: the contributions of shear decrease while the contributions
   of the pressure interaction drag increase, leading to an overall drag
   increase. In the case of longitudinal grooves, drag is produced by
   shear, and its rearrangement results in a drag decrease for
   long-wavelength grooves in spite of an increase of the wetted surface
   area. An increase of the wavenumber leads to the fluid being squeezed
   from the troughs and the stream being forced to lift up above the
   grooves. The shear is nearly eliminated from a large fraction of the
   wall but the overall drag increases due to reduction of the effective
   channel opening. It is shown that properly structured grooves are able
   to eliminate wall shear from the majority of the wetted surface area
   regardless of the groove orientation, thus exhibiting the potential for
   the creation of drag-reducing surfaces. Such surfaces can become
   practicable if a method for elimination of the undesired pressure and
   shear peaks through proper groove shaping can be found.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetic parameters of ferrous iron oxidation, covering both lag and

   developed to simulate the dynamics of a continuous bioreactor used for
   operation of a novel hybrid Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox flow fuel cell system.
   By changing the current load within a predefined range, three runs were
   performed to predict time-varying ferrous iron concentration, bacterial
   cell concentration, and pH as the major output variables of simulation
   program. The model was experimentally validated through three runs. It
   was found out that the key variable in dynamic analysis of the
   bioreactor was the current load applied. To optimize the bioreactor and
   the fuel cell conditions for a normal-steady-state operation, the
   optimal current profile for a transient phase was determined. A selected

Abstract = {{The quasi-static Young's modulus of the eardrum's pars tensa is an
   important modeling parameter in computer simulations. Recent
   developments in indentation testing and inverse modeling allow
   estimation of this parameter with the eardrum in situ. These approaches
   are challenging because of the curved shape of the pars tensa which
   requires special care during experimentation to keep the indenter
   perpendicular to the local surface at the point of contact. Moreover,
   they involve complicated contact modeling. An alternative computer-based
   method is presented here in which pressurization is used instead of
   indentation. The Young's modulus of a thin-shell model of the eardrum
   with subject-specific geometry is numerically optimized such that
   simulated pressurized shapes match measured counterparts. The technique
   was evaluated on six healthy rat eardrums, resulting in a Young's
   modulus estimate of 22.8 +/- 1.5 MPa. This is comparable to values
   estimated using indentation testing. The new pressurization-based
   approach is simpler to use than the indentation-based method for the two
   reasons noted above. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To synthesize and characterize machinable, bioactive
   glass-ceramics (GCs) suitable for dental implant applications.
   Methods. A glass in the SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-CaF2-K2O-B2O3-La2O3 system was
   synthesized by wet chemical methods, followed by calcination, melting
   and quenching. Crystallization kinetics were determined by differential
   thermal analysis (DTA). GC discs were produced by cold pressing of the
   glass powder and sintered using schedules determined by DTA. The
   crystalline phases and microstructure of GC samples were characterized
   by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   respectively. Dynamic Young's modulus (E), true hardness (H-o), fracture
   toughness (K-IC) and brittleness index (BI) were evaluated. Bioactivity
   was studied by examining the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the GC
   surfaces after soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF). Attachment and
   proliferation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were assessed in vitro.
   Results. Miserite {[}KCa5(Si2O7)(Si6O15)(OH) F] was the main crystalline
   phase of the GC with additional secondary phases. Microstructural
   studies revealed interlocking lath-like crystalline morphology. E, H-o,
   and K-IC values for the GCs were 96 +/- 3 GPa, 5.27 +/- 0.26 GPa and
   4.77 +/- 0.27 MPa m(0.5), respectively. The BI was found to be 1.11 +/-
   0.05 mu m(-0.5), indicating outstanding machinability. An HA surface
   layer was formed on the GC surfaces when soaked in SBF, indicating
   potential bioactivity. MC3T3-E1 cells exhibited attachment, spreading
   and proliferation on GC surfaces, demonstrating excellent
   biocompatibility.
   Significance. We present a novel approach for the synthesis of miserite
   GC with the physical and biological properties required for non-metallic
   dental implant applications. (C) 2013 Academy of Dental Materials.

Title = {{Associations between self-reported odour annoyance and volatile organic

Volume = {{185}},

Abstract = {{Annoyance produced by air pollution has been suggested as a useful proxy
   for determining ambient air pollution exposure. However, most of the
   studies, to date, have focused on nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide,
   with no work done on volatile organic compounds (VOC). This study is
   aimed at examining the associations between odour annoyance and VOC in
   `Chemical Valley', Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Annoyance scores were
   extracted from a community health survey (N = 774), and exposures to VOC
   were estimated from respondents' six-digit alphanumeric postal codes
   using land use regression models. Univariate analyses were used to
   explore the relationships between odour annoyance and modelled
   pollutants, whilst multivariate ordinal logistic regression was utilized
   to examine the determinants of odour annoyance. The results indicate
   that odour annoyance is significantly associated with modelled benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene and (m + p) xylene (BTEX) pollutants.
   The findings also show that the determinants of odour annoyance in the
   context of VOC include gender, number of relatives in the community,
   perception of air pollution, community satisfaction, medical checkups,
   ability to cope with daily life demands and general symptoms. When
   compared, the analysis indicates that Sarnia residents respond to
   considerably lower BTEX concentrations than the allowable `safe' levels
   in the province of Ontario. In general, the results exhibit a
   dose-response gradient with annoyance score increasing with rising
   modelled pollutant concentrations. The observed relationships suggest
   that odour annoyance might be a function of true exposure and may serve
   as a proxy for air quality and ambient air pollution monitoring.
   However, questionnaire-based odour annoyance scores need to be
   longitudinally validated across different geographical scales and
   pollutants if they are to be adopted at the national level.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of fall type and
   fall height on the kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activation of the
   upper extremity during simulated forward falls using a novel fall
   simulation method.
   Twenty participants were released in a prone position from a Propelled
   Upper Limb Fall ARrest Impact System. Impacts occurred to the hands from
   two fall heights (0.05 m and 0.10 m) and three fall types (straight-arm,
   bent-arm, self-selected). Muscle activation from six muscles (biceps
   brachii, brachioradialis, triceps brachii, anconeus, flexor carpi
   radialis and extensor carpi radialis) was collected and upper extremity
   joint kinematics were calculated.
   Peak Fx (medio-lateral), as well as Fx and Fz (inferior-superior) load
   rate increased between the 0.05 m and 0.10 m heights. With respect to
   fall type, the straight-arm falls resulted in significantly greater Fy
   (anterior-posterior) impulse and Fy and Fz load rates. The change in
   elbow flexion angle was greater during the self-selected and bent-arm
   falls compared to the straight-arm falls; a pattern also seen in the
   wrist flexion/extension angles. All muscles experienced peak \% MVIC
   prior to the time of the peak force.
   The results of this study suggest that, to some extent, individuals are
   capable of selecting an upper extremity posture that allows them to
   minimize the effects of an impact and it has confirmed the presence of a
   preparatory muscle activation response. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Natural and alkaline modified pumice stones were used for the adsorption
   of water hardening cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The adsorbents were
   characterized using XRF, XRD, SEM and FTIR instrumental techniques. At
   equilibrium time and for 150 mg/L of a given cation, removal
   efficiencies were 83\% and 94\% for calcium and 48\% and 73\% for
   magnesium for raw and modified pumices, respectively. The optimal pH for
   raw and modified pumices were found to be 6.0, leading to the removal of
   79 and 96\% of calcium and 51 and 93\% of magnesium by 10 g/L of raw and
   modified pumice adsorbents, respectively. Maximum adsorption capacities
   were 57.27 and 62.34 mg/g for Ca2+ and 44.53 and 56.11 mg/g for Mg2+ on
   the raw and modified pumices, respectively. Ca2+ and Mg2+ adsorption
   capacities of the pumice adsorbents decreased in the presence of
   competing cations. Less than 300 min were needed to achieve 99 and 92\%
   desorption of the adsorbed Ca2+ and 100 and 89\% of the adsorbed Mg2+
   from the natural and modified pumices, respectively. After treating
   synthetic water solution simulating an actual water stream with the
   alkali-modified pumice, total hardness of the treated sample met the
   required standard for drinking water, namely below 300 mg/L of CaCO3
   (297.5 mg/L). The studied pumice adsorbents, and especially the treated
   pumice, can be therefore considered as promising low cost adsorbents,
   suitable for the removal of hardness ions from drinking water. (C) 2013

   increasing the effective w/c ratio. In addition, nano-CaCO3 accelerated
   the cement hydration process through nucleation, and also acted as an
   effective filling material. Mixtures combining both micro- and
   nano-CaCO3 resulted in similar or enhanced mechanical properties
   compared to that of the control, while achieving cement replacement
   levels up to 20 \%. Thus, through the use of micro- and nano-CaCO3, more
   environmentally friendly UHPC can be produced by reducing its cement
   factor, while achieving enhanced engineering properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a full three dimensional FLUENT numerical model of the
   electrostatic coating process as used in the automotive industry is
   presented and selected parametric studies on the numerical model have
   been conducted. The model incorporates a moving mesh capability in order
   to simulate movements of the target. The target follows piecewise linear
   motion and the entire area of the target has been coated in multiple
   passes. All the dominant mechanical and electrical phenomena were taken
   into account and cases with both neutral and charged particles were
   examined. It was confirmed that the transfer efficiency increases when
   the electrical forces are present in the model and that the coating
   uniformity improves with the movement of the target. The deposition
   pattern corresponds to the motion of the target and gradually builds up
   in a cumulative manner. Due to the aggregation effect associated with
   the target movement, the deposition uniformity is dramatically improved.

Abstract = {{The use of finite element models as research tools in biomechanics and
   orthopedics has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. However, the
   attention to mesh quality, model validation and appropriate energy
   balance methods and the reporting of these metrics has not kept pace
   with the general use of finite element modeling. Therefore, the purpose
   of this review was to summarize the current state of finite element
   modeling validation practices from the literature in biomechanics and
   orthopedics and to present specific methods and criteria limits that can
   be used as guidelines to assess mesh quality, validate simulation
   results and address energy balance issues.
   Of the finite element models reviewed from the literature, approximately
   42\% of them were not adequately validated, while 95\% and 98\% of the
   models did not assess the quality of the mesh Or energy balance,
   respectively. A review of the methods that can be used to assess the
   quality of a mesh (e.g., aspect ratios, angle idealization and element
   Jacobians), measure the balance of energies (e.g., hour glass energy and
   mass scaling), and quantify the accuracy of the simulations (e.g.,
   validation metrics, corridors, statistical techniques) are presented.

Abstract = {{Polymer vesicles, commonly referred to as polymersomes, are self
   organized materials that result from the self assembly of amphiphilic
   copolymers in solution. Recently, there has been increasing interest in
   biomedical applications of polymersomes due to the different functions
   that can be imparted through encapsulation of molecules within the core
   or membrane or through the introduction of bioactive molecules to the
   polymersome surface. We describe here the development and study of
   poly(ethylene oxide)-polycaprolactone polymersomes designed to interact
   with influenza viruses at two different stages in the infection process.
   First, the conjugation of the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid
   (Neu5Ac) to the polymersome surface was designed to inhibit the binding
   of viral hemagglutinin to sialic acids on host cells, thus preventing
   viral entry. Second, the incorporation of the neuraminidase inhibitor
   zanamivir into the polymersome core was designed to prevent the release
   of progeny virus from the host cells, thus inhibiting viral replication.
   With the aim of maximizing multivalent effects at the polymersome
   surface, polyester dendrons functionalized with Neu5Ac were synthesized
   and conjugated to polymersomes. Binding of the resulting dendritic
   sialopolymersomes to Limax flavus agglutinin was studied and compared to
   the sialodendron and a monovalent Neu5Ac derivative using an enzyme
   linked lectin inhibition assay. It was found that while the sialodendron
   exhibited a 17 fold enhancement (per sialoside) relative to the small
   molecule, the dendritic sialopolymersomes resulted in an almost 2000
   fold enhancement in binding affinity. It was also demonstrated that
   encapsulation of zanamivir into the dendritic sialopolymersomes could be
   performed with the same efficiency as for naked polymersomes to provide
   a drug loading of similar to 35 wt \%. Drug release rates were similar
   for both systems with sustained release over a period of 4 days.
   Overall, these results suggest the promise of using a multifunctional
   polymersome system for interaction with and inhibition of influenza
   viruses.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Flexoelectricity, referring to a spontaneous electric polarization
   induced by strain gradient in dielectrics, presents a strong size
   dependency at the nanoscale. In the current work, the influence of the
   flexoelectric effect on the mechanical and electrical properties of
   bending piezoelectric nanobeams with different boundary conditions is
   investigated. Based on the extended linear piezoelectricity theory and
   the Euler beam model, analytical solutions of the electroelastic fields
   in the piezoelectric nanobeams subjected to both electrical and
   mechanical loads are obtained with the inclusion of the flexoelectric
   effect. Simulation results show that the flexoelectric effect on the
   elastic behavior of bending beams is sensitive to the beam boundary
   conditions and the applied electrical load. In addition, for a
   cantilever piezoelectric nanobeam, an axial relaxation strain is induced
   from the piezoelectric and flexoelectric effects, while these effects
   induce a resultant axial force in both the clamped-clamped and simply
   supported piezoelectric nanobeams. Results also indicate that the
   flexoelectric effect plays a significant role in the contact stiffness
   and electric polarization of piezoelectric beams when their thickness is
   at the nanoscale. It is found that the flexoelectric effect on the
   electroelastic responses of piezoelectric nanobeams is more pronounced
   for the beams with smaller thickness. These results are useful for
   understanding the fundamental mechanical and physical properties of
   bending piezoelectric nanobeams. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonance sensors of the nanohole array type provide a

   optically thick Au films on poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates. This
   technique significantly simplifies the process of sensor fabrication and
   reduces the cost of the device. A spectral analysis approach is also
   developed for improving the sensor performance. The sensitivity of the
   resulting sensor to refractive index change is 522 nm/RIU (refractive
   index unit) and the resolution is improved to 2 x 10(-5) RIU, which are
   among the best reported values for localized surface plasmon resonance
   sensors. We also demonstrate the limit of detection of this sensor for

Title = {{A burst of ABC genes in the genome of the polyphagous spider mite
   Tetranychus urticae}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ABC (ATP-binding cassette) gene superfamily is
   widespread across all living species. The majority of ABC genes encode
   ABC transporters, which are membrane-spanning proteins capable of
   transferring substrates across biological membranes by hydrolyzing ATP.
   Although ABC transporters have often been associated with resistance to
   drugs and toxic compounds, within the Arthropoda ABC gene families have
   only been characterized in detail in several insects and a crustacean.
   In this study, we report a genome-wide survey and expression analysis of
   the ABC gene superfamily in the spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a
   chelicerate similar to 450 million years diverged from other Arthropod
   lineages. T. urticae is a major agricultural pest, and is among of the
   most polyphagous arthropod herbivores known. The species resists a
   staggering array of toxic plant secondary metabolites, and has developed
   resistance to all major classes of pesticides in use for its control.
   Results: We identified 103 ABC genes in the T. urticae genome, the
   highest number discovered in a metazoan species to date. Within the T.
   urticae ABC gene set, all members of the eight currently described
   subfamilies (A to H) were detected. A phylogenetic analysis revealed
   that the high number of ABC genes in T. urticae is due primarily to
   lineage-specific expansions of ABC genes within the ABCC, ABCG and ABCH
   subfamilies. In particular, the ABCC subfamily harbors the highest
   number of T. urticae ABC genes (39). In a comparative genomic analysis,
   we found clear orthologous relationships between a subset of T. urticae
   ABC proteins and ABC proteins in both vertebrates and invertebrates
   known to be involved in fundamental cellular processes. These included
   members of the ABCB-half transporters, and the ABCD, ABCE and ABCF
   families. Furthermore, one-to-one orthologues could be distinguished
   between T. urticae proteins and human ABCC10, ABCG5 and ABCG8, the
   Drosophila melanogaster sulfonylurea receptor and ecdysone-regulated
   transporter E23. Finally, expression profiling revealed that ABC genes
   in the ABCC, ABCG ABCH subfamilies were differentially expressed in
   multi-pesticide resistant mite strains and/or in mites transferred to
   challenging (toxic) host plants.
   Conclusions: In this study we present the first comprehensive analysis
   of ABC genes in a polyphagous arthropod herbivore. We demonstrate that
   the broad plant host range and high levels of pesticide resistance in T.
   urticae are associated with lineage-specific expansions of ABC genes,
   many of which respond transcriptionally to xenobiotic exposure. This ABC
   catalogue will serve as a basis for future biochemical and toxicological
   studies. Obtaining functional evidence that these ABC subfamilies
   contribute to xenobiotic tolerance should be the priority of future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, exergoeconomic and environmental impact analyses, through
   energy, exergy, and sustainability assessment methods, are performed to
   investigate a hybrid version renewable energy (including wind and solar)
   based hydrogen and electricity production system. The dead state
   temperatures considered here are 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 30
   degrees C to undertake a parametric study. An electrolyzer and a metal
   hydride tank are used for hydrogen production and hydrogen storage,
   respectively. Also, the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) and
   battery options are utilized for electricity generation and storage,
   respectively. As a result, the energy and exergy efficiencies and the
   sustainability index for the wind turbine are found to be higher than
   the ones for solar photovoltaic (PV) system. Also, the overall exergy
   efficiency of the system is found to be higher than the corresponding
   overall energy efficiency. Furthermore, for this system, it can be
   concluded that wind turbine with 60 gCO(2)/month is more
   environmentally-benign than the solar PV system with 75 gCO(2)/month.
   Finally, the total exergoeconomic parameter is found to be 0.26 W/\$,
   when the energy loss is considered, while it is 0.41 W/\$, when the
   total of exergy loss and destruction rates are taken into account.

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate a solar-assisted biomass gasification
   system for hydrogen production and assess its performance
   thermodynamically using actual literature data. We also analyze the
   entire system both energetically and exergetically and evaluate its
   performance through both energy and exergy efficiencies. Three
   feedstocks, namely beech charcoal, sewage sludge and fluff, are
   considered as samples in the same reactor. While energy efficiencies
   vary from 14.14\% to 27.29\%, exergy efficiencies change from 10.43\% to
   23.92\%. We use a sustainability index (SI), as a function of exergy
   efficiency, to calculate the impacts on sustainable development and
   environment. This index changes from 1.12 to 1.31 due to intensive
   utilization of solar energy. Also, environmental impact of these systems
   is evaluated through calculating the specific greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. They are determined to be 17.97, 17.51 and 26.74 g CO2/MJ H-2

Abstract = {{An in vivo method to measure wear in total knee replacements was
   developed using dynamic single-plane fluoroscopy. A dynamic,
   anthropomorphic total knee replacement phantom with interchangeable,
   custom-fabricated components of known wear volume was created, and
   dynamic imaging was performed. For each frame of the fluoroscopy data,
   the relative location of the femoral and tibial components were
   determined, and the apparent intersection of the femoral component with
   the tibial insert was used to calculate wear volume, wear depth, and
   frequency of intersection. No difference was found between the measured
   and true wear volumes. The precision of the measurements was +/- 39.7
   mm(3) for volume and +/- 0.126 mm for wear depth. The results suggest
   the system is capable of tracking wear volume changes across multiple
   time points in patients. As a dynamic technique, this method can provide
   both kinematic and wear measurements that may be useful for evaluating
   new implant designs for total knee replacements.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the free rise of small air bubbles in aqueous solutions
   of xanthan gum and carboxymethylcellulose. The rheological behavior of
   the biopolymer solutions used in our experiments was thoroughly
   characterized. The terminal rise velocity of the bubbles was measured by
   imaging their motion with a high-speed video camera. The rise velocity
   increased as a power law in bubble volume for the smallest bubbles
   studied, as expected in the Stokes flow regime, but became approximately
   constant for larger bubbles. We observed no discontinuity in the rise
   velocity over the range of bubble volumes studied, from 1 mu l to 4000
   mu l. The shape of the bubbles changed from spherical to cusped to
   spherical cap as the volume increased. While the smaller bubbles rose
   vertically through the polymer solutions, the larger bubbles rose in a
   spiral or zig-zag path. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Platinum-nanoparticle-based catalysts are widely used in many important
   chemical processes and automobile industries. Downsizing catalyst
   nanoparticles to single atoms is highly desirable to maximize their use
   efficiency, however, very challenging. Here we report a practical
   synthesis for isolated single Pt atoms anchored to graphene nanosheet
   using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. ALD offers the
   capability of precise control of catalyst size span from single atom,
   subnanometer cluster to nanoparticle. The single-atom catalysts exhibit
   significantly improved catalytic activity (up to 10 times) over that of
   the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. X-ray absorption fine
   structure (XAFS) analyses reveal that the low-coordination and partially
   unoccupied densities of states of 5d orbital of Pt atoms are responsible
   for the excellent performance. This work is anticipated to form the
   basis for the exploration of a next generation of highly efficient
   single-atom catalysts for various applications.}},

Abstract = {{The wake of a freely flying European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) has
   been measured using high speed, time-resolved, particle image
   velocimetry, simultaneously with high speed cameras which imaged the
   bird. These have been used to generate vector maps that can be
   associated with the bird's location and wing configuration in the wind
   tunnel. Time series of measurements have been expressed as composite
   wake plots which depict segments of the wing beat cycle for various
   spanwise locations in the wake. Measurements indicate that downwash is
   not produced during the upstroke, suggesting that the upstroke does not
   generate lift. As well, the wake velocities imply the presence of
   streamwise vortical structures, in addition to tip vortices. These two
   characteristics indicate similarities between the wake of a bird and the
   wake of a bat, which may be general features of the wakes of flapping
   wings. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Distribution of spanwise enstrophy in the near wake of three symmetric
   elongated bluff bodies at high Reynolds number}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},

Abstract = {{Three elongated bluff bodies with a chord-to-thickness ratio of seven
   have been studied experimentally at a Reynolds number based on body
   thickness of 3x10(4). The defining feature of elongated bluff bodies is
   the interaction between trailing edge Karman vortex shedding and leading
   edge separation-reattachment. We have used particle image velocimetry
   with different body geometries to investigate this interaction for three
   distinct cases: (i) small leading edge separation-reattachment length;
   (ii) large leading edge separation-reattachment length; and (iii) one
   case in between these bounds. The leading edge separation-reattachment
   is a significant source of spanwise enstrophy. Thus, changes in the wake
   enstrophy distribution are of particular interest. We have examined the
   time-averaged distribution and production of both the turbulent kinetic
   energy and the spanwise enstrophy in the near wake region utilizing
   proper orthogonal decomposition on the vorticity field to distinguish
   between turbulence and the periodic contribution of the trailing edge
   vortex shedding. A significant increase in the lateral distribution of
   spanwise enstrophy is observed exceeding the typical bounds of the near
   wake - which is due to the leading edge separation-reattachment and the
   resulting scale of the flow at the trailing edge. As a result,
   strengthening the leading edge flow, which tends to weaken the trailing
   edge vortex shedding, may lead to enhanced mixing in the wake. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The dynamic performance of helical piles is of significant interest
   because such piles can offer an efficient alternative to conventional
   piling systems in many applications where the foundation is subjected to
   dynamic loads. This paper presents the results of full-scale dynamic
   vertical load tests on a 9.0 m double-helix, large-capacity helical pile
   and a driven steel pile of the same length and shaft geometry. Comparing
   the results is considered necessary to evaluate, qualitatively and
   quantitatively, the dynamic performance characteristics of
   large-capacity helical piles. The test piles were closed-ended steel
   shafts with an outer diameter of 324 mm. The piles were subjected to
   harmonic (quadratic) loading of different force intensities acting
   within a frequency range that covered the resonant frequencies of the
   tested pile-soil-cap systems. The dynamic and static properties of the
   subsurface soil adjacent to the test piles were determined using the
   seismic cone penetration technique and the conventional soil boring and
   testing methods. In addition, field observations are compared with
   calculated responses using the program DYNA 6 to better understand the
   pile-soil interaction for the case of helical piles. The effects of soil
   nonlinearity and pile-soil separation were accounted for in the analysis
   by employing a weak boundary zone around the piles in the analytical
   model. The experimental results show that the dynamic behaviour of
   helical piles is essentially the same as that of driven steel piles with
   the same geometric properties (without the helix plates). In addition,
   it was demonstrated that the program DYNA 6 can accurately simulate the
   behaviour of both helical and driven piles.}},

Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{19-27}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents a probabilistic methodology considering the
   correlations between the input variables for the failure probability
   evaluation of corroding pipelines based on the corrosion module of the
   FITNET FFS procedure. A computer program based on this method is
   developed to calculate the failure probability of pipelines by
   considering different numbers of defects and different elapsed times. In
   case of one defect, the correlation between the initial defect depth and
   the initial defect length has the most significant impact on the failure
   probability of the pipeline. If the correlations between these two
   parameters for an individual defect are not considered, the prediction
   results are nonconservative when the failure probability is below 40\%
   and conservative when it is above 40\%. In case of multiple defects, the
   independent assumption of variables generally leads to a conservative
   estimate of the failure probability. The conservatism increases if the
   elapsed time and/or the actual correlation coefficients of the variables
   increase. The correlation of the operating pressure, the initial defect
   depth and material ultimate tensile strength at the location of
   different defects has a larger impact on the failure probability than
   the correlation of other parameters at different defects. The upper
   bound failure probability calculated by engineering method corresponds
   to that calculated using the presented method without considering the
   correlation between input parameters. This confirms the validity of the
   presented model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Toward in vivo lung's tissue incompressibility characterization for
   tumor motion modeling in radiation therapy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: A novel technique is proposed to characterize lung tissue
   incompressibility variation during respiration. Estimating lung tissue
   incompressibility parameter variations resulting from air content
   variation throughout respiration is critical for computer assisted tumor
   motion tracking. Continuous tumor motion is a major challenge in lung
   cancer radiotherapy, especially with external beam radiotherapy. If not
   accounted for, this motion may lead to areas of radiation overdosage for
   normal tissue. Given the unavailability of imaging modality that can be
   used effectively for real-time lung tumor tracking, computer assisted
   approach based on tissue deformation estimation can be a good
   alternative. This approach involves lung biomechanical model where its
   fidelity depends on input tissue properties. This investigation shows
   that considering variable tissue incompressibility parameter is very
   important for predicting tumor motion accurately, hence improving the
   lung radiotherapy outcome.
   Methods: First, an in silico lung phantom study was conducted to
   demonstrate the importance of employing variable Poisson's ratio for
   tumor motion predication. After it was established that modeling this
   variability is critical for accurate tumor motion prediction, an
   optimization based technique was developed to estimate lung tissue
   Poisson's ratio as a function of respiration cycle time. In this
   technique, the Poisson's ratio and lung pressure value were varied
   systematically until optimal values were obtained, leading to maximum
   similarity between acquired and simulated 4D CT lung images. This
   technique was applied in an ex vivo porcine lung study where simulated
   images were constructed using the end exhale CT image and deformation
   fields obtained from the lung's FE modeling of each respiration time
   increment. To model the tissue, linear elastic and Marlow hyperelastic
   material models in conjunction with variable Poisson's ratio were used.
   Results: The phantom study showed that the tumor motion trajectory and
   its final locations obtained from simulations with and without
   considering tissue incompressibility variation were very different. For
   example, tumor displacements in the z direction were -11.23 and -38.10
   mm obtained with the Marlow hyperelastic material model in conjunction
   with constant and variable Poisson's ratio, respectively. By comparing
   the acquired 4D-CT image sequence of the porcine lung with their image
   sequence counterparts obtained from the hyperelastic model with constant
   and variable Poisson's ratio, it was shown that using variable tissue
   incompressibility reduced errors significantly in tumor motion
   prediction.
   Conclusions: This investigation demonstrates the importance of
   incompressibility variation estimation and utilization for accurate
   tumor tracking in computer assisted lung external beam radiation
   therapy. An optimization framework was developed to estimate a Poisson's
   ratio function in terms of respiration cycle time using experimental
   image data of the lung. Utilizing this function along with respiratory
   system FE modeling may lead to more effective tumor targeting, hence
   potentially improving the outcome of lung external beam radiation
   therapy techniques. This is particularly true for stereotactic body
   radiation therapy where only one or a few fraction treatments are
   applied, precluding the possibility of averaging out dosimetric
   deviations introduced by the respiratory motion. (C) 2013 American

Title = {{Three-dimensional segmentation of three-dimensional ultrasound carotid
   atherosclerosis using sparse field level sets}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) vessel wall volume (VWV)
   provides a 3D measurement of carotid artery wall remodeling and
   atherosclerotic plaque and is sensitive to temporal changes of carotid
   plaque burden. Unfortunately, although 3DUS VWV provides many advantages
   compared to measurements of arterial wall thickening or plaque alone, it
   is still not widely used in research or clinical practice because of the
   inordinate amount of time required to train observers and to generate
   3DUS VWV measurements. In this regard, semiautomated methods for
   segmentation of the carotid media-adventitia boundary (MAB) and the
   lumen-intima boundary (LIB) would greatly improve the time to train
   observers and for them to generate 3DUS VWV measurements with high
   reproducibility.
   Methods: The authors describe a 3D algorithm based on a modified sparse
   field level set method for segmenting the MAB and LIB of the common
   carotid artery (CCA) from 3DUS images. To the authors' knowledge, the
   proposed algorithm is the first direct 3D segmentation method, which has
   been validated for segmenting both the carotid MAB and the LIB from 3DUS
   images for the purpose of computing VWV. Initialization of the algorithm
   requires the observer to choose anchor points on each boundary on a set
   of transverse slices with a user-specified interslice distance (ISD), in
   which larger ISD requires fewer user interactions than smaller ISD. To
   address the challenges of the MAB and LIB segmentations from 3DUS
   images, the authors integrated regional- and boundary-based image
   statistics, expert initializations, and anatomically motivated boundary
   separation into the segmentation. The MAB is segmented by incorporating
   local region-based image information, image gradients, and the anchor
   points provided by the observer. Moreover, a local smoothness term is
   utilized to maintain the smooth surface of the MAB. The LIB is segmented
   by constraining its evolution using the already segmented surface of the
   MAB, in addition to the global region-based information and the anchor
   points. The algorithm-generated surfaces were sliced and evaluated with
   respect to manual segmentations on a slice-by-slice basis using 21 3DUS
   images.
   Results: The authors used ISD of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 mm for algorithm
   initialization to generate segmentation results. The algorithm-generated
   accuracy and intraobserver variability results are comparable to the
   previous methods, but with fewer user interactions. For example, for the
   ISD of 3 mm, the algorithm yielded an average Dice coefficient of 94.4\%
   +/- 2.2\% and 90.6\% +/- 5.0\% for the MAB and LIB and the coefficient
   of variation of 6.8\% for computing the VWV of the CCA, while requiring
   only 1.72 min (vs 8.3 min for manual segmentation) for a 3DUS image.
   Conclusions: The proposed 3D semiautomated segmentation algorithm
   yielded high-accuracy and high-repeatability, while reducing the expert
   interaction required for initializing the algorithm than the previous 2D
   methods. (c) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{We performed stochastic finite-fault simulations for the moment
   magnitude (M) 9.0 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake at KiK-net sites using
   the EXSIM algorithm (Motazedian and Atkinson, 2005; Atkinson et al.,
   2009; Boore, 2009). The average response spectra of the simulated ground
   motions were calculated and compared with observed ground motions to
   determine whether stochastic finite-fault modeling can reproduce key
   features of the recorded motions. To account for variations in source
   characteristics, we examined three rupture-process models: a
   single-event model with random slip distribution, a single-event model
   with prescribed slip distribution (Yagi, 2011; see Data and Resources),
   and a multiple-event model with five strong-motion generation areas
   (Kurahashi and Irikura, 2011).
   The analysis results indicate that the single-event models can model the
   high-frequency response spectra values well but result in significant
   model bias in the low-frequency range. By contrast, the multiple-event
   model produces ground motions that are in good agreement with the
   observations in both high-and low-frequency ranges. Furthermore, the
   multiple-event model can capture temporal characteristics of observed
   ground motions, including multiphase arrivals of major seismic-wave
   groups. Importantly, the calibrated EXSIM model for the 2011 Tohoku
   earthquake can be used to produce predicted ground motions in other
   regions, such as the Cascadia subduction region of North America, by
   suitable modifications of regional attenuation and site parameters. The
   suitability of the simple stochastic simulation method to prediction of
   motions for future events, the details of which are poorly known, makes
   its calibration to Tohoku a useful exercise.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we describe the use of unfolded graphene as a three
   dimensional (3D) conducting network for LiFePO4 nanoparticle growth.
   Compared with stacked graphene, which has a wrinkled structure, the use
   of unfolded graphene enables better dispersion of LiFePO4 and restricts
   the LiFePO4 particle size at the nanoscale. More importantly, it allows
   each LiFePO4 particle to be attached to the conducting layer, which
   could greatly enhance the electronic conductivity, thereby realizing the
   full potential of the active materials. Based on its superior structure,
   after post-treatment for 12 hours, the LiFePO4-unfolded graphene
   nanocomposite achieved a discharge capacity of 166.2 mA h g(-1) in the
   1st cycle, which is 98\% of the theoretical capacity (170 mA h g(-1)).
   The composite also displayed stable cycling behavior up to 100 cycles,
   whereas the LiFePO4-stacked graphene composite with a similar carbon
   content could deliver a discharge capacity of only 77 mA h g(-1) in the
   1st cycle. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) provided
   spectroscopic understanding of the crystallinity of LiFePO4 and chemical
   bonding between LiFePO4 and unfolded graphene.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The flow structure and convective heat transfer mechanisms in Unglazed
   Transpired solar Collectors (UTCs) are crucial to their performance.
   High-resolution, 3-dimensional, steady, Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes
   (RANS), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been used to
   analyze the convective heat transfer processes for both flat and
   corrugated UTCs. The performance of five potentially suitable turbulence
   closure models: Standard k-epsilon, Renormalization Normal Group
   k-epsilon (RNG k-epsilon), Realizable k-epsilon, Shear Stress Transport
   k-omega (SST k-omega) and Reynolds Stress Model (RSM), has been
   evaluated. Two scenarios have been considered: a flat UTC under free
   stream approaching flow and a corrugated UTC subjected to a plane wall
   jet flow. The results were compared against experimental data from the
   literature and those obtained using a full-scale experimental set-up in
   a solar simulator, in terms of the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy
   of the airflow as well as the plate surface and air temperature. The
   validation study showed that the RNG k-epsilon model has the best
   overall performance for both UTC geometries at reasonable accuracy and
   computing cost. A parametric analysis has been conducted using the RNG
   k-epsilon model at 3 m/s approaching flow velocity, for different
   suction flow rates (0.01 and 0.06 m/s) and free stream turbulence
   intensities (0.1\% and 20\%). The results showed that in UTCs, it is the
   suction velocity, rather than the suction ratio of V-s/U-infinity, that
   has the most profound impact on the boundary layer development and
   thermal efficiency. For flat UTCs, the presence of perforations is more
   significant than the level of turbulence intensity in the approach flow.
   However, for corrugated UTCs, the incident turbulence intensity plays a
   more important role in the system performance than the perforation
   dimensions due to the turbulent interaction between the corrugated
   geometry and the incoming flow. Although a high suction rate can help
   maintain the asymptotic boundary layer profiles and, hence simplify the
   energy analysis of UTCs, it is not applicable in practice due to the
   requirement of large fan power. These outcomes will not only further
   advance the development of UTCs and optimize their performance but also
   provide insights for the development of simplified thermal analysis
   models for use in building energy simulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{537-545}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: High-resolution computed tomography (CT)
   measurements of emphysema typically use Hounsfield unit (HU) density
   histogram thresholds or observer scores based on regions of low x-ray
   attenuation. Our objective was to develop an automated measurement of
   emphysema using principal Component analysis (PCA) of the CT density
   histogram.
   Materials and Methods: Ninety-seven ex-smokers, including 53 subjects
   with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 44 asymptomatic
   subjects (AEs), provided written informed consent to imaging as well as
   plethysmography and spirometry. We applied PCA to the CT density
   histogram to generate whole lung and regional density histogram
   principal components including the first and second components and the
   sum of both principal components (density histogram principal component
   score {[}DHPCS]). Significant relationships for DHPCS with single HU
   thresholds, pulmonary function measurements, an expert's emphysema
   score, and hyperpolarized He-3 magnetic resonance imaging apparent
   diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were determined using linear regression
   and Pearson coefficients. Receiver operator characteristics analysis was
   performed using forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital
   capacity (FVC) as the independent diagnostic.
   Results: There was a significant difference (P < .0001) between AE and
   COPD subjects for DHPCS; FEV1/FVC; diffusing capacity of lung for carbon
   monoxide(\%predicted); attenuation values below -950, -910, and -856 HU;
   and He-3 ADCs. There were significant correlations for DHPCS with
   FEV1/FVC (r = -0.85, P < .0001); diffusing capacity of lung for carbon
   monoxide(\%predicted) (r = -0.67, P < .0001); attenuation values below
   -950/-910/-856 HU (r = 0.93/0.96/0.76, P < .0001); and He-3 ADCs (r =
   0.85, P < .0001). Receiver operator characteristics analysis showed a
   91\% classification rate for DHPCS.
   Conclusions: We generated an automated emphysema score using PCA of the
   CT density histogram with a 91\% COPD classification rate that showed
   strong and significant correlations with pulmonary function tests,
   single HU thresholds, and He-3 magnetic resonance imaging ADCs.}},

   total phosphorus (30100 mg PO4-P L1) and nitrates (200300 mg NO3-N L1).
   Current technologies for effluent treatment have limitations of
   performance and high maintenance costs. The goals of this study were to
   investigate strategies which combine alkali treatment and microalgae
   cultivation for removal of nutrients from hydroponic greenhouse
   effluent. RESULTS: Treatment with strong alkali was found to effectively
   remove 97\% of total phophorous especially in the form of phosphate,
   without affecting the nitrate ion concentration in the greenhouse
   effluent. After alkali treatment, marine algae Dunaliella salina (UTEX
   1644) cultivation on treated hydroponic effluent (pH 7.5) showed > 80\%
   decrease in nitrate content in the effluent within 4 days of
   cultivation. In the same period, the carotene content of the micro-algal
   system was in the range 0.5 +/- 0.02 mu g mg1 (dry cell weight) which
   was 1.5 times higher than in the control. CONCLUSION: This study
   demonstrated that combination of a conventional alkali precipitation
   method with a microalgae treatment system is a highly efficient approach
   for the removal of excess nutrients from hydroponic greenhouse effluent
   in a short treatment time. The microalgae can provide a source of value
   in the form of carotene. (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Using statistic parameters of solids holdup signals, a moment
   consistency data processing method (MCDPM) was proposed. Experiments
   were carried out using FCC particles of 76 mu m under different
   operating conditions, and MCDPM was used to successfully obtain solids
   holdups of the dense and dilute phases and the phase fractions over five
   fluidization regimes, bubbling (BFB), turbulent (TFB), circulating
   turbulent (CTFB), high-density circulating (HDCFB), and circulating
   (CFB) fluidized bed systems. In BFB, TFB, and CTFB regimes, only dense
   phase fraction decreased with increasing air velocity, while the
   transition from HDCFB to CFB experienced appreciable change in the
   solids holdup of the dense phase. From the low-velocity to the
   high-velocity regimes, both the solids holdup and the fraction of the
   dense phase experienced a drastic decrease, suggesting that this
   transition corresponded to a profound change in flow structure and
   further suggesting that CTFB is in reality still a TFB. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This study contributes with a computational fluid dynamic simulation
   based on the numerical solution of continuity and momentum balance
   equations in a three-dimensional (3-D) framework. The proposed down flow
   gas-solid suspension model includes a unit configuration and CD drag
   coefficients recommended for these units. Computational particle fluid
   dynamics (CPFD) calculations using suitable boundary conditions and a
   Barracuda (version: 14.5.2) software allow predicting local solid
   densification and asymmetric ``wavy flows.{''} In addition, this model
   forecasts for the conditions of this study higher particle velocity than
   gas velocity, once the flow reaches 1 m from the gas injector. These
   findings are accompanied with observations about the intrinsic
   rotational character of the flow. CPFD numerical 3-D calculations show
   that both gas and particle velocities involve the following: (a) an
   axial velocity component, (b) a radial velocity component (about 5\% of
   axial velocity component), and (c) an angular velocity component. The
   calculated velocity components and the rotational flow pattern are
   established for a wide range of solid flux/gas flux ratios. (C) 2012

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{9-17}},

Abstract = {{The Monte Carlo simulation based method requires considerable
   computational efforts for the estimation of functional reliability
   analysis. Efficient sampling techniques can be adopted for performing
   robust estimations with limited number of samples and associated with
   computational time. An innovative reliability analysis method known as
   improved Line Sampling, which incorporates the quadratic response
   surface taken as a fast-running surrogate in replacement of a
   long-running thermal hydraulic system code to improve the computational
   efficiency, is presented for the functional reliability analysis. In the
   present method, the important direction pointing towards failure region
   is obtained from the simulated samples with Markov Chain, instead of the
   original design point in the standard normal space. Simultaneously, the
   simulated samples can be used to evaluate the functional failure
   probability with the response surface. This application is illustrated
   for the functional reliability estimation of a passive residual heat
   removal system due to the epistemic uncertainties. The numerical results
   demonstrate the high level of computational efficiency and excellent
   computational accuracy by comparison to direct Monte Carlo simulation
   and original Line Sampling based on design point simulation. The
   sensitivity, defined as the partial derivative of the failure
   probability with respect to the distribution parameter can help to
   identify the relative contribution of the individual parameter to output
   response and guide the optimization design. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We acquired Johnson BV photometry of the binary Be disk system delta

   it to probe the innermost regions of the disk. We found that several
   disk building events have occurred during this time, resulting in an
   overall brightening in the V band and reddening of the system. In
   addition to these long-term trends, we found cyclical variability in
   each observing season on timescales between 60 and 100 days. We were
   able to reproduce the changes in the magnitude and color of delta Sco
   using our theoretical models and found that variable mass-loss rates in
   the range 2.5-7.0 x 10(-9) M-circle dot yr(-1) over similar to 35 days

Abstract = {{Injection of liquid into fluidized beds is widely applied in the

   may be optimized to minimize agglomerate formation, which is detrimental
   to many industrial operations such as Fluid Coking. The effect of bed
   hydrodynamics on liquid distribution was investigated with a new,

Abstract = {{To elucidate the effects of frontal plane lower limb alignment on gait
   biomechanics, we compared knee joint moments and frontal plane angular
   impulse before and after varus or valgus producing osteotomy in patients
   with lateral or medial compartment osteoarthritis, and in healthy
   participants with neutral alignment. Thirty-nine subjects participated
   (13 valgus gonarthrosis, 13 varus gonarthrosis, 13 controls). Patients
   underwent 3D gait analysis and radiographic assessment of alignment
   (mechanical axis angle; MAA) before and 6 months after surgery, and were
   compared to controls. Mean changes (95\%CI) in frontal plane angular
   impulse indicated a 0.82\%BW Ht . s (0.49,1.14) increase in adduction
   impulse in patients after varus osteotomy, and a 0.61\%BW Ht . s
   (0.37,0.86) decrease in adduction impulse in patients after valgus
   osteotomy, equating to a 53\% and 45\% change from preoperative values,
   respectively. Preoperative frontal plane angular impulse was
   significantly different between both patient groups and controls before
   surgery, but not after. The cross-sectional data suggest that frontal
   plane angular impulse is very highly correlated to MAA before surgery
   (R=0.87), but not after (R=0.39), and that an adduction impulse
   predominates until 7 degrees of valgus, at which point an abduction
   impulse predominates. The prospective surgical realignment data indicate
   that for every 1 degrees change in MAA toward varus, there is a 0.1\%BW
   Ht . s (or 1.6 N m s) change in frontal plane knee angular impulse
   toward adduction, and vice versa. These overall findings illustrate the
   potent effects that lower limb alignment can have on frontal plane gait
   biomechanics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Global research is moving forward in developing hydrogen as a renewable
   energy source in order to alleviate concerns related to carbon dioxide
   emissions and depleting fossil fuels resources. Biohydrogen has the
   potential to replace current hydrogen production technologies relying
   heavily on fossil fuels. Batch and continuous systems employing pure
   mesophiles and thermophiles isolates and co-cultures of isolates have
   been investigated. The co-cultures of the isolates achieved better
   results than mono-cultures of the isolates with respect to different
   parameters. This paper presents a critical review of the literature
   reporting on fermentative biohydrogen production by pure cultures of
   bacteria in different systems. Synergies between different types of
   bacteria, i.e. strict and facultative, and a comparison between mono-
   and co-cultures, types of feedstocks, and preferred feedstocks for mono-

Abstract = {{In this paper, the 3-D deformation of an initially uncharged and
   spherical droplet suspended in another immiscible fluid under dc uniform
   electric field is numerically investigated. Both the droplet and the
   ambient fluids are considered as incompressible Newtonian fluids. In all
   the cases both fluids are slightly conductive ({''}leaky{''}
   dielectrics) with the ambient phase more conductive than the droplet.
   Three regimes were observed for droplet deformation: (1) oblate
   deformation (which can be predicted from the small perturbation theory),
   (2) oscillatory oblate-prolate deformation and (3) breakup of the
   droplet. It was found that an increased electric field causes the
   prolate deformation to be decreased in the oscillation regime. Further
   increase of the electric field leads to breakup, which creates a
   toroidal shape. It was shown that the threshold electric field strength
   depends on the viscosity ratio of both fluids. The critical electric
   capillary number beyond which the droplet eventually breaks up in a
   symmetric manner has been determined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrochemical detection for point-of-care diagnostics is of great
   interest due to its high sensitivity, fast analysis time and ability to
   operate on a small scale. Herein, we report the fabrication of a
   nanoporous thin-film electrode and its application in the configuration
   of a simple and robust enzymatic biosensor. The nanoporous thin-film was
   formed in a planar gold electrode through an alloying/dealloying
   process. The nanoporous electrode has an electroactive surface area up
   to 40 times higher than that of a flat gold electrode of the same size.
   The nanoporous electrode was used as a substrate to build an enzymatic
   electrochemical biosensor for the detection of glucose in standard
   samples and control serum samples. The example glucose biosensor has a
   linear response up to 30 mM, with a high sensitivity of 0.50 mu A mM(-1)
   mm(-2), and excellent anti-interference ability against lactate, uric
   acid and ascorbic acid. Abundant catalyst and enzyme were stably
   entrapped in the nanoporous structure, leading to high stability and
   reproducibility of the biosensor. Development of such nanoporous
   structure enables the miniaturization of high-performance
   electrochemical biosensors for point-of-care diagnostics or

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel method for preparation of phosphorylated polyvinyl alcohol
   (p-PVA) membranes was developed and used to synthesize a series of
   membranes with different degree of phosphorylation (4-9 wt \% of
   phosphorus). The optimal mass ratio of PVA:H3PO2 was found to be
   4.0:1.0, while the optimal curing time was 3 h at a temperature of 120
   degrees C. The membranes possessed good mechanical robustness and
   chemical stability in acidic media. The possible pathway of PVA
   phosphorylation leading to formation of P-C bonds was suggested based on
   IR-spectra of the membranes. The water flux (6.08 x 10(-2) g cm(-2)
   h(-1)) and permeability of ferric ions (3.5 x 10(-5) cm(2) min(-1)) were
   comparable to those of commercial Nafion 117 membrane. The dependence of
   the proton conductivity on the concentration of H2SO4 at 22 degrees C
   was studied that allowed us to predict the intrinsic proton conductivity
   of the p-PVA membrane (5.5 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)). The partial charges on
   oxygen atoms in the proposed structural units were calculated and the
   results permitted to suggest a mechanism of proton transport. The
   performance of the p-PVA membrane was tested in a Fe3+/H-2 redox fuel
   cell showing power density of 71 mW cm(-2) at 200 mA cm(-2). (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In this work, solar TiO2 photocatalysis was used for sacrificial
   hydrogen generation from formaldehyde. Platinum was loaded onto a TiO2
   photocatalyst by a solar photodeposition method to suppress the

   Photocatalytic hydrogen generation from formaldehyde was influenced by
   the solution pH, platinum loading (wt \%) on TiO2, catalyst
   concentration, light intensity, and initial formaldehyde concentration.
   A Langmuir-type model fitted well with the experimental data, and the
   values of surface reaction rate constant, k, and the adsorption
   equilibrium constant, K, are 2.3598 x 10(-6) mol min(-1) and 17.73 M-1,

Abstract = {{Cancer detection and classification have been the focus of many imaging
   and therapeutic research studies. Elastography is a non-invasive
   technique to visualize suspicious soft tissue areas where tissue
   stiffness is used as image contrast mechanism. In this study, a breast
   ultrasound elastography system including software and hardware is
   proposed. Unlike current elastography systems that image the tissue
   strain and present it as an approximation to relative tissue stiffness,
   this system is capable of imaging the breast absolute Young's modulus in
   fast fashion. To improve the quality of elastography images, a novel
   system consisting of two load cells has been attached to the ultrasound
   probe. The load cells measure the breast surface forces to be used for
   calculating the tissue stress distribution throughout the breast. To
   facilitate fast imaging, this stress calculation is conducted by an
   accelerated finite element method. Acquired tissue displacements and
   surface force data are used as input to the proposed Young's modulus
   reconstruction technique. Numerical and tissue mimicking phantom studies
   were conducted for validating the proposed system. These studies
   indicated that fast imaging of breast tissue absolute Young's modulus
   using the proposed ultrasound elastography system is feasible. The
   tissue mimicking phantom study indicated that the system is capable of
   providing reliable absolute Young's modulus values for both normal
   tissue and tumour as the maximum Young's modulus reconstruction error
   was less than 6\%. This demonstrates that the proposed system has a good
   potential to be used for clinical breast cancer assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Double-row suture anchor fixation of the rotator cuff was
   developed to reduce repair failure rates. The purpose of this study was
   to determine the effects of simulated rotator cuff tears and subsequent
   repairs using single- and double-row suture anchor fixation on
   three-dimensional shoulder kinematics. It was hypothesized that both
   single- and double-row repairs would be effective in restoring active
   intact kinematics of the shoulder. Materials and Methods: Sixteen
   fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulder specimens (eight matched pairs) were
   tested using a custom loading apparatus designed to simulate
   unconstrained motion of the shoulder. In each specimen, the rotator cuff
   was sectioned to create a medium-sized (2 cm) tear. Within each pair,
   one specimen was randomized to a single-row suture anchor repair, while
   the contralateral side underwent a double-row suture anchor repair.
   Joint kinematics were recorded for intact, torn, and repaired scenarios
   using an electromagnetic tracking device. Results: Active kinematics
   confirmed that a medium-sized rotator cuff tear affected glenohumeral
   kinematics when compared to the intact state. Single- and double-row
   suture anchor repairs restored the kinematics of the intact specimen.
   Conclusions: This study illustrates the effects of medium-sized rotator
   cuff tears and their repairs on active glenohumeral kinematics. No
   significant difference ( P >= 0.10) was found between the kinematics of
   single- and double-row techniques in medium-sized rotator cuff repairs.
   Clinical Relevance: Determining the relative effects of single- and
   double-row suture anchor repairs of the rotator cuff will allow
   physicians to be better equipped to treat patients with rotator cuff
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{The flow regimes associated with 2:1 aspect ratio elliptical planform
   cavities of varying depth immersed in a turbulent boundary layer at a
   Reynolds number of 8.7 x 10(4), based on the minor axis of the cavity,
   have been quantified from particle image velocimetry measurements and
   three-dimensional steady computational fluid dynamics simulations
   (Reynolds stress model closure). Although these elliptical cavity flows
   have some similarities with nominally two-dimensional and rectangular
   cases, three-dimensional effects due to the low aspect ratio and
   curvature of the walls give rise to features exclusive to low aspect
   ratio elliptical cavities, including formation of cellular structures at
   intermediate depths and vortex structures within and downstream of the
   cavity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent major post-hurricane damage assessments in the United States have
   reported that the most common damages result from the loss of building
   roof coverings and subsequent wind driven rain intrusion. In an effort
   to look further into this problem, this paper presents a full-scale
   (Wall of Wind -WoW-) investigation of external and underneath wind
   pressures on roof tiles installed on a low-rise building model with
   various gable roofs. The optimal dimensions for the low-rise building
   that was tested with the WOW are 2.74 m (9 ft) long, 2.13 m (7 ft) wide,
   and 2.13 m (7 ft) high. The building is tested with interchangeable
   gable roofs at three different slopes (2: 12; 5: 12 and 7: 12). The
   field tiles of these gable roofs are considered with three different
   tile profiles namely high (HP), medium (MP), and low profiles (LP) in
   accordance with Florida practice. For the ridge, two different types
   namely rounded and three-sided tiles were considered. The effect of
   weather block on the ``underneath{''} pressure that develops between the
   tiles and the roof deck was also examined. These tests revealed the
   following: high pressure coefficients for the ridge tile compared to the
   field tiles, including those located at the corners; considerably higher
   pressure on the gable end ridge tiles compared to ridge tiles at the
   middle of the ridge line; and marginally higher pressure on barrel type
   tiles compared to the three-sided ridge tiles. The weather blocking of
   clay tiles, while useful in preventing water intrusion, it doesn't have
   significant effect on the wind loads of the field tiles. The case with
   weather blocking produces positive mean underneath pressure on the field
   tiles on the windward side thus reducing the net pressures on the
   windward surface of the roof. On the leeward side, reductions in net
   pressure to a non-significant level were observed due to the opposite
   direction of the internal and external pressures. The effect of the
   weather blocking on the external pressure on the ridge tile was
   negligible.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first of two companion papers that analyse ten years of
   on-site monitoring data for the Confederation Bridge to determine the
   validity of the original wind speeds and wind loads predicted in 1994
   when the bridge was being designed. The check of the original design
   values is warranted because the design wind speed at the middle of
   Northumberland Strait was derived from data collected at shore-based
   weather stations, and the design wind loads were based on tests of
   section and full-aeroelastic models in the wind tunnel. This first paper
   uses wind, tilt, and acceleration monitoring data to determine the
   static and dynamic responses of the bridge, which are then used in the
   second paper to derive the static and dynamic wind loads. It is shown
   that the design ten-minute mean wind speed with a 100-year return period
   is 1.5\% less than the 1994 design value, and that the bridge has been
   subjected to this design event once on November 7, 2001. The dynamic
   characteristics of the instrumented spans of the bridge including
   frequencies, mode shapes and damping are in good agreement with
   published values reported by others. The on-site monitoring data show
   bridge response to be that of turbulent buffeting which is consistent
   with the response predicted at the design stage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses ten years of on-site monitoring data for the

   loads from the 1994 and 2009 wind tunnel aerodynamic model tests. The
   research shows, for the first time, that the aerodynamic model-based
   methodology originally developed in 1994 is a very accurate method for
   deriving wind loads for structural design. The research also confirms
   that the bridge has not experienced its specified (i.e., unfactored)
   wind force effects since it was opened to traffic in 1997, even during
   the most severe event that has occurred during this period.}},

Abstract = {{Edge-lit light guide panels (LGPs) with micropatterned surfaces
   represent a new technology for developing small- and medium-sized
   illumination sources for application such as automotive, residential
   lighting, and advertising displays. The shape, density, and spatial
   distribution of the micro-optical structures (MOSs) imprinted on the
   transparent LGP must be selected to achieve high brightness and uniform
   luminance over the active surface. We examine how round-tip cylindrical
   MOSs fabricated by precision micromilling can be used to create
   patterned surfaces on low-cost transparent polymethyl-methacrylate
   substrates for high-intensity illumination applications. The impact of
   varying the number, pitch, spatial distribution, and depth of the
   optical microstructures on lighting performance is initially
   investigated using LightTools (TM) simulation software. To illustrate
   the microfabrication process, several 100 x 100 x 6 mm(3) LGP prototypes
   are constructed and tested. The prototypes include an ``optimized{''}
   array of MOSs that exhibit near-uniform illumination (approximately
   89\%) across its active light-emitting surface. Although the average
   illumination was 7.3\% less than the value predicted from numerical
   simulation, it demonstrates how LGPs can be created using micromilling
   operations. Customized MOS arrays with a bright rectangular pattern near
   the center of the panel and a sequence of MOSs that illuminate a
   predefined logo are also presented. c 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{Tactile sensing and force reflection have been the subject of
   considerable research for tumor localization in soft-tissue palpation.
   The work presented in this paper investigates the relevance of force
   feedback (presented visually as well as directly) during tactile sensing
   (presented visually only) for tumor localization using an experimental
   setup close to one that could be applied for real robotics-assisted
   minimally invasive surgery. The setup is a teleoperated (master-slave)
   system facilitated with a state-of-the-art minimally invasive probe with
   a rigidly mounted tactile sensor at the tip and an externally mounted
   force sensor at the base of the probe. The objective is to capture the
   tactile information and measure the interaction forces between the probe
   and tissue during palpation and to explore how they can be integrated to
   improve the performance of tumor localization. To quantitatively explore
   the effect of force feedback on tactile sensing tumor localization,
   several experiments were conducted by human subjects to locate
   artificial tumors embedded in the ex vivo bovine livers. The results
   show that using tactile sensing in a force-controlled environment can
   realize, on average, 57 percent decrease in the maximum force and 55
   percent decrease in the average force applied to tissue while increasing
   the tumor detection accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to the case of
   using tactile feedback alone. The results also show that while visual
   presentation of force feedback gives straightforward quantitative
   measures, improved performance of tactile sensing tumor localization is
   achieved at the expense of longer times for the user. Also, the
   quickness and intuitive data mapping of direct force feedback makes it
   more appealing to experienced users.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Prostate adenocarcinoma is the most common noncutaneous
   malignancy in American men with over 200 000 new cases diagnosed each
   year. Prostate interventional therapy, such as cryotherapy and
   brachytherapy, is an effective treatment for prostate cancer. Its
   success relies on the correct needle implant position. This paper
   proposes a robust and efficient needle segmentation method, which acts
   as an aid to localize the needle in three-dimensional (3D) transrectal
   ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate therapy.
   Methods: The procedure of locating the needle in a 3D TRUS image is a
   three-step process. First, the original 3D ultrasound image containing a
   needle is cropped; the cropped image is then converted to a binary
   format based on its histogram. Second, a 3D Hough transform based needle
   segmentation method is applied to the 3D binary image in order to locate
   the needle axis. The position of the needle endpoint is finally
   determined by an optimal threshold based analysis of the intensity
   probability distribution. The overall efficiency is improved through
   implementing a coarse-fine searching strategy. The proposed method was
   validated in tissue-mimicking agar phantoms, chicken breast phantoms,
   and 3D TRUS patient images from prostate brachytherapy and cryotherapy
   procedures by comparison to the manual segmentation. The robustness of
   the proposed approach was tested by means of varying parameters such as
   needle insertion angle, needle insertion length, binarization threshold
   level, and cropping size.
   Results: The validation results indicate that the proposed Hough
   transform based method is accurate and robust, with an achieved endpoint
   localization accuracy of 0 5 mm for agar phantom images, 0 7 mm for
   chicken breast phantom images, and 1 mm for in vivo patient cryotherapy
   and brachytherapy images. The mean execution time of needle segmentation
   algorithm was 2 s for a 3D TRUS image with size of 264 x 376 x 630
   voxels.
   Conclusions: The proposed needle segmentation algorithm is accurate,
   robust, and suitable for 3D TRUS guided prostate transperineal therapy.

Title = {{The detective quantum efficiency of photon-counting x-ray detectors
   using cascaded-systems analyses}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Single-photon counting (SPC) x-ray imaging has the potential to
   improve image quality and enable new advanced energy-dependent methods.
   The purpose of this study is to extend cascaded-systems analyses (CSA)
   to the description of image quality and the detective quantum efficiency
   (DQE) of SPC systems.
   Methods: Point-process theory is used to develop a method of propagating
   the mean signal and Wiener noise-power spectrum through a thresholding
   stage (required to identify x-ray interaction events). The new transfer
   relationships are used to describe the zero-frequency DQE of a
   hypothetical SPC detector including the effects of stochastic conversion
   of incident photons to secondary quanta, secondary quantum sinks,
   additive noise, and threshold level. Theoretical results are compared
   with Monte Carlo calculations assuming the same detector model.
   Results: Under certain conditions, the CSA approach can be applied to
   SPC systems with the additional requirement of propagating the
   probability density function describing the total number of
   image-forming quanta through each stage of a cascaded model. Theoretical
   results including DQE show excellent agreement with Monte Carlo
   calculations under all conditions considered.
   Conclusions: Application of the CSA method shows that false counts due
   to additive electronic noise results in both a nonlinear image signal
   and increased image noise. There is a window of allowable threshold
   values to achieve a high DQE that depends on conversion gain, secondary
   quantum sinks, and additive noise. (C) 2013 American Association of

Title = {{Cascaded-systems analyses and the detective quantum efficiency of
   single-Z x-ray detectors including photoelectric, coherent and
   incoherent interactions}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Theoretical models of the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of
   x-ray detectors are an important step in new detector development by
   providing an understanding of performance limitations and benchmarks.
   Previous cascaded-systems analysis (CSA) models accounted for
   photoelectric interactions only. This paper describes an extension of
   the CSA approach to incorporate coherent and incoherent interactions,
   important for low-Z detectors such as silicon and selenium.
   Methods: A parallel-cascade approach is used to describe the three types
   of x-ray interactions. The description of incoherent scatter required
   developing expressions for signal and noise transfer through an
   ``energy-labeled reabsorption{''} process where the parameters
   describing reabsorption are random functions of the scatter photon
   energy. The description of coherent scatter requires the use of scatter
   form factors that may not be accurate for some crystalline detector
   materials. The model includes the effects of scatter reabsorption and
   escape, charge collection, secondary quantum sinks, noise aliasing, and
   additive noise. Model results are validated by Monte Carlo calculations
   for Si and Se detectors assuming free-atom atomic form factors.
   Results: The new signal and noise transfer expressions were validated by
   showing agreement with Monte Carlo results. Coherent and incoherent
   scatter can degrade the DQE of Si and sometimes Se detectors depending
   on detector thickness and incident-photon energy. Incoherent scatter can
   produce a substantial low-frequency drop in the modulation transfer
   function and DQE.
   Conclusions: A generally useful CSA model of the DQE is described that
   is believed valid for any single-Z material up to 10 cycles/mm at both
   mammographic and radiographic energies within the limitations of
   Fourier-based linear-systems models and the use of coherent-scatter form
   factors. The model describes a substantial low-frequency drop in the DQE
   of Si systems due to incoherent scatter above 20-40 keV. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of adding partially hydrated cementitious
   materials (PHCMs) on the early-age shrinkage of ultra-high-performance
   concrete (UHPC) was investigated. The PHCM were added at rates of 25\%,
   33\% and 50\% of the overall batch weight. UHPC mixtures incorporating a
   superabsorbent polymer (SAP) were also tested for comparison. Combined
   effects of PHCM and SAP techniques in reducing early-age shrinkage were
   investigated. Results indicate a significant improvement in early-age
   compressive strength of UHPC mixtures due to PHCM addition. PHCM
   achieved excellent early-age shrinkage reduction when used alone or
   combined with SAP. PHCM mitigated undesirable behaviour induced by SAP,
   including high drying shrinkage and reduction in mechanical properties.
   The addition of PHCM provides an ecological and economic technique for
   producing precast and cast-in-place self-restraining shrinkage concrete.
   Indeed, recycling leftover/unused concrete as PHCM in new mixtures can
   enhance the sustainability of concrete and minimize disposal in ready
   mixed concrete operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the use of low powered devices, susceptibility of high-speed
   interconnects to electromagnetic interference (EMI) is becoming a
   critical aspect of signal integrity analysis. For modeling the EMI in
   time domain, commercial circuit simulators like SPICE typically use
   longitudinal segmentation methodologies to discretize the interconnect
   network. For long lines as found in printed circuit board or cables, a
   large number of longitudinal segments are required to capture the
   response of the network leading to inefficient simulations. In this
   study, a waveform relaxation (WR) algorithm for the efficient EMI
   analysis of multiconductor transmission line networks is presented.
   Techniques to compress the size of the subcircuits, reduce communication
   overheads, and accelerate the convergence of the WR iterations are
   provided. The overall algorithm is demonstrated to be highly
   parallelizable and exhibits good scaling with both the size of the

Abstract = {{Sn alloy nanowires encapsulated in carbon nanotubes (SnM (M = (Fe, Ni,
   and Cr) or Cu) @ CNTs) were prepared in situ by a chemical vapor
   deposition (CVD) method, in which Sn came from a vaporized precursor
   while the alloy elements were supplied by the substrate. The
   heterostructures were grown on two types of substrates including
   stainless steel with high catalytic effectiveness and Cu substrates with
   low catalytic effectiveness for generating graphite layers,
   respectively. Pure Sn powder and C2H4 were employed to provide Sn and
   carbon precursors. The products were investigated by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) mapping. The morphology, structure and
   composition of the nanomaterials depended significantly on the surface
   conditions of the substrates. While SnCu alloy nanowires encapsulated in
   carbon nanotubes were grown on the Cu substrate, carbon nanotubes filled
   with alloy nanowires and porous carbon fibers decorated internally with
   alloy particles were observed on the stainless steel substrate. The
   growth mechanisms of the heterostructures were proposed. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{To design tissue-specific bioscaffolds with well-defined properties and
   3-D architecture, methods were developed for preparing porous foams from
   enzyme-solubilized human decellularized adipose tissue (DAT).
   Additionally, a technique was established for fabricating ``bead
   foams{''} comprised of interconnected networks of porous DAT beads fused
   through a controlled freeze-thawing and lyophilization procedure. In
   characterization studies, the foams were stable without the need for
   chemical crosslinking, with properties that could be tuned by
   controlling the protein concentration and freezing rate during
   synthesis. Adipogenic differentiation studies with human adipose-derived
   stem cells (ASCs) suggested that stiffness influenced ASC adipogenesis
   on the foams. In support of our previous work with DAT scaffolds and
   microcarriers, the DAT foams and bead foams strongly supported
   adipogenesis and were also adipo-inductive, as demonstrated by
   glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity, endpoint
   RT-PCR analysis of adipogenic gene expression, and intracellular lipid
   accumulation. Adipogenic differentiation was enhanced on the microporous
   DAT foams, potentially due to increased cell cell interactions in this
   group. In vivo assessment in a subcutaneous Wistar rat model
   demonstrated that the DAT bioscaffolds were well tolerated and
   integrated into the host tissues, supporting angiogenesis and
   adipogenesis. The DAT-based foams induced a strong angiogenic response,
   promoted inflammatory cell migration and gradually resorbed over the
   course of 12 weeks, demonstrating potential as scaffolds for wound
   healing and soft tissue regeneration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A remote catheter navigation system compatible with magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) has been developed to facilitate MRI-guided
   catheterization procedures. The interventionalist's conventional motions
   (axial motion and rotation) on an input catheter - acting as the master
   - are measured by a pair of optical encoders, and a custom embedded
   system relays the motions to a pair of ultrasonic motors. The ultrasonic
   motors drive the patient catheter (slave) within the MRI scanner,
   replicating the motion of the input catheter. The performance of the
   remote catheter navigation system was evaluated in terms of accuracy and
   delay of motion replication outside and within the bore of the magnet.
   While inside the scanner bore, motion accuracy was characterized during
   the acquisition of frequently used imaging sequences, including
   real-time gradient echo. The effect of the catheter navigation system on
   image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was also evaluated. The results show
   that the master-slave system has a maximum time delay of 41 +/- 21 ms in
   replicating motion; an absolute value error of 2 +/- 2 degrees. was
   measured for radial catheter motion replication over 360 degrees. and
   1.0 +/- 0.8 mm in axial catheter motion replication over 100 mm of
   travel. The worst-case SNR drop was observed to be 2.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional surgical approaches for repairing diseased mitral valves
   (MVs) have relied on placing the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass (on
   pump), stopping the heart and accessing the arrested heart directly.
   However, because this approach has the potential for adverse
   neurological, vascular, and immunological sequelae, less invasive
   beating heart alternatives are desirable. Emerging beating heart
   techniques have been developed to offer high-risk patients MV repair
   using ultrasound guidance alone without stopping the heart. This paper
   describes the first porcine trials of the NeoChord DS1000 (Minnetonka,
   MN), employed to attach neochordae to a MV leaflet using the traditional
   ultrasound-guided protocol augmented by dynamic virtual geometric
   models. The distance errors of the tracked tool tip from the intended
   midline trajectory (5.2 +/- 2.4 mm versus 16.8 +/- 10.9 mm, p = 0.003),
   navigation times (16.7 +/- 8.0 s versus 92.0 +/- 84.5 s, p = 0.004), and
   total path lengths (225.2 +/- 120.3 mm versus 1128.9 +/- 931.1 mm, p =
   0.003) were significantly shorter in the augmented ultrasound compared
   to navigation with ultrasound alone,(1) indicating a substantial
   improvement in the safety and simplicity of the procedure.}},

Abstract = {{A mixed micromechanics model was developed to predict the overall
   electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer nanocomposites.
   Two electrical conductivity mechanisms, electron hopping and conductive
   networks, were incorporated into the model by introducing an interphase
   layer and considering the effective aspect ratio of CNTs. It was found
   that the modeling results agree well with the experimental data for both
   single-wall carbon nanotube and multi-wall carbon nanotube based
   nanocomposites. Simulation results suggest that both electron hopping
   and conductive networks contribute to the electrical conductivity of the
   nanocomposites, while conductive networks become dominant as CNT volume
   fraction increases. It was also indicated that the sizes of CNTs have
   significant effects on the percolation threshold and the overall
   electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites. This developed model is
   expected to provide a more accurate prediction on the electrical
   conductivity of CNT-polymer nanocomposites and useful guidelines for the
   design and optimization of conductive polymer nanocomposites. (c) 2013

Title = {{Tungsten solubility in evolved granitic melts: An evaluation of magmatic
   wolframite}},
Journal = {{GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{84-98}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{A variety of parameters that potentially control the solubilities of
   synthetic hubnerite (MnWO4) and ferberite (FeWO4) in haplogranitic melts
   rich in fluxing compounds have been determined at 200 MPa in order to
   test the hypothesis that wolframite can occur as a magmatic mineral. The
   melts, considered representative of highly evolved pegmatites, contain
   1.1, 1.7 and 2.02 wt.\% of Li2O, P2O5, and B2O3, respectively. Although
   the molar Al/(Na + K) ratio is one, if Li is considered to be an alkali
   element the molar Al/(Na + K + Li) (ASI(Li)) of the melt is 0.88, and
   the melt is peralkaline. Hubnerite and ferberite solubilities at 800
   degrees C are strongly controlled by melt composition. They are much
   lower in subaluminous melt, (ASI(Li) = 1.05), than in peralkaline melt.
   By contrast, hubnerite and ferberite solubilities are nearly independent
   of the fluorine content of the melt, for up to 8 wt.\% F. Hubnerite and
   ferberite solubilities at 800 degrees C are also nearly independent of
   oxygen fugacity over a log f(O2) range of approximately Ni-NiO - 3 to
   Ni-NiO + 2, which implies that the predominant oxidation state of
   tungsten in the melts is + 6, even at moderately reduced conditions. A
   series of experiments on haplogranitic melt, rich in fluxing compounds,
   with 0 and 6 wt.\% F at 850-650 degrees C shows that temperature
   strongly influences hubnerite solubility, e. g., the solubility product
   of hubnerite (K-sp(hub)) in the melts with 6 wt.\% F decreases from 71.0
   +/- 7.9 x 10(-4) mol(2)/kg(2) at 850 degrees C to 4.4 +/- 2.3 x 10(-4)
   mol(2)/kg(2) at 650 degrees C.
   Our experimental results show that ferberite solubilities are much
   higher than those of hubnerite with the same composition of melt, but
   the Mn, Fe and W concentrations in natural melt inclusions indicate that
   these melts were undersaturated with wolframite at 800 degrees C.
   However, flux-rich melts crystallize at lower temperatures in nature and
   the occurrence of natural, magmatic wolframite was evaluated by
   comparing experimental solubility product values extrapolated to 500
   degrees C with wolframite activities at these temperatures. Magmatic
   wolframite is unlikely in flux-rich peralkaline melts but by contrast,
   flux-rich subaluminous to peraluminous melt inclusions appear to have
   been saturated with wolframite at approximately 500 degrees C. Because
   of the strong temperature dependence of wolframite solubility the
   dominant effect of fluxing compounds is to lower the solidus temperature
   of the melt. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive rise in the number of resource constrained wireless
   devices and the needs for secure communications with the servers imply
   fast and efficient cryptographic computations for both parties.
   Efficient hardware implementation of arithmetic operations over finite
   field using Gaussian normal basis is attractive for public key
   cryptography as it provides free squarings. In this paper, we first
   present two low-complexity digit-level multiplier architectures. It is
   shown that the proposed multipliers outperform the existing Gaussian
   normal basis (GNB) multiplier structures available in the literature.
   Then, for the first time, using these two architectures, we propose a
   new digit-level hybrid multiplier which performs two successive
   multiplications with the same latency as the one for one multiplication.
   We have studied the efficiency of the proposed hybrid architecture in
   terms of area and time delay for different digit sizes. The main
   advantage of this new hybrid architecture is to speed up exponentiation
   and point multiplication whenever double-multiplication is required and
   the traditional schemes fail due to the data dependencies. We have
   investigated the applicability of the proposed hybrid structure to
   reduce the latency of exponentiation-based cryptosystems. Our analysis
   and timing results show that the expected acceleration in
   double-exponentiation is considerable. Prototypes of the presented
   low-complexity multiplier architectures and the proposed hybrid
   architecture are implemented and experimental results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Loss-of-function mutations and deletions in the neurofibromin tumor
   suppressor gene (NF1) cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), the most
   common inherited syndrome of the nervous system in humans, with a birth
   incidence of 1:3,000. The most visible features of NF-1 are the
   neoplastic manifestations caused by the loss of Ras-GTPase-activating
   protein (Ras-GAP) activity mediated through the GAP-related domain (GRD)
   of neurofibromin (NF1), the protein encoded by NF1. However, the
   syndrome is also characterized by cognitive dysfunction and a number of
   developmental abnormalities. The molecular etiology of many of these
   nonneoplastic phenotypes remains unknown. Here we show that the
   tubulin-binding domain (TBD) of NF1 is a binding partner of the
   leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing (LRPPRC) protein.
   These two proteins complex with Kinesin 5B, hnRNP A2, Staufen1, and
   Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) mRNA, likely in RNA granules. This
   interaction is of interest in that it links NF-1 with Leigh's syndrome,
   French Canadian variant (LSFC), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative
   disorder that arises from mutations in the LRPPRC gene. Our findings
   provide clues to how loss or mutation of NF1 and LRPPRC may contribute

Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit ZrO2 directly on
   Li4Ti5O12 electrode to improve its electrochemical performance. The
   thickness of the deposited ZrO2 was controlled by adjusting ALD cycles
   from 0 to 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50. The Li4Ti5O12 electrodes with and without
   ZrO2 coating were characterized by scanning electron microscope, energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron
   microscope, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge
   test. The CV result indicated that ZrO2 coating with 2, 5 and 10 ALD
   cycles could effectively reduce the electrochemical polarization of the
   Li4Ti5O12 electrode. Charge-discharge test revealed that the Li4Ti5O12
   electrodes with 1-, 2- and 5-cycle ZrO2 coating exhibited higher
   specific capacity, better cycling performance and rate capability than
   the pristine Li4Ti5O12 in a voltage range of 0.1-2.5 V. However, ZrO2
   coating with more than 5 ALD cycles could lead to degraded performance
   of Li4Ti5O12. Mechanism for the enhanced electrochemical performance of
   Li4Ti5O12 was explored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and
   the reason was attributed to the suppressed formation of solid
   electrolyte interphase and the improved electron transport by ultrathin
   ZrO2 coating. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   high catalyst utilization, but also improves mass transport and gas
   diffusion. These novel Pt structures exhibited significantly improved
   catalytic activity (4.4 fold) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and
   greatly enhanced durability (6.1 fold) over that of the state-of-the-art
   commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work provides a promising approach to the
   design of highly efficient next-generation electrocatalysts.}},

Title = {{Controlling sensitivity and stability of ferrous-xylenol orange-gelatin
   3D gel dosimeters by doping with phenanthroline-type ligands and glyoxal}},

Abstract = {{The ferrous-xylenol orange-gelatin (FXG) dosimeter is widely used for
   three-dimensional ionizing radiation field mapping through optical
   scanning. Upon irradiation, the ferrous iron (Fe2+) is oxidized to
   ferric iron (Fe3+), which forms an intensely coloured complex with
   xylenol orange (XO). XO also acts as a diffusion-limiting additive;
   however, its presence may cause rapid auto-oxidation of Fe2+ during
   storage and low stability of the dose response. In this work,
   phenanthroline-type ligands were added to FXG system in a bid to bind
   the ferrous iron in a stable complex and minimize the rate of the
   auto-oxidation, whereas glyoxal was used as a chemical cross-linker,
   aiming to minimize the ferric iron diffusion. It was found that addition
   of either 1,10-phenanthroline or 5-nitro-1,10-phenanthroline can improve
   the auto-oxidation behaviour of the gels. However, the initial
   background absorbance was slightly increased, and the sensitivity of the
   dosimeters was decreased. Doping with glyoxal led to a moderate decrease
   of the diffusion only in those gels that also contained a
   phenanthroline-type ligand, and did not affect the initial dose
   response. Glyoxal also afforded an extended period of stable background
   absorbance level after an initial period of bleaching of the gel.
   Following re-irradiation, most glyoxal-containing dosimeters showed an
   excellent linearity of the dose response, albeit at a decreased
   sensitivity. We recommend further testing of FXG dosimeters, doped with
   phenanthroline-type ligands and glyoxal as a means for controlling the
   dose response and improving the long-term storage properties of the gels
   and the potential for dose fractionation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop a multivariate distal radius
   injury risk prediction model that incorporates dynamic loading variables
   in multiple directions, and interpret the distal radius failure data in
   order to establish injury probability thresholds.
   Repeated impacts with increasing intensity were applied to the distal
   third of eight human cadaveric radius specimens (mean (SD) age = 61.9
   (9.7)) until injury occurred. Crack (non-propagating damage) and
   fracture (specimen separated into at least two fragments) injury events
   were recorded. Best subsets analysis was performed to find the best
   multivariate injury risk model. Force-only risk models were also
   determined for comparison. Cumulative distribution functions were
   developed from the parameters of a Weibull analysis and the forces and
   risk scores (i.e., values calculated from the injury risk models) from
   10\% to 90\% probability were calculated.
   According to the adjusted R-2, variance inflation factor and p-values,
   the model that best predicted the crack event included medial/lateral
   impulse, F-z load rate, impact velocity and the natural logarithm of F-z
   (Adj. R-2 = 0.698), while the best predictive model of the fracture
   event included medial/lateral impulse, impact velocity and peak F-z
   (Adj. R-2 = 0.845). The multivariate models predicted injury risk better
   than both the F-z-only crack (Adj. R-2 = 0.551) and fracture (Adj. R-2 =
   0.293) models. Risk scores of 0.5 and 0.6 corresponded to 10\% failure
   probability for the crack and fracture events, respectively.
   The inclusion of medial/lateral impulse and impact velocity in both
   crack and fracture models, and F-z load rate in the crack model,
   underscores the dynamic nature of these events. This study presents a
   method capable of developing a set of distal radius fracture prediction
   models that can be used in the assessment and development of distal
   radius injury prevention interventions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{1836-1851}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In the finish machining of a pocket corner, varying radial depth of cut
   is generally encountered by the end milling tool during the entry into
   and exit from the corner. This leads to substantial variability of the
   machining process. This paper presents the generation and application of
   a multiple looping tool path for corner machining with the objective to
   reduce the machining variability and improve the machining efficiency.
   Material removal rate is selected as the measure for the machining
   variability. To reduce the material removal rate for a straightforward
   corner machining tool path, feed rate needs to be decreased as the end
   mill approaches the corner apex and increased as it exits the corner.
   Instantaneous changes of feed rate are not possible in practice due to
   practical limitations on the servo drive system of common machine tools.
   A tool path of constant feed rate is thus preferred for effective corner
   machining. The looping tool path proposed in this work is composed of a
   series of smoothly connected linear and circular segments to ensure its
   applicability for all machine tools. For a given corner geometry, a
   single-cutter as well as a double-cutter strategy have been introduced
   to maximise the machining efficiency. Various case studies were carried
   out to examine the resulting material removal rate and total machining
   time for different machining operations.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the time required for initial integration of bone-contacting
   implants with host tissues would be of great clinical significance.
   Changes in osteoblast adhesion formation and reorganization of the
   F-actin cytoskeleton in response to altered topography are known to be
   upstream of osteoblast differentiation, and these processes are
   regulated by the Rho GTPases. Rac and RhoA (through Rho Kinase (ROCK)).
   Using pharmacological inhibitors, we tested how inhibition of Rac and
   ROCK influenced osteoblast adhesion, differentiation and mineralization
   on PT (Pre-treated) and SLA (sandblasted large grit, acid etched)
   topographies. Inhibition of ROCK, but not Rac, significantly reduced
   adhesion number and size on PT, with adhesion size consistent with focal
   complexes. After 1 day, ROCK, but not Rac inhibition increased
   osteocalcin mRNA levels on SLA and PT, with levels further increasing at
   7 days post seeding. ROCK inhibition also significantly increased bone
   sialoprotein expression at 7 days, but not BMP-2 levels. Rac inhibition
   significantly reduced BMP-2 mRNA levels. ROCK inhibition increased
   nuclear translocation of Runx2 independent of surface roughness.
   Mineralization of osteoblast cultures was greater on SLA than on PT, but
   was increased by ROCK inhibition and attenuated by Rac inhibition on
   both topographies. In conclusion, inhibition of ROCK signalling
   significantly increases osteoblast differentiation and biomineralization
   in a topographic dependent manner, and its pharmacological inhibition
   could represent a new therapeutic to speed bone formation around
   implanted metals and in regenerative medicine applications.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) methods are widely used with magnetic
   resonance imaging and computed tomography to assess the vascular
   characteristics of tumours since these properties can affect the
   response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In contrast, there have been
   far fewer studies using optical-based applications despite the
   advantages of low cost and safety. This study investigated an
   appropriate kinetic model for optical applications to characterize
   tumour haemodynamics (blood flow, F, blood volume, V-b, and vascular
   heterogeneity) and vascular leakage (permeability surface-area product,
   PS). DCE data were acquired with two dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and
   800 CW carboxylate (IRDcbx), from a human colon tumour xenograph model
   in rats. Due to the smaller molecular weight of IRDcbx (1166 Da)
   compared to albumin-bound ICG (67 kDa), PS of IRDcbx was significantly
   larger; however, no significant differences in F and V-b were found
   between the dyes as expected. Error analysis demonstrated that all
   parameters could be estimated with an uncertainty less than 5\% due to
   the high temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the optical
   measurements. The next step is to adapt this approach to optical imaging
   to generate haemodynamics and permeability maps, which should enhance
   the clinical interest in optics for treatment monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{A wavelet adaptive filtering technique is presented for enhanced fault
   identification in gearboxes. Based on Morlet wavelet analysis and
   conventional optimization methods, an adaptive filtering is performed
   for the background noise removal of vibration signals emanating from
   gearboxes. A fourth-order statistical moment, kurtosis, is used as an
   objective function to optimize. A filtered signal is obtained by
   choosing the suitable Morlet wavelet that maximizes the kurtosis. The
   optimization framework uses one-dimensional and multidimensional
   accelerated search techniques to speed up the convergence in solution
   search space. A novel, transient-based features extraction method based
   on the shock response spectrum is used to extract characteristic
   features representing the health state of the gearbox. The effectiveness
   and feasibility of the proposed method have been demonstrated on
   experimental gearbox data. The proposed technique enables a high
   signal-to-noise ratio for gearbox fault detection.}},

Abstract = {{The wind-induced vibrations of the mast arm of cantilever traffic signal
   structures can lead to the fatigue failure of these structures. Wind
   tunnel tests were conducted on an aeroelastic model of this type of
   structure. Results of these experiments indicated that when the signals
   have backplates, vortex shedding causes large-amplitude vibrations that
   could lead to fatigue failure. Vibrations caused by galloping were only
   observed for one particular angle of attack with the signals having
   backplates. No evidence for galloping, previously thought to be the
   dominant cause of fatigue failures in these structures, was observed.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and hydrogen
   embrittlement were recently reviewed by Lynch in this journal. The
   present review, in contrast, focuses on the rate-limiting step of the
   SCC of low-alloy high-strength steels in water and particularly focuses
   on the influence of the applied stress rate on the SCC of low-alloy
   high-strength steels. Linearly increasing stress tests of low-alloy
   high-strength steels in distilled water indicated that the stress
   corrosion crack velocity increased with increasing applied stress rate
   until the maximum crack velocity, corresponding to v(II) in fracture
   mechanics tests in distilled water. Moreover, the crack velocity was
   dependent only on the applied stress rate and was not influenced by the
   steel composition. The rate-limiting step could be the rupture of a
   surface film, which would control the rate of metal dissolution and/or
   the production and transport of hydrogen to the crack tip or to the
   regions ahead of the crack tip.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying joint contact in articular joints is important for both the
   biomechanical investigation of joint mechanics and the study of
   osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study is to develop a proximity
   mapping technique to non-invasively determine joint congruency, as a
   surrogate of joint contact. To illustrate the capabilities of this
   algorithm, a cadaveric upper extremity was positioned at varying degrees
   of elbow flexion. This technique was validated using a gold standard
   experimental casting technique. The pattern of the cast showed an
   excellent agreement with the generated proximity map using the
   inter-bone distance algorithm. The results from this study agree with
   the results of previous studies examining joint contact at the elbow
   both in the location and in the tracking of the joint contact throughout
   elbow flexion. Ultimately, this technique will lead to an increased
   understanding of the effect of malalignment and instability of the joint
   on contact mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication details to form large area systematically changing
   multishape nanoscale structures on a chip by laser interference
   lithography (LIL) are described. The feasibility of fabricating
   different geometries including dots, ellipses, holes, and elliptical
   holes in both x- and y- directions on a single substrate is shown by
   implementing a Lloyd's interferometer. The fabricated structures at
   different substrate positions with respect to exposure time, exposure
   angle and associated light intensity profile are analyzed. Experimental
   details related to the fabrication of symmetric and biaxial periodic
   nanostructures on photoresist, silicon surfaces, and ion milled glass
   substrates are presented. Primary rat calvarial osteoblasts were grown
   on ion-milled glass substrates with nanotopography with a periodicity of
   1200 nm. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that cells formed adhesions
   sites coincident with the nanotopography after 24 h of growth on the
   substrates. The results suggest that laser LIL is an easy and
   inexpensive method to fabricate systematically changing nanostructures
   for cell adhesion studies. The effect of the different periodicities and
   transition structures can be studied on a single substrate to reduce the
   number of samples significantly. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{There is ample evidence of both ancient and long-lasting fluvial
   activity and chemical alteration in the Libya Montes region south of
   Isidis Basin. The region hosts Noachian to Amazonian aged surface rocks
   with extensive outcrops of olivine- and pyroxene-bearing material. Libya
   Montes also features surface outcrops and/or deposits hosting
   Fe/Mg-smectite, Fe/Mg-smectite mixed with carbonate and/or other
   Fe/Mg-rich phyllosilicates, and Al-smectite. These units likely formed
   through chemical alteration connected with hydrothermal activity
   resulting from the formation of the Isidis Basin and/or the pervasive
   fluvial activity throughout this region. The morphology and stratigraphy
   of the aqueous and mafic minerals are described using High Resolution
   Imaging Science Experiment and High Resolution Stereo Camera derived
   digital terrain models. Analyses of the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging
   Spectrometer for Mars spectra show variations in the chemistry of the
   Fe/Mg-smectite from nontronite-like exposures with spectral features
   near 2.29 and 2.4 mu m more consistent with Fe23+OH groups in the
   mineral structure, and saponite-like outcrops with spectral features
   near 2.31 and 2.38 mu m characteristic of Mg32+OH groups. These
   Fe/Mg-smectite bearing materials also have bands near 1.9 mu m due to
   H2O and near 2.5 mu m that could be due to the smectite, other
   phyllosilicates, and carbonates. All regions exhibiting carbonate
   features near 3.4-3.5 mu m also have features consistent with the
   presence of olivine and Fe/Mg-smectite, indicating that the carbonate
   signatures occur in rocks likely containing a mixture of these minerals.
   The Al-smectite-bearing rocks have bands near 1.41, 1.91, and 2.19 mu m
   that are more consistent with beidellite than other Al-phyllosilicates,
   indicating a higher-temperature or diagenetically processed origin for
   this material. Our interpretation of the geologic history of this region
   is that ancient Noachian basaltic crustal materials experienced
   extensive aqueous alteration at the time of the Isidis impact, during
   which the montes were also formed, followed by emplacement of a rough
   olivine-rich lava or melt, and finally the smooth pyroxene-bearing
   caprock unit.}},

Abstract = {{Inclined stay cables in cable-stayed bridges are post-tensioned in order
   to counteract the effect of the deck dead load. The evaluation of the
   post-tensioning forces is tackled in previous literature using either of
   the iterative unit load method, the force equilibrium method, or by
   using optimization search methods. All of the above mentioned methods
   are computationally intensive which hamper their further use in an
   optimal design algorithm of the bridge. This paper presents a simple
   surrogate function that can be used to evaluate post-tensioning cable
   forces in semi-cable stayed bridge under the action of the dead load.
   The post-tensioning forces for several configurations of the semi-fan
   cable-stayed bridges are evaluated using genetic algorithms, and are
   approximated using a simple polynomial function. The developed surrogate
   functions are used to study the effect of the main span length of the
   bridge as well as of the pylon height on the distribution and magnitude
   of the post-tensioning cable forces.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-atomized liquid injections into fluidized beds are commonly used in
   industrial processes such as fluid coking, fluid catalytic cracking
   (FCC), and pharmaceutical granulation, where it is important to optimize
   the distribution of the injected liquid to prevent the formation of
   unwanted liquid-solid agglomerates and maximize product yields. This
   injection is typically a two-phase, gas-atomized liquid injection. One
   issue with such a liquid injection is that most of the liquid is
   deposited at the end of the jet tip within the reactor. This study
   proposes introducing artificial fluctuations into the injection flow,
   which causes the jet penetration to vary, allowing for a more even
   spread of liquid throughout a fluidized bed reactor. The effect of
   artificial pulsations in the atomized injection, of various frequency
   and amplitude, was investigated in this study. Using pulsations, greatly
   enhanced the liquid distribution on the bed particles. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{The load distribution among piles in a group varies such that the inner
   piles often carry a smaller share of the total load compared to the
   outer piles, which is a result of increased soil-pile interaction. The
   main objective of this paper is to establish the relative effectiveness
   of pile groups with no inner piles (perimeter group), when compared to
   the more common grid configuration. The numerical investigation utilized
   the finite element programme ABAQUS and considered a range of variables
   that affect pile group behaviour including number of piles, pile
   spacing, length/diameter ratio, and soil strength. It was demonstrated
   that a complete grid group is less efficient than a perimeter group,
   where efficiency is defined as the load capacity of the whole group
   expressed as a ratio of the number of piles in the group multiplied by
   the load capacity of a single isolated pile. Efficiencies close to unity
   were observed for some perimeter groups. Perimeter groups also showed
   that a ``block{''} type group failure could occur, where piles were
   placed at a spacing of less than 2.0 pile diameters, d,
   centre-to-centre. This often, but not always, led to a reduction in the
   efficiency of the pile group.}},

   functions for evaluating post-tensioning cable forces, and design
   methodologies is developed specially to optimize the design of
   cable-stayed bridges. The loads, design, and constraints used in the
   numerical model are developed based on the Canadian Highway Bridge
   Design Code CAN/CSA-S6-06. The efficiency and practicality of the

Abstract = {{We propose a system for thoracic aortic stent-graft deployment that
   employs a magnetic tracking system (MTS) and intraoperative ultrasound
   (US). A preoperative plan is first performed using a general public
   utilities-accelerated cardiac modeling method to determine the target
   position of the stent-graft. During the surgery, an MTS is employed to
   track sensors embedded in the catheter, cannula, and the US probe, while
   a fiducial landmark based registration is used to map the patient's
   coordinate to the image coordinate. The surgical target is tracked in
   real time via a calibrated intraoperative US image. Under the guidance
   of the MTS integrated with the real-time US images, the stent-graft can
   be deployed to the target position without the use of ionizing
   radiation. This navigation approach was validated using both phantom and
   animal studies. In the phantom study, we demonstrate a US calibration
   accuracy of 1.5 +/- 0.47 mm, and a deployment error of 1.4 +/- 0.16 mm.
   In the animal study, we performed experiments on five porcine subjects
   and recorded fiducial, target, and deployment errors of 2.5 +/- 0.32,
   4.2 +/- 0.78, and 2.43 +/- 0.69 mm, respectively. These results
   demonstrate that delivery and deployment of thoracic stent-graft under
   MTS-guided navigation using US imaging is feasible and appropriate for
   clinical application.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an application of the Multiobjective Differential
   Evolution (MoDE) algorithm for the optimal operation of a complex
   multipurpose reservoir system. The developed algorithm (MoDE) is
   compared with the Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) using a set of common test
   problems and the case study. The case study includes part of a complex
   water supply system located in southwest Brazil that provides water for
   approximately 20 million people in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area
   (SPMA). The objectives of the case study include minimization of demand
   shortage (the difference between demand for water and available water
   supply), maximization of water quality (or minimization of the deviation
   from the water quality standards), and minimization of pumping cost.
   MoDE is applied to the case study using two inflow scenarios: (1) a
   drought period with inflows below historical average; and (2) a wet
   period with inflows above historical average. Multiobjective analysis is
   done by comparing two pairs of objective functions: minimization of
   demand shortage versus minimization of pumping cost and minimization of
   demand shortage versus minimization of the deviation from water quality
   standards. The constraints for the analysis are reservoir capacity,
   tunnels and channel limitations, and minimum downstream flow for all
   reservoirs. The proposed MoDE algorithm is outperforming NSGA-II as it
   converges closer to and provides better spread coverage of the true
   Pareto front. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000213. (C) 2013 American

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{208-224}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive numerical study was undertaken to investigate transport
   of a variable-density, conservative solute plume in an unconfined
   coastal aquifer subject to high and low frequency oceanic forcing. The
   model combined variable-density saturated flow for groundwater and
   solute transport, and wave hydrodynamics from a 2D Navier-Stokes solver.
   A sinusoidal tidal signal was specified by implementing time-varying
   heads at the seaward boundary. The solute plume behavior was
   investigated under different oceanic forcing conditions: no forcing,
   waves, tide, and combined waves and tide. For each forcing condition,
   four different injected solute densities (freshwater, brackish water,
   seawater, brine) were used to investigate the effects of density on the
   transport of the injected plume beneath and across the beach face. The
   plume's low-order spatial moments were computed, viz., mass, centroid,
   variance and aspect ratio. The results confirmed that both tide- and
   wave-forcing produce an upper saline plume beneath the beach face in
   addition to the classical saltwater wedge. For the no-forcing and
   tide-only cases (during rising tides), an additional small circulation
   cell below the beach face was observed. Oceanic forcing affects strongly
   the solute plume's flow path, residence time and discharge rate across
   the beach face, as well as its spreading. For the same oceanic forcing,
   solute plumes with different densities follow different trajectories
   from the source to the discharge location (beach face). The residence
   time and plume spreading increased with plume density. It was concluded
   that simulations that neglect the effect of waves or tides cannot
   reproduce accurately solute plume dispersion and also, in the case of
   coasts with small waves or tides, the solute residence time in the
   aquifer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   10.1152/japplphysiol.01206.2012.-In subjects with chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperpolarized xenon-129 (Xe-129) magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) reveals significantly greater ventilation
   defects than hyperpolarized helium-3 (He-3) MRI. The physiological
   and/or morphological determinants of ventilation defects and the
   differences observed between hyperpolarized He-3 and Xe-129 MRI are not
   yet understood. Here we aimed to determine the structural basis for the
   differences in ventilation observed between He-3 and Xe-129 MRI in
   subjects with COPD using apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and
   computed tomography (CT). Ten COPD ex-smokers provided written, informed
   consent and underwent MRI, CT, spirometry, and plethysmography. He-3 and
   Xe-129 MRI ventilation volume was generated using semiautomated
   segmentation, and ADC maps were registered to generate ADC values for
   lung regions of interest ventilated by both gases (ADC(HX)) and by He-3
   gas only (ADC(HO)). CT wall area percentage and the lowest 15th
   percentile point of the CT lung density histogram (HU15\%) were also
   evaluated. For lung regions accessed by 3He gas only, mean He-3 ADC(HO)
   was significantly greater than for regions accessed by both gases
   (ADC(HO) = 0.503 +/- 0.119 cm(2)/s, ADC(HX) = 0.470 +/- 0.125 cm(2)/s, P
   < 0.0001). The difference between He-3 and Xe-129 ventilation volume was
   significantly correlated with CT HU15\% (r = -65, P = 0.04) and He-3
   ADC(HO) (r = 0.70, P = 0.02), but not CT wall area percentage (r =
   -0.34, P = 0.33). In conclusion, in this small study in COPD subjects,
   we observed significantly decreased Xe-129 MRI ventilation compared with
   He-3 MRI, and these regions of decreased Xe-129 ventilation were
   spatially and significantly correlated with regions of increased
   pulmonary emphysema, but not airway wall thickness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the use of simple architectural elements such as
   aerodynamic mitigation devices for reducing high wind-induced suctions
   occurring at roof and wall corners of low-rise buildings where
   wind-induced building envelope failures usually initiate. The
   architectural elements considered in the current study include trellises
   (pergolas), roof extensions of gable ends (gable end ribs), ridgeline
   extensions (ridge rib), and sideways extensions of walls (wall ribs). A
   small-scale model of residential villa was tested in a boundary layer
   wind tunnel for two different roof geometries (gable and hip). Moreover,
   selected cases were investigated at the Wall of Wind, a large-scale
   testing facility, to investigate scale effects. The effectiveness of
   these architectural elements in reducing high suction (negative
   pressure) was assessed by comparing the wind-induced pressure
   measurements obtained before and after introducing the elements. Based
   on the results obtained for the worst wind angle of attacks, the peak
   suction was reduced after introducing the architectural elements by 65\%
   at gable-end corners, 60\% close to roof ridges, 45\% at soffits, 35\%
   at wall corners, and 25\% at eaves. These simple architectural elements,
   which can be retrofitted to the stock of existing homes or incorporated
   into the design of new buildings, can be used as aerodynamic mitigation
   devices for reducing peak suction at critical locations of the building
   envelope. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000505. (C) 2013 American

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{27-37}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Roof sheathing on typical North American timber frame house construction
   is subjected to high uplift loads during severe windstorms resulting in
   commonly observed failures. To investigate such failures in detail, ramp
   and fluctuating wind loads were applied to oriented strand board and
   plywood panels fixed to rafters with twisted and ring-shank nail
   varieties, as well as staples. It was observed for panels fixed with
   twist-shank nails that the panels separate from the rafters in small
   increments associated with the large peak pressures. In contrast, the
   failure progression for ring-shank nails is much more sudden. With both
   types of failure progression, however, it is observed that it is the
   short duration peak gusts which damage and fail the panels, and always
   at the nails with the largest tributary areas in the interior of the
   panel. Tests were also conducted with different missing nail
   configurations and the capacities assessed. It was observed that
   fasteners with the incremental failure mechanism were able to more
   effectively distribute the load such that the effects of missing nails
   are reduced compared to the panels which fail by the sudden mechanism.

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines wind loads acting on roof sheathing on typical
   low-rise, wood-frame houses for a variety of parameters including roof
   shape, roof slope, building height, upstream terrain and the presence of
   surrounding structures placed in several patterns. It was found that
   roof shape and upstream terrain have the most significant effect on wind
   loads acting on roof sheathing. Considering the variation in wind loads,
   an effective prescriptive standard for sheathing on gable roofs, would
   discriminate by terrain and roof zone. Roof height and roof slope could
   be neglected from such a standard. In contrast, for hip roofs, an
   effective prescriptive standard would discriminate based on terrain,
   roof height and roof slope, but without considering roof zones (for the
   current, nearly square plan dimension houses). Surrounding houses are
   found to have both shielding and enhancing effects on the loads,
   depending on the details. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC),
   dimyristoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) and
   dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) in aqueous solutions spontaneously
   form monodisperse, bilayered nanodiscs (also known as ``bicelles{''}) at
   or below the melting transition temperature of DMPC (T-M similar to 23
   degrees C). In dilute systems above the main transition temperature T-M
   of DMPC, bicelles coalesce (increasing their diameter) and eventually
   self-fold into unilamellar vesicles (ULVs). Time-resolved small angle
   neutron scattering was used to study the growth kinetics of nanodiscs
   below and equal to T-M over a period of hours as a function of
   temperature at two lipid concentrations in presence or absence of NaCl
   salt. Bicelles seem to undergo a sudden initial growth phase with
   increased temperature, which is then followed by a slower
   reaction-limited growth phase that depends on ionic strength, lipid
   concentration and temperature. The bicelle interaction energy was
   derived from the colloidal theory of Derjaguin and Landau, and Verwey
   and Overbeek (DLVO). While the calculated total energy between discs is
   attractive and proportional to their growth rate, a more detailed
   mechanism is proposed to describe the mechanism of disc coalescence.
   After annealing at low temperature (low-T), samples were heated to 50
   degrees C in order to promote the formation of ULVs. Although the low-T
   annealing of samples has only a marginal effect on the mean size of
   end-state ULVs, it does affect their polydispersity, which increases
   with increased T, presumably driven by the entropy of the system.

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of nano-calcium carbonate (CaCO3) addition on
   the early-age properties of ultra-high-performance concrete cured at
   simulated cold and normal field conditions were investigated. The
   nano-CaCO3 was added at rates of 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15\% as a partial
   volume replacement for cement. Similar mixtures incorporating
   chloride-and non-chloride-based accelerating admixtures were also tested
   for comparison. Results indicate the high potential of nano-CaCO3 to
   accelerate the setting and hardening process of ultra-high-performance
   concrete through providing nucleation sites, increasing contact points
   and increasing the effective water-to-cement ratio. Although nano-CaCO3
   exhibited a comparable or slightly lower accelerating effect to that of
   the chloride-and non-chloride-based accelerating admixtures, it brings a
   number of benefits to concrete production. These include the development
   of low-maintenance structures through eliminating the risk of steel
   corrosion induced by chloride-based accelerating admixtures, as well as
   a more environmentally friendly concrete through reducing the cement
   factor of ultra-high-performance concrete.}},

   within the admissible range by minimizing the level transients and
   improving the stability of the control loop. Simulation results and a
   general framework for systematically studying the SGL are presented to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method by
   comparing the performance of the designed controller with that of a
   properly tuned conventional three-element
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Moreover, it has been
   demonstrated that the proposed controller is more robust than a
   conventional PID controller to steam flow disturbances caused by load

Abstract = {{Purpose: To identify anomalous features that impact drug delivery in the
   eye as a result of intravitreal injections using micro-computed
   tomography imaging.
   Methods: Three-dimensional micro-computed tomography images were
   acquired following an intravitreal injection of 0.03 mL of contrast
   agent into ex vivo porcine eyes (n = 24). A baseline scan was acquired
   prior to injection to detect any abnormalities in the eyes. Acquisition
   continued at various time intervals up to 230 min post-injection.
   Results: Air bubbles were clearly visible within the vitreous of 21 eyes
   following injections. There was a total of 36 air bubbles in the 21 eyes
   and the volume of the air bubbles ranged from 0.01 mu L to 1.50 mu L. It
   was found the size of the air bubbles decreased over the scanning
   period. Furthermore, many of the injected boli in the eye specimens did
   not have the commonly assumed spherical shape; rather, a variety of
   other shapes resulted.
   Conclusion: The presence of air bubbles and inconsistent bolus shapes
   have indicated that intravitreal injections have high variability. It is
   only through the realization of these anomalous features that the
   efficacy of intravitreal drug delivery will be improved through a
   consistent and accurate injection technique.}},

Abstract = {{Corrosion of reinforced concrete is the most challenging durability
   problem that threatens reinforced concrete structures, especially
   structures that are subject to severe environmental conditions (i.e.,
   highway bridges, marine structures, etc.). Corrosion of reinforcing
   steel leads to cracking and spalling of the concrete cover and billions
   of dollars are spent every year on repairing such damaged structures.
   New types of reinforcements have been developed to avoid these high-cost
   repairs. Thus, it is important to study the corrosion behavior of these
   new types of reinforcements and compare them to the traditional carbon
   steel reinforcements. This study aimed at characterizing the corrosion
   behavior of three competing reinforcing steels; conventional carbon
   steel, micro-composite steel (MMFX-2) and 316LN stainless steel, through
   experiments in carbonated and non-carbonated concrete exposed to
   chloride-laden environments. Synthetic pore water solutions have been
   used to simulate both cases of sound and carbonated concrete under
   chloride ions attack. A three-electrode corrosion cell is used for
   determining the corrosion characteristics and rates. Multiple
   electrochemical techniques were applied using a Gamry PC4 (TM)
   potentiostat manufactured by Gamry Instruments (Warminster, PA). DC
   corrosion measurements were applied on samples subjected to fixed
   chloride concentration in the solution.}},

   while elongation-at-break (E) and elastic modulus (EM) were about 52 \%
   and 32-41 MPa, respectively. Moisture sorption behaviour of the samples
   was well described by GAB and BET models. Thermal property tests
   exhibited the glass transition temperature (T (g) ) of the

Abstract = {{A new three-level dc/dc converter is proposed in this paper. The
   outstanding features of this converter are that it operates with
   zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) from full-load to near no-load conditions
   with hardly any circulating freewheeling primary current due to its
   novel structure. Since the converter has little primary circulating
   current and its switches are exposed to only half of the input voltage,
   it has high efficiency even under light loads. In this paper, the new
   converter is introduced, its basic operating principles are explained,
   its modes of operation and its steady-state characteristics are
   discussed in detail as is its design, and experimental results obtained
   from a prototype converter that confirm its feasibility are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on an understanding of the influence of paper
   thickness on the electrochemical performances of graphene papers as an
   anode for lithium ion batteries. Three types of graphene papers, with
   thickness of similar to 1.5, 3 and 10 mu m, respectively, were
   fabricated by vacuum-assisted filtration of reduced graphene nanosheets
   suspended in water. These papers deliver evidently different lithium
   storage capacities, with thinner papers always outperform thicker ones.
   The 1.5 mu m paper gives rise to initial reversible specific capacities
   (the first 10 cycles) of similar to 200 mAh g(-1) at a current density
   of 100 mA g(-1), while the 10 mu m paper only presents similar to 80 mAh
   g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1). After 100 cycles, a specific
   capacity of similar to 180 mAh g(-1) is retained for the 1.5 mu m paper;
   in contrast, only similar to 65 mAh g(-1) remains for the 10 mu m paper.
   The capacity decline with the paper thickness is associated with the
   dense restacking of graphene nanosheets and a large aspect ratio of the
   paper. The effective Li+ diffusion distance in graphene paper is mainly
   controlled by the thickness of the paper, and the diffusion proceeds
   mainly in in-plane direction, cross plane diffusion is restrained. As
   such, the effective contact of graphene nanosheets with electrolyte is
   limited and the efficiency of carbon utilization is very low in the
   thick papers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   membrane vibration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the feasibility of measuring tympanic membrane
   (TM) vibrations at multiple locations on the TM to differentiate normal
   eardrums from those with associated ossicular pathologies.
   Design: Cadaveric human temporal bone study.
   Setting: Basic science laboratory.
   Methods: A mastoidectomy and facial recess approach was performed on
   four cadaveric temporal bones to obtain access to the ossicles without
   disrupting the TM. Ossicles were palpated to ensure normal mobility and
   an intact ossicular chain. Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) measurements
   were then taken on all four TMs. LDV measurements were repeated on each
   TM following stapes footplate fixation, incudo-stapedial joint
   dislocation, and malleus head fixation.
   Main outcome measures: LDV measurements of TM vibration at the umbo, the
   lateral process of the malleus, and in each of the four quadrants of the
   TM.
   Results: The best signal-to-noise ratios were found between 2 and 4 kHz,
   at the umbo, the anterior superior quadrant, the anterior inferior
   quadrant, and the posterior inferior quadrant. Since our goal was to
   assess the ossicular chain, we selected the TM locations closest to the
   ossicular chain (the umbo and lateral process of the malleus) for
   further analysis. Differences could be seen between normals and the
   simulated ossicular pathologies, but values were not statistically
   significant.
   Conclusions: LDV measurements are technically challenging and require
   optimization to obtain consistent measurements. This study demonstrates
   the potential of LDV to differentiate ossicular pathologies behind an
   intact tympanic membrane. Future studies will further characterize the
   clinical role of this diagnostic modality.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Investigating joint mechanics is important when determining
   the etiology of osteoarthritis, as degenerative changes are thought to
   occur due to altered joint mechanics. The objective of this study was to
   demonstrate the utility of an x-ray computed tomography-based approach
   to evaluate joint congruency in the setting of subtle kinematic
   alterations, employing an in vitro model of collateral ligament repair
   of the elbow.
   Methods: Active and passive elbow flexion was performed in 4 and 5
   fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities respectively using an elbow
   motion simulator in the valgus gravity dependent positions. The
   collateral ligaments were sectioned and repaired. A registration and
   inter-bone distance algorithm were then used to examine ulnohumeral
   joint congruency (quantified as surface area) throughout elbow flexion.
   Valgus angulation was also measured.
   Findings: Following ligament sectioning and repair, there was a 1.2 +/-
   1.0 degrees increase in valgus angulation in active flexion and a 21.2
   +/- 26.2\% decrease in surface area. In passive flexion, valgus
   angulation increased 3.3 +/- 2.2 degrees and surface area decreased 57.9
   +/- 39.9\%.
   Interpretation: The technique described to quantify joint congruency
   proved to be sensitive enough to detect large changes in joint surface
   interactions inspite of only small changes in traditionally measured
   kinematics. These changes in joint congruency may, in part, explain the
   high incidence of arthritis that has been reported following ligament
   injuries of the elbow, even in the absence of clinically detectable
   instability. This technique, when adapted for in vivo use, will be a
   useful tool to evaluate joint function and the effectiveness of
   treatments non-invasively. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The solution-mediated polymorphic transformation (SMPT) of L-glutamic
   acid is modeled using the method of moments (MoM) with the addition of a
   dissolution term to account for the transformation of the metastable to
   the stable polymorph. The numerical solution methodology involves the
   kinetics of nucleation, growth, and dissolution for the polymorphic
   system. The effects of the cooling profile, initial solute
   concentration, and seeding conditions on the product quality were
   investigated. In supersaturated solutions with respect to both
   polymorphs, the natural cooling yielded the highest mass of the
   metastable form, while the nonlinear cooling resulted in the highest
   mass of the stable form (13.41 g/kg of solvent). The ratio of the stable
   to metastable form masses was higher with the higher cooling rate
   parameters. In solutions supersaturated with respect to the stable form
   and undersaturated relative to the metastable form, the dissolution of
   the metastable form favored the production of the stable form. The
   number-weight average size of the stable particles was 148.5 mu m with
   the nonlinear cooling policy which was 51\% and 134\% more than those
   corresponding to the linear and natural cooling policies. Finally,
   nonlinear programming (NLP) was used in a dynamic mode to investigate
   the optimal control of the process with different objective functions.
   It was shown that the optimal control policy had a favorable effect on
   the yield of the stable or metastable form as well as the particle sizes
   at the end of the batch. The optimal control using an objective function
   to maximize the mass of the metastable form at the end of the batch
   resulted in 7.8 g of crystals/kg of solvent for metastable form which
   was 33\% and 381\% higher than the natural and linear cooling policies.
   For an objective function to maximize the mass of the stable form, the
   optimal cooling policy increased the mass of the stable form by 3.2\%
   compared to the nonlinear cooling policy.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon coating is a proven successful approach for improving the
   conductivity of LiFePO4 used in rechargeable Li-ion batteries. Different
   impurity phases can be formed during LiFePO4 synthesis. Here, a direct
   visualization of the impact of impurity phases in LiFePO4 on a carbon
   coating is presented; they are investigated on a model material using
   various surface-characterization techniques. By using polished ingot
   model materials, impurity phases can be clearly observed, identified,
   and located on the surface of the sample by scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), focused-ion-beam lithography (FIB), high-resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. During the
   carbon-coating process, the phosphorus-rich phase is found to have an
   inhibiting effect (or no positive catalytic effect) on carbon formation,
   while iron-rich phases (mainly iron phosphides) promote carbon growth by
   contributing to more carbon deposition and a higher graphitic carbon
   content. This finding, and the methodological evaluation here, will help
   us to understand and reveal the influencing factors of impurity phases
   on the basic carbon-deposition process to obtain high-performance
   LiFePO4 material for future energy-storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration control plays a crucial role in many structures, especially in
   the lightweight ones. One of the most commonly practiced method to
   suppress the undesirable vibration of structures is to attach patches of
   the constrained layer damping (CLD) onto the surface of the structure.
   In order to consider the weight efficiency of a structure, the best
   shapes and locations of the CLD patches should be determined to achieve
   the optimum vibration suppression with minimum usage of the CLD patches.
   This paper proposes a novel topology optimization technique that can
   determine the best shape and location of the applied CLD patches,
   simultaneously. Passive vibration control is formulated in the context
   of the level set method, which is a numerical technique to track shapes
   and locations concurrently. The optimal damping set could be found in a
   structure, in its fundamental vibration mode, such that the maximum
   modal loss factor of the system is achieved. Two different plate
   structures will be considered and the damping patches will be optimally
   located on them. At the same time, the best shapes of the damping
   patches will be determined too. In one example, the numerical results
   will be compared with those obtained from the experimental tests to
   validate the accuracy of the proposed method. This comparison reveals
   the effectiveness of the level set approach in finding the optimum shape
   and location of the CLD patches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This is the first in a series of papers in which we describe and report
   the analysis of a large survey of Herbig Ae/Be stars in circular
   spectropolarimetry. Using the ESPaDOnS and Narval high-resolution
   spectropolarimeters at the Canada-France-Hawaii and Bernard Lyot
   Telescopes, respectively, we have acquired 132 circularly polarized
   spectra of 70 Herbig Ae/Be stars and Herbig candidates. The large
   majority of these spectra are characterized by a resolving power of
   about 65 000, and a spectral coverage from about 3700 angstrom to 1 mu
   m. The peak signal-to-noise ratio per CCD pixel ranges from below 100
   (for the faintest targets) to over 1000 (for the brightest). The
   observations were acquired with the primary aim of searching for
   magnetic fields in these objects. However, our spectra are suitable for
   a variety of other important measurements, including rotational
   properties, variability, binarity, chemical abundances, circumstellar
   environment conditions and structure, etc. In this paper, we describe
   the sample selection, the observations and their reduction, and the
   measurements that will comprise the basis of much of our following
   analysis. We describe the determination of fundamental parameters for
   each target. We detail the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) that we
   have applied to each of our spectra, including the selection, editing
   and tuning of the LSD line masks. We describe the fitting of the LSD
   Stokes I profiles using a multicomponent model that yields the
   rotationally broadened photospheric profile (providing the projected
   rotational velocity and radial velocity for each observation) as well as
   circumstellar emission and absorption components. Finally, we diagnose
   the longitudinal Zeeman effect via the measured circular polarization,
   and report the longitudinal magnetic field and Stokes V Zeeman signature
   detection probability. As an appendix, we provide a detailed review of
   each star observed.}},

Abstract = {{We report the analysis of the rotational properties of our sample of
   Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) and related stars for which we have obtained
   high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations. Using the projected
   rotational velocities measured at the surface of the stars, we have
   calculated the angular momentum of the sample and plotted it as a
   function of age. We have then compared the angular momentum and the v
   sin i distributions of the magnetic to the non-magnetic HAeBe stars.
   Finally, we have predicted v sin i of the non-magnetic, non-binary
   ('normal') stars in our sample when they reach the zero-age main
   sequence (ZAMS), and compared them to various catalogues of v sin i of
   main-sequence stars. First, we observe that magnetic HAeBe stars are
   much slower rotators than normal stars, indicating that they have been
   more efficiently braked than the normal stars. In fact, the magnetic
   stars have already lost most of their angular momentum, despite their
   young ages (lower than 1 Myr for some of them). Secondly, our analysis
   suggests that the low-mass (1.5 < M < 5 M-circle dot) normal HAeBe stars
   evolve with constant angular momentum towards the ZAMS, while the
   high-mass normal HAeBe stars (M > 5 M-circle dot) are losing angular
   momentum. We propose that winds, which are expected to be stronger in
   massive stars, are at the origin of this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the capability of numerical cloud forecasting as a
   meteorological reference for astronomical observations, we compare the
   cloud forecast from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
   (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) model for total, layer and
   convective cloud with normalized satellite observations from the
   International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) for the period
   of 2005 July-2008 June. In general, the model forecast is consistent
   with the ISCCP observations. For total cloud cover, our result shows the
   goodness of the GFS model forecast, with a mean error within +/- 15 per
   cent in most areas. The global mean probability of <30 per cent forecast
   error (polar regions excluded) declines from 73 per cent to 58 per cent
   throughout the 180-h forecast period and is more skilled than the
   ISCCP-based climatology forecast up to tau similar to 120 h. Comparison
   using layer clouds reveals a distinct negative regional tendency for low
   cloud forecast and a questionable positive global tendency for high
   cloud forecast. Fractional and binary comparisons are performed on the
   convective cloud forecast and it is revealed that the GFS model can
   identify less than half of such cloud. In short, our result suggests
   that the GFS model can provide satisfactory worldwide total cloud
   forecasts up to a week ahead for observation-scheduling purposes, but
   layer and convective cloud forecasts are less reliable than the total
   cloud forecast.}},

   the synergistic effect of co-digestion was proven and quantified: the
   measured hydrogen productions were higher than the sums of the hydrogen
   productions calculated from each fraction, and the highest percentage

Abstract = {{An electrostatic dry coating process based on a liquid pan coater was
   developed for enteric coating of tablets with Eudragit (R) L100-55. Two
   different liquid plasticizers of triethyl citrate (TEC) and PEG400 were
   used in the coating process. In contrast to TEC, PEG400 produced good
   powder adhesion and successful coating. DSC results showed that PEG400
   lowered the glass transition temperature (T-g) of Eudragit (R) L100-55
   to a greater extent than TEC at the same blend ratio, indicating that
   PEG400 was more effective in plasticizing the polymer. PEG400 showed
   higher contact angle on both surfaces of tablet cores and coating
   powders as well as lower absorption into the tablet cores than TEC,
   suggesting that more PEG400 existed at the interface between tablet core
   and coating powders. The combination effects of higher plasticizing
   efficiency and more PEG400 available at the tablet surface produced
   higher plasticization of Eudragit (R) L100-55, leading to the
   successfully initial powder adhesion. The powder adhesion was further
   enhanced by the electrostatically assisted coating process, as confirmed
   by the higher coating level and coating efficiency with electrical
   charging (60 kV) than the ones without it (0 kV). The micrographs of
   scanning electron microscopy and in vitro drug release tests of the
   coated tablets showed that higher curing temperature and longer curing
   time led to enhanced film formation and acid resistance. The
   electrostatic dry coating process has been demonstrated to be a
   promising process for enteric coating of tablets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Is Myanmar jadeitite of Jurassic age? A result from incompletely
   recrystallized inherited zircon}},
Journal = {{LITHOS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{268-282}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Zircons from two Myanmar jadeitite samples were separated for texture,
   mineral inclusion, U-Pb dating and trace element composition analyses.
   Three types of zircons, with respect to U-Pb isotope system, were
   recognized. Type I zircons are inherited ones, yielding an igneous
   protolith age of 160 +/- 1 Ma; Type II zircons are
   metasomatic/hydrothermal ones, giving a (minimum) jadeitite formation
   age of 77 +/- 3 Ma; and Type III zircons are incompletely recrystallized
   ones, with non-coherent and geologically meaningless ages from 153 to
   105 Ma. These Myanmar jadeitites would therefore have formed through
   whole-sale metasomatic replacement processes.
   Compared with Type I zircons, Type II zircons show typical
   metasomatic/hydrothermal geochemical signatures, with low Th/U ratio
   (<0.1), small Ce anomaly (Ce/Ce{*}=<5) and low Sigma REE content (40-115
   ppm). Type III zircons, however, commonly have the above geochemical
   signatures straddle in between Type I and Type H zircons. It is shown
   that the resetting rates of various trace element compositions and U-Pb
   isotope system of inherited zircons are not coupled ``in phase{''} in
   response to zircon recrystallization during jadeitite formation. The
   observed abnormally low Th/U ratio and small Ce anomaly of some Type I
   zircons, as well as the lack of negative Eu anomaly of all Type I
   zircons, should be suspected to be of secondary origin. In extreme
   cases, incompletely recrystallized zircons may show typical
   metasomatic/hydrothermal geochemical signatures, but leave U-Pb isotope
   system partially reset or even largely unchanged. Such zircons easily
   lead to incorrect age interpretation, and hence erroneous geological
   implication.
   The Myanmar jadeitites, based on the present study, might have formed
   during the Late Cretaceous subduction before the beginning of India-Asia
   continental collision at Paleocene. Previously proposed Late Jurassic
   ages for Myanmar jadeitites are suggested as results rooted on data
   retrieved from incompletely recrystallized inherited zircons. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{With the effect of global climate change the rainfall intensity is
   changing, and in many places it is drastically increasing. The use of
   intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves based on historic rainfall
   data might, therefore, underestimate the risk associated with the design

   distribution function used in the establishment of IDF curves based on
   historical observations might need to be different for the future
   conditions. The Gumbel (EV1) distribution is the currently recommended
   distribution for use in Canada and the EV1 and the Log-Pearson type 3
   (LP3) are routinely used in the US. This study investigates potential
   utility of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution for use in
   climate change impact studies by the City of London that is located in
   the Upper Thames River Basin. All results point that GEV seems to be the
   best choice for the use with the Upper Thames River Basin data. We would
   like to use results of this study and open the discussion on the choice
   of most appropriate distribution for the development of IDF curves under

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Sn anode in rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) is currently being
   intensely investigated due to high reversible capacity and energy
   density as compared to the commercialized graphite anode. However, large
   volume change upon cycling causes poor cyclic performance, which
   prevents the practical application of Sn anode in LIBs. In this study,
   the nanosized MxSn (M = Ni, Fe, and Cr) alloys were encapsulated in
   amorphous carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) creating hybrid anode
   heterostructures. The structure of the hybrid anodes was confirmed by
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope
   (FE-SEM) and high angle dark field scanning transmission electron
   microscope (HAADF-STEM), and demonstrated that Ni3Sn4, FeSn2, and Cr2Sn3
   alloys exist in the hybrid anodes as both nanowires and nanoparticles.
   The galvanostatic cycling originating from over 330 charge-discharge
   cycles indicated that encapsulation of Ni3Sn4, FeSn2, and Cr2Sn3 into
   ACNTs results in surprisingly excellent cycling performance, high rate
   capability, and increased initial coulombic efficiency (81.4\%). Ex situ
   HAADF-STEM images of anodes after cycles showed that one-dimensional
   ACNTs as well as electrochemically inactive phase M (Ni, Fe, and Cr) in
   MxSn function as good matrices, offering ``buffer zone{''} to
   effectively accommodate the mechanical stress induced by Sn anode
   expansion and shrinkage. Importantly, ACNTs enable electrical contact of
   Sn nanoparticles with the current collectors. Therefore, our design can
   significantly overcome electrochemical degradation of anodes with large
   volume change, resulting in increased LIB performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study the impacts of the topography of Bermuda on the damage
   patterns observed following the passage of Hurricane Fabian over the
   island on 5 September 2003 are considered. Using a linearized model of
   atmospheric boundary layer flow over low-slope topography that also
   incorporates a model for changes of surface roughness, sets of
   directionally dependent wind speed adjustment factors were calculated
   for the island of Bermuda. These factors were then used in combination
   with a time-stepping model for the open water wind field of Hurricane
   Fabian derived from the Hurricane Research Division Real-Time Hurricane
   Wind Analysis System (H{*}Wind) surface wind analyses to calculate the
   maximum 1-min mean wind speed at locations across the island for the
   following conditions: open water, roughness changes only, and topography
   and roughness changes combined. Comparison of the modeled 1-min mean
   wind speeds and directions with observations from a site on the
   southeast coast of Bermuda showed good agreement between the two sets of
   values. Maximum open water wind speeds across the entire island showed
   very little variation and were of category 2 strength on the
   Saffir-Simpson scale. While the effects of surface roughness changes on
   the modeled wind speeds showed very little correlation with the observed
   damage, the effect of the underlying topography led to maximum modeled
   wind speeds of category 4 strength being reached in highly localized
   areas on the island. Furthermore, the observed damage was found to be
   very well correlated with these regions of topographically enhanced wind
   speeds, with a very clear trend of increasing damage with increasing
   wind speeds.}},

Abstract = {{For cooperative force-reflecting teleoperation over networks,
   conventional passivity-based approaches have limited applicability due
   to nonpassive slave-slave interactions and irregular communication

   teleoperator systems is developed. The framework is based on a version
   of weak input-to-output practical stability (WIOPS) nonlinear small gain
   theorem that is applicable to stability analysis of large-scale
   network-based interconnections. Based on this result, we design a
   cooperative force-reflecting teleoperator system which is guaranteed to
   be stable in the presence of multiple network-induced communication
   constraints by appropriate adjustment of local control gains and/or
   force-reflection gains. Experimental results are presented that confirm
   the validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   existing literature. Instead, IMU and GPS measurements are directly
   incorporated in the control law. An important feature of the proposed
   strategy, is that the accelerometer is used to measure the apparent

   vector, which would otherwise lead to unexpected performance when the

   This animal study confirms that variance is both sensitive and specific

Title = {{2D-3D rigid registration to compensate for prostate motion during 3D
   TRUS-guided biopsy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Three-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided
   systems have been developed to improve targeting accuracy during
   prostate biopsy. However, prostate motion during the procedure is a
   potential source of error that can cause target misalignments. The
   authors present an image-based registration technique to compensate for
   prostate motion by registering the live two-dimensional (2D) TRUS images
   acquired during the biopsy procedure to a preacquired 3D TRUS image. The
   registration must be performed both accurately and quickly in order to
   be useful during the clinical procedure.
   Methods: The authors implemented an intensity-based 2D-3D rigid
   registration algorithm optimizing the normalized cross-correlation (NCC)
   metric using Powell's method. The 2D TRUS images acquired during the
   procedure prior to biopsy gun firing were registered to the baseline 3D
   TRUS image acquired at the beginning of the procedure. The accuracy was
   measured by calculating the target registration error (TRE) using
   manually identified fiducials within the prostate; these fiducials were
   used for validation only and were not provided as inputs to the
   registration algorithm. They also evaluated the accuracy when the
   registrations were performed continuously throughout the biopsy by
   acquiring and registering live 2D TRUS images every second. This
   measured the improvement in accuracy resulting from performing the
   registration, continuously compensating for motion during the procedure.
   To further validate the method using a more challenging data set,
   registrations were performed using 3D TRUS images acquired by
   intentionally exerting different levels of ultrasound probe pressures in
   order to measure the performance of our algorithm when the prostate
   tissue was intentionally deformed. In this data set, biopsy scenarios
   were simulated by extracting 2D frames from the 3D TRUS images and
   registering them to the baseline 3D image. A graphics processing unit
   (GPU)-based implementation was used to improve the registration speed.
   They also studied the correlation between NCC and TREs.
   Results: The root-mean-square (RMS) TRE of registrations performed prior
   to biopsy gun firing was found to be 1.87 +/- 0.81 mm. This was an
   improvement over 4.75 +/- 2.62 mm before registration. When the
   registrations were performed every second during the biopsy, the RMS TRE
   was reduced to 1.63 +/- 0.51 mm. For 3D data sets acquired under
   different probe pressures, the RMS TRE was found to be 3.18 +/- 1.6 mm.
   This was an improvement from 6.89 +/- 4.1 mm before registration. With
   the GPU based implementation, the registrations were performed with a
   mean time of 1.1 s. The TRE showed a weak correlation with the
   similarity metric. However, the authors measured a generally convex
   shape of the metric around the ground truth, which may explain the rapid
   convergence of their algorithm to accurate results.
   Conclusions: Registration to compensate for prostate motion during 3D
   TRUS-guided biopsy can be performed with a measured accuracy of less
   than 2 mm and a speed of 1.1 s, which is an important step toward

Title = {{Fluidelastic Instability Modeling of Loosely Supported Multispan U-Tubes
   in Nuclear Steam Generators}},

Abstract = {{Steam generators in nuclear power plants have experienced tube failures
   caused by flow-induced vibrations. Two excitation mechanisms are
   responsible for such failures; random turbulence excitation and
   fluidelastic instability. The random turbulence excitation mechanism
   results in long-term failures due to fretting-wear damage at the tube
   supports, while fluidelastic instability results in short-term failures
   due to excessive vibration of the tubes. Such failures may require
   shutdowns, which result in production losses, and pose potential threats
   to human safety and the environment. Therefore, it is imperative to
   predict the nonlinear tube response and the associated fretting-wear
   damage to tubes due to fluid excitation. In this paper, a numerical
   model is developed to predict the nonlinear dynamic response of a steam
   generator with multispan U-tubes and anti-vibration bar supports, and
   the associated fretting wear due to fluid excitation. Both the crossflow
   turbulence and fluidelastic instability forces are considered in this
   model. The finite element method is utilized to model the vibrations and
   impact dynamics. The tube bundle geometry is similar to the geometry
   used in CANDU steam generators. Eight sets of flat-bar supports are
   considered. Moreover, the effect of clearances between the tubes and
   their supports, and axial offset between the supports are investigated.
   The results are presented and comparisons are made for the parameters
   influencing the fretting-wear damage, such as contact ratio, impact
   forces, and normal work rate. It is clear that tubes in loose flat-bar
   supports have complex dynamics due to a combination of geometry,
   tube-to-support clearance, offset, and misalignment. However, the
   results of the numerical simulation along with the developed model
   provide new insight into the flow-induced vibration mechanism and
   fretting wear of multispan U-tubes that can be incorporated into future
   design guidelines for steam generators and large heat exchangers.

   Vascularity of myocardium and gastrocnemius muscle in rats selectively

   First published December 11, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00110.2012.-We tested the hypothesis that
   changes in the arteriolar branching architecture contributed to
   increased running capacity of rats subjected to two-way artificial
   selection for intrinsic aerobic endurance treadmill running capacity
   resulting in strains of low-capacity and high-capacity endurance rats.
   Hearts and gastrocnemius muscles were harvested from each strain, and
   the microvasculature's branching geometry measured from micro-CT images.
   The vascular branching geometry of the hearts and skeletal muscle from
   the high capacity was indistinguishable from low-capacity rats. Our
   hypothesis was not supported. Neither remodeling nor an increase in
   arteriolar microvasculature branching appears to play a role in the
   enhanced performance of the high capacity rats. We are led to speculate
   that endothelial tolerance for shear stress and/or increased coupling of
   myocardial muscle fiber metabolic-to-contractile function is increased
   in the high-capacity runner strain to the effect of allowing either
   higher flow rate per unit volume of muscle or more efficient use of
   oxygen and nutrients in the high-capacity endurance rats.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at synthesizing one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures of
   TiO2 using atomic layer deposition (ALD) on anodic aluminum oxide (AAO)
   templates and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The precursors used are titanium
   tetraisopropoxide (TTIP, Ti(OCH(CH3)(2))(4)) and deionized water. It was
   found that the morphologies and structural phases of as-deposited TiO2
   are controllable through adjusting cycling numbers of ALD and growth
   temperatures. Commonly, a low temperature (150 degrees C) produced
   amorphous TiO2 while a high temperature (250 degrees C) led to
   crystalline anatase TiO2 on both AAO and CNTs. In addition, it was
   revealed that the deposition of TiO2 is also subject to the influences
   of the applied substrates. The work well demonstrated that ALD is a
   precise route to synthesize 1D nanostructures of TiO2. The resultant
   nanostructured TiO2 can be important candidates in many applications,
   such as water splitting, solar cells, lithium-ion batteries, and gas
   sensors. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Site response in Japan is characterized using thousands of surface and
   borehole recordings from events of moment magnitude collected by the
   KiK-net network, including the 2011 M9.0 Tohoku earthquake. Site
   amplification is defined by the ratio of motions at the surface to those
   at depth (within the borehole), corrected for the depth effect due to
   destructive interference using a technique based on cross-spectral
   ratios between surface and down-hole motions. Site effects were
   particularly strong at high frequencies, despite the expectation that
   high-frequency response may be damped by nonlinear effects. In part, the
   large amplitudes at high frequencies are due to the prevalence of
   shallow soil conditions in Japan. We searched for typical symptoms for
   soil nonlinearity, such as a decrease in the predominant frequency
   and/or amplification, using spectral ratios of weak to strong ground
   motions. Localized nonlinearity occurred at some recording sites, but
   was not pervasive. We developed a general empirical model to express
   site amplification for the KiK-net sites as a function of common site
   variables, such as the average shear-wave velocity in the uppermost 30 m
   ( and the horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratio. We use the model
   to estimate site-corrected ground-motions for the Tohoku mainshock for a
   reference site condition; these motions are in reasonable agreement with
   the predictions of some of the published ground motion prediction
   equations for subduction zones.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconium Oxide (ZrO2) was deposited on graphene nanosheets (GNS) by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) using tetrakis(dimethylamido)zirconium(IV)
   and water as precursors. The results indicated that both morphology and
   crystallinity of the deposited ZrO2 were controllable in a temperature
   range of 150-250 degrees C. At all the temperatures studied, ZrO2
   nanoparticles were formed with lower number of ALD cycles (<10 cycles at
   150 degrees C and <30 cycles at 200 and 250 degrees C), while ZrO2 thin
   films were achieved uniformly with higher number of ALD cycles (>10
   cycles at 150 degrees C and >30 cycles at 200 and 250 degrees C). The
   crystallinity of the deposited ZrO2 was highly dependent on the
   deposition temperature. The ZrO2 deposited at 150 degrees C exhibited
   mainly amorphous nature, whereas that prepared at 250 degrees C
   consisted of crystalline phase. At 200 degrees C, a mixture of amorphous
   and crystalline ZrO2 appeared in the ZrO2-GNS nanocomposite. In all
   cases, the growth of ZrO2 on GNS showed a transformation from an
   ``island growth{''} mode to a ``layer-by-layer growth{''} mode with
   increasing ALD cycle. Cyclic voltammetry measurement demonstrated that
   10-cycle ZrO2-GNS nanocomposite exhibited evident electrochemical

Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{44-56}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites are used extensively to
   strengthen and/or to rehabilitate infrastructures. The current study
   focuses on the use of GFRP for enhancing local buckling behaviour of
   wide flange steel beams. The study is conducted numerically using a
   nonlinear finite element model developed in-house. In the numerical
   model, consistent shell elements are used to simulate the flanges and
   web of the steel beams as well as the GFRP plates. The interface between
   the steel and GFRP plates is simulated using a set of continuous linear
   spring systems representing both the shear and peel stiffness of the
   adhesive based on values obtained from a previous experimental study.
   The numerical model is validated using test results and numerical
   predictions available in literature. Various failure modes, including
   GFRP rupture, adhesive shear failure, and local buckling of the flanges
   of beams are included in the model. The effect of geometric imperfection
   and residual stresses are also included. The model is then used to
   conduct a parametric study to assess the effect of bonding GFRP plates
   on enhancing the local buckling behaviour of wide flange steel beams.
   The results reveal that the effectiveness of this approach especially
   for the case of slender beams. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{The papers in this special issue reflect several of the major themes and
   topics from the 7th International Workshop on Gravel-Bed Rivers. The
   papers focus primarily on aspects of bed material transport in
   gravel-bed rivers and larger scale morpho-dynamics. Research in
   gravel-bed rivers is increasingly integrating processes over a wide
   range of temporal and spatial scales by combining field observation, lab
   experimentation, numerical modeling and theory testing in a range of
   river types, aided by new technological developments in particle
   tracking, computational modeling and high resolution spatial data. This
   is leading to greater understanding of the processes leading to
   distinctive morpho-dynamics of river types and a more reliable basis for
   river management. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Although Random Testing (RT) is low cost and straightforward, its
   effectiveness is not satisfactory. To increase the effectiveness of RT,
   researchers have developed Adaptive Random Testing (ART) and
   Quasi-Random Testing (QRT) methods which attempt to maximize the test
   case coverage of the input domain. This paper proposes the use of
   Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) to address this problem.
   Accordingly, a test case generation method, namely, Random Border CVT
   (RBCVT), is proposed which can enhance the previous RT methods to
   improve their coverage of the input space. The generated test cases by
   the other methods act as the input to the RBCVT algorithm and the output
   is an improved set of test cases. Therefore, RBCVT is not an independent
   method and is considered as an add-on to the previous methods. An
   extensive simulation study and a mutant-based software testing
   investigation have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   RBCVT against the ART and QRT methods. Results from the experimental
   frameworks demonstrate that RBCVT outperforms previous methods. In
   addition, a novel search algorithm has been incorporated into RBCVT
   reducing the order of computational complexity of the new approach. To
   further analyze the RBCVT method, randomness analysis was undertaken
   demonstrating that RBCVT has the same characteristics as ART methods in
   this regard.}},

Title = {{Flows in annuli with longitudinal grooves}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{716}},
Pages = {{280-315}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Analysis of pressure losses in laminar flows through annuli fitted with
   longitudinal grooves has been carried out. The additional pressure
   gradient required in order to maintain the same flow rate in the grooved
   annuli, as well as in the reference smooth annuli, is used as a measure
   of the loss. The groove-induced changes can be represented as a
   superposition of a pressure drop due to a change in the average position
   of the bounding cylinders and a pressure drop due to flow modulations
   induced by the shape of the grooves. The former effect can be evaluated
   analytically while the latter requires explicit computations. It has
   been demonstrated that a reduced-order model is an effective tool for
   extraction of the features of groove geometry that lead to flow
   modulations relevant to drag generation. One Fourier mode from the
   Fourier expansion representing the annulus geometry is sufficient to
   predict pressure losses with an accuracy sufficient for most
   applications in the case of equal-depth grooves. It is shown that the
   presence of the grooves may lead to a reduction of pressure loss in
   spite of an increase of the surface wetted area. The drag-decreasing
   grooves are characterized by the groove wavenumber M/R-1 being smaller
   than a certain critical value, where M denotes the number of grooves and
   R-1 stands for the radius of the annulus. This number marginally depends
   on the groove amplitude and does not depend on the flow Reynolds number.
   It is shown that the drag reduction mechanism relies on the
   re-arrangement of the bulk flow that leads to the largest mass flow
   taking place in the area of the largest annulus opening. The form of the
   optimal grooves from the point of view of the maximum drag reduction has
   been determined. This form depends on the type of constraints imposed.
   In general, the optimal shape can be described using the reduced-order
   model involving only a few Fourier modes. It is shown that in the case
   of equal-depth grooves, the optimal shape can be approximated using a
   special form of trapezoid. In the case of unequal-depth grooves, where
   the groove depth needs to be determined as part of the optimization
   procedure, the optimal geometry, consisting of the optimal depth and the
   corresponding optimal shape, can be approximated using a delta function.
   The maximum possible drag reduction, corresponding to the optimal
   geometry, has been determined.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Heat transfer resulting from the natural convection in a fluid layer
   contained in an infinite horizontal slot bounded by solid walls and
   subject to a spatially periodic heating at the lower wall has been
   investigated. The heating produces sinusoidal temperature variations
   along one horizontal direction characterized by the wave number alpha
   with the amplitude expressed in terms of a suitably defined Rayleigh
   number Ra-p. The maximum heat transfer takes place for the heating with
   the wave numbers alpha= 0(1) as this leads to the most intense
   convection. The intensity of convection decreases proportionally to
   alpha when alpha -> 0, resulting in the temperature field being
   dominated by periodic conduction with the average Nusselt number
   decreasing proportionally to alpha(2). When alpha ->(sic), the
   convection is confined to a thin layer adjacent to the lower wall with
   its intensity decreasing proportionally to alpha(-3). The temperature
   field above the convection layer looses dependence on the horizontal
   direction. The bulk of the fluid sees the thin convective layer as a
   ``hot wall.{''} The heat transfer between the walls becomes dominated by
   conduction driven by a uniform vertical temperature gradient which
   decreases proportionally to the intensity of convection resulting in the
   average Nusselt number decreasing as alpha(-3). It is shown that
   processes described above occur for Prandtl numbers 0.001 < Pr < 10
   considered in this study. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007420]}},

Abstract = {{The first anion with four polymerizable groups has been synthesized and
   used to produce durable, crosslinked polyelectrolyte (PE) coatings in a
   single step. Sodium tetrakis( 4-vinylphenyl) borate (NaBSty(4)) was
   produced by the reaction of BCI3 and the Grignard of 4-bromostyrene. The
   full series of borates NaBPh(x)Sty(4-x'), x = 1-3, were also synthesized
   analogously by reaction of the styryl-Grignard and PhBCI2, Ph2BCI, or
   Ph3B. Anion exchange of the borates with tributyl
   4-vinylbenzylphosphonium chloride gave a family of organic salts
   developed for applications in photopolymerized coatings. The percent UV
   cure of the polymer films was determined by infrared spectroscopy and
   this relative level of curing was corroborated by differential scanning
   calorimetry analysis. The degree of crosslinking imparted to the polymer
   films by the different monomers has resulted in varied mechanical
   properties, which were probed by diamond tip scratch tests and
   nanoindentation. These clearly demonstrated that as the number of
   polymerizable groups increased, the film hardness increased
   correspondingly. The final hardness of the films exceeds those of other
   related systems and identifies styryl borates as viable crosslinking
   additives in UV curable technologies, especially in the production of
   durable PE films. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part

Abstract = {{Liquid injections are applied widely in fluidized bed reactors such as
   Fluid Cokers, fluid catalytic crackers and polymerization reactors. In
   such industrial processes, it is necessary to optimize the contact
   between the injected liquid and the bed solids as it has a significant
   effect on product yields and quality, and reactor operability.
   The present paper presents and tests a novel measurement method
   employing electrical conductance to characterize the liquid distribution
   in a large scale fluid bed of about 7 tonnes of silica sand, using
   commercial-scale Fluid Coker spray nozzles. It was used to determine the
   effect of increasing atomization gas-to-liquid ratio (G/L) on the
   liquid-solid contact efficiency. Electrodes have been employed to map
   the free moisture distribution through the entire bed. The results
   indicated that raising the G/L ratio improves the contact efficiency,
   especially at high G/L ratios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Product quality in high-shear granulation is easily compromised by minor
   changes in raw material properties or process conditions. It is desired
   to develop a process analytical technology (PAT) that can monitor the

   work, the application of audible acoustic emissions (AAEs) as a PAT tool
   was investigated. A condenser microphone was placed at the top of the
   air exhaust on a PMA-10 high-shear granulator to collect AAEs for a
   design of experiment (DOE) varying impeller speed, total binder volume
   and spray rate. The results showed the 10 Hz total power spectral
   densities (TPSDs) between 20 and 250 Hz were significantly affected by
   the changes in process conditions. Impeller speed and spray rate were
   shown to have statistically significant effects on granulation wetting,
   and impeller speed and total binder volume were significant in terms of
   process end-point. The DOE results were confirmed by a multivariate PLS
   model of the TPSDs. The scores plot showed separation based on impeller
   speed in the first component and spray rate in the second component. The
   findings support the use of AAEs to monitor changes in process

Abstract = {{Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an extracellular matrix protein found in
   mineralized tissues of the skeleton and dentition. BSP is
   multifunctional, affecting cell attachment and signaling through an RGD
   integrin-binding region, and acting as a positive regulator for mineral
   precipitation by nucleating hydroxyapatite crystals. BSP is present in
   cementum, the hard tissue covering the tooth root that anchors
   periodontal ligament (PDL) attachment. To test our hypothesis that BSP
   plays an important role in cementogenesis, we analyzed tooth development
   in a Bsp null ((-/-)) mouse model. Developmental analysis by histology,
   histochemistry, and SEM revealed a significant reduction in acellular
   cementum formation on Bsp(-/-) mouse molar and incisor roots, and the
   cementum deposited appeared hypomineralized. Structural defects in
   cementum-PDL interfaces in Bsp(-/-) mice caused PDL detachment, likely
   contributing to the high incidence of incisor malocclusion. Loss of BSP
   caused progressively disorganized PDL and significantly increased
   epithelial down-growth with aging. Bsp(-/-) mice displayed extensive
   root and alveolar bone resorption, mediated by increased RANKL and the
   presence of osteoclasts. Results collected here suggest that BSP plays a
   non-redundant role in acellular cementum formation, likely involved in
   initiating mineralization on the root surface. Through its importance to
   cementum integrity, BSP is essential for periodontal function.}},

   Shear modulus reduction of sands becomes more nonlinear at reduced

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics-based optimization methodology is
   developed, appropriate for the geometric optimization of enhanced heat
   transfer devices based upon the principle of entropy generation
   minimization, in which the objective function is evaluated from a flow
   field obtained by computational simulation. A quasi-Newton optimization
   procedure is employed, with computation of the objective function
   gradients based upon a finite difference approach. The optimization
   procedure is developed to be general with regard to the choice of
   objective function, the details of the problem under consideration, and
   the computational methodology employed in solving the fluid flow and
   heat transfer problems. A novel implementation of a Taylor series-based
   procedure for the fast solution of nearby problems is presented, which
   is found to greatly benefit the efficiency of the present methodology.
   Finally, a numerical experiment is presented, illustrating the use of
   the present method in the geometric optimization of a practical enhanced
   heat transfer device on the basis of the criterion of entropy generation
   minimization. The optimization of the fin spacing of a simple plate fin
   heat sink is considered, and a comparison of the computational results
   with results obtained by analytical optimization based upon empirical
   friction factor and Nusselt number correlations is given. Copyright (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{317}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{A model is proposed in which the relationship between individual neurons
   within a neural network is dynamically changing to the effect of
   providing a measure of ``plasticity{''} in the control of heart rate.
   The neural network on which the model is based consists of three
   populations of neurons residing in the central nervous system, the
   intrathoracic extracardiac nervous system, and the intrinsic cardiac
   nervous system. This hierarchy of neural centers is used to challenge
   the classical view that the control of heart rate, a key clinical index,
   resides entirely in central neuronal command (spinal cord, medulla
   oblongata, and higher centers). Our results indicate that dynamic
   networking allows for the possibility of an interplay among the three
   populations of neurons to the effect of altering the order of control of
   heart rate among them. This interplay among the three levels of control
   allows for different neural pathways for the control of heart rate to
   emerge under different blood flow demands or disease conditions and, as
   such, it has significant clinical implications because current
   understanding and treatment of heart rate anomalies are based largely on
   a single level of control and on neurons acting in unison as a single
   entity rather than individually within a (plastically) interconnected
   network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Precise determination of competitive adsorption isotherm is of great
   importance for model-based optimization and scale-up of chromatographic
   separation processes, particularly for the simulated moving bed (SMB)
   systems due to its intrinsic complexity. In this study, five parameters
   of a bi-Langmuir model for adsorption of ketoprofen enantiomers on a
   preparative Chiralpak AD column at 25 degrees C were determined by the
   application of inverse method (IM). Transport-dispersive (TD) model
   parameters, axial dispersion and mass transfer coefficients were
   independently estimated first by tuning a series of linear pulse
   experiments. Competitive adsorption isotherm model parameters were then
   determined independently by fitting the experimental data. A new
   numerical scheme that couples non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
   (NSGA) and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) was proposed for the data
   fitting. NSGA was capable of rapidly locating the optimal solution in
   the parametric space while LGA allowed speedy convergence given a good
   initial guess. Independently measured band profiles and simulated moving
   bed (SMB) experiments were later used to validate the model parameters.
   The experimental results were in good agreement with the model
   predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using lattice
   oxygen. Ethane ODH is studied under an oxygen-free atmosphere employing
   a 10 wt.\% VOx, supported on c-Al2O3. TPR and TPO show that the prepared
   10 wt.\% VOx,, supported on c-alumina catalyst is a stable catalyst over
   repeated reduction and oxidation cycles. XRD shows the absence of V2O5
   bulk surface species and a high dispersion of VOx on the support
   surface. Experiments are carried out in the CREC Fluidized Bed Riser
   Simulator at 550-600 degrees C and pressures close to atmospheric
   conditions. Reactivity tests show that the prepared ODH catalyst
   displays 6.5-27.6\% ethane conversion and 57.6-84.5\% ethylene
   selectivity in the 550-600 degrees C range. Metal-support interaction is
   assessed using ammonia TPD. This provides the desorption energy for both
   the bare c-Al2O3 support and for the VOx/c-Al2O3 catalyst. A slightly
   increased desorption energy is found when using the V-loaded catalyst.
   This shows low metal-support interactions and as a result, a well
   dispersed VOx catalyst phase with high availability of lattice oxygen
   for ODH. These findings are confirmed with XRD, showing no changes with
   respect to the XRD for the c-Al2O3 alumina support. This proves that
   there are no other species formed due to the interaction between the VOx
   surface species and the Al2O3 support. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotubes are the subject of intense research due to their unique
   properties: light weight, significant strength, excellent conductivity,
   and outstanding chemical resistance. This has led to their application
   in a wide variety of industries (e.g., in composite materials). As a
   result of their potential impact to humans and ecosystems, there is
   increasing interest in understanding the factors that control the
   transport of carbon nanotubes in the environment, and of particular
   interest to this study, their transport in porous media. In this work,
   the transport behavior of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is
   investigated in sand packed column experiments. To determine the
   importance of MWCNT diameter, experiments were conducted using four
   commercially available MWCNTs. Results suggest that smaller MWCNTs are
   less mobile than their larger counterparts, likely due to the increase
   in Brownian motion leading to more MWCNT collisions with the porous
   media with decreasing MWCNT size. A numerical model was used to simulate
   observed MWCNT transport behavior and facilitate comparison with
   published studies. These results suggest that careful characterization
   of MWCNT characteristics (i.e., dimensions and initial MWCNT mass in
   suspension) is essential to adequately interpret observed results.
   Results from this study suggest that MWCNTs may be mobile under
   conditions expected in subsurface aquifers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A spectral approach is proposed to determine the flow field of a thin
   film inside narrow channels of arbitrary shape. Although the method is
   easily extended to transient flow, only steady flow is considered here.
   The flow field is represented spectrally in the depthwise direction in
   terms of orthonormal shape functions, which together with the Galerkin
   projection lead to a system of ordinary differential equations that can
   be solved using standard methods. The method is particularly effective
   for nonlinear flow, including nonlinearities of geometrical or material
   origins. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated for a flow
   with inertia, and, unlike the depth-averaging method, is not limited to
   a flow at small Reynolds number. The problem is closely related to
   high-speed lubrication flow. The validity of the spectral representation
   is assessed by examining the convergence of the method, and comparing it
   with the fully two-dimensional finite-element solution, and the widely
   used depth-averaging method from shallow-water theory. It is found that
   a low number of modes are usually sufficient to secure convergence and
   accuracy. The influence of inertia is examined on the velocity and
   pressure fields. The pressure distributions reflect excellent agreement
   between the low-order spectral method and the finite-element solution,
   even at moderately high Reynolds number. The depth-averaging solution is
   unable to predict accurately (qualitatively and quantitatively) the
   high-inertia flow. Comparison of the velocity field reflects the
   expected discrepancy in a boundary layer formulation. Copyright (c)?2012

Abstract = {{Plants produce a wide range of allelochemicals to defend against
   herbivore attack, and generalist herbivores have evolved mechanisms to
   avoid, sequester, or detoxify a broad spectrum of natural defense
   compounds. Successful arthropod pests have also developed resistance to
   diverse classes of pesticides and this adaptation is of critical
   importance to agriculture. To test whether mechanisms to overcome plant
   defenses predispose the development of pesticide resistance, we examined
   adaptation of the generalist two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus
   urticae, to host plant transfer and pesticides. T. urticae is an extreme
   polyphagous pest with more than 1,100 documented hosts and has an
   extraordinary ability to develop pesticide resistance. When mites from a
   pesticide-susceptible strain propagated on bean were adapted to a
   challenging host (tomato), transcriptional responses increased over time
   with similar to 7.5\% of genes differentially expressed after five
   generations. Whereas many genes with altered expression belonged to
   known detoxification families (like P450 monooxygenases), new gene
   families not previously associated with detoxification in other
   herbivores showed a striking response, including ring-splitting
   dioxygenase genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Strikingly,
   transcriptional profiles of tomato-adapted mites resembled those of
   multipesticide-resistant strains, and adaptation to tomato decreased the
   susceptibility to unrelated pesticide classes. Our findings suggest key
   roles for both an expanded environmental response gene repertoire and
   transcriptional regulation in the life history of generalist herbivores.
   They also support a model whereby selection for the ability to mount a
   broad response to the diverse defense chemistry of plants predisposes
   the evolution of pesticide resistance in generalists.}},

Abstract = {{Safety and reliability are important in the cloud computing environment.
   This is especially true today as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
   attacks constitute one of the largest threats faced by Internet users
   and cloud computing services. DDoS attacks target the resources of these
   services, lowering their ability to provide optimum usage of the network
   infrastructure. Due to the nature of cloud computing, the methodologies
   for preventing or stopping DDoS attacks are quite different compared to
   those used in traditional networks. In this paper, we investigate the
   effect of DDoS attacks on cloud resources and recommend practical
   defense mechanisms against different types of DDoS attacks in the cloud
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{In the era of m-Learning, it is found that educational institutions have
   onus of incorporating the latest technological innovations that can be
   accepted and understood widely. While investigating the important theme
   of fast-paced development of emerging technologies in mobile
   communications, it is important to recognize the extent influence of
   these innovations using which society can communicate, learn, access
   information, and, additionally, interact. In addition, the usage of
   mobile technology in higher education needs not only the pervasive
   nature of the technology but also its disruptive nature that offers
   several challenges while incorporation in the area of teaching and
   learning.
   Therefore, recently, higher education institutions are looking at
   various ways of implementing m-Learning strategies, in order to offer
   solutions, which, in turn, can standardize the process of education and,
   additionally, replace those traditional didactic courses, focusing on
   m-Learning's endless benefits. Some of the benefits are: the process of
   learning itself could be self-paced, whereas information could be easier
   accessed, adding to independent, discovery-oriented learning that
   becomes more engaging. Applying CMM successfully to design effective
   incorporation strategies of m-Learning, this research targets
   formulation of such a maturity model by which the process of m-Learning
   can be more effective and efficient.}},

   three-level isolated dc-dc converters. The main feature of three-level
   converters is that the voltage stress across their switches is half the

   comparable two level dc-dc converters. In this paper, the efficiency
   performance of a three-level dc-dc converter is compared to ZVS
   three-level and ZVZCS three-level dc-dc converters. The basic concepts
   of each topology are reviewed, and a comparison involving the number of
   passive elements and active switches used, the stresses of the
   semiconductors devices, and efficiency measurements based on
   experimental results is made. Conclusions based on this comparison are
   presented as well.}},

   prevents the dc bus voltage from becoming excessive while still allowing
   a single-stage converter topology to be used. In the paper, the

Abstract = {{Off-pump beating heart interventions require a good guidance system to
   show both cardiac anatomy and motion. Over the years, echocardiography
   has become a popular solution for such a purpose because of its
   real-time imaging capability, flexibility, non-invasiveness, and low
   cost. However, it can be difficult for surgeons to appreciate the
   position and orientation of 2D images and to keep surgical tools and
   targets both shown in the image plane with only ultrasound guidance. In
   this paper, we propose to use CT images as high-quality 3D context to
   enhance ultrasound images through image registration to provide a better
   guidance system with very few changes to standard workflow. We have also
   developed a method to generate synthetic 4D CT images through non-rigid
   registration, when dynamic pre-operative CT images are not available.
   The validation of synthetic CT images was performed by comparing them to
   real dynamic CT images and the validation of CT-ultrasound registration
   was performed with static, dynamic, and synthetic CT images.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate motion due to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe pressure and
   patient movement causes target misalignments during 3D TRUS-guided
   biopsy. Several solutions have been proposed to perform 2D-3D
   registration for motion compensation. To improve registration accuracy
   and robustness, we developed and evaluated a registration algorithm
   whose optimization is based on learned prostate motion characteristics
   relative to different tracked probe positions and prostate sizes. We
   performed a principal component analysis of previously observed motions
   and utilized the principal directions to initialize Powell's direction
   set method during optimization. Compared with the standard
   initialization, our approach improved target registration error to 2.53
   +/- 1.25 mm after registration. Multiple initializations along the major
   principal directions improved the robustness of the method at the cost
   of additional execution time of 1.5 s. With a total execution time of
   3.2 s to perform motion compensation, this method is amenable to useful
   integration into a clinical 3D guided prostate biopsy workflow.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of sum-rate maximization for an
   active channel subject to two constraints, one on the source total
   transmit power and one on the channel energy (or total power). Here,
   active channel refers to a parallel channel where not only can the
   source transmit power over different subchannels can be optimally
   calculated but also the gains of the subchannels can also be adjusted.
   Despite the non-convexity of this sum-rate maximization problem for
   active channels, using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we determine
   the number of subchannels that can be active for the source power
   constraint to be feasible. Then, for any feasible number of active
   subchannels, we obtain the optimal source power allocation. The optimal
   solution can then be obtained by comparing a finite number of points in
   the feasible set and by choosing the point which yields the best
   sum-rate performance. Our analysis and simulation results show that
   active channels can offer significantly higher sum-rate compared to
   their passive counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Smartphones have become the most used electronic devices. They carried
   out most of the functionalities of desktops, allowing various useful
   applications that suit the users' needs. Therefore, instead of the
   operator, the user has become the number one controller of the device
   and its applications and thus its reliability becomes an emergent need.
   We aim to investigate and evaluate the efficacy of Software Reliability
   Growth Models (SRGMs) when applied to Smartphone application failure
   data and check whether they achieve the same success as in the
   desktop/laptop area. We selected three of the most used SRGMs and
   applied them to three different Smartphone applications. None of the
   selected models were able to account for the data satisfactorily. Their
   failure is traced back to the specific features of mobile applications
   compared to desktop applications. Thus, a suitable model for Smartphone
   applications is still needed to improve their reliability.}},

   Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) safe robot manipulator. Magneto-Rheological
   (MR) clutches are incorporated in the design to enable antagonistic

   bidirectional actuation of all joints. Unlike most current safe robots,
   high quality actuation is preserved, while the manipulator weight and
   effective inertia are reduced. This is achieved by relocating the
   driving motor to the base of the robot. Moreover, MR clutches have been
   shown to pose superior torque to mass, and torque to inertia
   characteristics over conventional servo motors, further contributing to
   the reduction of manipulator mass and inertia. The manipulator exhibits
   both high performance and intrinsic safety as a result of mechanically
   passive dynamics. A set of experiments is performed to validate the

Abstract = {{The projection-based force reflection (PBFR) algorithms were previously
   demonstrated to substantially improve stability characteristics of the
   force reflecting teleoperator systems and haptic interfaces without
   transparency deterioration in the steady state; however, the transient
   response of the PFBR algorithms suffers from relatively slow force
   convergence. In particular, the high frequency component of the contact
   force, which is very important for the haptic perception of stiff
   surfaces, is typically filtered out. In this paper, a solution to this
   problem is proposed which is based on the idea to separate different
   frequency bands in the force reflection signal and consequently apply
   the projection-based principle to the low-frequency component, while
   reflecting the high-frequency component directly. It is shown that, for
   bilateral teleoperators with irregular communication delays, stability
   can always be achieved by implementing the above described force
   reflection scheme, if the cut-off frequency of the complementary filters
   is sufficiently high and a certain weighting coefficient in the force
   reflection algorithm is sufficiently low. Experimental results
   demonstrate that substantial simultaneous improvement of stability and
   transparency is achieved using the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a teleoperated dual-user system incorporating
   Virtual Fixtures (VFs) that allows concurrent performance of a robotic
   surgical task by an expert and a trainee. In order to guide the trainee
   through the procedure, an adaptive VF is created in the trainee's
   workspace according to the motion generated by the expert who is
   performing the surgery at the same time. The VF gets adaptively adjusted
   based on the level of expertise the trainee shows during the surgery. In
   addition, the trainee's level of expertise is used to adaptively adjust
   the dual-user dominance factor in an online fashion, which gives the
   trainee some authority over the task based on his/her skill level. To
   quantify the trainee's expertise level, a performance measure is
   proposed, based on the force generated by the VF. Three performance
   measures from the literature are also used. To satisfy the desired
   objectives of the proposed system, an impedance-based control
   methodology is adopted. Stability of the closed-loop system is
   investigated using the small-gain theorem. A sufficient stability
   condition is derived that guarantees stability in the presence of
   time-varying communication delay. Experimental results are given to
   validate the performance of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, catheter-based cardiac ablation has been the
   first surgical option for treatment of arrhythmia. In order to have an
   effective ablation procedure, after positioning the catheter at the
   desired location inside the heart chamber, a consistent tip/tissue
   contact should be maintained during the whole procedure. With the goal
   of implementing hybrid force/position control of the catheter tip during
   the ablation procedure, this paper studies how the catheter tip deflects
   when forces are applied. A pseudo-rigid-body 3R model for the catheter
   tip is introduced. The model performance is evaluated through extensive
   experiments and it is shown that the proposed model can estimate the
   shape of the bending section of the ablation catheter if force
   information is available. This model does not require extensive
   knowledge of the catheter internal structure. Moreover, the
   well-established static equations are simple to understand and solve,
   making this model a convenient choice for developing a control system.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing popularity of catheter-based ablation therapy in treating
   cardiac arrhythmia has motivated researchers to seek new techniques to
   improve the accuracy and efficiency of such procedures. After guiding
   the catheter through the vessels into the heart chambers, precise
   positioning of the catheter tip and consistent tool/tissue contact force
   are the two factors that greatly affect the ablation outcome.
   Implementing force/position control of the catheter tip will improve the
   efficacy of cardiac ablation procedures immensely. This paper proposes a
   model-based force control system to ensure a desired contact force at
   the distal tip, without directly measuring the force applied at the tip.
   In this regard, it is studied how the displacement of the proximal
   handle of a common 7-Fr pull-wire ablation catheter relates to the
   change of angle at its distal tip. The resulting mapping together with a
   mapping that relates the forces at the distal tip to the tip shape are
   used in developing a control system that ensures a desired contact force
   at the tip. This paper also introduces an optical strain sensor that can
   be used without modification in the manufacture of present day ablation
   catheters. This strain sensor completes the feedback loop of the control
   system through integration with the shape to force model. Performance of
   the control system is evaluated experimentally and the results suggest
   that model-based control of steerable catheters is feasible for catheter
   ablation. The proposed control system can be employed on a conventional
   ablation catheter following a fairly simple calibration step.}},

Abstract = {{Concentric-tube robots can offer dexterous positioning even in a small
   constrained environment. This technology turns out to be beneficial in
   many classes of minimally invasive procedures. However, one of the
   barriers to the practical use of a concentric-tube robot is the design
   of a real-time control scheme. In previous work by the authors, a
   computationally efficient torsionally compliant kinematic model of a
   concentric-tube robot was developed. Using this computationally fast
   technique and deriving the robot's Jacobian, a new position control
   approach is proposed in this paper. This mechanism provides
   computational efficiency as well as good tracking accuracy. To evaluate
   the performance, experiments were conducted, and the results obtained
   demonstrate the feasibility of enabling the robot's tip to perform
   trajectory tracking in real time.}},

Abstract = {{Reliance on costly and polluting diesel generators is a major difficulty
   common to almost all the remote offgrid communities. However, there are
   oftentimes opportunities to replace at least a part of it with clean

   energy storage technologies for shifting the energy as well as smart
   control and monitoring systems. Bella Coola in British Columbia has been
   the first remote community in Canada that initiated the replacement of a
   part of its diesel consumption with clean energy. This paper attempts to
   describe the technical challenges in Bella Coola, proposed solutions
   with emphasis on the control and monitoring part, a summary of open and
   closed-loop tests, and the lessons learned from this microgrid project
   that can be inspiring for future projects.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new technique is proposed to mitigate the problem of
   data loss in real-time short-term forecasting (STF) algorithms. The
   proposed method can be applied to any STF algorithm in order to resolve

   addition, the proposed implementation strategy can be employed to
   address the challenges of handling holidays in the electrical load and

   performance of the proposed method, a well-accepted real-time short-term

   electricity load information and ambient temperature of a real-life load
   are used in this study. The investigation reveals that the proposed
   method properly addresses the above-mentioned challenges with high
   accuracy and minimal additional computation. Although the case study in

Abstract = {{Novel non-linear trigonometric and hyperbolic chirp waveforms are
   introduced in multiuser spread spectrum communication environment for
   binary data transmission. Three subclasses of non-linear trigonometric
   and hyperbolic chirp signals namely sinusoidal (sine-CSS), hyperbolic
   arc sinusoidal (asinh-CSS) and hyperbolic tangent (tanh-CSS) are
   described and their properties are given. Cross-correlations of these
   trigonometric and hyperbolic chirp signals are derived and presented as
   dclosed-form expressions. Moreover, the chirp rates in these signals are
   derived as a function of user in the multiuser environment using the
   orthogonal structure inherent in non-linear chirp signals. A generic
   multiuser communication system model that employs non-linear chirp
   signals is presented and its bit error rate (BER) performance is
   analyzed in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, and Rayleigh
   and Nakagami-m fading environments as a function of the number of users

Abstract = {{Recently physical layer attributes and statistics have been exploited in
   securing wireless communications. However, one major obstacle of
   physical layer security techniques is that not all of these attributes
   are accessible in practical wireless communication platforms. More
   precisely, once the hardware of a physical transceiver is implemented,
   most of the physical layer attributes are not accessible due to the
   highly integrated circuits. Consequently, it becomes essential to
   develop implementable security enhancement techniques by utilizing all
   available attributes and statistics at different layers of wireless
   communication networks. In this paper, we consider the packet error rate
   (PER) and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in IEEE 802.11
   networks to improve the wireless communication security. These two
   unique user and environment dependent attributes are readily available
   in most of the currently deployed IEEE 802.11 platforms. To enhance the
   spoofing attack detection capability, we propose a practical
   authentication scheme by monitoring and analyzing the PER and RSSI at
   the same time. The hypothesis testing model for the proposed
   authentication using PER and RSSI as two testing variables is presented.
   In addition, a decision rule for authentication, which is able to
   differentiate between a legitimate transmitter and a potential attacker
   by combining both attributes together, is developed. To evaluate the
   feasibility of our proposed scheme, lab experiments have been conducted
   using an IEEE 802.11g Atheros platform. The proposed authentication
   technique is validated by the experimental and simulation data. Our
   final authentication results confirm the improved spoofing detecting
   capability of the proposed technique over the single-variable based
   authentication.}},

Abstract = {{A cooperative jamming system is investigated to enhance security of
   wireless communications in the presence of eavesdroppers. Different from
   traditional wireless security strategies that maximize secrecy capacity,
   a novel strategy based on the minimization of compromised secrecy region
   (CSR) is proposed. The secrecy region with a given secrecy outage
   probability is derived by considering path-loss and fading channel
   effects. Through numerical approximation of the outage probability, the
   optimal location and allocated power of the jammer are calculated to
   minimize the CSR which exhibits high secrecy outage probability. Without
   knowing the exact location of the randomly-distributed eavesdropper, our
   proposed scheme provides a new optimization criterion based on this
   compromised area minimization, thereby increasing the security level in
   cooperative jamming systems. Numerical results further validate the
   proposed CSR minimization scheme for cooperative jamming.}},

Abstract = {{This work identifies and examines the status quo of intolerance of
   e-markets to the free conduct of individuals, which often provokes
   adverse strategies and lead to market failures. The work advocates that
   free market dynamics bring stable efficiency by equalizing the
   conflicting forces of the self interest and essential need of
   individuals. That motivates a collaborative reactions that diffuse
   monopolies. The constant learning at repetitive e-trades motivates
   traders to reason about e-market disruptions and adjust strategies. The
   free expressions of strategic conduct, hence, inspire the truthful
   reactions that result in an efficient ecosystem friendly exchange of
   wealth and resources. Hence, the work introduces the rule based bidding
   language that enables the free, flexible, concise, and symmetric
   expression of preferences and strategic conduct. The bidding language
   enables individuals to freely express their strategic actions as logical
   rule formulae on multiple feature-value preferences that jointly form
   the traded items. The free e-market deliberates on the logical rules for
   automatic deduction, elicitation and formulation of bids and asks. The
   deduction of rules enables also a faster e-market clearing and rapid
   e-trades. This work is an attempt to liberalizing the e-marketplaces by
   freely expressing the strategic choice that drive the resilience of
   stable social efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel algorithm to jointly delineate the femoral artery
   lumen and outer wall surfaces from 3D black-blood MR images, while
   enforcing the spatial consistency of the reoriented MR slices along the
   medial axis of the femoral artery. We demonstrate that the resulting
   optimization problem of the proposed segmentation can be solved globally
   and exactly by means of convex relaxation, for which we introduce a
   novel coupled continuous max-flow (CCMF) model based on an Ishikawa-type
   flow configuration and show its duality to the studied convex relaxed
   optimization problem. Using the proposed CCMF model, the exactness and
   globalness of its dual convex relaxation problem is proven. Experiment
   results demonstrate that the proposed method yielded high accuracy (i.e.
   Dice similarity coefficient > 85\%) for both the lumen and outer wall
   and high reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.95)
   for generating vessel wall area. The proposed method outperformed the
   previous method, in terms of computation time, by a factor of similar to
   20.}},

Abstract = {{Data Analytics has proven its importance in knowledge discovery and
   decision support in different data and application domains. Big data
   analytics poses a serious challenge in terms of the necessary hardware
   and software resources. The cloud technology today offers a promising
   solution to this challenge by enabling ubiquitous and scalable
   provisioning of the computing resources. However, there are further
   challenges that remain to be addressed such as the availability of the
   required analytic software for various application domains, estimation
   and subscription of necessary resources for the analytic job or
   workflow, management of data in the cloud, and design, verification and
   execution of analytic workflows. We present a taxonomy for analytic
   workflow systems to highlight the important features in existing
   systems. Based on the taxonomy and a study of the existing analytic
   software and systems, we propose the conceptual architecture of
   CLoud-based Analytics-as-a-Service (CLAaaS), a big data analytics
   service provisioning platform, in the cloud. We outline the features
   that are important for CLAaaS as a service provisioning system such as
   user and domain specific customization and assistance, collaboration,

Abstract = {{Synchrophasors are increasingly used in the wide area monitoring
   applications. Computational window lengths of the practical
   synchrophasor estimation filters are often multiple fundamental cycles
   long to achieve robustness. In many situations, the window length of the
   synchrophasor estimation filter is greater than the fault clearing time.
   In this case, there are not enough fault samples within the window to
   compute a synchrophasor corresponding to the fault condition. So,
   transient state synchrophasors are only available for use in this case.
   A fault transient synchrophasor is computed over a window consisting of
   pre-fault and fault samples. Currently, these transient synchrophasors
   are discarded and generally not used in the applications. In this paper,
   an algorithm is proposed to compute fault voltage/current synchrophasor
   from a fault transient synchrophasor value. The novelty of the proposed
   algorithm is that this algorithm can be used in a Phasor Data
   Concentrator (PDC). The proposed algorithm is simple, non-iterative and
   performs satisfactorily in presence of noise. One possible application
   of the proposed algorithm is in the fault location on transmission lines
   where the fault clearing time is lower than the estimation filter window
   length.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the concept of weekly usage of Cryogenic Energy Storage
   (CES) to shift the electrical energy from lower prices during off-peak
   periods to higher prices during peak periods as compared to common daily
   usage is introduced. Two equally-expensive CESs are optimally sized for
   daily and weekly usage. An optimal dispatch algorithm is developed by
   formulating a mixed integer linear program (MILP) problem to determine
   the CES charging and discharging power set-points in an open retail
   electricity market based on online and forecasted electricity price.
   GLPK package is employed to solve the optimization problem. The economic
   benefits of both CES weekly and daily usages are presented and compared
   for different price profiles and round-trip efficiencies of the storage.
   The results reveal significant benefits of weekly usage of the CES as

Abstract = {{A DC distribution system is proposed for integration of Plug-in Hybrid
   Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in public parking areas. The proposed system
   assumes that each PHEV is interfaced with a network of DC lines, through
   a corresponding bidirectional DC-DC converter (battery charger). It also
   assumes that a central Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC) provides the
   interface between the DC network and the host AC utility grid. The
   proposed system is expected to be more efficient and economical than an
   equivalent aggregate of AC-DC battery charges connected to the AC grid,
   since it relieves the battery chargers from the need for a
   bidirectional, front-end, power-factor correction (PFC) stage. Further,
   due to its DC nature, the proposed system is amenable to integration of
   Photovoltaic (PV) modules. The paper presents a mathematical model for
   the proposed DC system and discusses the potential stability issues.}},

Abstract = {{This work is aimed at developing a new minimally invasive approach to
   characterize tissue properties in real time during telerobotic palpation
   and to localize tissue abnormality while estimating its depth. This
   method relies on using a minimally invasive probe with a rigidly mounted
   tactile sensor at the tip to capture the force distribution map and the
   indentation depth by each tactile element and thereby generating a
   stiffness map for the palpated tissue. The hybrid impedance control
   technique is used for this approach to enable the operator to switch
   between position control and force control and thereby to autonomously
   obtain the required information from the remote tissue. The operator
   would then be able to localize tissue abnormality based on the force
   distribution map, the tissue stiffness map and the indentation depth
   which are visually presented to him/her in real time. This method also
   enables the operator to estimate the depth at which the tissue
   abnormality is located. Our results show that tactile sensing alone may
   be unable to detect tumors embedded deep inside tissue and may also not
   be a good alternative for palpation on uneven tissue surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of designing of a haptics-enabled teleoperated
   rehabilitation system in the presence of communication delays is
   addressed. In a teleoperated rehabilitation system, communication delays
   introduce phase shift which may result in the task inversion phenomenon.
   To overcome the task inversion, a new type of projection-based force
   reflection algorithm is proposed which is suitable for
   assistive/resistive therapy in the presence of irregular communication
   delays. Additionally, algorithms for augmented therapy are introduced
   which combine the projection-based force reflection with a delay-free
   local virtual therapist. A small-gain design is developed which
   guarantees stability of the proposed schemes for both assistive and
   resistive modes of the therapy. Simulations and experimental results are
   presented which confirm the improvement achieved by the proposed
   methods.}},
