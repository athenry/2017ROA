Title = {{Changing forest water yields in response to climate warming: results

Abstract = {{Climate warming is projected to affect forest water yields but the
   effects are expected to vary. We investigated how forest type and age
   affect water yield resilience to climate warming. To answer this
   question, we examined the variability in historical water yields at
   long-term experimental catchments across Canada and the United States
   over 5-year cool and warm periods. Using the theoretical framework of
   the Budyko curve, we calculated the effects of climate warming on the
   annual partitioning of precipitation (P) into evapotranspiration (ET)
   and water yield. Deviation (d) was defined as a catchment's change in
   actual ET divided by P {[}AET/P; evaporative index (EI)] coincident with
   a shift from a cool to a warm period - a positive d indicates an upward
   shift in EI and smaller than expected water yields, and a negative d
   indicates a downward shift in EI and larger than expected water yields.
   Elasticity was defined as the ratio of interannual variation in
   potential ET divided by P (PET/P; dryness index) to interannual
   variation in the EI - high elasticity indicates low d despite large
   range in drying index (i.e., resilient water yields), low elasticity
   indicates high d despite small range in drying index (i.e., nonresilient
   water yields). Although the data needed to fully evaluate ecosystems
   based on these metrics are limited, we were able to identify some
   characteristics of response among forest types. Alpine sites showed the
   greatest sensitivity to climate warming with any warming leading to
   increased water yields. Conifer forests included catchments with lowest
   elasticity and stable to larger water yields. Deciduous forests included
   catchments with intermediate elasticity and stable to smaller water
   yields. Mixed coniferous/deciduous forests included catchments with
   highest elasticity and stable water yields. Forest type appeared to
   influence the resilience of catchment water yields to climate warming,
   with conifer and deciduous catchments more susceptible to climate
   warming than the more diverse mixed forest catchments.}},

Pages = {{63-68}},

Abstract = {{A non-linear vibration equation with the consideration of large
   amplitude, gas damping and excitation is developed to investigate the
   dynamic performance of a dielectric elastomer (DE)-based microbeam
   resonator. Approximate analytical solution for the vibration equation is
   obtained by applying parameterized perturbation method (PPM) and
   introducing a detuning variable. The analysis exhibits that active
   tuning of the resonant frequency of the resonator can be achieved
   through changing an applied electrical voltage. It is observed that
   increasing amplitude will increase the natural frequency while it will
   decrease the quality factor of the resonator. In addition, it is found
   that the initial pre-stretching stress and the ambient pressure can
   significantly alter the resonant frequency of the resonator. The
   analysis is envisaged to provide qualitative predictions and guidelines
   for design and application of DE-based micro resonators with large
   vibration amplitude. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reactor performance of a high flux circulating fluidized bed (CFB)
   downer is studied under superficial gas velocities of 3-7 m/s with
   solids circulation rate up to 300 kg/m(2)s using ozone decomposition
   reaction. Results show that the reactant conversion in the downer is
   closely related to the hydrodynamics, with solids holdup being the most
   influential parameter on ozone decomposition. High degree of conversion
   is achieved at the downer entrance region due to strong gas-solids
   interaction as well as higher solids holdup and reactant concentration.
   Ozone conversion increases with the increase of solids circulation rate
   and/or the decrease of superficial gas velocity. Overall conversion in
   the CFB downer is less than but very close to that in an ideal plug flow
   reactor indicating a good reactor performance in the downer because of
   the nearly ideal hydrodynamics in downer reactors. (c) 2014 American

Abstract = {{A sample preparation method of total sulphur measurement of reactive
   mine tailings was optimized. The total sulphur was measured by
   inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and ultrasound
   technique was used for sample digestion. The optimization process was
   adopted by a combined approach of experimental design and response
   surface methodology. The digestion time, temperature and acid-oxidant
   combination (i.e. effect of H2O2 with a fixed amount of acid mixture)
   were investigated. A two-level and three-factor (2(3)) full factorial
   design of experiment was applied to identify the most significant
   factors, and a central composite design was used to optimize the
   digestion procedure. KZK-1, a sericite schist, was selected as the
   certified reference material. The optimum methodology at 95 \%
   confidence level (P < 0.05) was identified to be 10 min of digestion at
   77 A degrees C, with a solution of 1 ml HNO3:1 ml HCl:1.35 ml H2O2. This
   combination resulted in 100 \% sulphur recovery. The investigated method
   was verified by X-ray diffraction analysis. The optimum digestion level
   was applied to a reactive mine tailings, which achieved satisfactory
   results with a percentage relative standard deviation < 3 \%.}},

Abstract = {{The achievable secrecy rate of a dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying
   system, in the presence of an eavesdropper, is investigated based on the
   different values of the wireless links' signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).
   It is shown that when the direct link to the eavesdropper is in a better
   condition than the direct link to the destination, but the relaying link
   for the destination is better than the relaying link for the
   eavesdropper, under specific conditions for the links SNRs, it is
   possible to achieve the secrecy rate for a limited range of the relay
   power. On the other hand, when the direct link to the destination is
   better than the direct link to the eavesdropper, under certain
   conditions for the links' SNRs, it is not always beneficial to employ
   the relay, since there exists a limited range of relaying power for
   which secrecy rate is not achievable. Finally, it is shown that the
   source transmit power has no impact on the secrecy rate achievability.
   Simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis carried out in this

Abstract = {{This study presents the first part of a CFD study on the performance of
   a downer reactor for biomass pyrolysis. The reactor was equipped with a
   novel gas-solid separation method, developed by the co-authors from the
   ICFAR (Canada). The separator, which was designed to allow for fast
   separation of clean pyrolysis gas, consisted of a cone deflector and a
   gas exit pipe installed inside the downer reactor. A multi-fluid model
   (Eulerian-Eulerian) with constitutive relations adopted from the kinetic
   theory of granular flow was used to simulate the multiphase flow. The
   effects of the various parameters including operation conditions,
   separator geometry and particle properties on the overall hydrodynamics
   and separation efficiency were investigated. The model prediction of the
   separator efficiency was compared with experimental measurements. The
   results revealed distinct hydrodynamic features around the cone
   separator, allowing for up to 100\% separation efficiency. The developed
   model provided a platform for the second part of the study, where the
   biomass pyrolysis is simulated and the product quality as a function of
   operating conditions is analyzed. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by

Title = {{Investigation of concrete exposed to dual sulfate attack}},
Journal = {{CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{42-53}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Durability of concrete exposed to sulfates has primarily been studied on
   specimens fully-submerged in sulfate solutions. However, field
   experience shows that concrete exposed to sulfates can suffer from
   surface scaling above ground level due to physical attack. This damage
   has often been ignored and even confused with chemical sulfate attack.
   In this study, concrete partially-immersed in sulfate solutions and
   exposed to cyclic temperature and relative humidity was explored.
   Results show that concrete can experience dual sulfate attack. The lower
   immersed portion can suffer from chemical sulfate attack, while the
   upper portion can be vulnerable to physical attack. Lowering the
   water-to-binder ratio and moist-curing reduced surface scaling above the
   solution level, since the volume of pores was decreased. Although
   partial replacement of cement with pozzolans also decreased the pore
   volume, surface scaling increased due to increased proportion of small
   diameter pores and associated growth of capillary suction and surface
   area for evaporation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between coronary arterial blood pressure,
   plaque morphology and composition, and sites of fibrous cap (FC)
   bursting, has been the focus of many recent studies. Instability of
   atherosclerotic plaques, defined as the propensity for FCs to burst, has
   been thought to occur at places where FCs are thin and necrotic core
   (NC) areas are large and highly compliant. However, here we show
   quantitatively, using a fiber-reinforced, anisotropic and hyperelastic
   FE model, that FC thickness and NC size and compliance alone are limited
   in predicting vulnerable and high-risk plaques. We suggest that plaque
   instabilities primarily occur at sites of high and concentrated
   mechanical stresses irrespective of fibrous cap thickness or NC area and
   compliance. Also, limitations of imaging techniques, such as
   intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography, for providing
   input into (FE) models of atherosclerosis are discussed. The proposed
   model can be used to predict vulnerable plaque sites and rupture risks
   in patients. The current study also provides a framework for future
   research in which three-dimensional platform and viscoelastic properties
   of plaque composition can be considered in time-dependent and fatigue
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new open-loop model for a magnetorheological-based
   actuator is presented. The model consists of two parts relating the
   output torque of the actuator to its internal magnetic field, and the
   internal magnetic field to the applied current. Each part possesses its
   own hysteretic behavior. The first part uses a novel nonlinear adaptive
   model that relates the internal magnetic field to the applied current.
   The second part uses an open-loop Bingham model to relate the output
   torque to an internal magnetic field. The model facilitates accurate
   control of the actuator using its input current. It also eliminates the
   need for force/torque sensors for providing feedback signals. The
   accuracy of the constructed model is validated through simulations. The
   model is assessed against a widely accepted hysteresis modeling
   approach, known as the Preisach model and its advantages are
   highlighted. Experimental results using the prototyped actuation
   mechanism further verify the accuracy of the model and demonstrate its
   effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium cobalt fluorophosphate (Li2CoPO4F) is a promising 5 V class
   cathode material for lithium secondary batteries. In this study, surface
   coating with ZrO2 improved the electrochemical activity of Li2CoPO4F
   with a maximum discharge capacity of 144 mA h g(-1). The effectiveness
   of ZrO2 coating was evaluated using aging analysis with a commercial
   electrolyte, i.e., 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:1, v/v). The metal ion
   dissolution was reduced to 1/8th of that observed in the non-coated
   Li2CoPO4F. It was found that the thin coating layer had less or no
   contribution to the additional resistance for the cell, both at an open
   circuit potential and at a fully charged state; hence, the capacity of
   the cell was retained over cycling. Elevated temperature aging did not
   affect the intrinsic property of the coated Li2CoPO4F, as observed from
   the complete anodic and cathodic peaks from cyclic voltammetry studies
   after 30 days of storage at 50 degrees C. An increase in impedance was
   observed for aged cells, which could be due to the thick SEI layer
   formed during storage. The ZrO2 coating over Li2CoPO4F was crucial for
   the improved performance of electrode active material at higher
   operating potentials of up to 5.2 V.}},

   CNTs and stabilize NiHCNP. The morphology and structure of the

   electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and

Abstract = {{Production of oil in water (O/W) emulsion using oscillatory high
   porosity woven metal microscreen (WMMS) is investigated both
   experimentally and theoretically. The investigation included coupling
   effects of design and operating parameters on droplet size and
   distribution. Results demonstrate the ability to produce emulsions with
   predictable characteristics and to achieve high dispersed phase
   concentrations at low energy requirements. Increasing oscillation
   intensity resulted in smaller droplet size due to the increase in both
   surface shear and surfactant transfer rate to the droplets surface. The
   expansion rate of the later increased with increasing the dispersed
   phase flow resulting in faster surfactant depletion. Using
   bi-surfactants in both the continuous and dispersed phases resulted in
   smaller droplet size due to lower interfacial tension. Decreasing the
   emulsification channel width decreased droplet size clue to the increase
   in the relative surface shear as well as the energy dissipation density.
   The presence of surface roughness resulted in smaller droplet sizes but
   had an adverse effect on the dispersion uniformity, which was also
   affected by lateral vibrations. Both led to localized energy dissipation
   and droplets breakage near the edges. An order of magnitude assessment
   of power consumption showed favourable energy requirement (kW h/m(3)) of
   the proposed approach compared to other techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel nanostructured support of ZrO2/nitrogen-doped graphene
   nanosheets (ZrO2/NGNs) hybrid was synthesized successfully by atomic
   layer deposition (ALD) technology to significantly improve the activity
   and stability of Pt electrocatalyst. Electrochemical test shows that
   Pt-ZrO2/NGNs catalyst has 2.1 times higher activity towards methanol
   oxidation reaction (MOR) than Pt/NGNs catalyst, due to the promotion by
   ZrO2 to the MOR on Pt surface. Pt-ZrO2/NGNs catalyst has higher
   electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and better oxygen reduction reaction
   (ORR) activity than Pt/NGNs catalyst. Pt-ZrO2/NGNs catalyst has also
   demonstrated 2.2 times higher durability than that of Pt/NGNs. The
   enhanced activity and durability were attributed to the unique
   triple-interaction of ZrO2-Pt-NGNs. These findings indicate that metal
   oxide-metal-support is a promising catalyst structure for low
   temperature fuel cells. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Performance of classic sound absorbing materials strictly depends on
   their thickness, with a minimum of one-quarter wavelength to reach full
   sound absorption. In this paper, we report ultrathin sound absorbing
   panels that completely absorb sound energy with a thickness around one
   percent of wavelength. The strategy is to bend and coil up
   quarter-wavelength sound damping tubes into 2D coplanar ones, and embed
   them into a matrix to form sound absorbing panel. Samples have been
   designed and fabricated by 3D printing. Efficacies of sound absorption
   by these panels were validated through good agreement between
   theoretical analysis and experimental measurements. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{Global, regional, and national levels and causes of maternal mortality
   during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease
   Study 2013}},
Journal = {{LANCET}},

Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background The fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG 5) established the
   goal of a 75\% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR; number of
   maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths) between 1990 and 2015. We aimed
   to measure levels and track trends in maternal mortality, the key causes
   contributing to maternal death, and timing of maternal death with
   respect to delivery.
   Methods We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death
   Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years
   and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188
   countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of
   pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic
   review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive
   women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction
   of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic
   review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine different
   causes, we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943
   site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review
   of reports about the timing of maternal death, identifying 142 sources
   to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for
   1990-2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95\% uncertainty
   intervals (UIs) for all values.
   Findings 292 982 (95\% UI 261017-327792) maternal deaths occurred in
   2013, compared with 376 034 (343483-407574) in 1990. The global annual
   rate of change in the MMR was -0.3\% (-1.1 to 0.6) from 1990 to 2003,
   and -2.7\% (-3.9 to -1.5) from 2003 to 2013, with evidence of continued
   acceleration. MMRs reduced consistently in south, east, and southeast
   Asia between 1990 and 2013, but maternal deaths increased in much of
   sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s. 2070 (1290-2866) maternal deaths
   were related to HIV in 2013, 0.4\% (-0.2-0.6) of the global total. MMR
   was highest in the oldest age groups in both 1990 and 2013. In 2013,
   most deaths occurred intrapartum or postpartum. Causes varied by region
   and between 1990 and 2013. We recorded substantial variation in the MMR
   by country in 2013, from 956.8 (685.1-1262.8) in South Sudan to 2.4
   (1.6-3.6) in Iceland.
   Interpretation Global rates of change suggest that only 16 countries
   will achieve the MDG 5 target by 2015. Accelerated reductions since the
   Millennium Declaration in 2000 coincide with increased development
   assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health. Setting of targets
   and associated interventions for after 2015 will need careful
   consideration of regions that are making slow progress, such as west and
   central Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Chromatographic-based protein refolding techniques have proven to be
   superior to conventional dilution refolding methods, due to the higher
   loading concentration and simultaneous purification. Among these
   techniques, Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) has in particular been
   demonstrated as an effective method for refolding of variety of
   proteins. To date existing studies of protein refolding at high
   concentrations (>1 mg/mL) in SEC have primarily been conducted as single
   factor studies, in which a single parameter is varied to assess impact
   on operating performance, which does not allow for determination of the
   interactions of different operating parameters and optimized operating
   conditions. In this work a multi-variable investigation of size
   exclusion protein refolding at high protein concentration using lysozyme
   as a model protein was performed, in order to quantify the interaction
   of factors and optimize performance. It was observed when L-arginine is
   used as an additive the refolding yield becomes independent of the
   protein concentration and refolding buffer pH, providing that a redox
   couple is used to assist the reformation of disulfide bridges.
   Furthermore, the pore accessibility for small molecules was reduced at
   the presence of this additive particularly at higher protein
   concentrations indicating slower removal of these molecules and a
   possible additional mechanism of aggregation prevention. Using the
   subsequent optimized refolding buffer, a refolding yield of more than
   90\% was obtained for up to 40 mg/mL loading concentration of lysozyme
   which has only been reported for a urea gradient SEC (8-2 M) with lower
   equilibration and elution flow rates due to high viscosity of buffer
   containing high concentrations of urea. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Establishing photon absorption fields in a Photo-CREC Water II Reactor
   using a CREC-spectroradiometric probe}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{The scattering mode and the appropriate boundary conditions in a
   Photo-CREC Water II annular reactor are assessed from experimental data.
   These data are obtained by using a novel spectroradiometric probe
   (CREC-SP). This probe is designed to measure irradiation at different
   radial positions within the concentric channel. Radiation data obtained
   is analyzed using a calculated Monte Carlo radiation field inside the
   slurry photoreactor. The effect of the phase function and the boundary
   conditions, as relevant to the photoreactor walls, are determined. The
   MC method proposed by Valades-Pelayo et al. (2014, Chem. Eng. Sci., 107,
   123-136) is modified in the present study to account for refraction,
   absorption and reflection at the probe surface. Lamp emission,
   refraction and reemission as well as wavelength-dependent absorption and
   scattering are accounted for. Regarding Degussa P25, a Henyey-Greenstein
   phase function with g=0.68 +/- 0.03 is needed. On this basis, a 3D LVRPA
   field is established. This approach also allows one to independently set
   boundary conditions, breaking, in this manner, their correlation with
   scattering parameters. As a result, this study establishes scattering
   phase functions and radiation absorption fields with improved accuracy.
   Clarification of these matters is of crucial importance for the design
   and scale-up of photocatalytic reactors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{10174-10181}},

Abstract = {{Field measurements combined with numerical simulations provide insight
   into the water exchange, groundwater flow, and geochemical processes
   controlling the mobility of arsenic (As) in freshwater beach aquifers.
   Elevated dissolved As (up to 56 mu g/L) was observed 1-2 m below the
   shoreline at two sandy beaches on Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. Water and
   solid-phase analyses suggest that Fe (hydr)oxides present below the
   shoreline accumulate As, creating a risk of high As in the beach
   aquifer. Groundwater flow simulations combined with vertical hydraulic
   gradient measurements indicate that wave-induced flow recirculations
   across the groundwater lake interface are significant. These
   recirculations, which vary with wave intensity and lake water level
   fluctuations, set up redox and pH gradients, where Fe precipitates and
   subsequently sequesters As. The elevated As concentrations observed at
   both beaches, combined with the distribution of other dissolved species,
   suggest that the As enrichment may be naturally occurring. Regardless of
   the As source, the interacting hydrologic and geodiemical processes
   revealed may have important implications for the flux of As and also
   other oxyanions, such as phosphate, across the groundwater-lake
   interface in nearshore areas of the Great Lakes.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric mercury (Hg) measurements from across Canada were compiled
   and analysed as part of a national Hg science assessment. Here we update
   long-term trends of Hg in air and precipitation, and present more
   extensive measurements on patterns and trends in speciated Hg species
   (gaseous elemental mercury-GEM, reactive gaseous mercury-RGM, and total
   particulate mercury on particles < 2.5 mu m-TPM2.5) at several sites. A
   spatial analysis across Canada revealed higher air concentrations and
   wet deposition of Hg in the vicinity of local and regional emission
   sources, and lower air concentrations of Hg at mid-latitude maritime
   sites compared to continental sites. Diel and seasonal patterns in
   atmospheric GEM, RGM and TPM2.5 concentrations reflected differences in
   patterns of anthropogenic emissions, photo-induced surface emissions,
   chemistry, deposition and mixing. Concentrations of GEM decreased at
   rates ranging from -0.9\% to -3.3\% per year at all sites where
   measurements began in the 1990s. Concentrations of total Hg in
   precipitation declined up to 3.7\% yr(-1). Trends in RGM and TPM2.5 were
   less clear due to shorter measurement periods and low concentrations,
   however, in spring at the high Arctic site (Alert) when RGM and TPM2.5
   concentrations were high, concentrations of both increased by 7\%-10\%
   per year.}},

   attention. During the past decade, various marine environment monitoring
   systems have been developed. The traditional marine environment
   monitoring system using an oceanographic research vessel is expensive
   and time-consuming and has a low resolution both in time and space.
   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have recently been considered as
   potentially promising alternatives for monitoring marine environments
   since they have a number of advantages such as unmanned operation, easy
   deployment, real-time monitoring, and relatively low cost. This paper
   provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art technologies in
   the field of marine environment monitoring using wireless sensor
   networks. It first describes application areas, a common architecture of
   WSN-based oceanographic monitoring systems, a general architecture of an
   oceanographic sensor node, sensing parameters and sensors, and wireless
   communication technologies. Then, it presents a detailed review of some
   related projects, systems, techniques, approaches and algorithms. It
   also discusses challenges and opportunities in the research,
   development, and deployment of wireless sensor networks for marine
   environment monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{P-n junction BiOBr/ZnO composites were prepared by a facile solvothermal
   process with double Br sources of CTAB and KBr. The samples were
   characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, DRS, BET and PL. The
   BiOBr/ZnO composites exhibited much higher photocatalytic activity than
   single BiOBr and ZnO for the degradation of phenol under simulated
   sunlight irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of BiOBr/ZnO
   composites could be mainly ascribed to the high-efficiency separation of
   photogenerated electron-hole pairs through BiOBr/ZnO p-n junction. The
   reaction mechanism for the removal of phenol was also discussed. Hole
   and center dot OH were the main reactive species. Moreover, the
   influence of disparate ratios of double Br sources to BiOBr/ZnO
   composites was also investigated. The results indicated that the
   BiOBr/ZnO composites prepared by double Br sources showed better
   photocatalytic activities than the sample prepared by single Br source.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIntra-operative imaging is widely used to provide visual
   feedback to a clinician when he/she performs a procedure. In visual
   servoing, surgical instruments and parts of tissue/body are tracked by
   processing the acquired images. This information is then used within a
   control loop to manoeuvre a robotic manipulator during a procedure.
   MethodsA comprehensive search of electronic databases was completed for
   the period 2000-2013 to provide a survey of the visual servoing
   applications in medical robotics. The focus is on medical applications
   where image-based tracking is used for closed-loop control of a robotic
   system.
   ResultsDetailed classification and comparative study of various
   contributions in visual servoing using endoscopic or direct visual
   images are presented and summarized in tables and diagrams.
   ConclusionThe main challenges in using visual servoing for medical

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the highest bottom shear
   stress, induced by wind in an area of Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada
   known as Randle Reef. The study was conducted in support of a component
   of a contaminated sediment remediation plan utilizing a thin layer of
   sand to manage contaminated sediments. Toward this end, four acoustic
   Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) were deployed at two locations in the
   study region to measure velocity profiles for the purpose of indirectly
   measuring bottom shear stress (BSS) and model verification. There is no
   easy way to directly measure BSS in the field. As a result, the use of
   the logarithmic-profile method from the ADCP measured high resolution
   velocity profiles in the bottom layer was explored. This approach,
   according to our best knowledge, has not been published for a wind
   driven flow in a small open water body. To use the indirectly measured
   BSS to estimate the highest BSS in the study area, a three-dimensional
   hydrodynamic model was adopted to provide the spatial and temporal
   information of the bottom flow. The results showed that the modeled and
   measured flow velocity components agreed reasonably well at most of the
   water depths with the correlation coefficients being greater than 0.6.
   However, agreements between the modeled and measured bottom flow speeds
   were worse than expected due to the error contributions from both the
   modeled velocity components. Therefore, the modeled flow speed required
   rescaling based on ADCP velocity measurements before it could be deemed
   reliable. This is especially important in estimation of the BSS with a
   quadratic formula because the calculated BSS is proportional to the
   square of the speed.}},

Abstract = {{Flux characteristics and energy dissipation for oscillatory flat surface
   membranes roughed with turbulence promoters (TP) have been investigated
   both theoretically and experimentally. The combined effect of
   oscillations and TP has proven effective in enhancing the
   microfiltration flux by an almost order of magnitude over that for a
   non-oscillatory flat surface membranes, and close to four times higher
   than that achieved in the absence of TP under the same oscillation
   conditions. The power dissipation was determined using the drag and
   inertia forces acting on individual promoters, as well from the solution
   of the boundary layer equations with time-invariant eddy viscosity for
   large and small roughness conditions. Using higher oscillation frequency
   and lower amplitudes was found to be more effective for flux enhancement
   and energy utilization where near self cleaning conditions were achieved
   at specific energy consumption,of less than w similar to 0.5 kW h/m(3)
   filtrate. Both grooved and flat TP gave similar results in terms of flux
   enhancement and energy consumption per unit filtrate, with the former
   slightly better. Membrane fouling was found to follow the intermediate
   blocking fouling mechanism for oscillatory membranes as compared to cake
   filtration for non-oscillating systems. The quasi-steady state flux was
   satisfactorily predicted using an analytical model based on oscillatory
   rough surfaces with R-2=0.95. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel fault current management (FCM) technique for
   radial distribution systems with embedded inverter-based distributed
   generators (IB-DGs). At the point of connection to a power system, many
   distributed generators (DGs) require power electronic (PE) interfaces,
   which are normally idle during faults. The proposed FCM method employs
   these PE interfaces for control of the fault current. For this purpose,
   operation of IB-DGs is modified to FCM mode at the moment of fault and
   new current references are applied. Of the two controllable parameters
   of the IB-DG output current-current magnitude and current phase
   angle-the current phase angle is chosen as the means of controlling the
   fault current magnitude. The reference current phase angle is calculated
   based on the relation between the fault current elements and their phase
   angles. As a result of this novel operation, IB-DGs with larger capacity
   can be connected at different locations of the system without affecting
   the fault current magnitude. Also, implementing this technique in smart
   grids is economically proven, since the asset of power system which have
   been designed for normal operation are employed to manage the fault
   current magnitude. Moreover, possibilities of synchronization problems
   are reduced by keeping IB-DGs connected to the system at all the time.
   The evaluation of the proposed FCM technique using the standard IEEE
   33-bus distribution system demonstrates the effectiveness of the
   proposed method for managing the fault current magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method for enhancing the stability of a dc
   distribution system that integrates plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
   (PHEVs) with an ac power grid. The dc distribution system is interfaced
   with the host ac grid via a voltage-sourced converter and can also embed
   photovoltaic (PV) modules. Thus, bidirectional dc-dc electronic power
   converters act as battery chargers and interface the PHEVs with the dc
   distribution system, while PV modules are interfaced with the dc
   distribution system via unidirectional dc-dc converters. The dc
   distribution system is expected to be more efficient and economical than
   a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid,
   but it is prone to instabilities due to the constant-power property of
   the dc-dc converters. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed
   stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by
   altering the power setpoints of the battery chargers, bidirectional
   dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or
   hardware. The paper presents mathematical models for the original and
   modified systems and demonstrates that the proposed technique expands
   the stable operating region of the dc distribution system. Simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a study

   accomplished through reconstructing the key and initial vector loading

Abstract = {{Tunnels play a key role in facilitating the movement of people, goods,
   and services. The functionality of tunnels depends on the structural and
   durability performance of its lining system. Tunnel lining systems act
   as lines of defense against large overburden loads and complex
   geotechnical surrounding conditions. In this study, the structural
   behavior of precast concrete tunnel lining (PCTL) segments from a subway
   extension tunnel project in Canada was investigated. Flexural monotonic
   and cyclic load tests were performed on full-scale conventional
   reinforced concrete (RC) and steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) PCTL
   segments to evaluate their bending resistance. Moreover, a thrust load
   test was conducted to simulate the thrust loading action during tunnel
   boring machine operation. As expected, flexural test results indicate
   that the peak load-carrying capacity of RC segments was higher than that
   of the SFRC segments. However, SFRC segments exhibited higher cracking
   load and more stable post-peak cracking behavior compared to that of RC
   segments. RC and SFRC segments exhibited similar behavior during thrust
   load tests. Both types of segments satisfied the design flexural
   capacity and thrust loading criteria for monotonic and cyclic loads. The
   SFRC crack control capability supports its potential as an alternative
   for conventional RC tunneling segments.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study is conducted on combined electrokinetic and
   chemical processes for improving marine sediment. The electrokinetic and
   chemical treatment is carried out on marine sediment from the Korean
   coast. The soil is mixed with chemical admixtures, including
   sulphate-resistant cement, quicklime, and coal fly ash, and is treated
   with a DC current. The effectiveness of the combined treatment is
   evaluated in terms of the undrained shear strength and compressibility,
   as well as soil characteristics such as the water content, plasticity
   (Atterberg limits), carbonate content, and pore water chemistry. The
   results of this study show that the combined electrokinetic and chemical
   treatment nearly doubled the undrained shear strength of the marine
   sediment after 7 days, compared to the chemical treatment over the same
   time period. In addition, the preconsolidation pressure of the EK and
   chemical-treated sediment increased to as high as 500 kPa when the soil
   sample was consolidated under a surcharge pressure of 5 kPa, compared to
   that of 220 kPa after the chemical treatment under the same condition.
   The improvement is attributed to significant cementation effects
   generated by both electrokinetics and electrochemical reactions.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, a novel technique has been developed for producing
   progesterone form II crystals by using shear-assisted
   sonocrystallization (SAS) method. Progesterone, a steroid hormone, has
   been recognized for more than 70 years as having two polymorphs, a
   stable form (form I) and a metastable form (form II). Previous attempts
   have failed to produce a single crystal of form II of progesterone
   without the presence of a cocrystal additive or template. The technique
   proposed in the current study is the first to report the growth of
   single crystals of progesterone form H. The produced crystals were
   characterized using X-ray diffraction, differential scanning
   calorimeter, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Single crystal
   X-ray diffraction was performed for comparing the hydrogen bond geometry
   of forms I and II. Solubility and dissolution rates were estimated,
   providing insight on the thermodynamics of both forms. Stability studies
   of both forms were conducted for 60 days, which confirmed the higher
   stability of progesterone form I. Comparing the crystal structure of
   form I and form II provides evidence for their relative stabilities. The
   SAS technique can be proposed as a novel strategy for polymorphic
   transformation of progesterone, which can increase the dissolution rate,
   enhance oral bioavailability, and decrease dose-related side effects.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of methyl orange (MeO), as a model compound, in the presence

   Adsorption of MeO over the catalyst film followed the Langmuir
   adsorption isotherm. The degradation kinetics of MeO followed the
   well-known Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) type model. The degradation rate
   increased at higher initial concentrations while flow rate had a
   negative impact on the degradation rate. pH of the solution influenced
   the degradation rate, with higher degradation rates observed in acidic
   solutions. Degradation rate was also increased with increasing light
   intensity up to a certain level, beyond which it remained almost
   unchanged. Total organic carbon (TOC) content of MeO was also measured

Abstract = {{Ballast water has been a topic of concern for some time because of its
   potential to introduce invasive species to new habitats. To comply with
   the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships'
   Ballast Water and Sediments, members of the International Maritime
   Organization (IMO) must equip their ships with on-board treatment
   systems to eliminate organism release with ballast water. There are many
   challenges associated with the implementation of this IMO guideline, one
   of which is the selection of species for testing the ecological impacts
   of the treated ballast water. In the United States, ballast water
   toxicity test methods have been defined by the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency. However, the test methods had not been
   finalized in China until the toxicity test methods for ballast water
   were established in 2008. The Chinese methods have been based on species
   from three trophic levels: Skeletonema costatum, Neomysis awatschensis,
   and Ctenogobius gymnauchen. All three species live in broad estuarine
   and open sea areas of China; they are sensitive to reference toxicants
   and acclimatize easily to different conditions. In this paper, the
   biological characteristics, test processes and statistical analysis
   methods are presented for the three species. Results indicate that the
   methods for evaluating these three organisms can be included in the
   ecological toxicity tests for treated ballast water in China.}},

Abstract = {{Faults and switching operations often cause step changes in voltage and

   computed over switching/fault transients. The proposed algorithm runs in
   phasor measurement unit. The proposed algorithm performs satisfactorily
   in the presence of noises, harmonics, off nominal frequencies, decaying
   DC and missing/bad samples. The proposed algorithm can detect
   fault/switching transient synchrophasors caused by smaller or larger
   disturbances. The proposed algorithm is simple, non-iterative and mainly
   needs additions. Possible applications of the proposed algorithm are

Abstract = {{The jiggled bed reactor (JBR) is a state-of-the-art batch fluidized
   microreactor designed and developed to test catalysts for endothermic
   reactions. The solid particles in the microreactor are mechanically
   fluidized by agitating the reactor using a linear pneumatic actuator. An
   external induction field heats up vertical metal wires installed inside
   the reactor bed to generate heat rapidly and uniformly within the bed of
   solid particles, while eliminating hot spots and large temperature
   gradients. Image and signal processing techniques were utilized to
   investigate how the fluidization dynamics of the solid particles are
   affected by the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, and the size
   distribution and the mass of the particles. The results show that the
   microreactor is very flexible: operating conditions can be optimized to
   successfully fluidize any type of catalyst. Heat-transfer coefficients
   between heating surfaces and the bed are similar to the coefficients
   that could be obtained in a well-bubbling fluidized bed. This confirms
   the excellent quality of the fluidization achieved with the new JBR. (C)

Abstract = {{Decontamination of opaque fluids using photocatalysts and near
   Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation involves major technical challenges. This
   study considers a thin TiO2 layer placed in a new Chemical Reactor
   Engineering Centre (CREC)-photoreactor cell. This new photoreactor cell
   is used for the photocatalytic degradation of malic and malonic acids,
   typical apple juice components. Conversion of organic species can only
   proceed through the ``dark side{''} of the TiO2 layer, which is in
   direct contact with the fluid. Under the selected operating conditions
   both external mass-transfer limitations and photolysis are found to be
   negligible. Macroscopic radiation balance shows that 92\% of near UV
   radiation is absorbed by the `back side{''} of the TiO2-film.
   Photocatalytic degradation experiments with 10, 20, 30, and 40 ppm malic
   acid initial concentrations, show that malonic acid is a main
   intermediate. Complete malic acid conversion occurs after 5-8 h of
   irradiation. Kinetic modeling of malic and malonic acid photodegradation
   with kinetic parameter estimation is performed using both an ``in
   series{''} and an ``in series-parallel{''} reaction networks. The ``in
   series-parallel{''} reaction network displays better ability for
   predicting CO2 formation, showing maximum quantum yields of 14.2\%.
   Given that in the CREC-photoreactor cell with a thin TiO2-film,
   photocatalysis can only proceed via the transfer of mobile ``h(+){''}
   sites from the irradiated side to the ``dark side', this study
   demonstrates the significance of this step on the overall photocatalysis

   incandescence (TiRe-LII), a combustion diagnostic used mainly for
   measuring soot primary particles, to size silicon nanoparticles formed
   within a plasma reactor. Inferring nanoparticle sizes from TiRe-LII data
   requires knowledge of the heat transfer through which the laser-heated
   nanoparticles equilibrate with their surroundings. Models of the free
   molecular conduction and evaporation are derived, including a thermal
   accommodation coefficient found through molecular dynamics. The model is
   used to analyze TiRe-LII measurements made on silicon nanoparticles
   synthesized in a low-pressure plasma reactor containing argon and
   hydrogen. Nanoparticle sizes inferred from the TiRe-LII data agree with
   the results of a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the optimal inspection interval for newly-built
   onshore underground natural gas pipelines with respect to external
   metal-loss corrosion by considering the generation of corrosion defects
   over time and time-dependent growth of individual defects. The
   non-homogeneous Poisson process is used to model the generation of new
   defects and the homogeneous gamma process is used to model the growth of
   individual defects. A realistic maintenance strategy that is consistent
   with the industry practice and accounts for the probability of detection
   (PoD) and sizing errors of the inspection tool is incorporated in the
   investigation. Both the direct and indirect costs of failure are
   considered. A simulation-based approach is developed to numerically
   evaluate the expected cost rate at a given inspection interval. The
   minimum expected cost rule is employed to determine the optimal
   inspection interval. An example gas pipeline is used to examine the
   impact of the cost of failure, PoD, the excavation and repair criteria,
   the growth rate of the defect depth, the instantaneous generation rate
   of the generation model and defect generation model on the optimal
   inspection interval through parametric analyses. The results of the
   investigation will assist engineers in making the optimal maintenance
   decision for corroding natural gas pipelines and facilitate the
   reliability-based corrosion management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, recycled Ni smelter slag has been used as a reactive
   medium for arsenic (As) removal from aqueous solutions. The results of
   the study showed that 10.16-11.43-cm long columns containing 451-550 g
   of slag operated for at least 65 days were able to remove 99-100 \% As
   species from continuously flowing contaminated water at an initial As
   concentration of 10 mg/L. The removal capacities were found to be 1.039
   to 1.054 mg As per g of slag. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   Raman spectroscopy data also showed that electrostatic attraction and
   oxidation-reduction reactions between As species and mixed iron oxides
   present in the slag were the main mechanisms for the removal of arsenic
   from aqueous solutions. Theoretical multiplet analysis of XPS data
   revealed that the amount of goethite in the slag increased from 22 to 60
   \% during arsenic removal by adsorption and the percentage of magnetite
   decreased from 50 to 40 \%. These changes indicate that redox-mediated
   reactions occurred as part of the As(V) removal process. Raman
   spectroscopy studies confirmed that, in addition to surface reactions,
   internal interactions between the slag and arsenic also occurred. The
   findings of the study suggest that recycled Ni smelter slag could be an
   effective low-cost reactive medium for a subsurface remediation system,
   such as a permeable reactive barrier. Recycling of waste material (slag)
   for the removal of another waste (arsenic) can significantly reduce the
   environmental footprint of metallurgical operations and hence contribute
   to sustainable development. Such recycling also decreases slag disposal
   costs and eliminates the need to purchase commercial reactive material
   or obtain expensive natural material for remediation purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Snow depth records from daily measurements at climatological stations
   were obtained from Environment Canada and were processed and analyzed.
   It was identified that there are 549 stations, each with at least 20
   years of useable annual maximum snow depth data. Both the Gumbel
   distribution and generalized extreme value distribution were used to fit
   the annual maximum snow depth, considering several distribution fitting
   methods. Statistical analysis results indicated that, according to the
   Akaike information criterion, the Gumbel distribution is preferred for
   72 \% stations. The estimated return period value of annual maximum snow
   depth at stations was used to calculate their corresponding ground snow
   load. The at-site analysis results were used as the basis to spatially
   interpolate the ground snow loads for locations tabulated in the
   National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) since a code location and a
   climatological site are usually not co-located. For the interpolation,
   the ordinary co-kriging method with elevation as co-variate was used
   because a cross-validation analysis by using several deterministic and
   probabilistic spatial interpolation techniques indicated that the
   ordinary co-kriging method is preferred. A comparison of the newly
   estimated ground snow loads to those locations tabulated in the 1995
   edition and 2010 edition of the NBCC was also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This at is intended for investigating the effects of

   (CNTs) On the flow and heat transfer in two lateral directions over a
   stretching sheet. For this purpose, three types of base fluids

   multi-walled carbon nanotubes are used in the analysis. The convective
   boundary condition in the presence of CNTs is presented first time and
   not been explored so far. The transformed nonlinear differential
   equations are solved by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method with a shooting
   technique. The dimensionless velocity and shear stress are obtained in
   both directions. The dimensionless heat transfer is determined on the
   surface. Three different models of thermal conductivity are comparable
   for both CNTs and it is found that the Xue {[}1] model gives the best
   approach to guess the superb thermal conductivity in comparison with the
   Maxwell {[}2] and Hamilton and Crosser {[}3] models. And finally,
   another finding suggests the engine oil provides the highest skin
   friction and heat transfer rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The effect of topographic features on wind speed and wake turbulence is
   evaluated by conducting Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations
   using an in-house CFD program that features various turbulence models.
   The simulation results are assessed by computing Fractional Speed Up
   Ratio (FSUR) along longitudinal lines at different elevations. Such
   information is useful for evaluating wind loads on long span structures
   and micro-siting of wind turbines on complex terrain. Simulations are
   conducted on both idealized and real topographic features in both 2D and
   3D domain. The turbulence structure behind hills is examined using
   several turbulence models such as the mixing-length, standard k-epsilon,
   RNG k-epsilon, realizable k-epsilon and Smagorinsky LES models. All
   turbulence models predicted FSUR values on upstream side of hills
   adequately; however, the performance of simple turbulence models, such
   as mixing length, is found to be insufficient for characterizing wakes
   behind hills. RANS turbulence models gave results close to one another;
   however, those models that incorporate modifications to account for
   adverse pressure gradient conditions performed better at wakes behind
   hills. LES conducted at full scale dimensions, and using wall functions,
   failed to give results that are comparable to the other turbulence
   models. Re-conducting the simulations at model scale dimensions, hence
   at relatively small Reynolds number, and without using wall functions
   gave results that are comparable to those found in the literature.
   Therefore, use of wall functions can degrade quality of results in LES
   of high Reynolds number flows of practical interest. Crown Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Stochastic time series models are very useful in many environmental
   domains. In this paper, an analytical procedure for multi-site,
   multi-season streamflow generation using maximum entropy bootstrap
   stochastic model (M3EB) is developed that can implicitly preserve both
   the spatial and temporal dependence structure, in addition to the other
   statistical characteristics present in the historical time series. The
   proposed model is computationally less demanding and simple in terms of
   modeling complexity. The maximum entropy bootstrap (MEB) generates
   random samples from the empirical cumulative distribution function
   (ECDF) and rearranges the random series based on the rank ordering of
   the historical time series. The modeling structure of MEB implicitly
   satisfies the ergodic theorem (preservation of summary statistics) and
   guarantees the reproduction of the time dependent structure of an
   underlying process. The orthogonal transformation is used with M3EB to
   capture the spatial dependence present in the multi-site collinear data.
   The performance of M3EB is verified by comparing the statistical
   characteristics between the observed and synthetically generated
   streamflows. Three case studies from Colorado River Basin, USA; Red
   River Basin, USA and Canada; and Cauvery River Basin, India; are used to
   demonstrate the advantages of M3EB. The statistical measures adopted for
   evaluation of M3EB performance include monthly statistics (mean,
   standard deviation and skewness), temporal and spatial correlation,
   smoothing (flows other than present in historical data) and
   extrapolation (flows outside the range of historical data). The M3EB
   model shows (i) a high level of accuracy in preserving the statistics;
   and (ii) a high computational efficiency. Since M3EB can be used for
   multiple variable problems, the model can be easily extended to other
   environmental or hydroclimatic time series data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Beach sand is a habitat that supports many microbes, including viruses,
   bacteria, fungi and protozoa (micropsammon). The apparently inhospitable
   conditions of beach sand environments belie the thriving communities
   found there. Physical factors, such as water availability and protection
   from insolation; biological factors, such as competition, predation, and
   biofilm formation; and nutrient availability all contribute to the
   characteristics of the micropsammon. Sand microbial communities include
   autochthonous species/phylotypes indigenous to the environment.
   Allochthonous microbes, including fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and
   waterborne pathogens, are deposited via waves, runoff, air, or animals.
   The fate of these microbes ranges from death, to transient persistence
   and/or replication, to establishment of thriving populations
   (naturalization) and integration in the autochthonous community.
   Transport of the micropsammon within the habitat occurs both
   horizontally across the beach, and vertically from the sand surface and
   ground water table, as well as at various scales including interstitial
   flow within sand pores, sediment transport for particle-associated
   microbes, and the large-scale processes of wave action and terrestrial
   runoff. The concept of beach sand as a microbial habitat and reservoir
   of FIB and pathogens has begun to influence our thinking about human
   health effects associated with sand exposure and recreational water use.
   A variety of pathogens have been reported from beach sands, and recent
   epidemiology studies have found some evidence of health risks associated
   with sand exposure. Persistent or replicating populations of FIB and
   enteric pathogens have consequences for watershed/beach management
   strategies and regulatory standards for safe beaches. This review
   summarizes our understanding of the community structure, ecology, fate,
   transport, and public health implications of microbes in beach sand. It
   concludes with recommendations for future work in this vastly
   under-studied area.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{343-351}},

Abstract = {{Reticulated domes with substructure system are affected by
   multiple-support seismic excitations that are spatially correlated and
   coherent. The influence of the coherency on the seismic responses of
   such a structure has been investigated but the effect of the spatial
   correlation and coherency on the responses for the system with different
   flexibility of the substructure has not been studied. A parametric
   investigation is carried out to address this issue for a single-layer
   reticulated dome. For the analysis, sets of records for multiple-support
   are simulated and used for time history analysis. The statistics of the
   responses of the dome with substructures of varying degree of
   flexibility are extracted from analysis, and compared with those
   obtained under uniform excitations. The results show the importance of
   considering spatially correlated and coherent excitations, especially as
   the stiffness of the substructure system increases. They also show that
   a flexible substructure system for the dome acts as a ``base
   isolation{''} system for the dome under spatially correlated and
   coherent multiple-support excitations, and reduces the potential
   yielding and damage of the structure under large earthquakes. As the
   stiffness of the substructure system increases the consideration of
   uniform excitations instead of spatially correlated and coherent
   excitations can underestimate the seismic load effect by more than 25\%
   for structural members in the reticulated dome and by more than 100\%
   for the columns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mapping ice and open water in ocean bodies is important for numerous
   purposes, including environmental analysis and ship navigation. The
   Canadian Ice Service (CIS) has stipulated a need for an automated
   ice-water discrimination algorithm using dual polarization images
   produced by RADARSAT-2. Automated methods can provide mappings in larger
   volumes, with more consistency, and in finer resolutions, which are
   otherwise impractical to generate. We have developed such an automated
   ice-water discrimination system called MAp-Guided Ice Classification.
   First, the HV (horizontal transmit polarization, vertical receive
   polarization) scene is classified using the ``glocal{''} method, i.e., a
   hierarchical region-based classification method based on the published
   iterative region growing using semantics (IRGS) algorithm. Second, a
   pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) using a nonlinear radial basis
   function kernel classification is performed exploiting synthetic
   aperture radar gray-level co-occurrence texture and backscatter
   features. Finally, the IRGS and SVM classification results are combined
   using the IRGS approach but with a modified energy function to
   accommodate the SVM pixel-based information. The combined classifier was
   tested on 20 ground truthed dual polarization RADARSAT-2 scenes of the
   Beaufort Sea containing a variety of ice types and water patterns across
   melt, summer, and freeze-up periods. The average leave-one-out
   classification accuracy with respect to these ground truths is 96.42\%,
   with a minimum of 89.95\% for one scene. The MAGIC system is now under
   consideration by the CIS for operational use.}},

Abstract = {{The surface of Mars has long been considered a relatively oxidizing
   environment, an idea supported by the abundance of ferric iron phases
   observed there. However, compared to iron, manganese is sensitive only
   to high redox potential oxidants, and when concentrated in rocks, it
   provides a more specific redox indicator of aqueous environments.
   Observations from the ChemCam instrument on the Curiosity rover indicate
   abundances of manganese in and on some rock targets that are 1-2 orders
   of magnitude higher than previously observed on Mars, suggesting the
   presence of an as-yet unidentified manganese-rich phase. These results
   show that the Martian surface has at some point in time hosted much more
   highly oxidizing conditions than has previously been recognized.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports on a new methodology for synthesizing poly(propylene
   fumarate) (PPF)/titania nanowire composites which would be beneficial in
   tissue engineering for orthopaedic bone cements. The synthetic procedure
   reacted PPF with maleic anhydride to create HOOC-PPF-COOH species in a
   ring-opening reaction at room temperature. These species were then
   coordinated to titania nanowires by metal carboxylate bonding through
   the end -COOH groups. These PPF-grafted nano-TiO2 assemblies were then
   further polymerized and crosslinked in the presence of
   N-vinylpyrrolidone to produce the bone cements. The synthesis and
   modification of PPF was confirmed by NMR (H-1 and C-13) and XPS, while
   the reaction chemistry of the functionalized PPF and nano-TiO2 was also
   investigated by XPS and FTIR. Mechanical testing of the resulting
   composites demonstrated a significant reinforcement of the tensile and
   flexural properties, showing the utility of this synthetic approach for
   bone tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, effects of carbon-heteroatom bonds on sulfur cathodes
   were investigated. A series of carbon black substrates were prepared
   using various treatments to introduce nitrogen or oxygen surface
   species. Our results indicated that nitrogen-doped carbon black
   significantly improved the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathode
   materials. Synchrotron-based XPS revealed that the defect sites of
   nitrogen-doped carbon are favorable for the discharge product
   deposition, leading to a high utilization and reversibility of sulfur
   cathodes. Our studies also found that the introduction of oxygen
   functional groups results in deteriorated performance of Li-sulfur
   batteries due to the reduced conductivity and unwanted side reactions
   occurring between sulfur and surface oxygen species.}},

Abstract = {{We present a systematic study of the static and dynamic magnetization
   behavior of interlayer-coupled Ni80Fe20(200
   angstrom)/Ru(t(Ru))/Ni80Fe20(100 angstrom) trilayers as a function of
   the Ru spacer layer thickness t(Ru). As t(Ru) was varied in the range
   from 0 to 15.8 angstrom, we observe a strong antiferromagnetic (AFM)
   exchange coupling between the two ferromagnetic (FM) layers for t(Ru) =
   5 angstrom, which becomes weak for t(Ru) = 10 angstrom. For t(Ru) = 14.1
   angstrom, the coupled magnetic system changes from AFM to FM ordering.
   Using broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we have probed the
   effects of the different coupling mechanisms on both the acoustic and
   optic magnetic modes. We found that the biquadratic exchange coupling
   has a negligible effect compared to Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
   exchange coupling, while the uniaxial anisotropy at the Ni80Fe20/Ru
   interfaces also plays an important role in determining the behaviors of
   the modes. A mode anticrossing phenomenon is observed when the RKKY
   exchange interaction term is above a critical value. A theoretical
   framework developed is in very good agreement with our experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The distal radius fracture (DRF) is a particularly dominant injury of
   the wrist, commonly resulting from a forward fall on an outstretched
   hand. In an attempt to reduce the prevalence, costs, and potential
   long-term pain/deformities associated with this injury, in vivo and in
   vitro investigations have sought to classify the kinematics and kinetics
   of DRFs. In vivo forward fall work has identified a preparatory muscle
   contraction that occurs in the upper extremity prior to peak impact
   force. The present investigation constitutes the first attempt to
   systematically determine the effect of static muscle forces on the
   fracture threshold of the distal radius in vitro. Paired human cadaveric
   forearm specimens were divided into two groups, one that had no muscle
   forces applied (i.e., right arms) and the other that had muscle forces
   applied to ECU, ECRL, FCU and FCR (i.e., left arms), with magnitudes
   based on peak muscle forces and in vivo lower bound forward fall
   activation patterns. The specimens were secured in a custom-built
   pneumatic impact loading device and subjected to incremental impacts at
   pre-fracture (25 J) and fracture (150 J) levels. Similar fracture forces
   (6565 (866) N and 8665 (5133) N), impulses (47 (6) Ns and 57 (30) Ns),
   and energies (152 (38) J and 144 (45)J) were observed for both groups of
   specimens (p > 0.05). Accordingly, it is suggested that, at the
   magnitudes presently simulated, muscle forces have little effect on the
   way the distal radius responds to forward fall initiated impact loading.

Abstract = {{Several linked total elbow arthroplasty designs exist, which function
   similar to a loose hinge joint. Constraint behaviour is an important
   design consideration, as it affects joint stability, or how much
   secondary {[}e.g. varus-valgus (VV)] motion is permitted. Implant
   durability is also a concern, as bearing failures have been reported.
   This finite element analysis investigates the constraint characteristics
   and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene bearing stresses of three
   linked elbow design concepts {[}cylindrical (CY), hourglass (HG) and
   concave cylinder (CC)]. The bearing of the CY design was subjected to
   elevated Von Mises stresses (2.1 - 5.4 times higher than the HG and CC
   designs) due to edge loading. The HG design maintained low stresses, but
   was unable to provide consistent VV stability. The CC design also
   maintained low stresses while providing consistent VV stability. These
   results suggest that CC designs may provide better stability
   characteristics and durability in vivo, compared to the other two
   designs.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{278}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study was conducted to determine the relative efficacy
   of various advanced oxidation processes such as O-3, H2O2, UV, and
   combinations of UV/O-3, UV/H2O2 for the removal of estrone (E1) from
   pure water and secondary effluent. In addition to the parent compound
   (El) removal, performance of the advanced oxidation processes was
   characterized using removal of total organic carbon (TOC), and
   estrogenicity of the effluent. Although E1 removal was high for all the
   AOPs, intermediates formed were more difficult to degrade leading to
   slow TOC removal. Energy calculations and cost analysis indicated that,
   although UV processes have low electricity cost, ozonation is the least
   cost option (\$ 0.34/1000 gallons) when both capital and operating costs
   were taken into account. Ozonation also is superior to the other tested
   AOPs due to higher removal of TOC and estrogenicity. The rate of E1
   removal decreased linearly with the background TOC in water, however, E1
   degradation in the secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment
   plant was not affected significantly due to the low COD values in the
   effluent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A lactobacilli dominated microbiota in most pre and post-menopausal
   women is an indicator of vaginal health. The objective of this double
   blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study was to evaluate in 14
   post-menopausal women with an intermediate Nugent score, the effect of 3
   days of vaginal administration of probiotic L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L.
   reuteri RC-14 (2.5610(9) CFU each) on the microbiota and host response.
   The probiotic treatment did not result in an improved Nugent score when
   compared to when placebo. Analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing and
   metabolomics profiling revealed that the relative abundance of
   Lactobacillus was increased following probiotic administration as
   compared to placebo, which was weakly associated with an increase in
   lactate levels. A decrease in Atopobium was also observed. Analysis of
   host responses by microarray showed the probiotics had an
   immune-modulatory response including effects on pattern recognition
   receptors such as TLR2 while also affecting epithelial barrier function.
   This is the first study to use an interactomic approach for the study of
   vaginal probiotic administration in post-menopausal women. It shows that
   in some cases multifaceted approaches are required to detect the subtle
   molecular changes induced by the host to instillation of probiotic

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on metal nanostructures offers a
   promising route for manipulation and interrogation of light in the
   subwavelength regime. However, the utility of SPR structures is largely
   limited by currently used complex nanofabrication methods and relatively
   sophisticated optical components. Here to relieve these restrictions,
   plasmonic optical fibers are constructed by transferring periodic metal
   nanostructures from patterned templates onto endfaces of optical fibers
   using an epoxy adhesive. Patterned metal structures are generally
   extended from two-dimensional (2D) nanohole arrays to one-dimensional
   (1D) nanoslit arrays. By controlling the viscosity of the adhesive
   layer, diverse surface topographies of metal structures are realized
   with the same template. We design a special plasmonic fiber that
   simultaneously implements multimode refractive index sensing
   (transmission and reflection) with remarkably narrow linewidth (6.6 nm)
   and high figure of merit (60.7), which are both among the best reported
   values for SPR sensors. We further demonstrate a real-time immunoassay
   relying on our plasmonic fiber integrated with a special flow cell.
   Plasmonic optical fibers also take advantages of excellent stability
   during fiber bending and capability of spectrum filtering. These
   features enable our plasmonic fibers to open up an alternative avenue
   for the general community in biosensing and nanoplasmonics.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts have been made to elucidate the origin of d(0) magnetism in ZnO
   nanocactuses (NCs) and nanowires (NWs) using X-ray-based microscopic and
   spectroscopic techniques. The photoluminescence and O K-edge and Zn
   L-3,L-2-edge X-ray-excited optical luminescence spectra showed that ZnO
   NCs contain more defects than NWs do and that in ZnO NCs, more defects
   are present at the O sites than at the Zn sites. Specifically, the
   results of O K-edge scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and
   the corresponding X-ray-absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
   spectroscopy demonstrated that the impurity (non-stoichiometric) region
   in ZnO NCs contains a greater defect population than the thick region.
   The intensity of O K-edge STXM-XANES in the impurity region is more
   predominant in ZnO NCs than in NWs. The increase in the unoccupied
   (occupied) density of states at/above (at/below) the conduction-band
   minimum (valence-band maximum) or the Fermi level is related to the
   population of defects at the O sites, as revealed by comparing the ZnO
   NCs to the NWs. The results of O K-edge and Zn L-3,L-2-edge X-ray
   magnetic circular dichroism demonstrated that the origin of
   magnetization is attributable to the O 2p orbitals rather than the Zn d
   orbitals. Further, the local density approximation (LDA) + U verified
   that vacancies in the form of dangling or unpaired 2p states (due to Zn
   vacancies) induced a significant local spin moment in the
   nearest-neighboring O atoms to the defect center, which was determined
   from the uneven local spin density by analyzing the partial density of
   states of O 2p in ZnO.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid photovoltaic (PV)-biomass system with energy storage options is
   investigated based on energy and exergy analyses. The hybrid system
   consists of a photovoltaic system, an electrolyser, and a biomass
   gasifier, which is integrated with a biomass-based gas turbine. The PV
   system is accountable for 56\% of the annual exergy destruction in the
   hybrid system, while 38\% of the annual exergy destruction occurs in the
   biomass-gas turbine (GT) system. The overall energy and exergy
   efficiencies of the hybrid PV-biomass system with energy storage options
   are 34.8\% and 34.1\%, respectively. A 29\% increase in both energy and
   exergy efficiencies is reported with an increase in the steam-to-carbon
   ratio (SC) in the range of 1-3 mol/mol. The related specific carbon
   dioxide emission reduction is 1441-583 g/kWh. In contrast to SC, an
   increase in gas turbine inlet temperature results in a negative effect
   on the overall energy and exergy efficiencies, and it does not make a
   significant contribution to the reduction in specific carbon dioxide
   emission.}},

Abstract = {{A reliability analysis of roof sheathing panels was performed to assess
   the current minimum requirements specified in the National Building Code
   of Canada (NBCC). The present analysis considers the variations in the
   annual, hourly-mean wind speeds in cities across Canada, the external
   wind pressures due to roof shape, roof slope, eave height and upstream
   terrain, the internal wind pressures, for the range of fasteners typical
   of current construction practice. It was found that the use of 6d (51
   mm) common nails with 300 mm spacing on intermediate supports, which is
   the minimum requirement of NBCC, is not adequate for many regions of the
   country. It was found that relatively small differences in fastener size
   result in large differences in roof sheathing performance.
   Recommendations for revisions to NBCC are made, which involve using 8d
   (63 mm) nails, with 150 mm spacing on intermediate supports.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations have been
   carried out to evaluate the flow past ground-mounted solar panels at
   different flow configurations. Initially, the flow past a stand-alone
   solar panel consisting of four individual sub-panels in a 2x2
   arrangement is considered. The effects of the lateral gap spacing
   between sub-panels, the ground clearance, and the wind direction on the
   wind loading of the full panel have been analyzed. Simulations of the
   flow past solar panels in an arrayed configuration are also conducted to
   investigate the effect of longitudinal spacing between the panels on the
   wind loading. Results from the flow past the stand-alone panel reveal
   that the structure experiences maximum values of wind loading at two
   azimuthal wind directions of theta = 0 degrees and 180 degrees. The
   results also show that the two bottom panels experience larger mean wind
   loading compared to the top panels. The introduction of gap spacing
   between the panels changes the flow structure in the wake region,
   contributing to the formation and shedding of additional vortices, which
   increase in size with increased gap spacing. Although the introduction
   of gap spacing results in reduced mean wind forces, it produces regions
   that experience large wind loading. Increase of the ground clearance
   also causes larger mean wind loading on the panels. A proper choice of
   longitudinal spacing between the panels forming the array can
   significantly reduce the lift by taking advantage of the sheltering
   effect.}},

   seismic hazard, including updating the NGA database for a magnitude
   range of 3.0-7.9; updating NGA ground-motion prediction equations
   (GMPEs) for the ``average{''} horizontal component; scaling response
   spectra for damping values other than 5\%; quantifying the effects of
   directivity and directionality for horizontal ground motion; resolving
   discrepancies between the NGA and the National Earthquake Hazards
   Reduction Program (NEHRP) site amplification factors; analysis of
   epistemic uncertainty for NGA GMPEs; and developing GMPEs for vertical
   ground motion. This paper presents an overview of the NGA-West2 research

Abstract = {{We provide ground motion prediction equations for computing medians and

   derived equations for the primary M- and distance-dependence of the IMs
   after fixing the V-S30-based nonlinear site term from a parallel
   NGA-West2 study. We then evaluated additional effects using mixed
   effects residuals analysis, which revealed no trends with source depth
   over the M range of interest, indistinct Class 1 and 2 event IMs, and
   basin depth effects that increase and decrease long-period IMs for
   depths larger and smaller, respectively, than means from regional
   V-S30-depth relations. Our aleatory variability model captures
   decreasing between-event variability with M, as well as within-event
   variability that increases or decreases with M depending on period,
   increases with distance, and decreases for soft sites.}},

Abstract = {{A presentation of the model parameters and comparison of the median
   ground-motion values from the NGA-West2 GMPEs is presented for a suite

   between 10-100 km Differences increase (on the order of 2-3) for
   large-magnitude (M > 8) earthquakes at large distances (R > 100-200 km)
   and for close distances (R < 10 km). A similar increase is observed for
   hanging-wall sites, and slightly larger differences are observed for
   soil sites as opposed to rock sites. Regionalization of four of the
   GMPEs yields similar attenuation rate adjustments based on the different
   regional data sets. All five GMPE aleatory variability models are a
   function of magnitude with higher overall standard deviations values for
   the smaller magnitudes when compared to the large-magnitude events.}},

Abstract = {{High flux thin-film composite reverse osmosis membranes for brackish

   based on aromatic polyamide chemistry. A response surface methodology
   was used to optimize the concentrations of the monomers,
   1,3-Diaminobenzene (MPDA) and 1,3,5-Benzenetricarbonyl trichloride
   (TMC), and a flux-enhancing additive, Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The
   membranes prepared showed a salt rejection of more than 95\%. The
   membranes produced with DMSO additive exhibited a four-to five-fold
   higher flux rate as compared to the membranes without additive.
   Quadratic mathematical models have been proposed and verified using
   diagnostic plots, which adequately describe the flux rate and rejection
   ability within the limits of the factors investigated. The membrane
   rejection ability was contributed by a first-order effect of the
   membrane preparation parameters MPDA, TMC, and DMSO concentration, a
   quadratic effect of TMC and DMSO concentration, and an interaction
   effect between TMC and DMSO concentrations. For flux rate, first-order
   effect of TMC, MPDA, and DMSO concentration, and quadratic effect of
   MPDA concentration were significant model terms.}},

Abstract = {{Flow quantification with high-frequency (>20 MHz) power Doppler
   ultrasound can be performed objectively using the wall-filter selection
   curve (WFSC) method to select the cutoff velocity that yields a
   best-estimate color pixel density (CPD). An in vivo video microscopy
   system (IVVM) is combined with high-frequency power Doppler ultrasound
   to provide a method for validation of CPD measurements based on WFSCs in
   mouse testicular vessels. The ultrasound and IVVM systems are
   instrumented so that the mouse remains on the same imaging platform when
   switching between the two modalities. In vivo video microscopy provides
   gold-standard measurements of vascular diameter to validate power
   Doppler CPD estimates. Measurements in four image planes from three mice
   exhibit wide variation in the optimal cutoff velocity and indicate that
   a predetermined cutoff velocity setting can introduce significant errors
   in studies intended to quantify vascularity. Consistent with previously
   published flow-phantom data, in vivo WFSCs exhibited three
   characteristic regions and detectable plateaus. Selection of a cutoff
   velocity at the right end of the plateau yielded a CPD close to the
   gold-standard vascular volume fraction estimated using IVVM. An
   investigator can implement the WFSC method to help adapt cutoff velocity
   to current blood flow conditions and thereby improve the accuracy of
   power Doppler for quantitative microvascular imaging. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{A pilot injection test with guar gum stabilized microscale zerovalent
   iron (mZVI) particles was performed at test site V (Belgium) where
   different chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) were present as
   pollutants in the subsurface. One hundred kilograms of 56 pm-diameter
   mZVI (similar to 70 g L-1) was suspended in 1.5 m(3) of guar gum
   (similar to 7 g L-1) solution and injected into the test area. In order
   to deliver the guar gum stabilized mZVI slurry, one direct push
   bottom-up injection (Geoprobe) was performed with injections at 5 depths
   between 10.5 and 8.5 m bgs. The direct push technique was preferred
   above others (e.g. injection at low flow rate via screened wells)
   because of the limited hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, and to the
   large size of the mZVI particles. A final heterogeneous distribution of
   the mZVI in the porous medium was observed explicable by preferential
   flow paths created during the high pressure injection. The maximum
   observed delivery distance was 2.5 m. A significant decrease in
   1,1,1-TCA concentrations was observed in close vicinity of spots where
   the highest concentration of mZVI was observed. Carbon stable isotope
   analysis (CSIA) yielded information on the success of the abiotic
   degradation of 1,1,1-TCA and indicated a heterogeneous spatio-temporal
   pattern of degradation. Finally, the obtained results show that mZVI
   slurries stabilized by guar gum can be prepared at pilot scale and
   directly injected into low permeable aquifers, indicating a significant
   removal of 1,1,1-TCA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the utility of intraprocedural 3D TRUS image information in
   guiding registration for displacement compensation during prostate
   biopsy}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{537-547}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: In targeted 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy,
   patient and prostate movement during the procedure can cause target
   misalignments that hinder accurate sampling of preplanned suspicious
   tissue locations. Multiple solutions have been proposed for displacement
   compensation via registration of intraprocedural TRUS images to a
   baseline 3D TRUS image acquired at the beginning of the biopsy
   procedure. While 2D TRUS images are widely used for intraprocedural
   guidance, some solutions utilize richer intraprocedural images such as
   bi- or multiplanar TRUS or 3D TRUS, acquired by specialized probes. In
   this work, the impact of such richer intraprocedural imaging on
   displacement compensation accuracy was measured to evaluate the tradeoff
   between cost and complexity of intraprocedural imaging versus improved
   displacement compensation.
   Methods: Baseline and intraprocedural 3D TRUS images were acquired from
   29 patients at standard sextant-template biopsy locations. Planes
   extracted from 3D TRUS images acquired at sextant positions were used to
   simulate 2D and 3D intraprocedural information available in different
   potential clinically relevant scenarios for co-registration with the
   baseline 3D TRUS image. In practice, intraprocedural 3D information can
   be acquired either via the use of specialized ultrasound probes (e.g.,
   multiplanar or 3D probes) or via axial rotation of a tracked 2D TRUS
   probe. Registration accuracy was evaluated by calculating the target
   registration error (TRE) using manually identified homologous intrinsic
   fiducial markers (microcalcifications). The TRE was analyzed separately
   at the base, mid-gland and apex regions of the prostate.
   Results: The results indicate that TRE improved gradually as the number
   of intraprocedural imaging planes used in registration was increased,
   implying that 3D TRUS information assisted the registration algorithm to
   robustly converge to more accurate solutions. The acquisition of a
   partial volume up to the angle of rotation supported more accurate
   displacement compensation than acquiring biplane configurations.
   Additional intraprocedural 3D TRUS image information was more beneficial
   to registration accuracy in the base and apex regions as compared with
   the mid-gland region.
   Conclusions: While the majority of the registrations using 2D TRUS
   images provided a clinically desired level of accuracy, intraprocedural
   3D imaging helped improve the overall registration accuracy and
   robustness, especially in the base and apex regions of the prostate.
   These results are helpful for devising image-based registration methods
   for displacement compensation when designing 3D TRUS-guided biopsy
   systems. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{LiMnBO3 nanobeads (LMB-NB) with uniform size and distribution were
   synthesized using a urea-assisted microwave/solvothermal method. The
   potential application of LMB-NBs as an anode for a lithium-ion hybrid
   capacitor (Li-AHC) was tested with a polyaniline-nanofiber (PANI-NF)
   cathode in a nonaqueous LiPF6 (1M)-ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate
   electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge (C/DC) studies
   revealed that the PANI-NF/LMB-NB cell showed an exceptional capacitance
   behavior between 0-3 V along with a prolonged cycle life. A discharge
   capacitance of about 125 Fg(-1), and energy and power densities of about
   42 Whkg(-1) and 1500 Wkg(-1), respectively, could be obtained at a
   current density of 1 Ag-1; those Li-AHC values are higher relative to
   cells containing various lithium intercalation materials in nonaqueous
   electrolytes. In addition, the PANI-NF/LMB-NB cell also had an
   outstanding rate performance with a capacitance of 54 Fg(-1) and a power
   density of 3250 Wkg(-1) at a current density of 2.25 Ag-1 and maintained
   94\% of its initial value after 30000 cycles. This improved capacitive
   performance with an excellent electrochemical stability could be the
   result of the morphological features and inherent conductive nature of
   the electroactive species.}},

Abstract = {{The acaricides clofentezine, hexythiazox and etoxazole are commonly
   referred to as `mite growth inhibitors', and clofentezine and
   hexythiazox have been used successfully for the integrated control of
   plant mite pests for decades. Although they are still important today,
   their mode of action has remained elusive. Recently, a mutation in
   chitin synthase 1 (CHS1) was linked to etoxazole resistance. In this
   study, we identified and investigated a Tetranychus urticae strain
   (HexR) harboring recessive, monogenic resistance to each of hexythiazox,
   clofentezine, and etoxazole. To elucidate if there is a common genetic
   basis for the observed cross-resistance, we adapted a previously
   developed bulk segregant analysis method to map with high resolution a
   single, shared resistance locus for all three compounds. This finding
   indicates that the underlying molecular basis for resistance to all
   three compounds is identical. This locus is centered on the CHS1 gene,
   and as supported by additional genetic and biochemical studies, a
   non-synonymous variant (I1017F) in CHS1 associates with resistance to
   each of the tested acaricides in HexR. Our findings thus demonstrate a
   shared molecular mode of action for the chemically diverse mite growth
   inhibitors clofentezine, hexythiazox and etoxazole as inhibitors of an
   essential, non-catalytic activity of CHS1. Given the previously
   documented cross-resistance between clofentezine, hexythiazox and the
   benzyolphenylurea (BPU) compounds fiufenoxuron and cycloxuron, CHS1
   should be also considered as a potential target-site of insecticidal
   BPUs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the influence of ceramic
   thickness and shade on the Knoop hardness and dynamic elastic modulus of
   a dual-cured resin cement.
   Materials and Methods: Six ceramic shades (Bleaching, A1, A2, A3, A3.5,
   B3) and two ceramic thicknesses (1 mm, 3 mm) were evaluated. Disk
   specimens (diameter: 7 mm; thickness: 2 mm) of the resin cement were
   light cured under a ceramic block. Light-cured specimens without the
   ceramic block at distances of 1 and 3mm were also produced. The Knoop
   hardness number (KHN), density, and dynamic Young's moduli were
   determined. Statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA and a Tukey B
   rank order test (p = 0.05).
   Results: The bleaching 1-mm-thick group exhibited significantly higher
   dynamic Young's modulus. Lower dynamic Young's moduli were observed for
   the 3-mm-thick ceramic groups compared to bleaching 3-mm-thick group,
   and no difference was found among the other 3-mm groups. For the KHN,
   when A3.5 3-mm-thick was used, the KHN was significantly lower than
   bleaching and A1 1-mm-thick ceramic; however, no difference was
   exhibited between the thicknesses of the same shade.
   Conclusions: The dual-cured resin cement studied irradiated through the
   1-mm-thick ceramic with the lightest shade (bleaching ceramic) exhibited
   a better elastic modulus, and there was no effect in KHN of the resin
   cement when light cured under different ceramic shades and thicknesses
   (1 and 3 mm), except when the A3.5 3-mm-thick ceramic was used.
   Clinical Significance: Variolink II irradiated through ceramic with the
   lowest chroma exhibited the highest elastic modulus; therefore, the
   light activation method might not be the same for all clinical
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Object tracking is a key enabling technology in the context of
   computer-assisted medical interventions. Allowing the continuous
   localization of medical instruments and patient anatomy, it is a
   prerequisite for providing instrument guidance to subsurface anatomical
   structures. The only widely used technique that enables real-time
   tracking of small objects without line-of-sight restrictions is
   electromagnetic (EM) tracking. While EM tracking has been the subject of
   many research efforts, clinical applications have been slow to emerge.
   The aim of this review paper is therefore to provide insight into the
   future potential and limitations of EM tracking for medical use. We
   describe the basic working principles of EM tracking systems, list the
   main sources of error, and summarize the published studies on tracking
   accuracy, precision and robustness along with the corresponding
   validation protocols proposed. State-of-the-art approaches to error
   compensation are also reviewed in depth. Finally, an overview of the
   clinical applications addressed with EM tracking is given. Throughout
   the paper, we report not only on scientific progress, but also provide a
   review on commercial systems. Given the continuous debate on the
   applicability of EM tracking in medicine, this paper provides a timely
   overview of the state-of-the-art in the field.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops the probabilistic characteristics of the model
   errors associated with five well-known burst capacity
   models/methodologies for pipelines containing longitudinally-oriented
   external surface cracks, namely the Battelle and CorLAS (TM) models as
   well as the failure assessment diagram (FAD) methodologies recommended
   in the BS 7910 (2005), API RP579 (2007) and R6 (Rev 4, Amendment 10). A
   total of 112 full-scale burst test data for cracked pipes subjected
   internal pressure only were collected from the literature. The model
   error for a given burst capacity model is evaluated based on the ratios
   of the test to predicted burst pressures for the collected data.
   Analysis results suggest that the CorLAS (TM) model is the most accurate
   model among the five models considered and the Battelle, BS 7910, API
   RP579 and R6 models are in general conservative; furthermore, the API
   RP579 and R6 models are markedly more accurate than the Battelle and BS
   7910 models. The results will facilitate the development of
   reliability-based structural integrity management of pipelines. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To propose a novel approach to water/fat separation using a
   unique smoothness constraint.
   Theory and Methods: Chemical-shift based water/fat separation is an
   established noninvasive imaging tool for the visualization of body fat
   in various anatomies. Nevertheless, B0 magnetic field inhomogeneities
   can hamper the water/fat separation process. In this work, B0 variations
   are mapped using a convex-relaxed labeling model which produces a coarse
   estimate of the field map, while considering T-2(star) decay during the
   labeling process. Fat and water components are subsequently resolved
   using T-2(star)-IDEAL. An adaptive spatial filtering (ASF) was
   introduced to improve the robustness of the estimate. The method was
   tested on cardiac and abdominal datasets from healthy volunteers and
   nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients.
   Results: Out of 168 cardiac and abdominal images, only 1 case has shown
   water/fat swaps that can hinder the clinical interpretation of the
   underlying anatomy.
   Conclusion: This work demonstrates a new water/fat separation approach
   that prevents the occurrence of water/fat swaps, by means of a unique
   smoothness constraint. Incorporating T-2(star) effect in the labeling
   procedure and including the ASF processing enhance the robustness of the
   proposed approach and permit the procedure to handle abrupt B0
   variations within the field of view. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Functionalization of polymeric biomaterials permits the conjugation of
   cell signaling molecules capable of directing cell function. In this
   study, L-phenylalanine and L-aspartic acid were used to synthesize
   poly(ester amide)s (PEAs) with pendant carboxylic acid groups through an
   interfacial polycondensation approach. Human coronary artery smooth
   muscle cell (HCASMC) attachment, spreading and proliferation was
   observed on all PEA films. Vinculin expression at the cell periphery
   suggested that HCASMCs formed focal adhesions on the functional PEAs,
   while the absence of smooth muscle alpha-actin (SM alpha A) expression
   implied the cells adopted a proliferative phenotype. The PEAs were also
   electrospun to yield nanoscale three-dimensional (3-D) scaffolds with
   average fiber diameters ranging from 130 to 294 nm. Immunoblotting
   studies suggested a potential increase in SMaA and calponin expression
   from HCASMCs cultured on 3-D fibrous scaffolds when compared to 2-D
   films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and immunofluorescence
   demonstrated the conjugation of transforming growth factor-beta 1 to the
   surface of the functional PEA through the pendant carboxylic acid
   groups. Taken together, this study demonstrates that PEAs containing
   aspartic acid are viable biomaterials for further investigation in
   vascular tissue engineering. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Stem surface treatment and material are two design factors that may
   affect the onset of implant loosening. For upper limb applications, no
   known in vitro studies have addressed the role of these two factors on
   cemented implant stability. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
   compare the torsional stability of cemented titanium and cobalt chrome
   stems with varying surface treatments in vitro. Thirty implant stems of
   circular cross-section (empty set = 8mm) were machined from cobalt
   chrome (n = 15) and titanium (n = 15). For each type, stems were
   subdivided into three groups for application of clinically relevant
   surface treatments: smooth, sintered beads, or plasma spray. Stems were
   potted in bone cement, allowed 24 h to cure, and placed in a materials
   testing machine. Stems were tested under cyclic torsion (1-30 Nm), using
   a staircase loading protocol. Failure was defined as either the first
   rapid increase in stem rotation without resistance, or attaining a
   maximum torque of 30 Nm. Implant stems with non-smooth surfaces offered
   greater resistance to torsion (p < 0.05), with the plasma spray
   treatment outlasting the beaded and smooth stems (p < 0.05). Titanium
   offered superior interface strength (p < 0.05) but reduced resistance to
   motion (p < 0.05) when compared to cobalt chrome. Therefore, these
   design features should be considered during upper limb implant design.

Abstract = {{In this work, Fe-doped TiO2 nanoparticles ranging from a 0.2 to 1 weight
   \% were grown from the surface of graphene sheet templates containing
   -COOH functionalities using sol-gel chemistry in a green solvent, a
   mixture of water/ethanol. The assemblies were characterized by a variety
   of analytical techniques, with the coordination mechanism examined
   theoretically using the density functional theory (DFT). Scanning
   electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed
   excellent decoration of the Fe-doped TiO2 nanoparticles on the surface
   of the graphene sheets >5 nm in diameter. The surface area and optical
   properties of the Fe-doped photocatalysts were measured by BET, UV and
   PL spectrometry and compared to non-graphene and pure TiO2 analogs,
   showing a plateau at 0.6\% Fe. Interactions between graphene and
   Fe-doped anatase TiO2 were also studied theoretically using the Vienna
   ab initio Simulation Package based on DFT. Our first-principles
   theoretical investigations validated the experimental findings, showing
   the strength in the physical and chemical adsorption between the
   graphene and Fe-doped TiO2. The resulting assemblies were tested for
   photodegradation under visible light using 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as a
   model compound, with all investigated catalysts showing significant
   enhancements in photocatalytic activity in the degradation of E2.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{427-447}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A single roughness element and the beginning/end of a roughness patch
   represent common surface protuberances. The flow recovers from
   disruptions caused by such protuberances either by returning to its
   original state or by approaching a new state downstream from a
   protuberance. Understanding of the recovery process is important in the
   determination of the sensitivity of the laminar-turbulent transition to
   surface protuberances. The beginning/end of a roughness patch has been
   modeled as a small-height channel expansion/contraction, while a
   rectangular protuberance has been used in the analysis of disruptions
   caused by a single roughness element. The recovery process has been
   studied using semi-analytical methods, direct numerical simulations as
   well as experiments. The size of the recovery zone has been measured
   using two types of criteria, one based on the properties of the
   stationary flow and the other one based on the characteristics of the
   linear instability. It has been found that the flow remains stationary
   without any unsteady separation at the subcritical Reynolds number Re =
   5000 of interest. The effects of the step persist very far in the
   downstream direction; for the step height of 1 \% of the channel
   half-height, the two-dimensional TS wave reaches asymptotic form at
   about 500 channels half-heights (50,000 step's heights) downstream from
   the step. The length of the recovery zone is reduced by an order of
   magnitude if the channel returns to its upstream form downstream from
   the protuberance, as demonstrated through analysis of a single roughness
   element. Smoothing of the downstream side of the protuberance eliminates
   flow separation but does not affect the flow characteristics.}},

Title = {{Cost-sensitive learning for defect escalation}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{146-155}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{While most software defects (i.e., bugs) are corrected and tested as
   part of the prolonged software development cycle, enterprise software
   venders often have to release software products before all reported
   defects are corrected, due to deadlines and limited resources. A small
   number of these reported defects will be escalated by customers whose
   businesses are seriously impacted. Escalated defects must be resolved
   immediately and individually by the software vendors at a very high
   cost. The total costs can be even greater, including loss of reputation,
   satisfaction, loyalty, and repeat revenue. In this paper, we develop a
   Software defecT Escalation Prediction (STEP) system to mine historical
   defect report data and predict the escalation risk of current defect
   reports for maximum net profit. More specifically, we first describe a
   simple and general framework to convert the maximum net profit problem
   to cost-sensitive learning. We then apply and compare four well-known
   cost-sensitive learning approaches for STEP. Our experiments suggest
   that cost-sensitive decision trees (CSTree) is the best methods for
   producing the highest positive net profit. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Generalized cyclic p-y curve modeling for analysis of laterally loaded
   piles}},
Journal = {{SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{138-149}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Owing to their simplicity and reasonable accuracy, Beam on Nonlinear
   Winkler Foundation (BNWF) models are widely used for the analysis of
   laterally loaded piles. Their main drawback is idealizing the soil
   continuum with discrete uncoupled springs representing the soil
   reactions to pile movement. Static p-y curves, obtained from limited
   full-scaled field tests, are generally used as a backbone curve of the
   model. However, these empirically derived p-y curves could not
   incorporate the effects of various pile properties and soil continuity.
   The strain wedge method (SWM) has been improved to assess the nonlinear
   p-y curve response of laterally loaded piles based on a
   three-dimensional soil-pile interaction through a passive wedge
   developed in front of the pile. In this paper, the SWM based p-y curve
   is implemented as the backbone curves of developed BNWF model to study
   the nonlinear response of single pile under cyclic lateral loading. The
   developed nonlinear model is capable of accounting for various important
   soil-pile interaction response features such as soil and pile yielding,
   cyclic degradation of soil stiffness and strength under generalized
   loading, soil-pile gap formation with soil cave-in and recompression,
   and energy dissipation. Some experimental tests are studied to verify
   the BNWF model and examine the effect of each factor on the response of
   laterally loaded pile embedded in sand and clay. The experimental data
   and computed results agree well, confirming the model ability to predict
   the response of piles under one-way and two-way cyclic loading. The
   results show that the developed model can satisfactorily simulate the
   pile stiffness hardening due to soil cave in and sand densification as
   observed in the experiment. It is also concluded from the results that
   the gap formation and soil degradation have significant effects on the
   increase of lateral pile-head deflection and maximum bending moment of
   the pile in cohesive soils. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3241-3253}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{High-level image representations have drawn increasing attention in
   visual recognition, e. g., scene classification, since the invention of
   the object bank. The object bank represents an image as a response map
   of a large number of pretrained object detectors and has achieved
   superior performance for visual recognition. In this paper, based on the
   object bank representation, we propose the object-to-class (O2C)
   distances to model scene images. In particular, four variants of O2C
   distances are presented, and with the O2C distances, we can represent
   the images using the object bank by lower-dimensional but more
   discriminative spaces, called distance spaces, which are spanned by the
   O2C distances. Due to the explicit computation of O2C distances based on
   the object bank, the obtained representations can possess more semantic
   meanings. To combine the discriminant ability of the O2C distances to
   all scene classes, we further propose to kernalize the distance
   representation for the final classification. We have conducted extensive
   experiments on four benchmark data sets, UIUC-Sports, Scene-15, MIT
   Indoor, and Caltech-101, which demonstrate that the proposed approaches
   can significantly improve the original object bank approach and achieve
   the state-of-the-art performance.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchical Bayesian growth model is presented in this paper to
   characterize and predict the growth of individual metal-loss corrosion
   defects on pipelines. The depth of the corrosion defects is assumed to
   be a power-law function of time characterized by two power-law
   coefficients and the corrosion initiation time, and the probabilistic
   characteristics of the these parameters are evaluated using Markov Chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation technique based on in-line inspection
   (ILI) data collected at different times for a given pipeline. The model
   accounts for the constant and non-constant biases and random scattering
   errors of the ILI data, as well as the potential correlation between the
   random scattering errors associated with different ILI tools. The model
   is validated by comparing the predicted depths with the field-measured
   depths of two sets of external corrosion defects identified on two real
   natural gas pipelines. The results suggest that the growth model is able
   to predict the growth of active corrosion defects with a reasonable

Abstract = {{Interstitial nitrogen (N) doped titanium dioxide was prepared and used
   as support for vanadium oxide to test the nitrogen effect on
   vanadia-catalyzed partial oxidation processes. Ethanol partial oxidation
   catalytic studies and surface studies on the structure of the N doped
   support before and after vanadia loading indicate that nitrogen acts as
   a promoter of catalytic activity. Samples were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction, electron dispersive X-ray, and surface area measurements to
   evaluate their crystallinity, surface chemical composition and surface
   area. Diffuse reflectance UV-visible and Fourier transform intra-red
   spectroscopy, together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used
   to probe the effect of nitrogen on the vanadia-titanium dioxide
   interaction. The band gap edge energies obtained for the vanadium oxide
   species suggest that the size of the vanadia cluster is larger on the
   nitrogen doped catalysts compared to the ones observed in the N-free
   support, pointing to a weaker interaction between vanadia and TiO2 when
   nitrogen is present. At the same time and in-situ Fourier transform
   infra-red spectroscopy studies indicate that interstitial N exists in
   the catalyst surface in forms of hyponitrite or nitrite-like species. A
   model in which nitrogen affects vanadia dispersion and ethanol
   adsorption capacity is proposed to explain all these observations. (C)

Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The overall stability of a segmental tunnel lining ring is highly
   dependent on the structural integrity of its individual precast
   segments, which provide protection against the surrounding exposure
   conditions. In this study, the settlement and punching behavior of
   full-scale conventional reinforced concrete (RC) and steel
   fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) precast tunnel lining segments
   fabricated for a subway tunnel in Canada were investigated. Precast
   concrete tunnel lining (PCTL) segment specimens were subjected to
   mid-span load on their intrados faces. Such loading can be induced as a
   result of vehicular accidents inside the tunnel and/or soil settlement
   underneath the PCTL segments. Moreover, a punching test was conducted to
   replicate the expansion of rocks or other geotechnical surrounding
   conditions above or underneath the tunnel segments. The experimental
   results showed that the peak load carrying capacity of the RC segments
   was higher than that of the SFRC segments for both the settlement and
   punching behavior. However, SFRC segments exhibited higher initial
   cracking load, more stable post-peak cracking pattern compared to that
   of the RC segments and significant reduction in crack width. This makes
   SFRC attractive for the fabrication of segmental tunnel linings where
   the initial cracking is a governing criterion. Furthermore, it was
   confirmed that both the tested RC and SFRC PCTL segments satisfied
   common settlement and punching loads design criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of the second-order polynomial dynamic
   linear model (DLM) to characterize the growth of the depth of corrosion
   defects on energy pipelines using data obtained from multiple
   high-resolution in-line inspections (ILI). The growth model incorporates
   the measurement error of the ILI tools and captures the temporal
   variability of the corrosion growth by allowing the
   artificially-constructed average growth rate between two successive
   inspections to vary with time. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation
   is employed to carry out the Bayesian updating of the growth model and
   evaluate the posterior distributions of the model parameters. An example
   involving real ILI data collected from an in-service natural gas
   pipeline is employed to illustrate and validate the growth model. The
   analysis results show that the defect depths predicted by the proposed
   model agree well with the actual depths and are more accurate than those
   predicted by the Gamma process- and Inverse Gaussian process-based
   growth models reported in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the performance of a novel batch fluidized
   microreactor, called ``the Jiggle Bed Reactor'', in producing reliable
   and reproducible data and its functionality in relation to changes in
   operating parameters, non-catalytic and catalytic steam reforming of a
   model compound (acetic acid) was investigated. Silica sand was used as
   the bed material for non-catalytic tests and a commercial steam
   reforming catalyst was used for the catalytic tests. Testing parameters
   included temperatures between 650 degrees C and 750 degrees C, reaction
   times between 10 s and 90 s and molar steam to carbon ratio ( S/C) equal
   to 0, 3 and 6. Such long reactions times were selected to investigate
   extend of conversion of acetic acid and yield of product gases in the
   absence of catalyst. Atmospheric pressure was used in all experiments.
   Analysis of the product gas yield shows that the Jiggle Bed Reactor
   allows for a series of precise experiments over a short period of time
   in a small scale setup. In addition, the effects of operating
   parameters, such as temperature, reaction time, S/C ratio as well as
   type and mass of the bed particles on product gas yields, were clearly
   observed and reliable consistency between trends from the Jiggle Bed
   Reactor data and the literature was confirmed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   is preserved, while the manipulator weight and effective inertia are
   reduced. This is achieved by relocating the driving motor to the base of
   the robot. Moreover, magnetorheological clutches have been shown to pose
   superior torque to mass, and torque to inertia characteristics over
   conventional servo motors, further contributing to the reduction of
   manipulator mass and inertia. The manipulator exhibits both high
   performance and intrinsic safety as a result of mechanically passive
   dynamics. A set of experiments is performed to validate the manipulator
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study of particle velocity and solids flux is conducted
   in a high density circulating fluidized bed with extremely high solids
   circulation rate up to 1000 kg/m(2) s, for the first time in the

   velocity becomes more uniform in such extremely high solids flux
   conditions than cases with lower solids flux. Radial profiles of
   particle velocity and solids flux become increasingly steep with
   increasing solids circulation rate. No net downward flow near the wall
   is detected, which is considered an important advantage of the high
   density riser leading to reduced solids backmixing. Correlations of
   particle velocity against solids holdup are stronger for low density
   conditions than for high density cases, suggesting that gas-particle
   interaction dominates in low density risers, while particle-particle
   interaction plays a key role for the motion of particles in the
   extremely high density ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oxide coatings were produced on a 6061 aluminum alloy using a pulsed
   unipolar plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) process. The effect of
   electrical parameters including pulse frequency, duty cycle and current
   density on phase formation in the coatings was revealed using
   conventional and glancing angle X-ray diffraction. The results show that
   PEO coatings are mainly composed of gamma-Al2O3. Depending on the
   electrical parameters employed, the coatings can also contain
   alpha-Al2O3 and mullite with varying concentrations. Higher current
   densities and higher duty cycle were found to favor the formation of
   mullite. Under the experimental conditions used, the ratio of the
   integrated XRD peaks for alpha- and gamma-Al2O3 varied from 0 to about
   0.6, indicating that the relative content of alpha-Al2O3 in the PEO
   coatings varied over a wide range. Longer pulse on-times and higher
   current densities promoted the gamma to alpha-alumina phase
   transformation. Depth profiling of PEO ceramic coatings using glancing
   angle XRD with different incident beam angles revealed that mullite was
   more concentrated in the top surface of the coatings. No significant
   variation in alpha-Al2O3 concentration across the coatings could be
   concluded in this study, unlike the results of some other studies. Crown

Abstract = {{An electrostatic ultrafine dry powder coating technique was developed,
   which utilizes nanoparticles to prevent agglomeration. When polyester
   resin, TiO2 (25\%), nano-TiO2 (0.5\%), filler, flow, degassing and
   curing agents were combined in a high-shear mixer, then sprayed (20 kV)
   onto metal sheets and cured (200 degrees C), biocompatible polymeric
   powder coatings (PPC) were created. This study's objective was to
   determine if these surface coatings could be successfully augmented with
   calcium-rich functional additives. Thus, formulations were enriched with
   CaO (1,3 and 5\%) and Ca-3(PO4)(2) (5\%, CaP), and their coatings
   characterized. Particle size analysis of the powders confirmed their
   ultrafine dimensions. Volume diameters for 50\% (D 0.5) were under 30 mu
   m, and 90\% (D 0.9) under 50 mu m. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
   analysis confirmed integration with minimal modification to the PPC
   base. Carbon (61-67\%), oxygen (15-25\%) and titanium (9-15\%) dominated
   all surfaces, whereas calcium (0.5-1.0\%) and phosphorus (0.3\%) were
   only detected in the CaO and CaP enriched coatings respectively.
   Elemental mapping showed calcium clusters that were smaller but more
   abundant with more CaO (PPC + 3\%CaO, PPC + 5\%Ca0), and colocalized to
   phosphorus in the PPC + 5\%CaP. Contact angle measurements indicated
   hydrophilic coatings (62-81 degrees) and significantly (P < 0.05)
   increased surface wetting with CaO. Optical microscopy showed human
   mesenchymal cell (HEPM, ATCC CRL-1486) attachment and spreading on all
   coatings within 24 h, and increasing confluence with CaO incorporation.
   Alizarin Red-S staining detected the biomineralization of cultures on
   all coatings that increased with CaO and time. Ultimately, the PPC +
   5\%CaO had the most cells and biomineralization. This ultrafine dry
   powder coating technology can create biocompatible surfaces from
   polyester resins and TiO2, which can be readily augmented with
   functional additives such as calcium, to titrate optimal cellular
   responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new DFTB-p3b density functional tight binding model for
   hydrogen at extremely high pressures and temperatures, which includes a
   polarizable basis set (p) and a three-body environmentally dependent
   repulsive potential (3b). We find that use of an extended basis set is
   necessary under dissociated liquid conditions to account for the
   substantial p-orbital character of the electronic states around the
   Fermi energy. The repulsive energy is determined through comparison to
   cold curve pressures computed from density functional theory (DFT) for
   the hexagonal close-packed solid, as well as pressures from thermally
   equilibrated DFT-MD simulations of the liquid phase. In particular, we
   observe improved agreement in our DFTB-p3b model with previous
   theoretical and experimental results for the shock Hugoniot of hydrogen
   up to 100 GPa and 25000 K, compared to a standard DFTB model using
   pairwise interactions and an s-orbital basis set, only. The DFTB-p3b
   approach discussed here provides a general method to extend the DFTB
   method for a wide variety of materials over a significantly larger range
   of thermodynamic conditions than previously possible.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first detailed molecular dynamics study of two carbon
   nanoparticles (nanotubes or fullerenes) embedded in a droplet of
   chloroform. The carbon nanoparticles are negatively charged and are
   accompanied by the positive counterions of sodium. On the one hand, this
   setup is inspired by the carbon nanoparticle salts-{''}nanotubides{''}
   and ``fullerides{''}-proposed recently as a convenient way to address
   the difficult problem of the dispersion of carbon nanoparticulates in
   the organic solvents. On the other hand, the electrospray of carbon
   nanoparticle suspensions has been shown to be a promising technique for
   the production of thin nanoparticle coatings. We explore the combination
   of these two approaches by using molecular simulations. We find that
   depending on the overall electrostatic charge balance the two
   nanoparticles can exist in the droplet either in the ``salted-out{''}
   bound state or in a ``solvent-separated{''} state. The latter opens up
   the possibility for the efficient dispersion of the nanoparticles in the
   charged droplet environment. We also find that depending on the charge
   of the nanoparticles the mother droplet may break evenly or unevenly
   with respect to the mass but evenly with respect to charge. The
   understanding of the fragmentation paths and the intermolecular
   interactions of the nanoparticles in droplets provides insight into the
   manner that the droplet chemistry can be manipulated so that effective
   dispersion of nanoparticulates can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach was made to fabricate lithium ion hybrid capacitor
   (Li-HC) having LiMnBO3 nanobead (LMB-NB) anode and polyaniline nanofiber
   (PAN cathode in 1 M LiPF6 organic electrolyte. LMB-NB and PANI
   nanofibers were synthesized using urea assisted microwave-solvothermal
   method and chemical polymerization process, respectively. The
   PANI/LMB-NB cell showed improved electrochemical capacitive behavior as
   compared to activated carbon (AC)/LMB-NB cell due to the characteristic
   conductivity and the morphological feature of PANI as well as LMB-NB
   electrodes. A discharge capacitance (DCcell) of 125 F g(-1) was obtained
   at a current density of 1 A g(-1) between the potential range 0 and 3 V
   for PANI/LMB-NB cell, while AC/LMB-NB cell delivered only 77 F g(-1) at
   the same current density. Moreover, PANI/LMB-NB cell exhibited excellent
   rate performance with the DCcell of about 55 F g(-1) at 2.25 A g(-1) and
   still retained 94\% of the initial value after 30 000 charge-discharge
   cycles. In addition, maximum energy and power densities of 42 Wh kg(-1)
   and 5350 W kg(-1), respectively, were achieved from PANI/LMB-NB cell.
   The obtained DCcell, energy, and power densities along with prolonged
   cyclic life for PANI/LMB-NB cell are some of the best ever reported
   values for Li-HC as compared to the cells constructed with various
   lithium intercalating materials.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Edible medicinal
   mushrooms have been used in traditional medicine as regimes for cancer
   patients. Recently anti-cancer bioactive components from some mushrooms
   have been isolated and their anti-cancer effects have been tested.
   Pleurotus ferulae, a typical edible medicinal mushroom in Xinjiang
   China, has also been used to treat cancer patients in folk medicine.
   However, little studies have been reported on the anticancer components
   of Pleurotus ferulae. This study aims to extract bioactive components
   from Pleurotus ferulae and to investigate the anti-cancer effects of the
   extracts. We used ethanol to extract anti-cancer bioactive components
   enriched with terpenoids from Pleurotus ferulae. We tested the
   anti-tumour effects of ethanol extracts on the melanoma cell line
   B16F10, the human gastric cancer cell line BGC 823 and the immortalized
   human gastric epithelial mucosa cell line GES-1 in vitro and a murine
   melanoma model in vivo. Cell toxicity and cell proliferation were
   measured by MTT assays. Cell cycle progression, apoptosis, caspase 3
   activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), migration and gene
   expression were studied in vitro. PFEC suppressed tumor cell growth,
   inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cells at G0/G1 phases and was not
   toxic to non-cancer cells. PFEC also induced cell apoptosis and
   necrosis, increased caspase 3 activity, reduced the MMP, prevented cell
   invasion and changed the expression of genes associated with apoptosis
   and the cell cycle. PFEC delayed tumor formation and reduced tumor
   growth in vivo. In conclusion, ethanol extracted components from
   Pleurotus ferulae exert anti-cancer effects through direct suppression
   of tumor cell growth and invasion, demonstrating its therapeutic
   potential in cancer treatment.}},

Abstract = {{6{''}-O-Acetylginsenoside Rb-1 (ac-Rb-1) isolated from North American
   ginseng was encapsulated within biodegradable
   poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres. Both a conventional
   double emulsion and a microfluidic technique were examined for
   microsphere formation. The ac-Rb-1 encapsulation within PLGA
   microspheres was characterized by various physicochemical techniques
   including FTIR, DSC, and XRD. The experimental data showed that the PLGA
   microspheres produced from the microfluidic technique were uniform with
   tunable mean diameters from 7 to 59 mu m and standard deviations less
   than 10\%. The size was independent of the capillary number and could be
   tuned by altering the continuous and disperse phase flow rate ratios.
   Release profiles from the uniform microspheres were investigated,
   showing controlled release of ac-Rb-1 which followed a Fickian diffusion
   while retaining potency toward immunosuppressive activity using
   macrophages in vitro. This study shows that ac-Rb-1 encapsulated PLGA
   microspheres obtained using the microfluidic approach are promising for
   the development of next-generation biomedical agents.}},

Title = {{Polyglyoxylates: A Versatile Class of Triggerable Self-Immolative
   Polymers from Readily Accessible Monomers}},

Abstract = {{Self-immolative polymers, which degrade by an end-to-end
   depolymerization mechanism in response to the cleavage of a stabilizing
   end-cap from the polymer terminus, are of increasing interest for a wide
   variety of applications ranging from sensors to controlled release.
   However, the preparation of these materials often requires expensive,
   multistep monomer syntheses, and the degradation products such as
   quinone methides or phthalaldehydes are potentially toxic to humans and
   the environment. We demonstrate here that polyglyxoylates can serve as a
   new and versatile class of self-immolative polymers. Polymerization of
   the commercially available monomer ethyl glyoxylate, followed by
   end-capping with a 6-nitroveratryl carbonate, provides a poly(ethyl
   glyoxylate) that depolymerizes selectively upon irradiation with UV
   light, ultimately generating ethanol and the metabolic intermediate
   glyoxylic acid hydrate. To access polyglyoxylates with different
   properties, the polymerization and end-capping approach can also be
   extended to other glyoxylate monomers including methyl glyoxylate,
   n-butyl glyoxylate, and benzyl glyoxylate, which can be easily prepared
   from their corresponding fumaric or maleic acid derivatives. Random
   copolymers of these monomers with ethyl glyoxylate can also be prepared.
   Furthermore, using a multifunctional end-cap that is UV-responsive and
   also enables the conjugation of another polymer block via an
   azide-alkyne ``click{''} cydoaddition, amphiphilic self-immolative block
   copolymers are also prepared. These block copolymers self-assemble into
   micelles in aqueous solution, and their poly(ethyl glyoxylate) blocks
   rapidly depolymerize upon UV irradiation. Overall, these strategies are
   expected to greatly expand the utility of self-immolative polymers by
   providing access for the first time to self-immolative polymers with
   tunable properties that can be readily obtained from simple monomers and
   can be designed to depolymerize into nontoxic products.}},

Volume = {{276}},
Pages = {{323-331}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the changes in thermal conductivity, temperature, and
   unconfined compressive strength of gold tailings and fly ash mixtures
   during the curing period of 5 days. The microfabric of the cured
   mixtures was investigated with mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). The
   mixture samples were prepared at their maximum dry unit weight and
   optimum moisture content. Effect of adding fly ash to gold tailings
   (i.e., 0, 20, and 40\% of the dry weight of tailings) was examined, and
   a comparison was made on samples prepared at the same fly ash content by
   replacing gold tailings with humic acid (i.e., gold tailings and humic
   acid ratios of 100:0, 90:10, and 80:20 by weight) or by varying pore
   fluid chemistry (i.e., water and salt solutions of 1 M NaCl and CaCl2).
   The results show that the initial thermal conductivity of the samples is
   sensitive to the mixture proportion and a declination in the thermal
   conductivity is observed due to hydration of fly ash and evaporation.
   Inclusion of fly ash and salts into gold tailings improves the
   unconfined compressive strength but the presence of humic acid in
   samples leads to the decrease of the strength. MIP results reveal the
   pore structure changes associated with the packing states of the samples
   that reflect the influential factors considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Two-stage concrete (TSC), also known as preplaced aggregate concrete, is
   a special type of concrete that is produced using a unique procedure
   which differs from that of conventional concrete. In TSC, coarse
   aggregate particles are first placed in the formwork and voids between
   them are subsequently injected with a special cementitious mixture. TSC
   has been successfully used in many applications, such as underwater
   construction, casting concrete sections congested with reinforcement and
   concrete repair. This paper provides a critical overview of TSC,
   including its development history, material specifications, engineering
   properties and long term-performance. This critical overview of the TSC
   state-of-the-art should enhance the understanding of its behaviour, thus
   paving the way for wider implementation of its use in today's concrete

Title = {{Selective adsorption of thiophene using a HIPZD additive in FCC}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Pages = {{71-87}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This study considers the application of a PDVSA Intevep additive (HIPZD)
   and a FCC Y zeolite commercial catalyst to reduce sulfur species in
   gasoline range hydrocarbons. The HIPZD additive and the FCC catalyst are
   blended and contacted with thiophene or benzothiophene and 1,3,5
   trimethylbenzene (TMB) in a CREC Fluidized Riser Simulator.
   Temperatures, partial pressures, reaction times and C/O (catalyst/oil)
   ratios selected for the experiments, are representative of FCC
   industrial units. While it is shown that as expected, the proposed
   additive is not able to selectively remove benzothiophene species, it is
   proven that HIPZD displays excellent performance for thiophene removal
   in gasoline aromatic hydrocarbon media. This selective thiophene
   adsorption can be managed with minimal thiophene alkylation and gasoline
   catalytic cracking. It is found in this respect, that thiophene
   selective adsorption on the HIPZD occurs for reaction times smaller than
   7 s. It is also observed that a 10 wt\% HIPZD and 90 wt\% FCC catalyst
   blend provides both a good and a practical manner to implement the HIPZD
   additive in FCC. Thus, on the basis of the results reported, it is
   anticipated that the HIPZD additive can provide valuable ``in situ''
   thiophene selective adsorption for the removal of thiophene under
   typical FCC riser operation conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   VOx/gamma- Al2O3 catalyst}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{120-140}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{This study contributes with a new vanadium oxide catalyst supported on
   gamma-Al(2)O3 especially designed for propane ODH under oxygen-free
   conditions. This catalyst is prepared with different vanadium loadings
   (5-10 wt.\%) via wet impregnation using ammonium metavanadate as a
   precursor. The prepared catalyst is characterized using BET surface
   area, H-2-TPR, NH3-TPD, O-2 chemisorption, Laser Raman Spectroscopy,
   pyridine FT-IR and XRD. The characterization of the supported
   VOx/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts by Raman spectroscopy reveals that monomeric
   VOx species are dominant at low vanadium loadings. Polymeric VOx species
   increase, however, at higher loadings until surface monolayer coverage
   is reached. Pyridine FTIR and NH3-TPD reveal that this VOx/gamma-Al2O3
   catalyst shows progressive acidity reduction with vanadium addition
   while compared to bare alumina. This controlled acidity reduction is
   achieved with a higher Bronsted acidity. The performance of the prepared
   catalysts is established having in mind possible industrial propane ODH
   applications. This is accomplished using a CREC Fluidized Bed Riser
   Simulator at 475-550 degrees C and at atmospheric pressure. Successive
   propane injections for ODH experiments (without catalyst regeneration)
   over a partially reduced catalyst show that the prepared catalysts
   display promising propane conversions (11.73-15.11\%) and propylene
   selectivities (67.65-85.89\%) at 475-550 degrees C. Propylene
   selectivity increases while that of COx decreases as the degree of
   catalyst reduction augments with consecutive propane injections. Under
   such oxygen-free conditions oxygen from the catalyst lattice is consumed
   via propane ODH. This demonstrates that a controlled degree of catalyst
   reduction is very desirable for high propylene selectivity in ODH. (C)

   fuel storage environment}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{240-247}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Biodiesel usage as in the environment as an alternative to fossil fuels
   or in biodiesel/diesel blends requires an understanding of the potential
   effects of its addition on the integrity of the infrastructure used for
   fuel storage. Polyethylene is one of the most common materials for the
   manufacturing of fuel storage tanks. Due to the insoluble nature of
   polyethylene, biofilm formation on its surface boosted by the presence
   of biodiesel could potentially contribute to its degradation. In this
   study, the effect of biodiesel concentration on biofilm development on
   linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), cross-linked polyethylene
   (XLPE) and a bilayer construction of linear-low density polyethylene and
   polyamide-11 (LLDPE/PA) was studied. Polymers were exposed to
   biodeterioration conditions during a 200 days in a simulated fuel
   storage tank. Excess of water and blends of diesel/biodiesel (0\%, 25\%,
   50\%, 75\% and 100\%) as a carbon source were employed to simulate the
   conditions found in the bottom of fuel storage tanks, where the presence
   of water is common as result of condensation. Microorganisms obtained
   from a diesel storage facility were used as inoculum. Biofilm growth and
   viability were quantified by a crystal violet assay and hydrolysis of
   fluorescein diacetate, respectively. Results show that although there is
   greater accumulation of biofilm material in pure biodiesel samples
   metabolic activity is higher in pure diesel ones. Microbial community
   structure and composition were studied by community level physiological
   profiling (CLPP) and 16s rDNA sequencing. Principal component analysis
   of CLPP revealed that both biodiesel concentration and polymer type
   affect the structure and metabolic capabilities of biofilm communities.
   These results were confirmed by comparison of libraries of 16s rDNA for
   different polymers growing at different biodiesel concentrations. Genera
   isolated in the biofilm were characterized either by their ability to
   degrade hydrocarbons, produce surfactants or degrade polyethylene or
   polyamide-11. The results of this study may lead to a better
   understanding of microbial effects on storage materials for
   diesel/biodiesel blends. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Flexoelectric effect on the electroelastic responses and vibrational
   behaviors of a piezoelectric nanoplate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Flexoelectricity, referring to the coupling between electric
   polarization and strain gradients, is a universal effect in all
   dielectrics and may become manifest at the nano-scale. The current work
   aims to investigate the flexoelectric effect on the electroelastic
   responses and the free vibrational behaviors of a piezoelectric
   nanoplate (PNP). Based on the conventional Kirchhoff plate theory and
   the extended linear piezoelectricity theory, the governing equation and
   the boundary conditions of a clamped PNP with the consideration of the
   static bulk flexoelectricity are derived. Ritz approximate solutions of
   the electroelastic fields and the resonant frequencies demonstrate the
   size-dependency of the flexoelectric effect, which is more prominent for
   thinner plates with smaller thickness as expected. Simulation results
   also indicate that the influence of the flexoelectricity upon the
   electroelastic fields of a bending PNP and the transverse vibration of
   the PNP is sensitive to the plate in-plane dimensions as well as the
   applied electric voltage. Moreover, it is suggested that the possible
   frequency tuning of a PNP resonator by adjusting applied electrical load
   warrants the consideration of the flexoelectricity. This study is
   claimed to provide a theoretical predicition on the trend of the
   flexoelectric effect upon the static and dynamic behaviors of a bending
   PNP, thus sheding light on understanding the underlying physics of
   electromechanical coupling at the nano-scale to some extent. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The problem of stability of haptic interaction with virtual objects is
   addressed, where the force reflection is implemented using the
   projection-based principle. A stability condition is derived that
   generalizes some previously known results to the case of
   projection-based force reflection. It demonstrates that, in this case,
   an additional design parameter is brought in that allows to increase the
   admissible stiffness of the virtual wall and decrease the update rate
   without changing the damping of the haptic device. A passivity based
   interpretation of the result is given in terms of interconnection of
   generalized passive systems where the excess of passivity of haptic
   device compensates the shortage of passivity of the virtual wall. In
   particular, it is shown that the projection-based force reflection
   allows to arbitrarily increase the excess of passivity of the haptic
   device without changing its physical damping.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes partial turbulence simulation and validation of the
   aerodynamic pressures on building models for an open-jet small-scale
   12-Fan Wall of Wind (WOW) facility against their counterparts in a
   boundary-layer wind tunnel. The wind characteristics pertained to the
   Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) mean wind speed profile and turbulent
   fluctuations simulated in the facility. Both in the wind tunnel and the
   small-scale 12-Fan WOW these wind characteristics were produced by using
   spires and roughness elements. It is emphasized in the paper that proper
   spectral density parameterization is required to simulate turbulent
   fluctuations correctly. Partial turbulence considering only high
   frequency part of the turbulent fluctuations spectrum was simulated in
   the small-scale 12-Fan WOW. For the validation of aerodynamic pressures
   a series of tests were conducted in both wind tunnel and the small-scale
   12-fan WOW facilities on low-rise buildings including two gable roof and
   two hip roof buildings with two different slopes. Testing was performed
   to investigate the mean and peak pressure coefficients at various
   locations on the roofs including near the corners, edges, ridge and hip
   lines. The pressure coefficients comparisons showed that open-jet
   testing facility flows with partial simulations of ABL spectrum are
   capable of inducing pressures on low-rise buildings that reasonably
   agree with their boundary-layer wind tunnel counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{Physical-layer security is emerging as a promising paradigm of securing
   wireless communications against eavesdropping between legitimate users,
   when the main link spanning from a source to a destination has better
   propagation conditions than the wiretap link from a source to an
   eavesdropper. In this paper, we identify and analyze the tradeoffs
   between the security and reliability of wireless communications in the
   presence of eavesdropping attacks. Typically, the reliability of the
   main link can be improved by increasing the source's transmit power (or
   decreasing its date rate) to reduce the outage probability (OP), which
   unfortunately increases the risk that an eavesdropper succeeds in
   intercepting the source message through the wiretap link, since the OP
   of the wiretap link also decreases when a higher transmit power (or
   lower date rate) is used. We characterize the security-reliability
   tradeoffs (SRT) of conventional direct transmission from the source to
   the destination in the presence of an eavesdropper, where the security
   and reliability are quantified in terms of the intercept probability
   (IP) by an eavesdropper and the OP experienced at the destination,
   respectively. To improve the SRT, we then propose opportunistic relay
   selection (ORS) and quantify the attainable SRT improvement upon
   increasing the number of relays. It is shown that given the maximum
   tolerable IP, the OP of our ORS scheme approaches zero for N ->
   infinity, where N is the number of relays. Conversely, given the maximum
   tolerable OP, the IP of our ORS scheme tends to zero for N -> infinity.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral nerve blood flow (NBF) does not autoregulate but, instead,
   responds passively to changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP). How this
   relationship is impacted by insulin-treated experimental diabetes (ITED)
   is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that ITED will reduce NBF across a
   range of MAP in Sprague Dawley rats. Following 10 weeks of control or
   ITED conditions, conscious MAP (tail-cuff) was measured, and under
   anaesthesia, the MAP (carotid artery catheter, pressure transducer) and
   NBF (Doppler ultrasound, 40 MHz) responses to sodium nitroprusside (60
   mu g/kg) and phenylephrine (12 mu g/kg) infusion were recorded
   (regression equations for MAP vs NBF were created for each rodent).
   Thereafter, motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and nerve
   vascularization (haematoxylin and eosin stain) were determined.
   Conscious MAP was higher and MNCV was lower in the ITED group (p <
   0.01). In response to drug infusions, the Delta MAP and Delta NBF were
   similar between groups (p >= 0.18). Estimated conscious NBF (based on
   substituting conscious MAP values into each individual regression
   equation) was greater in the ITED group (p < 0.01). Sciatic nerve
   vascularization was similar between groups (p >= 0.50). In contrast to
   the hypothesis, NBF was not reduced across a range of MAP. In spite of
   increased estimated conscious NBF values, MNCV was reduced in rats with
   ITED.}},

Abstract = {{The advancement of angular domain imaging in mesoscopic reflectance
   multispectral imaging is reported. The key component is an angular
   filter array that performs the angular filtration of the back-scattered
   photons and generates image contrast due to the variances in tissue
   optical properties. The proposed modality enables multispectral imaging
   of subsurface features for samples too thick for transillumination
   angular domain spectroscopic imaging (ADSI) approaches. The validation
   was carried out with tissue-mimicking phantoms with multiple absorptive
   features embedded below the surface. Multispectral images in the range
   of 666 to 888 nm clearly revealed the location of the features with the
   background scattering levels up to 20 cm(-1). The shape of the features
   was recoverable at depths of up to three to four times the transport
   mean free path. The spatial resolution was < 1 mm and the field-of-view
   was larger than 2.5 cm x 3.0 cm. Furthermore, the attenuation spectra of
   measured absorptive features were successfully extracted. Target
   detectability and imaging quality with different background scattering
   levels, target depths, and illumination focal depths were discussed, as
   well as the capability of ADSI in reflectance optical mesoscopic imaging

Abstract = {{A series of micro-nano-structure BiOBr thin films were prepared at a low
   temperature by the alcoholysis-coating method using BiBr3 as precursor.
   The as-prepared films were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction,
   scanning electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area.
   The obtained results indicated that micro-nano-structure tetragonal
   BiOBr films with different intensity ratios of (110) to (102)
   characteristic peaks could be synthesized through controlling the
   reaction temperature and the calcination temperatures. Furthermore, the
   photocatalytic activities of BiOBr thin films with different preparation
   conditions have been evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange (MO)
   under UV light irradiation, suggesting that the photocatalytic activity
   should be closely related to the solvent, the alcoholysis reaction
   temperature, and the calcining temperature. The best photocatalytic
   degradation efficiency of MO for BiOBr thin films reaches 98.5\% under
   2.5 h UV irradiation. The BiOBr thin films display excellent stability
   and their photocatalytic activity still remains above 90\% after being
   used five times. The main reasons for the higher photocatalytic activity
   of micro-nano-structure BiOBr microspheres have been investigated. In
   addition, the possible formation mechanism of BiOBr thin films with
   micro-nano-structure and excellent photocatalytic activity was proposed
   and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   its modified forms was done by infra-red, X-ray diffraction, scanning
   electron microscope and X-ray fluorescence studies. The specific surface
   area of HML and MGML was 3.34 and 3.97 times greater than that of NL
   (11.72 m(2)/g). Improved chemical composition of Magnesium (as oxide) to
   15.6\% by 2 M MgCl2 solution was ascertained through XRF results. The
   fluoride levels were reduced (within the safe limit of WHO: 0.5-1.5
   mg/L-1) to 0.39 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L and 0.075 mg/L respectively using natural
   (NL), H2O2 (HML) and MgCl2 - modified LECA (MGML) at a pH of 6.0 and
   initial fluoride concentration of 10 g/L for an equilibrium time of 120
   mm. The sorption capacities of 8.53 mg/g, 17.83 mg/g and 23.86 mg/g were
   determined for NL, HML and MGML respectively. Validation of kinetic and
   isotherm models was checked for the present fluoride sorption dynamics.
   The thermodynamic data revealed that the present fluoride sorption was
   spontaneous, exothermic and ends up with decrease in randomness.
   Prediction of fluoride sorption mechanism for onto natural and modified
   LECA forms was also elucidated. Chloride and sulfate were the highly
   competing species against fluoride sorption. Regeneration efficiency of
   the spent LECA materials prompted the ability of MGML even after five
   cycles of adsorption-regeneration processes. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute

Abstract = {{Sludge is a semi-solid residue produced from wastewater treatment
   processes. It contains biodegradable and recalcitrant organic compounds,
   as well as pathogens, heavy metals, and other inorganic constituents.
   Sludge can also be considered a source of nutrients and energy, which
   could be recovered using economically viable approaches. In the present
   paper, several commonly used sludge treatment processes including land
   application, composting, landfilling, anaerobic digestion, and
   combustion are reviewed, along with their potentials for energy and
   product recovery. In addition, some innovative thermo-chemical
   techniques in pyrolysis, gasification, liquefaction, and wet oxidation
   are briefly introduced. Finally, a brief summary of selected published
   works on the life cycle assessment of a variety of sludge treatment and
   end-use scenarios is presented in order to better understand the overall
   energy balance and environmental burdens associated with each sludge
   treatment pathway. In all scenarios investigated, the reuse of bioenergy
   and by-products has been shown to be of crucial importance in enhancing
   the overall energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint.}},

Abstract = {{C-4 photosynthesis evolved independently numerous times, probably in
   response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but also to high
   temperatures and aridity, which enhance water losses through
   transpiration. Here, the environmental factors controlling stomatal
   behaviour of leaf-level carbon and water exchange were examined across
   the evolutionary continuum from C-3 to C-4 photosynthesis at current
   (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and low (280 mu mol mol(-1)) atmospheric CO2
   conditions. To this aim, a stomatal optimization model was further
   developed to describe the evolutionary continuum from C-3 to C-4 species
   within a unified framework. Data on C-3, three categories of C-3-C-4
   intermediates, and C-4 Flaveria species were used to parameterize the
   stomatal model, including parameters for the marginal water use
   efficiency and the efficiency of the CO2-concentrating mechanism (or C-4
   pump); these two parameters are interpreted as traits reflecting the
   stomatal and photosynthetic adjustments during the C-3 to C-4
   transformation. Neither the marginal water use efficiency nor the C-4
   pump strength changed significantly from C-3 to early C-3-C-4
   intermediate stages, but both traits significantly increased between
   early C-3-C-4 intermediates and the C-4-like intermediates with an
   operational C-4 cycle. At low CO2, net photosynthetic rates showed
   continuous increases from a C-3 state, across the intermediates and
   towards C-4 photosynthesis, but only C-4-like intermediates and C-4
   species (with an operational C-4 cycle) had higher water use
   efficiencies than C-3 Flaveria. The results demonstrate that both the
   marginal water use efficiency and the C-4 pump strength increase in C-4
   Flaveria to improve their photosynthesis and water use efficiency
   compared with C-3 species. These findings emphasize that the advantage
   of the early intermediate stages is predominantly carbon based, not
   water related.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine whether bidirectional flow

   right panel (Fig. 1; rat 2), there appears to be three distinct vessels,
   reflective of non-pulsatile negative flow (D), and pulsatile positive
   (E) and negative (F) flows. These data confirm the presence of

Abstract = {{Applications of wireless technologies in nuclear power plants (NPPs), in
   particular for monitoring purposes, have been gaining popularity
   recently. It has been shown that wireless technologies can offer several
   advantages over wired solutions. However, many challenges need to be
   overcome before widespread adoption of wireless systems in nuclear
   industries. This paper has extended the existing work in this area and
   has developed a systematic procedure to deploy a wireless sensor network
   within a NPP containment. The developed scheme deals with the following
   challenges explicitly: (a) restrictions on the peak transmission power
   of the wireless sensor modules, (b) workaround of large concrete and
   metal structures, and (c) avoidance of locations with high radiation
   levels. Starting from the sensor locations dictated by the variables to
   be measured, the scheme determines the positions of the wireless
   relaying modules in a three-dimensional containment space to ensure
   reliable data communication. The results from case studies under
   realistic NPP containment conditions demonstrate the practical value of
   the proposed solution.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Characterization of the biomechanical properties of the human
   eye has a number of potential utilities. One novel purpose is to provide
   the basis for development of suitable tissue-mimicking material. The
   purpose of this study was to determine the indentation and needle
   insertion characteristics on human eye globes and tissue strips.
   Methods An indenter assessed the elastic response of human eye globes
   and tissue strips under increasing compressive loads. Needle insertion
   determined the force (N) needed to penetrate various areas of the eye
   wall.
   Results The results demonstrated that globes underwent slightly greater
   indentation at the midline than at the central cornea, and corneal
   strips indented twofold more than scleral strips, although neither
   difference was significant (P = 0.400 and P = 0.100, respectively).
   Significant differences were observed among various areas of needle
   insertion (P<0.001). Needle insertion through the anterior sclera
   (adjacent to the limbus) and posterior sclera (adjacent to the optic
   nerve) required the greatest amount of force (0.954 and 1.005 N,
   respectively). The force required to penetrate the central cornea (0.518
   N) was significantly lower than all other areas except the midline
   sclera (0.700N)
   Conclusion These data form the basis for further research into the
   development of a tissue-mimicking human eye construct with potential
   utility as a model for use in ophthalmology research and surgical
   teaching.}},

Abstract = {{Waveguide Evanescent Field Scattering (WEFS) microscopy is introduced as
   a new and simple tool for label-free, high contrast imaging of bacteria
   and bacteria sensors. Bacterial microcolonies and single bacteria were
   discriminated both by their bright field images and by their evanescent
   scattering intensity. By comparing bright field images with WEFS images,
   the proportion of planktonic : sessile (i.e., `floating' : attached)
   bacteria were measured. Bacteria were irradiated with UV light, which
   limited their biofilm forming capability. A quantitative decrease in
   attachment of individual, sessile bacteria and in attached, microcolony

Abstract = {{In vascular tissue engineering, three-dimensional (3D) biodegradable
   scaffolds play an important role in guiding seeded cells to produce
   matrix components by providing both mechanical and biological cues. The
   objective of this work was to fabricate fibrous biodegradable scaffolds
   from novel poly(ester amide) s (PEAs) derived from L-alanine by
   electrospinning, and to study the degradation profiles and its
   suitability for vascular tissue-engineering applications. In view of
   this, L-alanine-derived PEAs (dissolved in chloroform) were electrospun
   together with 18-30\% w/w polycaprolactone (PCL) to improve
   spinnability. A minimum of 18\% was required to effectively electrospin
   the solution while the upper value was set in order to limit the
   influence of PCL on the electrospun PEA fibres. Electrospun fibre mats
   with average fibre diameters of similar to 0.4 mu m were obtained. Both
   fibre diameter and porosity increased with increasing PEA content and
   solution concentration. The degradation of a PEA fibre mat over a period
   of 28 days indicated that mass loss kinetics was linear, and no change
   inmolecular weight was found, suggesting a surface erosion mechanism.
   Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) cultured for 7 days
   on the fibre mats showed significantly higher viability (p<0.0001),
   suggesting that PEA scaffolds provided a better microenvironment for
   seeded cells compared with control PCL fibre mats of similar fibre
   diameter and porosity. Furthermore, elastin expression on the PEA fibre
   mats was significantly higher than the pure PEA discs and pure PCL fibre
   mat controls (p<0.0001). These novel biodegradable PEA fibrous scaffolds
   could be strong candidates for vascular tissue-engineering applications.

Abstract = {{The present study explored the problem-solving strategies of high-and

   task to determine whether differences in strategies contribute to
   differences in task performance. The results of this study provide
   further insights into the processing commonalities and differences among
   learners beyond the classification of spatial visualization ability
   alone, and help elucidate what, if anything, high-and low-spatial
   visualization ability learners do differently while solving spatial
   anatomy task problems. Forty-two students completed a standardized
   measure of spatial visualization ability, a novel spatial anatomy task,
   and a questionnaire involving personal self-analysis of the processes
   and strategies used while performing the spatial anatomy task. Strategy
   reports revealed that there were different ways students approached
   answering the spatial anatomy task problems. However, chi-square test
   analyses established that differences in problem-solving strategies did
   not contribute to differences in task performance. Therefore, underlying
   spatial visualization ability is the main source of variation in spatial
   anatomy task performance, irrespective of strategy. In addition to
   scoring higher and spending less time on the anatomy task, participants
   with high spatial visualization ability were also more accurate when
   solving the task problems. (C) 2013 American Association of Anatomists.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Distal humeral hemiarthroplasty is a treatment option for
   distal humeral fractures, nonunions, and avascular necrosis. The
   biomechanical effects, however, have not been reported. The purpose of
   this in vitro study was to quantify the effects of hemiarthroplasty and
   implant size on elbow joint kinematics.
   Methods: Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric arms were mounted in an in vitro
   motion simulator. An electromagnetic tracking system quantified elbow
   kinematics. A custom distal humeral stem was implanted by use of
   navigation, and 3 humeral articular spools were evaluated: optimally
   sized, undersized, and oversized. Statistical analysis was performed
   with repeated-measures analysis of variance.
   Results: Distal humeral hemiarthroplasty altered elbow kinematics,
   regardless of implant size. In the valgus position, the optimally sized
   implant resulted in a mean increase in valgus angulation of 3 degrees
   +/- 1 degrees (P =.003) as compared with the osteotomy control. In the
   varus position, the optimal and undersized implants both resulted in
   significant increases in varus angulation: 3 degrees +/- 1 degrees (P
   =.01) and 3 degrees +/- 1 degrees (P =.001), respectively. The
   undersized implant had the greatest alteration in kinematics, whereas
   the oversized implant best reproduced native elbow kinematics.
   Conclusion: This study showed a small but significant alteration in
   elbow joint kinematics with placement of a distal humeral
   hemiarthroplasty implant, regardless of implant size. This could be due
   to errors in implant positioning and/or differences in the shape of the
   humeral implant relative to the native elbow. These changes in joint
   tracking may cause abnormal articular contact and loading, which may
   result in pain and cartilage degeneration over time. (C) 2014 Journal of

Abstract = {{Biofuels from algae are considered a technically viable energy source

   operational points in terms of target temperature and algae
   concentration for high lipid and glucose yields. Within the range
   covered by these experiments the best conditions for high bio-crude
   yield are temperatures higher than 174 degrees C and low biomass
   concentrations (<5 g/L). For high glucose yield there are two suitable
   operational ranges, either low temperatures (<105 degrees C) and low
   biomass concentrations (<4 g/L); or low temperatures (<105 degrees C)
   and high biomass concentrations (<110 g/L). High pressure steaming is a
   good hydrothermal treatment for lipid recovery and does not
   significantly change the fatty acids profile for the range of

Abstract = {{This study assesses the impact of organic loading rate on biohydrogen
   production from glucose in an up-flow anaerobic packed bed reactor
   (UAnPBR). Two mesophilic UAPBRs (UAnPBR1 and 2) were tested at organic
   loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 6.5 to 51.4 gCOD L (1) d (1). To
   overcome biomass washout, design modifications were made in the UAnPBR2
   to include a settling zone to capture the detached biomass. The design
   modifications in UAnPBR2 increased the average hydrogen yield from 0.98
   to 2.0 mol-H-2 mol (1)-glucose at an OLR of 25.7 gCOD L (1) d (1).
   Although, a maximum hydrogen production rate of 23.4 +/- 0.9 L H-2 L (1)
   d (1) was achieved in the UAnPBR2 at an OLR of 51.4 gCOD L (1) d (1),
   the hydrogen yield dropped by 50\% to around 1 mol-H-2 mol (1)-glucose.
   The microbiological analysis (PCR/DGGE) showed that the biohydrogen
   production was due to the presence of the hydrogen and volatile acid
   producers such as Clostridium beijerinckii, Clostridium butyricum,
   Megasphaera elsdenii and Propionispira arboris. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The secure hash algorithm (SHA)-3 has been selected in 2012 and will be
   used to provide security to any application which requires hashing,
   pseudo-random number generation, and integrity checking. This algorithm
   has been selected based on various benchmarks such as security,
   performance, and complexity. In this paper, in order to provide reliable
   architectures for this algorithm, an efficient concurrent error
   detection scheme for the selected SHA-3 algorithm, i.e., Keccak, is
   proposed. To the best of our knowledge, effective countermeasures for
   potential reliability issues in the hardware implementations of this
   algorithm have not been presented to date. In proposing the error
   detection approach, our aim is to have acceptable complexity and
   performance overheads while maintaining high error coverage. In this
   regard, we present a low-complexity recomputing with rotated
   operands-based scheme which is a step-forward toward reducing the
   hardware overhead of the proposed error detection approach. Moreover, we
   perform injection-based fault simulations and show that the error
   coverage of close to 100\% is derived. Furthermore, we have designed the
   proposed scheme and through ASIC analysis, it is shown that acceptable
   complexity and performance overheads are reached. By utilizing the

Abstract = {{The loss of haptic information that results from the reduced-access
   conditions present in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) may compromise
   the safety of the procedures. This limitation must be overcome through
   training. However, current methods for determining the skill level of
   trainees do not measure critical elements of skill attainment. This
   study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of force information for the
   assessment of skill during MIS.
   To achieve the study goal, experiments were performed using a set of
   sensorized instruments capable of measuring instrument position and
   tissue interaction forces. Several force-based metrics were developed as
   well as metrics that combine force and position information.
   The results show that experience level has a strong correlation with the
   new force-based metrics presented in this article. In particular, the
   integral and the derivative of the forces or the metrics that combine
   force and position provide the strongest correlations.
   This study showed that force-based metrics are better indications of
   performance than metrics based on task completion time or position
   information alone. The proposed metrics can be automatically computed,
   are completely objective, and measure important aspects of performance.}},

Abstract = {{Guyanaite, naturally occurring beta-CrOOH, has been identified in a
   xenolith of Cr-rich omphacitite from the Moses Rock diatreme in the
   Navajo Volcanic Field of the southwestern United States. It occurs as
   the dominant phase in small clusters of accessory minerals, intergrown
   with kosmochlor-rich omphacite, zincian chromite, eskolaite, and
   carmichaelite. The assemblage is interpreted as the result of
   metasomatism of chromite-bearing serpentinite by slab-derived fluids
   during subduction of the Farallon Plate in Laramide time. At the time of
   entrainment of the xenolith, the rock was undergoing prograde
   metamorphism, with guyanaite dehydrating to eskolaite plus water. This
   reaction, and the coeval dehydration of the inferred accompanying host
   serpentinites (which would have been much more volumetrically
   significant), provided water for hydration of the subcontinental upper
   mantle, contributing to uplift of the Colorado Plateau. Recognition of
   guyanaite as a component of a subducted slab supports recent proposals,
   based on laboratory experiments, that high-pressure polymorphs of other
   common crustal oxy-hydroxide minerals such as boehmite and goethite
   (i.e., high-pressure delta-AlOOH and epsilon-FeOOH) can also transport
   and store water in the mantle.}},

Abstract = {{Acetone butanol ethanol (ABE) was produced from enzymatic-hydrolyzed
   corncobs by Clostridium saccharobutylicum DSM 13864. Pretreatment of

   without sediments removal for ABE fermentation. A solvent production of
   19.44 g L-1 with 12.27 g L-1 butanol was obtained from 55.22 g L-1
   sugars, resulting in an ABE yield of 350 g kg-1 and a production rate of
   0.54 g L-1 h(-1). A control experiment using 55.3 g L-1 mixed sugars
   resulted in an ABE production of 16.81 g L-1 with 10.26 g L-1 butanol,

Abstract = {{The chiral separation of the racemic mandelic acid ((R,S)-MA) by

   to obtain the complete separation region of the SMB operation. The
   influences of the switching time, loading, extract flow rate and column
   configuration on the SMB performance were also studied. The online
   monitoring system consisting of circular dichroism (CD) and UV detector
   in series was employed to measure the composition and purity of the
   extract and raffinate streams. Good agreement between the experimental
   data and model predictions proved the efficiency and reliability of SMB
   modelling and the Triangle theory in the design and operation of SMB
   chromatography. Experimental results show that purity and recovery at

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{35-52}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Laser polishing is presently regarded as one of the enabling
   technologies hoped to eventually replace the need for time-consuming and
   error-prone manual polishing operations which are often required by
   metallic surfaces. During laser polishing, a thin layer of material is
   being melted as a result of laser irradiation. Since molten metal is
   characterized by increased relocation capabilities, laser polishing is
   generally accompanied by a more or less significant decrease in the
   surface roughness. The primary objective of this study is to present a
   comprehensive snapshot of the advancements made over more than one
   decade with respect to theoretical and experimental investigation of
   laser polishing technology. However, in addition to the usual review of
   the state-of-the-art in the field, the study places an increased
   emphasis on the finishing performance of the process, defined through
   the perspective of pre- and postpolishing surface roughness. The
   implementation of this metric with strong practical implications has
   revealed that under appropriate process parameters, certain classes of
   metallic materials can reduce their average surface roughness by more
   than 80 \%, possibly to R (a) = 5 nm. Nonetheless, a more rigorous and
   fundamental understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms underlying laser
   polishing remains one of the currently unfulfilled premises toward a
   wider industrial adoption of the process.}},

Title = {{Evaluating four-dimensional time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography
   for monitoring DNAPL source zone remediation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{27-46}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Practical, non-invasive tools do not currently exist for mapping the
   remediation of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). Electrical
   resistivity tomography (ERT) exhibits significant potential but has not
   yet become a practitioner's tool due to challenges in interpreting the
   survey results at real sites. This study explores the effectiveness of
   recently developed four-dimensional (4D, i.e., 3D space plus time)
   time-lapse surface ERT to monitor DNAPL source zone remediation. A
   laboratory experiment demonstrated the approach for mapping a changing
   NAPL distribution over time. A recently developed DNAPL-ERT numerical
   model was then employed to independently simulate the experiment,
   providing confidence that the DNAPL-ERT model is a reliable tool for
   simulating real systems. The numerical model was then used to evaluate
   the potential for this approach at the field scale. Four DNAPL source
   zones, exhibiting a range of complexity, were initially simulated,
   followed by modeled time-lapse ERT monitoring of complete DNAPL
   remediation by enhanced dissolution. 4D ERT inversion provided estimates
   of the regions of the source zone experiencing mass reduction with time.
   Results show that 4D time-lapse ERT has significant potential to map
   both the outline and the center of mass of the evolving treated portion
   of the source zone to within a few meters in each direction. In
   addition, the technique can provide a reasonable, albeit conservative,
   estimate of the DNAPL volume remediated with time: 25\% underestimation
   in the upper 2 m and up to 50\% underestimation at late time between 2
   and 4 m depth. The technique is less reliable for identifying cleanup of
   DNAPL stringers outside the main DNAPL body. Overall, this study
   demonstrates that 4D time-lapse ERT has potential for mapping where and
   how quickly DNAPL mass changes in real time during site remediation. (C)

   force and moment coefficients on the ground mounted array decreased
   across panel rows as a result of sheltering effect from the neighboring
   upwind panels. The largest reduction of wind load coefficients was
   observed on the second row panels but the amount of reduction dropped
   quickly afterwards, becoming minimal after the fourth row. It was also
   observed that panels located in the outer array column could be
   subjected to relatively higher wind loads compared to panels located in
   the inner array columns. Increasing the lateral spacing between array
   columns was observed to have minimal effect on the force and moment
   coefficients. However, the wind load coefficients increased as the
   longitudinal spacing between panel rows was increased. The wind load
   coefficients on the roof mounted array decreased with increasing
   perimeter gap from the building edge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Yunmengshan metamorphic core complex in the middle part of the
   Yanshan Fold and Thrust Belt records crust extension processes of the
   eastern North China Craton during its peak destruction. Development of
   the metamorphic core complex was controlled by the generally
   NNE-striking Dashuiyu Shear Zone. The shear zone dips SE and becomes
   shallower NE-wards, leading to exposures of a ductile shear zone in the
   southern and middle parts and brittle faults in the northern part.
   Exposure structures, microstructures, and quartz C-axis fabrics indicate
   that the ductile shear zone belongs to an extensional shear zone with a
   top-to-the-SE shear sense. Deformation temperatures of 300-520 A degrees
   C suggest a mid-crustal origin for the ductile shear zone. A ductile
   deformation belt in the footwall of the shear zone is only as wide as
   1-3 km, indicating no widespread mid-crustal ductile flow in the region
   during the deformation. Zircon U-Pb dating of dykes and plutons as well
   as hornblende and biotite Ar-40/Ar-39 dating demonstrate that the
   metamorphic core complex originated at 135 Ma and experienced intense
   shearing of the Dashuiyu Shear Zone, development of the supradetachment
   basins, and synkinematic intrusion during 135-125 Ma. The metamorphic
   core complex was subjected to rapid exhumation during 125-114 Ma when
   the Dashuiyu Shear Zone suffered continuous activity and passive doming.
   The shear zone and its hanging wall were cut or replaced by a series of
   brittle faults when they were uplifted to a brittle regime, showing that
   exhumation took place in continuous extensional activities. The
   metamorphic core complex turned into slow exhumation in an extensional
   regime in the following latest Early Cretaceous. The evolution history
   suggests that the Yunmengshan metamorphic core complex was developed by
   the rolling-hinge model, a common formation mechanism for intraplate
   metamorphic core complexes in the North China Craton, under the
   continuous NW-SE extension during the Early Cretaceous (135-100 Ma).}},

Abstract = {{Recent increase in intensity and frequency of catastrophic hydrologic
   events is shown to be a major threat to the global economy. These major
   events have been strongly linked to climate change and are expected to
   become worse in the future. The intensity-duration-frequency (IDF)
   curves quantify the extreme precipitations which are commonly used in
   planning and design of hydraulic structures. Since it is expected that
   the trends in extreme precipitation events will alter in the future,
   this will impact the IDF curves and they will have to be updated. In
   this study we present a methodology based on equidistance quantile
   matching (EQM) for updating the IDF curves under climate change. The two
   main steps in the proposed methodology are: (i) spatial downscaling of
   the maximum daily precipitation values from the global climate model/s
   (GCM) data to each of the sub-daily maximums observed at a station under
   consideration; (ii) explicit description of the changes in the GCM data
   between the baseline period and the future period (temporal
   downscaling). The main advantage of the proposed method compared to the
   existing methods which only use the spatial downscaling/disaggregation
   methods at baseline period, is that the proposed methodology
   additionally incorporates the changes in the distributional
   characteristics of the GCM model between the baseline period and the
   projection period. In addition, the method is simple to adopt and
   computationally efficient. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed
   methodology we use: (i) Canadian GCM model CanESM2 and (ii) its
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for greenhouse gas
   concentration trajectories adopted by the IPCC for its Fifth Assessment
   Report (AR5) for the description of future conditions. The sub-daily
   annual maximum intensities are obtained for four stations in Canada
   located at London (Ontario), Hamilton (Ontario), Calgary (Alberta) and
   Vancouver (British Columbia). It is observed that the proposed approach
   is skillful in capturing and replicating the historical intensities and
   frequencies. The results indicated that for all RCP simulations
   considered in this study there is increase in precipitation intensities
   for all return periods. The relative increase in precipitation extremes
   is consistent with the RCP scenarios, i.e., the intensity of RCP-26 is
   lower than the RCP-45 which in-turn is lower than RCP-85. The
   quantile-based modeling without the temporal downscaling consistently
   underestimates the precipitation intensity when compared to the proposed
   method. The proposed method offers a valuable contribution to water
   resources planning and management of future extreme conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Fire safety of Reinforced Concrete (RC) columns is an important design
   aspect to ensure the overall integrity of structures during fire events.
   Currently, fire ratings of RC sections are achieved using prescriptive
   methods. As new codes are moving towards performance based design,
   practitioners are in need of rational design tools to assess the
   capacity of heated sections. To construct the axial force-moment
   interaction diagram of a RC section using existing numerical methods,
   high computation demand and knowledge of heat transfer and stress
   analysis are required. This paper presents the derivation of a set of
   formulas that can be used to estimate the average temperature
   distribution within the concrete section and the corresponding internal
   forces. The utilization of these formulas to construct interaction
   diagrams of fire-exposed RC sections is then explained. The proposed
   formulas are validated by comparing their predictions with experimental
   and analytical results by others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) near-infrared (NIR) methods have been
   proposed for bedside monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF). These
   methods have primarily focused on qualitative approaches since scalp
   contamination hinders quantification. In this study, we demonstrate that
   accurate CBF measurements can be obtained by analyzing multi-distance
   time-resolved DCE data with a combined kinetic deconvolution optical
   reconstruction (KDOR) method. Multi-distance time-resolved DCE-NIR
   measurements were made in adult pigs (n = 8) during normocapnia,
   hypocapnia and ischemia. The KDOR method was used to calculate CBF from
   the DCE-NIR measurements. For validation, CBF was measured independently
   by CT under each condition. The mean CBF difference between the
   techniques was - 1.7 mL/100 g/min with 95\% confidence intervals of 16.3
   and 12.9 mL/100 g/min; group regression analysis revealed a strong
   agreement between the two techniques (slope = 1.06 +/- 0.08, y-intercept
   = -4.37 +/- 4.33 mL/100 g/min, p < 0.001). The results of an error
   analysis suggest that little a priori information is needed to recover
   CBF, due to the robustness of the analytical method and the ability of
   time-resolved NIR to directly characterize the optical properties of the
   extracerebral tissue (where model mismatch is deleterious). The findings
   of this study suggest that the DCE-NIR approach presented is a minimally
   invasive and portable means of determining absolute hemodynamics in
   neurocritical care patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed study on the hydrodynamics of liquid-solid circulating
   fluidized bed (LSCFB) reactors is crucial in the efficient design and

   developed to simulate the flow field in a LSCFB riser. The model is
   based on Eulerian-Eulerian approach incorporating the kinetic theory of
   granular flow. The predicted results agree well with our earlier
   experimental data. Furthermore, it is found that the dispersed k-epsilon
   multiphase turbulence model is more accurate and computationally
   efficient than other k-epsilon multiphase turbulence models. Also, the
   model predicts the residence time of both liquid and solid phases in the
   riser by using a Pulse technique. Finally, the proposed CFD model is
   used to investigate the effects of the liquid stream velocity and the
   solids circulation rate on the performance of the LSCFB. It is
   demonstrated that the proposed CFD model can be a robust tool for the
   scale-up and design of industrial LSCFB reactors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A new zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) reduction method for

Abstract = {{The most common device for control of tall buildings under wind loads is
   the tuned mass damper (TMD). However, during their lifetimes, high-rise
   and slender buildings may experience natural frequency changes under
   wind speed, ambient temperatures and relative humidity variations, among
   other factors, which make the TMD design challenging. In this paper, a
   proposed approach for the design of robust TMDs is presented and
   investigated. The approach accounts for structural uncertainties,
   optimization objectives and input excitation (wind or earthquake). For
   the use of TMDs in buildings, practical design parameters can be
   different from the optimum ones. Nevertheless, predetermined optimal
   parameters for a primary structure with uncertainties are useful to
   attain design robustness. To illustrate the applicability of the
   proposed approach, an example of a very slender building with uncertain
   natural frequencies is presented. The building represents a case study
   of an engineered design that is instructive. Basically, due to its
   geometry, the building behaves differently in one lateral direction
   (cantilever building) than the other (shear building). The proposed
   approach shows its robustness and effectiveness in reducing the response
   of tall buildings under multidirectional wind loads. In addition,
   linear-quadratic Gaussian and fuzzy logic controllers enhanced the
   performance of the TMD. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   arterial vasodilation through a nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS)
   mechanism. Experimental diabetes reduces vasa nervorum NO reactivity.
   Studies investigating hyperglycemia and nerve arterial vasodilation
   typically omit insulin treatment and use sedentary rats resulting in
   severe hyperglycemia. We tested the hypotheses that 1) insulin-treated
   experimental diabetes and inactivity (DS rats) will attenuate
   insulinmediated nerve arterial vasodilation, and 2) deficits in
   vasodilation in DS rats will be overcome by concurrent exercise training
   (DX rats; 75-85\% V-O2 (max), 1 h/day, 5 days/wk, for 10 wk). The
   baseline index of vascular conductance values (VCi = nerve blood flow
   velocity/mean arterial blood pressure) were similar (P >= 0.68), but
   peak VCi and the area under the curve (AUCi) for the VCi during a
   euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC; 10 mU center dot kg(-1)center
   dot min(-1)) were lower in DS rats versus control sedentary (CS) rats
   and DX rats (P <= 0.01). Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was
   lower in DS rats versus CS rats and DX rats (P <= 0.01). When compared
   with DS rats, DX rats expressed greater nerve endothelial NOS (eNOS)
   protein content (P = 0.04). In a separate analysis, we examined the
   impact of diabetes in exercise-trained rats alone. When compared with
   exercise-trained control rats (CX), DX rats had a lower AUCi during the
   EHC, lower MNCV values, and lower sciatic nerve eNOS protein content (P
   <= 0.03). Therefore, vasa nervorum and motor nerve function are impaired
   in DS rats. Such deficits in rats with diabetes can be overcome by
   concurrent exercise training. However, in exercise-trained rats (CX and
   DX groups), moderate hyperglycemia lowers vasa nervorum and nerve
   function.}},

Abstract = {{A new continuous-flow reactor was designed for the conversion of
   glycerol to solketal, an oxygenated fuel additive, through ketalization
   with acetone. Six heterogeneous catalysts were investigated with respect
   to their catalytic activity and stability in a flow reactor. The acidity
   of the catalysts positively influences the catalyst's activity. Among
   all the solid acid catalysts tested, the maximum solketal yield from
   experiments at 40 degrees C, 600 psi and WHSV of 4 h(-1) attained 73\%
   and 88\% at the acetone/glycerol molar ratio of 2.0 and 6.0,
   respectively, with Amberlyst Wet. Based on the solketal yield and
   glycerol conversion results, the activity of all catalysts tested
   follows the following order of sequence: Amberlyst Wet approximate to
   Zeolite approximate to Amberlyst Dry > Zirconium Sulfate >
   Montmorillonite > Polymax. An increase in acetone/glycerol molar ratio
   or a decrease in WHSV enhanced the glycerol conversion as expected. This
   process offers an attractive route for converting glycerol, the main
   by-product of biodiesel, to solketal - a value-added green product with
   potential industrial applications as a valuable fuel additive or
   combustion promoter for gasoline engines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Motor Phenotype of Decline in Cognitive Performance among
   Community-Dwellers without Dementia: Population-Based Study and
   Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Decline in cognitive performance is associated with gait
   deterioration. Our objectives were: 1) to determine, from an original
   study in older community-dwellers without diagnosis of dementia, which
   gait parameters, among slower gait speed, higher stride time variability
   (STV) and Timed Up \& Go test (TUG) delta time, were most strongly
   associated with lower performance in two cognitive domains (i.e.,
   episodic memory and executive function); and 2) to quantitatively
   synthesize, with a systematic review and meta-analysis, the association
   between gait performance and cognitive decline (i.e., mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) and dementia).
   Method: Based on a cross-sectional design, 934 older community-dwellers
   without dementia (mean +/- standard deviation, 70.3 +/- 4.9years; 52.1\%
   female) were recruited. A score at 5 on the Short Mini-Mental State
   Examination defined low episodic memory performance. Low executive
   performance was defined by clock-drawing test errors. STV and gait speed
   were measured using GAITRite system. TUG delta time was calculated as
   the difference between the times needed to perform and to imagine the
   TUG. Then, a systematic Medline search was conducted in November 2013
   using the Medical Subject Heading terms ``Delirium,'' ``Dementia,''
   ``Amnestic,'' ``Cognitive disorders'' combined with ``Gait'' OR ``Gait
   disorders, Neurologic'' and ``Variability.''
   Findings: A total of 294 (31.5\%) participants presented decline in
   cognitive performance. Higher STV, higher TUG delta time, and slower
   gait speed were associated with decline in episodic memory and executive
   performances (all P-values < 0.001). The highest magnitude of
   association was found for higher STV (effect size = -0.74 {[}95\%
   Confidence Interval (CI): -1.05; -0.43], among participants combining of
   decline in episodic memory and in executive performances). Meta-analysis
   underscored that higher STV represented a gait biomarker in patients

Abstract = {{The heterocyclic bisdithiazolyl radical 1b (R-1 = Me, R-2 = F)
   crystallizes in two phases. The alpha-phase, space group P2(1)/n,
   contains two radicals in the asymmetric unit, both of which adopt
   slipped pi-stack structures. The beta-phase, space group P2(1)/c,
   consists of cross-braced pi-stacked arrays of dimers in which the
   radicals are linked laterally by hypervalent 4-center 6-electron S
   center dot center dot center dot S-S center dot center dot center dot S
   sigma-bonds. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements
   on alpha-1b indicate Curie-Weiss behavior (with Theta = -14.9 K), while
   the dimer phase beta-1b is diamagnetic, showing no indication of thermal
   dissociation below 400 K. High-pressure crystallographic measurements
   indicate that the cross-braced pi-stacked arrays of dimers undergo a
   wine-rack compression, but the dimer remains intact up to 8 GPa (at
   ambient temperature). The resistance of beta-1b to dissociate under
   pressure, also observed in its conductivity versus pressure profile, is
   in marked contrast to the behavior of the related dimer beta-1a (R-1 =
   Et, R-2 = F), which readily dissociates into a pair of radicals at 0.8
   GPa. The different response of the two dimers to pressure has been
   rationalized in terms of differences in their linear compressibilities
   occasioned by changes in the degree of cross-bracing of the pi-stacks.
   Dissociation of both dimers can be effected by irradiation with visible
   (lambda = 650 nm) light; the transformation has been monitored by
   optical spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and single
   crystal X-ray diffraction. The photoinduced radical pairs persist up to
   temperatures of 150 K (beta-1b) and 242 K (beta-1a) before reverting to
   the dimer state. Variable-temperature optical measurements on beta-1b
   and beta-1a have afforded Arrhenius activation energies of 8.3 and 19.6
   kcal mol(-1,) respectively, for the radical-to-dimer reconversion. DFT
   and CAS-SCF calculations have been used to probe the ground and excited
   electronic state structures of the dimer and radical pair. The results
   support the interpretation that the ground-state interconversion of the
   dimer and radical forms of beta-1a and beta-1b is symmetry forbidden,
   while the photochemical transformation is symmetry allowed.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6107-6114}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Watershed mercury (Hg) flux was calculated for ten inflowing rivers and
   the outlet for Lake Ontario using empirical measurements from two
   independent field-sampling programs. Total Hg (THg) flux for nine study
   watersheds that directly drain into the lake ranged from 0.2 kg/yr to 13
   kg/yr, with the dominant fluvial THg load from the Niagara River at 154
   kg/yr. THg loss at the outlet (St. Lawrence River) was 68 kg/yr and has
   declined approximately 40\% over the past decade. Fluvial Hg inputs
   largely (62\%) occur in the dissolved fraction and are similar to
   estimates of atmospheric Hg inputs. Fluvial mass balances suggest strong
   in-lake retention of particulate Hg inputs (99\%), compared to dissolved
   total Hg (45\%) and methyl Hg (22\%) fractions. Wetland land cover is a
   good predictor of methyl Hg yield for Lake Ontario watersheds. Sediment
   deposition studies, coupled atmospheric and fluvial Hg fluxes, and a
   comparison of this work with previous measurements indicate that Lake
   Ontario is a net sink of Hg inputs and not at steady state likely
   because of recent decreases in point source inputs and atmospheric Hg
   deposition.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1059-1062}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, a novel anti-eavesdropping OFDM system through dynamic
   subcarrier coordinate interleaving is proposed by exploiting the
   reciprocal, location-dependent and time-varying nature of wireless
   channels. The transmitter performs coordinate interleaving at some of
   the OFDM subcarriers in an opportunistic manner, where the secret
   interleaving pattern is determined by the instantaneous channel state
   information (CSI) between the transmitter and intended receiver. More
   specifically, a subcarrier symbol associated with a channel phase larger
   than a predefined threshold is coordinate interleaved. Since wireless
   channels associated with each pair of users at separate locations
   exhibit independent multipath fading, the frequently updated coordinate
   interleaving pattern can only be shared between legitimate users based
   on channel reciprocity. Consequently, eavesdropping is prevented due to
   mismatched de-interleaving at the eavesdropper. Theoretical analysis and
   simulation results are provided to validate the proposed system.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a detailed damage investigation of the two tornadoes in
   Vaughan, Ontario, which were part of the 19 tornadoes in the outbreak of
   20 August 2009, are presented. The bulk of the damage in both tornadoes
   consisted of structural roof failures categorized as EF-1 on the
   Enhanced Fujita Scale. However, multiple houses in both tornadoes
   suffered total roof failure, which is EF-2. It was observed that the
   total roof failures were all due to either internal pressurization and
   (or) weak (or non-existent) roof-to-wall connections. Wind speeds for
   specific damage states are estimated using median values from published
   fragility analyses and compared to the wind speeds found in the
   EF-Scale. The current results indicate that applying fragility concepts
   to the EF-Scale may allow for future improvements and verification of
   the wind speed - damage relationship for tornadoes.}},

Title = {{An Alternative Approach to Mapping Thermophysical Units from Martian
   Thermal Inertia and Albedo Data Using a Combination of Unsupervised
   Classification Techniques}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Thermal inertia and albedo provide information on the distribution of
   surface materials on Mars. These parameters have been mapped globally on
   Mars by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) onboard the Mars Global
   Surveyor. Two-dimensional clusters of thermal inertia and albedo reflect
   the thermophysical attributes of the dominant materials on the surface.
   In this paper three automated, non-deterministic, algorithmic
   classification methods are employed for defining thermophysical units:
   Expectation Maximisation of a Gaussian Mixture Model; Iterative
   Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA); and Maximum
   Likelihood. We analyse the behaviour of the thermophysical classes
   resulting from the three classifiers, operating on the 2007 TES thermal
   inertia and albedo datasets. Producing a rigorous mapping of
   thermophysical classes at similar to 3 km/pixel resolution remains
   important for constraining the geologic processes that have shaped the
   Martian surface on a regional scale, and for choosing appropriate
   landing sites. The results from applying these algorithms are compared
   to geologic maps, surface data from lander missions, features derived
   from imaging, and previous classifications of thermophysical units which
   utilized manual (and potentially more time consuming) classification
   methods. These comparisons comprise data suitable for validation of our
   classifications. Our work shows that a combination of the
   algorithms-ISODATA and Maximum Likelihood-optimises the sensitivity to
   the underlying dataspace, and that new information on Martian surface
   materials can be obtained by using these methods. We demonstrate that
   the algorithms used here can be applied to define a finer partitioning
   of albedo and thermal inertia for a more detailed mapping of surface
   materials, grain sizes and thermal behaviour of the Martian surface and
   shallow subsurface, at the similar to 3 km scale.}},

Title = {{Impact-Generated Endolithic Habitat Within Crystalline Rocks of the

Abstract = {{The colonization of rocks by endolithic communities is an advantageous
   trait, especially in environments such as hot or cold deserts, where
   large temperature ranges, low water availability, and high-intensity
   ultraviolet radiation pose a significant challenge to survival and
   growth. On Mars, similar conditions (albeit more extreme) prevail. In
   these environments, meteorite impact structures could provide refuge for
   endolithic organisms. Though initially detrimental to biology, an impact
   event into a rocky body can favorably change the availability and
   habitability of a substrate for endolithic organisms, which are then
   able to (re) colonize microfractures and pore spaces created during the
   impact. Here, we show how shocked gneisses from the Haughton impact
   structure, Devon Island, Canada, offer significant refuge for endolithic
   communities. A total of 28 gneiss samples representing a range of shock
   states were analyzed, collected from in situ, stable field locations.
   For each sample, the top centimeter of rock was examined with confocal
   scanning laser microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and
   bright-field microscopy to investigate the relationship of biomass with
   shock level, which was found to correlate generally with increased shock
   state and particularly with increased porosity. We found that gneisses,
   which experienced pressures between 35 and 60 GPa, provide the most
   ideal habitat for endolithic organisms.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers the development of a realistic statistical model to
   represent the interference in heterogeneous wireless networks. The
   considered networks are comprised of one or more femtocells deployed in
   buildings with unknown internal structures and a preplanned cellular
   network. The proposed interference model is based on a novel random
   floor plan generator, which is used to construct a statistical rather
   than site-specific floor plans. The developed model is augmented with
   Nakagami fading to represent the femtocell interference signal in the
   outdoor environment. The model is then utilized to evaluate the
   performance of the macrocell users where closed-form formulae for the
   outage probability and signal-to-interference ratio at the receiver
   front-end are derived. The obtained results reveal that a femtocell
   signal propagating from an indoor transmitter to an outdoor receiver
   will experience a composite shadowing/fading process where the Nakagami
   distribution is adopted for the fading part while the shadowing is
   modeled by lognormal mixture distribution. Analytical and simulation
   results show that placing the femtocell base-station (FBS) close to the
   center of the house can significantly reduce the impact of the
   interference on the outdoor macrocell users as compared to a randomly
   placed FBS.}},

   a set of polynomial equations were derived to calculate the solubility
   of taurine as a function of sodium sulfate mass fraction in the
   equilibrium solution, and two phase diagrams at (293.15 and 318.15) K
   were constructed. In general, the density of the equilibrium solution
   regularly increases with the sodium sulfate concentration. Furthermore,
   at low temperatures the equilibrium solid phase is Na2SO4 center dot
   10H(2)O, whereas at high temperatures the equilibrium solid phase is
   Na2SO4. All of these data will provide a better understanding of the

Abstract = {{For drug applications, nanoparticles, used as drug carriers, offer the
   advantage of controlled release, therapeutic impact and targeted
   delivery. In drug delivery applications, biodegradable polymers can be
   extracted from natural sources or prepared synthetically by
   polymerization. Natural polymers typically have varying compositions and
   physiochemical properties. As a result, methods which utilize natural
   polymers to encapsulate drugs are more varied and polymer dependent. The
   following polymers are discussed in this review article: alginate,
   chitosan, gelatin, albumin, gliadin, pullulan, and dextran. Specialized
   encapsulation nanotechnologies will be discussed such as ionotropic
   gelation, complexation, the reverse microemulsion technique,
   cross-linking methods, emulsion-dependent methods, desolvation methods
   and self-assembly methods. For each biopolymer an overview of the
   structure is presented with the corresponding encapsulation techniques.
   Understanding the structure of the biopolymer is important as to not
   only understand the rational for current encapsulation techniques but to
   continue to develop new encapsulation techniques in pursuit of the ideal
   drug carrier for application in therapeutic treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Four specimens of uranium dioxide doped with rare-earth oxide (Y2O3)
   and/or metal particles (Pd) i.e., UO2, UO2-Y2O3, UO2-Y2O3-Pd, UO2-Pd
   were surface and electrochemically characterized using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM/EDX), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry. Surface analyses showed that
   the dopants are present as a separate phase in the UO2 matrix and all
   oxides are non-stoichiometric and contain a large number of defect
   clusters. Voltammetry shows anodic oxidation begins at sub-thermodynamic
   potentials and the presence of multiple cathodic reduction peaks
   indicates the presence of a number of structural domains with different
   electrochemical reactivities. Corrosion potential (E-CORR) and
   polarization resistance measurements (Rp) in the presence of H2O2
   suggests that the anodic reactivity of all the specimens is comparable
   and high compared to 1.5 at\% SIMFUEL. The lower Rp values obtained on
   the doped specimens is consistent with the presence of readily
   oxidizable cuboctahedral clusters in the oxide matrix. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The jet flow of a shear-thinning power-law fluid is examined
   theoretically as it emerges from a channel at moderate Reynolds number.
   Poiseuille flow conditions are assumed to prevail far upstream from the
   exit. The problem is solved using the method of matched asymptotic
   expansions. A similarity solution is obtained in the inner layer near
   the free surface, with the outer layer extending to the jet centreline.
   An inner thin viscous sublayer is introduced to smooth out the
   singularity in viscosity at the free surface, allowing the inner
   algebraically decaying solutions to be matched smoothly with the
   solution near the free surface. A Newtonian jet is found to contract
   more than a shear-thinning jet. While both the inner-layer thickness and
   the free-surface height are O(Re-1/3), and grow with downstream
   distance, the sublayer thickness is smaller, O(Re-1(1+n)/3), growing
   with distance for n < 0.5, and decaying for n > 0.5. The relaxation
   downstream distance for the jet is found to grow logarithmically with
   Re.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a biocompatible biopolymer synthesized by

   0.02 mmol/g was obtained with the TEMPO-catalyzed oxidation.
   Epichlorohydrin-mediated amination introduced amine groups (pK(a) of
   11.0 +/- A 0.1) up to 1.74 +/- A 0.06 mmol/g. The oxidation of BC caused
   a decrease in its zeta-potential to -103 +/- A 6 mV, and amination
   increased the zeta-potential to -4 +/- A 6 mV. The fibre diameter
   decreased after both reactions. The high absolute value of the
   zeta-potential for oxidized BC led to superior colloidal stability in
   water, and a 390 \% increase in water retention. The oxidized BC
   hydrogel was also found to increase in water retention fivefold from pH
   1 to 7, making it a smart hydrogel. The cationic and anionic BC

   investigation have been generally limited to field study and application
   of computational fluid dynamics. This paper investigates the parameters
   of tropical storm and hurricane-level WDR and presents a methodology of
   experimental simulation of WDR that may complement the two other
   investigation methods. Tropical cyclone WDR data acquired through
   National Aeronautics and Space Administrations' Tropical Rainfall
   Measuring Mission ground validation program were used to study the
   characteristics of tropical storm and hurricane-level WDR and derive the
   values of target parameters, which were later used in the experimental
   simulation process. Procedure for determination of target WDR rate,
   simulation of raindrop size distribution and its integral parameters,
   and selection of type and number of nozzles are discussed in detail.
   Similarity requirements and important scaling considerations of WDR
   simulation were addressed. The procedure was used to simulate WDR using
   the 12-fan Wall of Wind facility at Florida International University.
   The experimental simulation results demonstrated satisfactory
   representation of target rainfall intensity and raindrop size
   distribution in the test setup. The WDR simulation methodology presented
   herein may be used for simulation of WDR in testing facilities to
   evaluate water intrusion in buildings during tropical cyclones, develop
   solutions to promote functional longevity of building envelope, and
   enhance current simplified test protocols given in international
   standards. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The wear performance of two types of crosslinked polyethylene (Marathon
   (TM) and XLIC (TM), DePuy Synthes Inc., Warsaw, IN) was evaluated in a
   pin-on-disc wear tester, a hip wear simulator, and a knee wear
   simulator. Sodium azide was used as the microbial inhibitor in the calf
   serum-based lubricant. In the pin-on-disc wear tester, the Marathon wear
   rate of 5.33 +/- 0.54 mm(3)/Mc was significantly lower (p=0.002) than
   the wear rate of 6.43 +/- 0.60 mm(3)/Mc for XLK. Inversely, the Marathon
   wear rate of 15.07 +/- 1.03 mm(3)/Mc from the hip wear simulator was
   2.2-times greater than the XLK wear rate of 6.71 +/- 1.03 mm(3)/Mc from
   the knee wear simulator. Differences in implant design, conformity, GUR
   type, and kinematic test conditions were suggested to account for the
   difference between the wear rates generated in the different types of
   wear testing apparati. In all wear tests, sodium azide was ineffective
   at inhibiting microbial growth in the lubricant. Eight different
   organisms were identified in the lubricant samples from the wear tests,
   which suggested the necessity of using an alternative, more effective
   microbial inhibitor. Careful sample preparation and thorough cleaning
   has shown to improve the consistency of the wear results. The wear rates
   generated in the hip and knee wear simulators closely reflected the wear
   behaviour of Marathon and XLK reported in published data that were
   tested under similar conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{To investigate the use of ``Control Point Analysis{''} (Sun Nuclear
   Corporation, Melbourne, FL) to analyze and compare delivered
   volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans for 3 different treatment
   planning complexity levels. A total of 30 patients were chosen and fully
   anonymized for the purpose of this study. Overall, 10 lung stereotactic
   body radiotherapy (SBRT), 10 head-and-neck (H\&N), and 10 prostate VMAT
   plans were generated on Pinnacle(3) and delivered on a Varian linear
   accelerator (LINAC). The delivered dose was measured using ArcCHECK (Sun
   Nuclear Corporation, Melbourne, FL). Each plan was analyzed using ``Sun
   Nuclear Corporation (SNC) Patient 6{''} and ``Control Point
   Analysis.{''} Gamma passing percentage was used to assess the
   differences between the measured and planned dose distributions and to
   assess the role of various control point binning combinations. Of the
   different sites considered, the prostate cases reported the highest
   gamma passing percentages calculated with ``SNC Patient 6{''} (97.5\% to
   99.2\% for the 3\%, 3 mm) and ``Control Point Analysis{''} (95.4\% to
   98.3\% for the 3\%, 3 mm). The mean percentage of passing control point
   sectors for the prostate cases increased from 51.8 +/- 7.8\% for
   individual control points to 70.6 +/- 10.5\% for 5 control points binned
   together to 87.8 +/- 11.0\% for 10 control points binned together (2\%,
   2-mm passing criteria). Overall, there was an increasing trend in the
   percentage of sectors passing gamma analysis with an increase in the
   number of control points binned together in a sector for both the gamma
   passing criteria (2\%, 2 mm and 3\%, 3 mm). Although many plans passed
   the clinical quality assurance criteria, plans involving the delivery of
   high Monitor Unit (MU)/control point (SBRT) and plans involving high
   degree of modulation (H\&N) showed less delivery accuracy per control
   point compared with plans with low MU/control point and low degree of
   modulation (prostate). (c) 2014 American Association of Medical

Abstract = {{Many regions of the world are experiencing an increase in frequency and
   intensity of floods. There has been increasing understanding among
   emergency preparedness and natural disaster planners that rapid
   urbanization is enhancing the risk from river flooding in urban areas.
   Many regions of Canada have been exposed to particularly severe floods
   over the course of the last few years, much of this due to land-use
   change. This study aims at understanding the risk of flooding for the
   City of Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which is located in
   the Fraser River Delta. The paper presents a fast, efficient and
   reliable method that can be used to produce vegetation maps from
   advanced very high resolution radiometer images and SPOT vegetation
   maps. A 10-day maximum normalized difference vegetation index maps were
   produced to assess the dynamics of the urbanization process in
   Vancouver. Remotely sensed data show a significant decrease in
   vegetation cover in the Metro Vancouver City between 1984 and 2012. The
   proposed method can be used as an effective tool for raising early
   land-use change awareness and assist with flood risk management. Flood
   risk management has a substantial impact on human health and well-being
   in urban areas, and this flood risk information will be used to assess
   the impact of flooding and explore the complex relationship between
   land-use change, urbanization, flooding and impact on urban dwellers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates a novel biorefinery approach for the conversion of
   lignocellulosic biomass from pinewood. A combination of thermochemical
   and biochemical conversion was chosen with the main product being
   ethanol. Fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomasss with fractional
   condensation of the products was used as the thermochemical process to
   obtain a pyrolysis-oil rich in anhydro-sugars (levoglucosan) and low in
   inhibitors. After hydrolysis of these anhydro-sugars, glucose was
   obtained which was successfully fermented, after detoxification, to
   obtain bioethanol. Ethanol yields comparable to traditional biochemical
   processing were achieved (41.3\% of theoretical yield based on cellulose
   fraction). Additional benefits of the proposed biorefinery concept
   comprise valuable by-products of the thermochemical conversion like
   bio-char, mono-phenols (production of BTX) and pyrolytic lignin as a
   source of aromatic rich fuel additive. The inhibitory effect of
   thermochemically derived fermentation substrates was quantified
   numerically to compare the effects of different process configurations
   and upgrading steps within the biorefinery approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The behaviour of Al-Mn precipitates during atmospheric and aqueous
   corrosion of an AM50 Mg alloy was investigated using site-specific
   analytical electron microscopy. After air-exposure, localized attack was
   observed close to Al-Mn precipitates, with the top layer of the
   intermetallic enriched in Al and O. During immersed corrosion, these
   precipitates developed protruding domes of corrosion products, with
   crystalline Mg(OH)2 on top and an inner layer of crystalline MgO. After
   prolonged immersion, these precipitates showed evidence of preferential
   Al dissolution, ultimately developing a fragmented interlayer of Mn3O4.
   This phase transformation is linked to the enhanced hydrogen evolution
   rates adjacent to these precipitates. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dual-tracer molecular imaging is a powerful approach to quantify
   receptor expression in a wide range of tissues by using an untargeted
   tracer to account for any nonspecific uptake of a molecular-targeted
   tracer. This approach has previously required the pharmacokinetics of
   the receptor-targeted and untargeted tracers to be identical, requiring
   careful selection of an ideal untargeted tracer for any given targeted
   tracer. In this study, methodology capable of correcting for tracer
   differences in arterial input functions, as well as binding-independent
   delivery and retention, is derived and evaluated in a mouse U251 glioma
   xenograft model using an Affibody tracer targeted to epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR), a cell membrane receptor overexpressed in many
   cancers. Simulations demonstrated that blood, and to a lesser extent
   vascular-permeability, pharmacokinetic differences between targeted and
   untargeted tracers could be quantified by deconvolving the uptakes of
   the two tracers in a region of interest devoid of targeted tracer
   binding, and therefore corrected for, by convolving the uptake of the
   untargeted tracer in all regions of interest by the product of the
   deconvolution. Using fluorescently labeled, EGFR-targeted and untargeted
   Affibodies (known to have different blood clearance rates), the average
   tumor concentration of EGFR in four mice was estimated using dual-tracer
   kinetic modeling to be 3.9 +/- 2.4 nM compared to an expected
   concentration of 2.0 +/- 0.4 nM. However, with deconvolution correction
   a more equivalent EGFR concentration of 2.0 +/- 0.4 nM was measured.}},

Title = {{An educational video to promote multi-factorial approaches for fall and
   injury prevention in long-term care facilities}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Older adults living in long term care (LTC) settings are
   vulnerable to fall-related injuries. There is a need to develop and
   implement evidence-based approaches to address fall injury prevention in
   LTC. Knowledge translation (KT) interventions to support the uptake of
   evidence-based approaches to fall injury prevention in LTC need to be
   responsive to the learning needs of LTC staff and use mediums, such as
   videos, that are accessible and easy-to-use. This article describes the
   development of two unique educational videos to promote fall injury
   prevention in long-term care (LTC) settings. These videos are unique
   from other fall prevention videos in that they include video footage of
   real life falls captured in the LTC setting.
   Methods: Two educational videos were developed (2012-2013) to support
   the uptake of findings from a study exploring the causes of falls based
   on video footage captured in LTC facilities. The videos were developed
   by: (1) conducting learning needs assessment in LTC settings via six
   focus groups (2) liaising with LTC settings to identify learning
   priorities through unstructured conversations; and (3) aligning the
   content with principles of adult learning theory.
   Results: The videos included footage of falls, interviews with older
   adults and fall injury prevention experts. The videos present
   evidence-based fall injury prevention recommendations aligned to the
   needs of LTC staff and: (1) highlight recommendations deemed by LTC
   staff as most urgent (learner-centered learning); (2) highlight negative
   impacts of falls on older adults (encourage meaning-making); and, (3)
   prompt LTC staff to reflect on fall injury prevention practices
   (encourage critical reflection).
   Conclusions: Educational videos are an important tool available to
   researchers seeking to translate evidence-based recommendations into LTC
   settings. Additional research is needed to determine their impact on
   practice.}},

Title = {{Measurement of in vivo cerebral volumetric strain induced by the

Abstract = {{Compressibility of biological tissues such as brain parenchyma is
   related to its poroelastic nature characterized by the geometry and
   pressure of vasculature and interconnected fluid-filled spaces. Thus,
   cerebral volumetric strain may be sensitive to intracranial pressure
   which can be altered under physiological conditions. So far volumetric
   strain has attained little attention in studies of the mechanical
   behavior of the brain.
   This paper reports a study of measuring the in vivo cerebral volumetric
   strain induced by the Valsalva maneuver (VM) where forced expiration
   against a closed glottis leads to a transient increase in the
   intracranial pressure. For this purpose we applied three-dimensional
   magnetic resonance imaging equipped with a patient-controlled
   acquisition system to five healthy volunteers. With each volunteer,
   three experiments were performed: one with VM and two in resting state.
   i.e. normal ventilation, which were conducted before and after VM. The
   VM data were registered to reference data by morphology based non-rigid
   deformation, yielding 3D maps of total displacements and volumetric
   strain. On average, VM induced volumetric strain correlated to
   whole-brain dilatation of -3.14 +/- 0.87\% and -2.80 +/- 0.71\% compared
   to the reference states before and after VM, respectively. These values
   were well reproduced by repetitive experiments during the same scan as
   well as by repeated measurements in one volunteer on different days.
   Combined with literature data of intracranial pressure changes, our
   volumetric strain values can be used to elucidate the static compression
   modulus of the in vivo human brain. These results add knowledge to the
   understanding of the brain's biomechanical properties under
   physiological conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Wideband MRE and static mechanical indentation of human liver specimen:
   Sensitivity of viscoelastic constants to the alteration of tissue

Abstract = {{Despite the success of elastography in grading hepatic fibrosis by
   stiffness related noninvasive markers the relationship between
   viscoelastic constants in the liver and tissue structure remains
   unclear. We therefore studied the mechanical properties of 16 human
   liver specimens with different degrees of fibrosis, inflammation and
   steatosis by wideband magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and static
   indentation experiments providing the specimens' static Young's modulus
   (E), dynamic storage modulus (G') and dynamic loss modulus (G `'). A
   frequency-independent shear modulus p and a powerlaw exponent a were
   obtained by fitting G' and G `' using the two-parameter sprinpot model.
   The mechanical parameters were compared to the specimens' histology
   derived parameters such as degree of Fibrosis (F), inflammation score
   and fat score, amount of hydroxyproline (HYP) used for quantification of
   collagen, blood markers and presurgery in vivo function tests.
   The frequency averaged parameters G', G `' and p were significantly
   correlated with F (G': R=0.762, G `': R=0.830; mu: R=0.744; all P <
   0.01) and HYP (G': R=0.712; G `': R=0.720; mu: R=0.731; all P < 0.01).
   The powerlaw exponent a displayed an inverse correlation with F
   (R=-0.590, P=0.034) and a trend of inverse correlation with HYP
   (R=-0.470, P=0.089). The static Young's modulus E was less correlated
   with F (R=0.587, P=0.022) and not sensitive to HYP. Although
   inflammation was highly correlated with F (R=0.773, P < 0.001), no
   interaction was discernable between inflammation and mechanical
   parameters measured in this study. Other histological and blood markers
   as well as liver function test were correlated with neither F nor the
   measured mechanical parameters.
   In conclusion, viscoelastic constants measured by wideband MRE are
   highly sensitive to histologically proven fibrosis. Our results suggest
   that, in addition to the amount of connective tissue, subtle structural
   changes of the viscoelastic matrix determine the sensitivity of
   mechanical tissue properties to hepatic fibrosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The BiOCl, BiOCl/Bi2O2CO3 composites and Bi2O2CO3 were successfully
   fabricated by a facile composition-controlled preparation technology at
   room temperature for the first time. The X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   adsorption isotherm, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) and
   first-principles methods were employed to characterize the phase
   structures, morphologies, surface areas, optical properties, and
   photocatalytic mechanism of as-prepared samples. The BiOCl/Bi2O2CO3
   composites exhibited the higher photocatalytic activity than individual
   BiOCl and Bi2O2CO3 for the degradation of MO under simulated sunlight
   irradiation. The COD removal efficiency of MO solution over
   BiOCl/Bi2O2CO3 composite achieved 95\% after 8 h reaction time. In
   addition, the formation mechanism and excellent photocatalytic activity
   of BiOCl/Bi2O2CO3 composite have been investigated and discussed in
   detail. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of BiOCl/Bi2O2CO3
   composites is closely related to the suitable conduction band (CB)
   interaction and efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole
   pairs by the synergistic effect of BiOCl and Bi2O2CO3 under the
   simulated sunlight irradiation. Combined with the theoretical and
   experimental findings, the photocatalytic mechanism of BiOCl/Bi2O2CO3
   composite and the charge carrier transfer process between Bi2O2CO3 and
   BiOCl semiconductors have been proposed and investigated. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We theoretically characterize the imaging performance of a hypothetical
   mercuric iodide (HgI2) photoconductor prepared by a screen printing

   efficiency (DQE) using the cascaded-systems analysis. In the DQE model,
   we use the ``photon-interaction process{''} in order to represent both
   the selection of interacting photons and subsequent conversion gain as a
   single process because both processes are not statistically independent

   include the thermal generation process of leakage current charges and
   the incomplete charge-collection process in the DQE model. Theoretical
   imaging performances of the hypothetical HgI2 photoconductor sample are
   compared with those of a 0.2-mm thick amorphous selenium (a-Se) under
   mammographic imaging conditions. It is shown that the hypothetical HgI2

   better DQE performance at lower exposure levels, which suggests that a

Abstract = {{In this paper, wind induced aerodynamic loads on a standard tall
   building have been evaluated through large-eddy simulation (LES)
   technique. The flow parameters of an open terrain were recorded from the
   downstream of an empty boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) and used to
   prescribe the transient inlet boundary of the LES simulations. Three
   different numerically generated inflow boundary conditions have been
   investigated to assess their suitability for LES. A high frequency
   pressure integration (HFPI) approach has been employed to obtain the
   wind load. A total of 280 pressure monitoring points have been
   systematically distributed on the surfaces of the LES model building.
   Similar BLWT experiments were also done to validate the numerical
   results. In addition, the effects of adjacent buildings were studied.
   Among the three wind field generation methods (synthetic, Simirnov's,
   and Lund's recycling method), LES with perturbation from the synthetic
   random flow approach showed better agreement with the BLWT data. In
   general, LES predicted peak wind loads comparable with the BLWT data,
   with a maximum difference of 15\% and an average difference of 5\%, for
   an isolated building case and however higher estimation errors were
   observed for cases where adjacent buildings were placed in the vicinity

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{537-544}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hemiarthroplasty is a treatment option for selected distal
   humerus fractures. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect
   of distal humeral hemiarthroplasty and implant size on elbow articular
   contact. We hypothesized that implants of varying sizes produce
   different contact patterns compared with the native elbow.
   Methods: Eight cadaveric arms were tested in an elbow simulator and the
   kinematics recorded. Three-dimensional reconstructions of bones and
   cartilage were generated from computed-tomography images to determine
   contact patterns. The native articulation was compared to optimal,
   oversized, and undersized implants (Latitude Anatomic Hemiarthroplasty).
   Changes in contact patterns relative to the native articulation were
   measured using total contact area and contact patch agreement scores,
   defined as the sum of distance between contact patches x area,
   indicating how well contact patches agree with the native contact
   pattern.
   Findings: The native articulation had significantly lower ulnohumeral
   contact patch agreement scores compared to all tested implants (P <
   0.05). Mean ulnohumeral and radiocapitellar contact area decreased an
   average 44\% (P = 0.03) and 4\% (P = 0.07) following placement of an
   optimally sized implant. There was no effect of implant size on contact
   area or contact patch agreement score (P > 0.05).
   Interpretation: Shape differences of elbow implants relative to the
   native joint maybe responsible for altered contact patterns and could be
   improved with design modifications. These changes may predispose the
   elbow to arthritis. The lack of influence of implant size suggests that
   implant shape and materials may be more important than implant sizing
   during surgery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{551-555}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background: In below knee amputations, the remaining fibula may be
   subjected to abnormal forces resulting in problematic tibia-fibular
   movement. The purpose of the current work was to examine the effect of
   amputation length and interosseous membrane integrity on fibular
   movement when subjected to unopposed biceps femoris muscle tension.
   Methods: Forty embalmed cadaveric specimens were subjected to a below
   knee amputation with fibular lengths of 5 cm and 10 cm. A subset of
   specimens (n = 20) was further modified by sectioning the interosseous
   membrane. The tibias were mounted in a material testing machine and the
   biceps femoris was sutured to the actuator. Position-controlled tensile
   cyclic loading was applied (initial displacement of 4 mm for 100 cycles
   at 0.5 Hz with increments of 2 mm up to 20 mm) to the biceps femoris.
   The kinematics of the fibula with respect to the tibia was analyzed for
   three degrees of freedom: abduction, flexion and rotation.
   Findings: There was no interaction between below knee amputation length
   and interosseous membrane integrity on the degree of abduction, flexion,
   and rotation. However, below knee amputations with a sectioned
   interosseous membrane are abducted to a significantly greater degree
   than intact interosseous membrane below knee amputations. Furthermore,
   although embalmed specimens were tested here, embalming was consistent
   across specimens and it is unlikely that this confounded the findings.
   Interpretation: Understanding the cause of fibular abduction in below
   knee amputation will lead to recommendations for preventive surgical and
   rehabilitative measures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel physical layer authentication scheme is proposed in this paper
   by exploiting the time-varying carrier frequency offset (CFO) associated
   with each pair of wireless communications devices. In realistic
   scenarios, radio frequency oscillators in each transmitter-and-receiver
   pair always present device-dependent biases to the nominal oscillating
   frequency. The combination of these biases and mobility-induced Doppler
   shift, characterized as a time-varying CFO, can be used as a radiometric
   signature for wireless device authentication. In the proposed
   authentication scheme, the variable CFO values at different
   communication times are first estimated. Kalman filtering is then
   employed to predict the current value by tracking the past CFO
   variation, which is modeled as an autoregressive random process. To
   achieve the proposed authentication, the current CFO estimate is
   compared with the Kalman predicted CFO using hypothesis testing to
   determine whether the signal has followed a consistent CFO pattern. An
   adaptive CFO variation threshold is derived for device discrimination
   according to the signal-to-noise ratio and the Kalman prediction error.
   In addition, a software-defined radio (SDR) based prototype platform has
   been developed to validate the feasibility of using CFO for
   authentication. Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of
   the proposed scheme in multipath fading channels.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and accurate segmentation of the prostate and two of its
   clinically meaningful sub-regions: the central gland (CG) and peripheral
   zone (PZ), from 3D MR images, is of great interest in image-guided
   prostate interventions and diagnosis of prostate cancer. In this work, a
   novel multi-region segmentation approach is proposed to simultaneously
   segment the prostate and its two major sub-regions from only a single 3D
   T2-weighted (T2w) MR image, which makes use of the prior spatial region
   consistency and incorporates a customized prostate appearance model into
   the segmentation task. The formulated challenging combinatorial
   optimization problem is solved by means of convex relaxation, for which
   a novel spatially continuous max-flow model is introduced as the dual
   optimization formulation to the studied convex relaxed optimization
   problem with region consistency constraints. The proposed continuous
   max-flow model derives an efficient duality-based algorithm that enjoys
   numerical advantages and can be easily implemented on GPUs. The proposed
   approach was validated using 18 3D prostate T2w MR images with a
   body-coil and 25 images with an endo-rectal coil. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of efficiently and
   accurately extracting both the prostate zones: CG and PZ, and the whole
   prostate gland from the input 3D prostate MR images, with a mean Dice
   similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.3 +/- 3.2\% for the whole gland (WG),
   82.2 +/- 3.0\% for the CG, and 69.1 +/- 6.9\% for the PZ in 3D body-coil
   MR images; 89.2 +/- 3.3\% for the WG, 83.0 +/- 2.4\% for the CG, and
   70.0 +/- 6.5\% for the PZ in 3D endo-rectal coil MR images. In addition,
   the experiments of intra- and inter-observer variability introduced by
   user initialization indicate a good reproducibility of the proposed
   approach in terms of volume difference (VD) and coefficient-of-variation
   (CV) of DSC. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mixing zone approach in regulating the discharge of brine and other
   toxic dense discharges has many limitations when applied in
   environmentally sensitive areas. A well-defined minimum return dilution
   is advocated in this study as an alternative method to regulate the
   disposal of brine and other toxic dense discharges. This study examined
   experimentally the development and dilution of turbulent vertical dense
   jets (or fountains) at small Froude numbers. The study complements an
   earlier larger Froude number investigation. The mean and fluctuating
   temperature fields were measured with fast responding thermocouples, and
   an emphasis was given to the minimum return dilution, which occurred
   just outside the edge of the discharge pipe. The study has revealed that
   at small Froude numbers (Fr < 5) the normalized minimum dilution,
   mu(min)/Fr, decreased linearly with the Froude number and it became
   constant only at larger Froude numbers (Fr > 7). Simple design equations
   for the calculations of minimum return dilution and maximum excess
   temperature and salinity at the level of the source are provided for
   small and large Froude number regimes. This study also recognized the
   advantage of using a vertical discharge configuration (inclination theta
   = 90 degrees with horizontal) as opposed to an inclined configuration (0
   degrees <= theta < 90 degrees) when discharging brine into water
   environments. The inclined discharge configuration has the potential of
   producing higher concentrations of brine and temperature near the source
   when ambient currents are in a direction opposite to the discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Very high surface area activated carbons (AC) are synthesized from pine
   cone petals by a chemical activation process and subsequently evaluated
   as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications in a nonaqueous
   medium. The maximum specific surface area of approximate to
   3950m(2)g(-1) is noted for the material treated with a 1:5 ratio of KOH
   to pine cone petals (PCC5), which is much higher than that reported for
   carbonaceous materials derived from various other biomass precursors. A
   symmetric supercapacitor is fabricated with PCC5 electrodes, and the
   results showed enhanced supercapacitive behavior with the highest energy
   density of approximate to 61Whkg(-1). Furthermore, outstanding cycling
   ability is evidenced for such a configuration, and approximate to 90\%
   of the initial specific capacitance after 20000cycles under harsh
   conditions was observed. This result revealed that the pine-cone-derived
   high-surface-area AC can be used effectively as a promising electrode
   material to construct high-energy-density supercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research employing a real-time auditory perturbation paradigm
   has shown that talkers monitor their own speech attributes such as
   fundamental frequency, vowel intensity, vowel formants, and fricative
   noise as part of speech motor control. In the case of vowel formants or
   fricative noise, what was manipulated is spectral information about the
   filter function of the vocal tract. However, segments can be contrasted
   by parameters other than spectral configuration. It is possible that the
   feedback system monitors phonation timing in the way it does spectral
   information. This study examined whether talkers exhibit a compensatory
   behavior when manipulating information about voicing. When talkers
   received feedback of the cognate of the intended voicing category
   (saying ``tipper{''} while hearing ``dipper{''} or vice versa), they
   changed the voice onset time and in some cases the following vowel. (C)

Abstract = {{Measurements have been performed in a large scale wind tunnel on an
   elongated bluff body with a chord-to-thickness ratio of 7 over the
   Reynolds number range Re=4.0-7.5 x 10(4). Six different leading edge
   separation angles were created by altering the leading edge geometry.
   Time-resolved, synchronized, surface pressure and Particle Image
   Velocimetry data allow for detailed characterization of the flow around
   the body and in the recirculation region. The results show a linear
   decrease in the shedding frequency of nearly 40\% as the leading edge
   separation angle is increased from 0 degrees-90 degrees. The PIV data
   are phase averaged in the recirculation region and the convection speed
   of the vortices is characterized. From the phase averaged data, the
   velocity outside of the recirculation region is observed to decrease
   markedly as the leading edge separation angle is increased, which is
   suggested to be responsible for the observed changes in the shedding
   frequency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Protection of standard-delta phase shifting transformer using terminal

Journal = {{ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{31-38}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new standard-delta phase shifting transformer
   (PST) protection technique based on the normal operating voltage-current
   (v-i) relationships of the PST equivalent circuit. These voltage-current
   relations are used to define the v-i differential equations, which are
   further used to detect and discriminate the internal and external
   faults. Using the v-i differential relationships, the proposed
   protection relay computes small or zero (ideally) differential quantity
   during normal and external fault conditions. However, in the event of an
   internal fault, the v-i relationships become invalid and the proposed
   differential relay therefore computes significantly large differential
   quantity. A comparative performance analysis of the proposed protection
   technique and the former methods, that make use of the current
   differential principle, suggest that the proposed technique offers a
   more secure protection solution of the standard-delta PST. It
   successfully detects and discriminates the internal/external faults,
   while remaining stable during a magnetizing inrush current and the
   saturation of the series winding, and offers a high degree of tolerance
   against external faults with current transformer saturation. A real
   representation of a standard-delta PST has been modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC
   to simulate various normal and faulted conditions to test and validate
   the performance of the proposed protection technique. Implementation of
   the proposed protection algorithm requires currents, voltages and
   tracking of the tap-changer position. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A simulation model is developed to understand the dynamic behavior of a
   hydraulically coupled multiple reservoir system when operated in
   real-time. An object-oriented simulation environment conceived on the
   principles of system dynamics (SD) is used for the development of the
   model. The modeling process consists of developing causal loop, stock
   and flow diagrams, and carrying out simulations using difference
   equations to integrate stocks. Unlike traditional simulation
   environments, modeling using SD principles will aid in the analysis of
   the system by a series of interconnecting processes and functional
   relationships. Also, the feedback loops that influence variable values
   and causal relationships in space and time can be clearly understood
   using SD-based simulation. Performance measures are developed to
   quantify the system performance in making decisions regarding actual
   implementation of operating rules. A simulation model based on a
   real-life hydropower reservoir system in the Province of Manitoba,
   Canada is developed. Dynamics of the multiple reservoir operation
   suggest that in a serial system of reservoirs, the operational decision
   taken at one reservoir will have effect on the other reservoir. The
   behavior of the reservoir system for extreme events is also observed and
   conclusions relevant to real-time operation of the systems are drawn.
   The simulation models developed in this study provide global description
   of a hydraulically coupled reservoir system with ability to easily model
   dynamic processes to obtain operational release decisions that can be
   adopted in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the surface element integration (SEI) method was used
   derive analytical force/potential versus distance profiles for two
   non-DLVO forces: Lewis acid-base and solvation forces. These forces are
   highly relevant in a variety of systems, from bacterial adhesion,
   nanoparticle suspension stability to atomic force microscopy (AFM)
   profiles. The SEI-derived expressions were compared with the more
   commonly utilized Derjaguin approximations in order to assess the effect
   of curvature on the resulting interaction for the test cases of
   sphere-flat plate and equally sized spheres. For acid base interactions,
   the deviation was found to be significant for particles up to 40 nm in
   diameter for the conventionally used decay length (lambda = 1 nm) for
   water. The resulting expressions show that accounting in curvature for
   acid base interactions is important even for simple smooth geometric
   shapes, recovering the Derjaguin expression at smaller values of
   lambda/R. These results allow for correction of the acid base
   force/potential versus distance from the Derjaguin-derived expressions
   using simple functions of lambda/R. Conversely, for the solvation force
   the deviation was far less significant due to the oscillatory nature of
   the potential damping out effects and the smaller order of magnitude
   range of the solvation decay length, indicating that for solvation
   forces the Derjaguin approximation is suitable for most conceivable
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{A new process to produce high purity phenol crystal from dilute aqueous
   solutions based on pervaporation-crystallization coupling (PVCC) was
   reported. Our approach to modifying the permeate condenser was to
   replace the traditional single condenser for complete condensation and
   collection of permeate with a two-stage condenser where the first stage
   was used for crystallization of phenol while the second stage was to
   condense and collect the remaining permeate. The phenol crystal obtained
   in the crystallizer was found to be of the same purity as that of
   commercial reagent phenol. The pervaporation experiments showed that the
   phenol crystals collected in the crystallizer accounted for about
   79.9-89.2\% of the total amount of phenol permeated through the membrane
   for a feed concentration of 6000-10,000 ppm at an operating temperature
   of 65 C. This is of particular interest from an application point of
   view as high purity phenol crystals were obtained directly from dilute
   aqueous solutions by pervaporation alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{233-243}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Detailed distributions of solids holdup in an extremely high density
   circulating fluidized bed riser with FCC particles are mapped by an
   optical fiber probe. The solids circulation rate reaches as high as 1000
   kg/ m(2) s which has never been achieved before in an academic setting.
   When solids flux approaches 800 kg/ m(2) s, the axial flow structure
   becomes uniform and the cross-sectional mean solids holdup reaches 0.22
   throughout the entire riser; the same reaching 0.32 at 1000 kg/m(2) s.
   Compared to a typical core-annulus structure, the radial distributions
   of the solids holdup becomes much less uniform with a shrinking core and
   transits to a monotonic increasing profile towards the wall. Speed of
   flow development differs at various radial positions with almost instant
   development in the center even at the highest solids flux of 1000
   kg/m(2) s and then becoming slower towards the wall. Fluctuations in
   high density circulating fluidized beds are significantly greater than
   those in low density ones, leading to more vigorous interactions between
   gas and solids phases. As a result, better gas-solids contacting and
   mixing, plus the uniform axial profiles of solids holdup, provide better
   reactor performance for the high solids flux/ density risers than low
   flux/density ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential of
   sub-synchronous resonance in induction generator based wind farms
   connected to a line commutated converter based high-voltage DC
   transmission line. Since series-compensated lines are also known to
   cause sub-synchronous resonance in induction generator based (Type 1)
   wind farms, this study also considers a series-compensated line in
   parallel with the high-voltage DC line for the investigation of
   sub-synchronous resonance potential. The CIGRE benchmark high-voltage DC
   system and the IEEE first benchmark system are considered as the study
   system components. A linearized state-space model of the study system is
   developed for eigenvalue analysis followed by participation factor
   analysis. A sensitivity study of the sub-synchronous resonance modes
   with respect to variation in different model parameters, such as
   rectifier firing angle, DC line power flow, and series compensation
   level, is also reported. It is found that the high-voltage DC rectifier
   station current regulator does not interact with any of the
   sub-synchronous modes of the wind farm. However, in the event that the
   high-voltage DC line is blocked during a contingency, the wind farm will
   operate radially with the series-compensated line and may experience
   sub-synchronous resonance oscillation due to the induction generator
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing is defined as the task of detecting the presence of
   licensed users and is an essential prerequisite for opportunistic
   spectrum access in cognitive radio. Motivated by the infeasible
   assumptions of perfect synchronization and prior noise knowledge in most
   of the existing spectrum sensing algorithms, a robust orthogonal
   frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal sensing scheme, with the
   use of a noise power insensitive threshold, is investigated in this
   paper. Identification of primary OFDM signals is achieved by sliding the
   local pilot reference over the received signals and measuring the
   frequency domain correlations. The necessity of prior noise power
   knowledge for the sensing threshold determination is removed by
   employing the proposed interference insensitive test metric, which is a
   ratio of uniformly distorted correlations. As a result, no noise power
   information is required in the sensing process. In addition, the effects
   of both timing and frequency offsets are mitigated with a novel extended
   time domain segmentation as well as multiple frequency domain
   correlations via a frequency sliding window. Numerical results are
   provided to validate the theoretical analysis and estimate the
   performance of the proposed algorithm. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

   capturing microvasculature hemodynamics}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Multispectral imaging is a highly desirable modality for material-based
   analysis in diverse areas such as food production and processing,
   satellite-based reconnaissance, and biomedical imaging. Here, we present
   nanofilter-based multispectral videography (nMSV) in the 700 to 950 nm
   range made possible by the tunable extraordinary-optical-transmission
   properties of 3D metallic nanostructures. Measurements made with nMSV
   during a bolus injection of an intravascular tracer in the ear of a
   piglet resulted in spectral videos of the microvasculature. Analysis of
   the multispectral videos generated contrast measurements representative
   of arterial pulsation, the distribution of microvascular transit times,
   as well as a separation of the venous and arterial signals arising from
   within the tissue. Therefore, nMSV is capable of acquiring serial
   multispectral images relevant to tissue hemodynamics, which may have
   application to the detection and identification of skin cancer.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Cyanogenic glucosides are among the most widespread defense chemicals of
   plants. Upon plant tissue disruption, these glucosides are hydrolyzed to
   a reactive hydroxynitrile that releases toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN).
   Yet many mite and lepidopteran species can thrive on plants defended by
   cyanogenic glucosides. The nature of the enzyme known to detoxify HCN to
   beta-cyanoalanine in arthropods has remained enigmatic. Here we identify
   this enzyme by transcriptome analysis and functional expression.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed that the gene is a member of the cysteine
   synthase family horizontally transferred from bacteria to phytophagous
   mites and Lepidoptera. The recombinant mite enzyme had both
   beta-cyanoalanine synthase and cysteine synthase activity but enzyme
   kinetics showed that cyanide detoxification activity was strongly
   favored. Our results therefore suggest that an ancient horizontal
   transfer of a gene originally involved in sulfur amino acid biosynthesis
   in bacteria was co-opted by herbivorous arthropods to detoxify plant
   produced cyanide.}},

Abstract = {{Reactor performance of a high density circulating fluidized bed (CFB)
   riser is studied using ozone decomposition with extremely high solids
   circulation rates up to 800 kg/m(2)s and superficial gas velocities

   distributions of the ozone concentration are consistent with those of
   the solids holdup. Higher solids flux and/or lower gas velocity lead to
   higher reaction conversion in the riser. Solids holdup is the dominant
   factor affecting reaction conversion. Effects of solids holdup on
   overall ozone conversion are more significant under high superficial gas
   velocity and/or low solids circulation rate. Overall conversion in the
   high density riser is not only less than that of plug flow reactor but
   also less than that of completely stirred tank reactor indicating that,
   due to the two-phase nature inside the riser, a CFB riser is still far
   from an ideal plug flow reactor.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the dynamics of spreading and impact of a
   dielectric droplet onto a dry conductive substrate in the presence of an
   external vertical electric field are investigated numerically. The
   effects of electric field strength, surface charge, droplet properties,
   and surface wettability are taken into account. Studies were made for
   droplet charge of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 nC, corresponding to drop
   charge of 15-80\% of the conducting drop Rayleigh Limit. The results are
   reported for contact angles from 40 degrees to 150 degrees. In the first
   part, the spreading of a charged dielectric droplet placed on a ground
   electrode is simulated. It was found that the droplet maximum spreading
   diameter and the rate of spreading increase with increasing the surface
   charge density. In the second part, the suppression of the droplet
   receding phase, after it has been impacted onto a surface, is
   investigated using a vertical field parallel to the impact axis. Our
   results show that the maximum wetting diameter can be conserved by
   increasing the surface charge. It was also observed that increasing the
   droplet charge beyond some threshold level not only prevents the droplet
   from receding, but also may increase the final wetting diameter. This
   mechanism of retraction control differs from those described in
   literature. The numerical simulations are shown to reproduce
   experimentally observed droplet behavior quantitatively, in both the
   spreading and receding phases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: 1) To measure and compare the time required to perform
   (pTUG) and the time required to imagine (iTUG) the Timed Up \& Go (TUG),
   and the time difference between these two tasks (i.e., TUG delta time)
   in older adults with cognitive decline (i.e., mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI) and mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease and related disorders
   (ADRD)) and in cognitively healthy individuals (CHI); and 2) to examine
   any association between the TUG delta time and a cognitive status.
   Methods: Sixty-six participants (24 CHI, 23 individuals with MCI, and 19
   individuals with ADRD) were recruited in this cross-sectional study. The
   mean and standard deviation of the pTUG and iTUG completion times and
   the TUG delta time, as well as age, gender, and Mini-Mental State
   Examination (MMSE) scores were used as outcomes. Participants were
   separated into three groups based on the tertilization of TUG delta
   time: lowest (<13.6\%; n = 22; best performance), intermediate
   (13.6-52.2\%; n = 22), and highest tertile (>52.2\%; n = 22, worst
   performance).
   Results: Fewer CHI were in the group exhibiting the highest tertile of
   TUG delta time compared to individuals with lowest and intermediate TUG
   delta times (p = 0.013). Being in the highest tertile of the TUG delta
   time was associated with cognitive decline in the unadjusted model (p =
   0.012 for MCI, and p = 0.021 for mild-to-moderate ADRD). In the
   multivariate models, this association remained significant only for
   individuals with MCI (p = 0.019 while adjusting for age and gender; p =
   0.047 while adjusting for age, gender, and MMSE score; p = 0.012 for the
   stepwise backward model).
   Conclusions: Our results provide the first evidence that motor imagery
   of gait may be used as a biomarker of MCI in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach in fairness is proposed by using a probabilistic relay
   assignment strategy for cooperative communication systems. In this
   approach, relays are allocated to sources based on a probabilistic relay
   assignment function, which is characterised by the outage probability.
   To examine the proposed relay assignment strategy, an exact expression
   for the outage probability of an opportunistic coded cooperation
   diversity system is derived. It is assumed that the relays in this
   system are distributed according to a two-dimensional homogeneous
   Poisson point process, and the transmission channels undergo Rayleigh
   fading as well as path loss. It is observed that the proposed strategy
   reduces the number of requests for using the relays and, thus, utilises
   the relays more efficiently. Furthermore, compared to the conventional
   opportunistic relay assignment strategy, the total power consumed by the
   relays decreases, while the quality of service requirements are still
   satisfied.}},

Abstract = {{Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an integral part of the
   hydrological cycle and represents an important aspect of land-ocean
   interactions. We used a numerical model to simulate flow and salt
   transport in a nearshore groundwater aquifer under varying wave
   conditions based on yearlong random wave data sets, including storm
   surge events. The results showed significant flow asymmetry with rapid
   response of influxes and retarded response of effluxes across the seabed
   to the irregular wave conditions. While a storm surge immediately
   intensified seawater influx to the aquifer, the subsequent return of
   intruded seawater to the sea, as part of an increased SGD, was gradual.
   Using functional data analysis, we revealed and quantified retarded,
   cumulative effects of past wave conditions on SGD including the fresh
   groundwater and recirculating seawater discharge components. The
   retardation was characterized well by a gamma distribution function
   regardless of wave conditions. The relationships between discharge rates
   and wave parameters were quantifiable by a regression model in a
   functional form independent of the actual irregular wave conditions.
   This statistical model provides a useful method for analyzing and
   predicting SGD from nearshore unconfined aquifers affected by random
   waves.}},

Abstract = {{Key points
   A slow adjustment of skeletal muscle oxygen uptake (V \&\#775;O2) to
   produce energy during exercise predisposes to early fatigue.
   In human studies, V \&\#775;O2 kinetics are slow when exercise is
   initiated from an elevated baseline; this is proposed to reflect slow
   blood flow regulation and/or recruitment of muscle fibres containing few
   mitochondria.
   To investigate this, we measured V \&\#775;O2 kinetics in canine muscle,
   with experimental control over muscle activation and blood flow.
   We found that V \&\#775;O2 kinetics remained slow when contractions were
   initiated from an elevated baseline despite experimentally increased
   blood flow and uniform fibre activation.
   These data challenge our current understanding of the control of muscle
   V \&\#775;O2 and demand consideration of new alternative mediators for V
   \&\#775;O2 control.
   Oxygen uptake kinetics (tau V \&\#775;O2) are slowed when exercise is
   initiated from a raised metabolic rate. Whether this reflects the
   recruitment of muscle fibres differing in oxidative capacity, or slowed
   blood flow (Q \&\#775;) kinetics is unclear.
   This study determined tau V \&\#775;O2 in canine muscle in situ, with
   experimental control over muscle activation and Q \&\#775; during
   contractions initiated from rest and a raised metabolic rate. The
   gastrocnemius complex of nine anaesthetised, ventilated dogs was
   isolated and attached to a force transducer. Isometric tetanic
   contractions (50Hz; 200ms duration) via supramaximal sciatic nerve
   stimulation were used to manipulate metabolic rate: 3min stimulation at
   0.33Hz (S1), followed by 3min at 0.67Hz (S2). Circulation was initially
   intact (SPON), and subsequently isolated for pump-perfusion (PUMP) above
   the greatest value in SPON. Muscle V \&\#775;O2 was determined
   contraction-by-contraction using an ultrasonic flowmeter and venous
   oximeter, and normalised to tension-time integral (TTI). tau V
   \&\#775;O2/TTI and tau Q \&\#775; were less in S1(SPON) (mean +/- s.d.:
   13 +/- 3s and 12 +/- 4s, respectively) than in S2(SPON) (29 +/- 19s and
   31 +/- 13s, respectively; P<0.05). tau V \&\#775;O2/TTI was unchanged by
   pump-perfusion (S1(PUMP), 12 +/- 4s; S2(PUMP), 24 +/- 6s; P<0.001)
   despite increased O-2 delivery; at S2 onset, venous O-2 saturation was
   21 +/- 4\% and 65 +/- 5\% in SPON and PUMP, respectively. V \&\#775;O2
   kinetics remained slowed when contractions were initiated from a raised
   metabolic rate despite uniform muscle stimulation and increased O-2
   delivery. The intracellular mechanism may relate to a falling energy
   state, approaching saturating ADP concentration, and/or slowed
   mitochondrial activation; but further study is required.
   These data add to the evidence that muscle V \&\#775;O2 control is more
   complex than previously suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The quaternary system of bile salt (BS)-lecithin (L)-cholesterol
   (Ch)-water has been mainly employed to simulate the in vitro formation
   of cholesterol gallstones. In this work, a quinary system of bile salt
   (BS)-lecithin (L)-cholesterol (Ch)-inorganic salt (Ca2+)-water was
   developed to study the nucleation of cholesterol crystals from a
   thermodynamic standpoint. The accurate concentration of each component
   in the freshly prepared biles and after incubation was analyzed by high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The micelles, vesicles
   and,crystals formed in the biles were characterized by quasielastic
   light scattering (QLS) and polarizing microscope, respectively. The
   results show that, under different concentrations of above five
   components at 37 C the model biles can finally disperse as one phase
   (micelles), two phases (micelles and vesicles, micelles and crystals) or
   three phases (micelles, vesicles and crystals). The mean diameter of
   BS-L micelles in the one phase region is about 5.7 nm, whereas that of
   Ch-L vesicles in the phase region of micelles and vesicles is about
   362.4 nm. In addition, the introduction of Ca2+ will decrease the
   solubility of cholesterol in model biles and thus will shorten the
   nucleation time of cholesterol crystals, which indicates that Ca2+ plays
   an important role in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. (C)

Abstract = {{This study analyses issues and limitations regarding the definition of
   the local volumetric rate of photon absorption (LVRPA) in an annular
   Photo-CREC Water II reactor. This analysis is carried out in order to
   establish the influence of the scattering phase functions and boundary
   conditions (BC) on the LVRPA. To) accomplish this, macroscopic radiation
   quantities such as the total rate of photon absorption (TRPA) and the
   total transmitted radiation (TT) as functions of pholocatalyst
   concentration are experimentally determined. On the other hand, the
   radiative transfer equation (RTE) is solved using a Monte Carlo method
   (MC). Boundary conditions accounting for lamp absorption/re-emission
   effects and diffuse reflection/absorption at the inner and outer reactor
   walls are employed. The Henyey-Greenstein and the binomial phase
   functions are used to simulate both forward and backward scattering
   phase functions. The significant influence of the phase functions on the
   radiation field is assessed for various BCs. Simulation results show
   that in annular photo reactors, the sensitivity of the LVRPA towards the
   ``g{''} scattering parameter increases when ``g{''} is set in the
   forward scattering range. Moreover, the comparison with experimental
   macroscopic quantities proves that Degussa P25 displays mostly forward
   scattering. The investigation of various possible BCs also proves that
   TT and TRPA fitting yields scattering parameters in restricted ranges.
   Consideration of the more physically sound BCs applicable in the
   Photo-CREC Water II, with complete absorption in the outer wall leads to
   a ``g{''} value in the 0.6-0.8 range. It is proven that the MC
   simulation and the use of TT measurements in the PhoLo-CREC-Water II
   reactor with selected BCs are of critical importance for establishing
   phase functions and scattering parameters in photo catalytic reactors.

Abstract = {{This study aimed to examine the effects of sex and sport on the tissue
   composition of the distal lower extremity of varsity athletes, in sports
   that involve repetitive-impact loading patterns. Fat mass, lean mass,
   bone mineral content and wobbling mass were predicted for the leg and
   leg+foot segments of varsity basketball, cross-country, soccer and
   volleyball athletes. The absolute masses were normalised to body mass,
   and also expressed relative to each other as ratios. Females and males
   differed on most normalised tissue masses and ratios by 11-101\%.
   Characteristic differences were found in the normalised tissue masses
   across sports, with the lowest and highest values displayed by
   cross-country and volleyball (female)/basketball (male) athletes,
   respectively. Conversely, cross-country athletes had the highest
   wobbling mass:bone mineral content and lean mass:bone mineral content
   ratios for females by 10\% and 16\%, respectively. The differences
   between sports may be explained in part by different impact loading
   patterns characteristic of each sport. Tissue mass ratio differences
   between sports may suggest that the ratios of soft to rigid tissues are
   optimised by the body in response to typical loading patterns, and may
   therefore be useful in investigations of distal lower extremity injury

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Since its development in the early 1980's the force balance technique
   has become a standard method in the efficient determination of
   structural loads and responses. Its usefulness lies in the simplicity of
   the physical model, the relatively short records required from the wind
   tunnel testing and its versatility in the use of the data for different
   sets of dynamic properties. Its major advantage has been the ability to
   provide results in a timely manner, assisting the structural engineer to
   fine-tune their building at an early stage of the structural
   development. The analysis of the wind tunnel data has evolved from the
   simple un-coupled system to sophisticated methods that include the
   correction for non-linear mode shapes, the handling of complex geometry
   and the handling of simultaneous measurements on multiple force balances
   for a building group. This paper will review some of the components in
   the force balance data analysis both in historical perspective and in
   its current advancement. The basic formulation of the force balance
   methodology in both frequency and time domains will be presented. This
   includes all coupling effects and allows the determination of the
   resultant quantities such as resultant accelerations, as well as various
   load effects that generally were not considered in earlier force balance
   analyses. Using a building model test carried out in the wind tunnel as
   an example case study, the effects of various simplifications and
   omissions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the gas-solids
   two-phase flow in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) riser is carried
   out. The Eularian-Eularian method with the kinetic theory of granular
   flow is used to solve the gas-solids two-phase flow in the CFB riser.
   The wall boundary condition of the riser is defined based on the Johnson
   and Jackson wall boundary theory (Johnson \& Jackson, 1987) with
   specularity coefficient and particle-wall restitution coefficient, The
   numerical results show that these two coefficients in the wall boundary
   condition play a major role in the predicted solids lateral velocity,
   which affects the solid particle distribution in the CFB riser. And the
   effect of each of the two coefficients on the solids distribution also
   depends on the other one. The generality of the CFD model is further
   validated under different operating conditions of the CFB riser. (C)

Title = {{Conditional Knockout of CTGF Affects Corneal Wound Healing}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. This study aimed to elucidate the role of connective tissue
   growth factor (CTGF) in healthy eyes and wounded corneas of mice and
   rabbits. Conditional knockout mice were used to determine the role of
   CTGF in corneal healing.
   METHODS. CTGF expression was determined using transgenic mice carrying
   CTGF promoter driven-eGFP, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunofluorescent
   staining. Mice that carried two floxed CTGF alleles and a Cre/ERT2
   transgene under the control of human ubiquitin C (ubc) promoter were
   used to conditionally delete CTGF gene in a tamoxifen-inducible manner.
   Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) was used to generate an acute corneal
   wound and corneal re-epithelialization was assessed by fluorescein
   staining.
   RESULTS. Connective tissue growth factor expression was found in
   multiple ocular tissues with relatively high levels in the corneal
   endothelium, lens subcapsular epithelium, and in the vasculature of the
   iris and retina. Wounded corneas responded with an immediate
   upregulation of CTGF in the epithelium at the wound margin and a
   sustained CTGF induction during re-epithelialization. At the onset of
   haze formation, CTGF protein becomes more focused in the basal
   epithelium. Deletion of the CTGF gene caused a 40\% reduction (P < 0.01)
   in the cornea re-epithelialization rate in knockout mice compared with
   wild-type mice.
   CONCLUSIONS. Connective tissue growth factor is expressed in the naive
   cornea, lens, iris, and retina, and is expressed immediately after
   epithelial injury. Loss of CTGF impairs efficient reepithelialization of
   corneal wounds.}},

Abstract = {{Extraction of medicinally active components from natural health products
   has become an emerging source for drug discovery. Of particular interest
   for this work was the finding and testing of a new ginsenoside from
   North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius). In the present study, a
   large amount of 6 `'-O-acetylginsenoside Rb-1, compound 7, was found
   using ultrasonic extraction of North American ginseng with DMSO aqueous
   solution. This new ginsenoside was well identified with MS, FTIR, and 1D
   (H-1 and C-13) and 2D (gCOSY, gHSQC, and gHMBC) NMR. Subsequent bioassay
   experiments confirmed that compound 7 demonstrated an additional
   immunosuppressive activity towards inhibiting the production of nitric
   oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha in lipopolysaccharide-induced
   macrophage cells in a dose-dependent manner using murine macrophages.
   This new ginsenoside is encouraging for the further exploration and

Abstract = {{The modelling of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels requires electrical
   parameters which are dependent on the manufacturing materials and their
   physical properties. Manufacturers typically do not disclose detailed
   physical properties of the PV module, except for some electrical
   quantities such as open circuit voltage (V-oc), short-circuit current
   (I-sc), maximum power point voltage (V-m), maximum power point current
   (I-m) and maximum power (P-M). However, to model the PV panels
   comprehensively, it is necessary to determine other physical parameters,
   e.g., series resistance of PV cell (R-s), shunt resistance of PV cell
   (R-Sh) and diode ideality factor (n). This paper presents a generalised
   mathematical model of a PV panel utilising only the quantities provided
   in manufacturer's datasheet. The proposed modelling technique determines
   all the PV panel parameters without any explicit repetitive iteration.
   Although the developed model is general and can be implemented on any
   software platform, its implementation is demonstrated on a commercial
   electromagnetic transients simulation software electro magnetic
   transient including direct current power systems computer aided design.
   The electrical parameters obtained from the proposed PV panel model are
   validated for six different commercially available PV panels from their
   datasheet values and also from measurements provided by National
   Institute of Standards and Technology for solar irradiation and
   temperature at nonstandard test conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of mortality
   worldwide and is associated with irreversible cardiomyocyte death and
   pathological remodeling of cardiac tissue. In the past 15 years, several
   animal models have been developed for pre-clinical testing to assess the
   potential of stem cells for functional tissue regeneration and the
   attenuation of left ventricular remodeling. The promising results
   obtained in terms of improved cardiac function, neo-angiogenesis and
   reduction in infarct size have motivated the initiation of clinical
   trials in humans. Despite the potential, the results of these studies
   have highlighted that the effective delivery and retention of viable
   cells within the heart remain significant challenges that have limited
   the therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapies for treating the
   ischemic myocardium. In this review, we discuss key elements for
   designing clinically translatable cell delivery approaches to promote
   myocardial regeneration. Key topics addressed include cell selection,
   with a focus on mesenchymal stem cells derived from the bone marrow
   (bMSCs) and adipose tissue (ASCs), including a discussion of their
   potential mechanisms of action. Natural and synthetic biomaterials that
   have been investigated as injectable cell delivery vehicles for cardiac
   applications are critically reviewed, including an analysis of the role
   of the biomaterials themselves in the therapeutic scheme. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to investigate the effect of bottom

   was found to be complex and three-dimensional due to the interactions of
   buoyancy-induced rising plumes of warm fluid, falling parcels of cold
   fluid and the shear flow. The mean streamwise velocity profiles were
   altered by bottom wall heating; and back flow was induced in the upper
   half of the channel when GrIRe(2) > 55. The bottom wall temperatures
   were found to have more significant influence on the turbulent velocity
   magnitudes than the flow rate. The Reynolds stress became negative in
   the channel core region indicating the momentum transfer from the
   turbulent velocity field to the buoyancy field. The POD analysis
   revealed the presence of convective cells primarily in the lower half of

Abstract = {{The uniqueness and form of the critical state line for sands have been
   widely debated in the literature when particles crush. In this paper,
   the large-displacement behaviors of two clean sands and a silty sand are
   studied using ring shear and triaxial compression shear tests.
   Significant particle damage occurred in the shear bands of the ring
   shear tests. At very large shear displacements (>10 m in the ring shear
   tests), particle damage and rearrangement/reorientation were complete in
   the ring shear tests, and a state of constant shear stress, constant
   effective stress, and constant volume was achieved in the crushed sand.
   Accordingly, a new definition is proposed for the residual state of
   damaged (crushed) sands, which is reached only within the shear band. It
   is shown that the critical state of the original sand (without particle
   crushing) and the residual state (with particle crushing) are
   independent of sand fabric (moist tamping and air pluviation) and
   consolidation stress (approximate to 29-770 kpa), and the same critical
   state is established in ring shear and triaxial compression shear tests.
   A unique residual state line is proposed for sands when particle damage
   occurs, which is significantly steeper than the critical state line.}},

Title = {{Energy modeling of photovoltaic thermal systems with corrugated unglazed

Abstract = {{Building-integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPV/T) systems with unglazed
   transpired solar collectors (UTCs) can provide a key solution for
   on-site electricity and thermal energy generation. Although the energy
   saving potential of this technology is significant, no systematic
   thermal analysis model has been developed for optimal system design and
   integration with building operation. This paper is the first of two
   companion papers focused on modeling and performance analysis of BIPV/T
   systems with UTC. In Part 1, energy models are presented for two
   configurations: UTC only and UTC with PV panels, to predict the cavity
   exit air temperature and plate surface temperature with weather
   (incident solar radiation, ambient air temperature, dew point
   temperature and wind speed) and design (airflow rate or suction velocity
   and geometry) parameters used as inputs. Nusselt number and
   effectiveness correlations, representing both the exterior and interior
   convective heat transfer processes, have been obtained from
   experimentally validated, three-dimensional, Reynolds-Averaged Navier
   Stokes (RANS), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, using
   high resolution grids and the ReNormalization Group Methods k-epsilon
   (RNG k-epsilon) turbulence closure model. The energy models were
   validated with measurements in an outdoor test-facility. Good agreement
   was observed between the model prediction and the experimental data,
   with the root mean square error (RMSE) being within 1 degrees C for the
   UTC-only model and within 2 degrees C for the model of UTC with PIT
   modules. In the companion paper, Part 2, the effects of important
   parameters on system performance are demonstrated based on information
   from the literature and simulations using CFD and energy models. The
   optimal geometry is investigated for both configurations and the
   performance curves, under different levels of solar radiation, wind
   speed and suction velocity, are presented to provide guidelines for
   system design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The modulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype is an
   essential element to fabricate engineered conduits of clinical
   relevance. In vivo, owing to their close proximity, endothelial cells
   (ECs) play a role in VSMC phenotype switching. Although considerable
   progress has been made in vascular tissue engineering, significant
   knowledge gaps exist on how the contractile VSMC phenotype is induced at
   the conclusion of the tissue fabrication process. The objectives of this
   study were as follows: (1) to establish ligand presentation modes on
   transcriptional activation of VSMC-specific genes, (2) to develop a
   three-dimensional (3D) coculture model using human coronary artery
   smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) and human coronary artery endothelial
   cells (HCAECs) on porous synthetic scaffolds and, (3) to investigate
   EC-mediated Notch signaling in 3D cultures and the induction of the
   HCASMC contractile phenotype. Whereas transcriptional activation of
   VSMC-specific genes was not induced by presenting soluble Jagged1 and
   Jagged1 bound to protein G beads, a direct link between HCAEC-bound
   Jagged1 and HCASMC differentiation genes was observed. Our 3D culture
   results showed that HCASMCs seeded to scaffolds and cultured for up to
   16 days readily attached, infiltrated the scaffold, proliferated, and
   formed dense confluent layers. HCAECs, seeded on top of an HCASMC layer,
   formed a distinct, separate monolayer with cell-type partitioning,
   suggesting that HCAEC growth was contact inhibited. While we observed EC
   monolayer formation with 200,000 HCAECs/scaffold, seeding 400,000
   HCAECs/scaffold revealed the formation of cord-like structures akin to
   angiogenesis. Western blot analyses showed that 3D coculture induced an
   upregulation of Notch3 receptor in HCASMCs and its ligand Jagged1 in
   HCAECs. This was accompanied by a corresponding induction of the
   contractile HCASMC phenotype as demonstrated by increased expression of
   smooth muscle-alpha-actin (SM-alpha-actin) and calponin. Knockdown of
   Jagged1 with siRNA showed a reduction in SM-alpha-actin and calponin in
   cocultures, identifying a link between Jagged1 and the expression of
   contractile proteins in 3D cocultures. We therefore conclude that the
   Notch3 signaling pathway is an important regulator of VSMC phenotype and
   could be targeted when fabricating engineered vascular tissues.}},

Abstract = {{In series-compensated transmission lines, current and voltage signals
   measured by the line protection system include considerable

   phasor-based fault location. This paper presents an accurate algorithm
   which effectively filters out unwanted frequency components and noise to
   perform accurate phasor estimation for fault location in
   series-compensated transmission lines. Phasor estimation of a
   theoretical signal is first evaluated by using the proposed method,
   direct Prony analysis, and four-cycle discrete Fourier transform
   algorithm. Then, various fault locations of a 500-kV series-compensated
   transmission line simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC are used to comprehensively
   evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. It is shown that the
   proposed method can effectively attenuate SSFCs and other unwanted

Title = {{SPECT-based functional lung imaging for the prediction of radiation
   pneumonitis: A clinical and dosimetric correlation}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   When we irradiate lung cancer, the radiation dose that can be delivered
   safely is limited by the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in the
   surrounding normal lung. This risk is dose-dependent and is commonly
   predicted using metrics such as the V20, which are usually formulated
   assuming homogeneous pulmonary function. Because in vivo pulmonary
   function is not homogeneous, if highly functioning lung can be
   identified beforehand and preferentially avoided during treatment, it
   might be possible to reduce the risk of RP, suggesting the utility of
   function-based prediction metrics.
   Methods
   We retrospectively identified 26 patients who received ventilation and
   perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT)
   immediately prior to curative-intent radiation therapy. Patients were
   separated into non-RP and RP groups. As-treated dose-volume histogram
   (DVH), perfusion-SPECT-based and ventilation-SPECT-based dose-function
   histogram (DFH) parameters were defined for each group and were tested
   for differences. The relative utilities of ventilation-based and
   perfusion-based DFH metrics were assessed using receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) analysis.
   Results
   The standard mean lung dose (MLD) was significantly higher in the RP
   group; the standard V20 and V30 were higher in the RP group but not
   significantly. Perfusion-weighted and ventilation-weighted values of the
   MLD, V20 and V30 were all significantly higher in the RP group. ROC
   analysis suggested that SPECT-based DFH parameters outperformed standard
   DVH parameters as predictors of RP.
   Conclusions
   SPECT-based DFH parameters appear to be useful as predictors of RP.}},

Title = {{An empirical study on the use of mutant traces for diagnosis of faults
   in deployed systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{29-44}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Debugging deployed systems is an arduous and time consuming task. It is
   often difficult to generate traces from deployed systems due to the
   disturbance and overhead that trace collection may cause on a system in
   operation. Many organizations also do not keep historical traces of
   failures. On the other hand earlier techniques focusing on fault
   diagnosis in deployed systems require a collection of passing-failing
   traces, in-house reproduction of faults or a historical collection of
   failed traces. In this paper, we investigate an alternative solution. We
   investigate how artificial faults, generated using software mutation in
   test environment, can be used to diagnose actual faults in deployed
   software systems. The use of traces of artificial faults can provide
   relief when it is not feasible to collect different kinds of traces from
   deployed systems. Using artificial and actual faults we also investigate
   the similarity of function call traces of different faults in functions.
   To achieve our goal, we use decision trees to build a model of traces
   generated from mutants and test it on faulty traces generated from
   actual programs. The application of our approach to various real world
   programs shows that mutants can indeed be used to diagnose faulty
   functions in the original code with approximately 60-100\% accuracy on
   reviewing 10\% or less of the code; whereas, contemporary techniques
   using pass-fail traces show poor results in the context of software
   maintenance. Our results also show that different faults in closely
   related functions occur with similar function call traces. The use of
   mutation in fault diagnosis shows promising results but the experiments
   also show the challenges related to using mutants. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   In the considered scenario, the secondary users utilize the sequential
   ratio test to sense the wireless channel looking for the presence of a
   transmitting primary user. A Fusion Centre (FC) gathers the decisions
   from the secondary users in order to perform a sequential ratio test and
   achieve a final verdict. The instance when the FC starts collecting the
   decisions is optimized in such way that the total time to make a
   decision is minimized. This allows for a better energy usage from the
   secondary users along with a reliable and fast detection of the primary
   user. Some numerical examples are considered in order to validate our

Title = {{An anthropometric study of the distal humerus}},

Abstract = {{Background: The optimal articular shape for distal humeral
   hemiarthroplasty has not been defined because of a paucity of data
   quantifying the morphology of the normal distal humerus. This study
   defines the osseous anatomy and anatomic variability of the distal
   humerus using 3-dimensional imaging techniques.
   Methods: Three-dimensional surface models were created from computed
   tomography scans obtained from 50 unpaired human cadaveric elbows.
   Geometric centers of the capitellum and the trochlear groove defined the
   anatomic flexion-extension axis. A coordinate system was created, and
   the distal humerus was sectioned into 100 slices along this axis. The C
   line was defined as the line of best fit connecting the geometric
   centers of each of the slices.
   Results: The anatomic flexion-extension axis of the distal humerus was
   found to be an average of 1 degrees perpendicular to 1 degrees from the
   C line (range, 0 degrees-3 degrees) in the coronal plane and 2 degrees
   +/- 1 degrees (range, 0 degrees-7 degrees) in the transverse plane. The
   average trochlear width was 22 +/- 3 mm, and the average trochlear
   height was 18 +/- 2 mm. The mean width of the capitellum was 17 +/- 2
   mm; the height was 23 +/- 2 mm (P<.001).
   Conclusions: The difference in the capitellum width and height
   demonstrates that the capitellum is ellipsoid, not spherical. A data
   bank of humeral dimensions may be used for the development of future
   distal humeral hemiarthroplasty implants. A more anatomic implant may
   optimize kinematics and maximize contact area, thus minimizing contact
   stresses on the native ulna and radius. (C) 2014 Journal of Shoulder and

Title = {{The Human Papillomavirus E7 Proteins Associate with p190RhoGAP and Alter

Abstract = {{Using mass spectrometry, we identified p190RhoGAP (p190) as a binding
   partner of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E7. p190 belongs to the
   GTPase activating protein (GAP) family and is one of the primary GAPs
   for RhoA. GAPs stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rho
   proteins, leading to Rho inactivation and influencing numerous
   biological processes. RhoA is one of the best-characterized Rho proteins
   and is specifically involved in formation of focal adhesions and stress
   fibers, thereby regulating cell migration and cell spreading. Since this
   is the first report that E7 associates with p190, we carried out
   detailed interaction studies. We show that E7 proteins from other HPV
   types also bind p190. Furthermore, we found that conserved region 3
   (CR3) of E7 and the middle domain of p190 are important for this
   interaction. More specifically, we identified two residues in CR3 of E7
   that are necessary for p190 binding and used mutants of E7 with
   mutations of these residues to determine the biological consequences of
   the E7-p190 interaction. Our data suggest that the interaction of E7
   with p190 dysregulates this GAP and alters the actin cytoskeleton. We
   also found that this interaction negatively regulates cell spreading on
   a fibronectin substrate and therefore likely contributes to important
   aspects of the HPV life cycle or HPV-induced tumorigenesis.}},

Title = {{Electromechanical response and failure modes of a dielectric elastomer
   tube actuator with boundary constraints}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As a widely used configuration for dielectric elastomer (DE) actuators,
   DE tube actuators (or cylindrical actuators) are also found to be
   susceptible to electromechanical instability (EMI), which may lead to a
   premature electrical breakdown (EB), and inhibit the potential actuation
   of DE actuators. This work investigates the electromechanical response
   of a DE tube actuator with and without boundary constraints to
   demonstrate an alternative to avoid EMI while achieving large actuation.
   Our simulation results based on the Gent strain energy model show that
   the EMI of a DE tube actuator can be eliminated, and larger actuation
   deformation can be achieved by applying boundary constraints. As a
   result of these constraints, consideration is also given to the possible
   mechanical buckling failure that may occur. Mechanisms of possible
   failure modes of constrained and unconstrained DE tube actuators, such
   as electromechanical instability, electrical breakdown and mechanical
   buckling, are elucidated. This paper should provide better theoretical
   guidance on how to improve the actuation performance of DE actuators,
   thus leading to the optimal design of DE-based devices.}},

Abstract = {{We report an experimental study investigating the thermal performance of
   a flat-plate solar collector using insert devices, over a Reynolds
   number range 200-8000 and a Prandtl number range 5-8, using water as the
   working fluid. A variety of conventional and novel insert configurations
   were considered which include, twisted-tape inserts, wire coil inserts
   and wire mesh insert. The results clearly indicate the enhancement of
   the Nusselt number by all insert devices. Comparison of the best inserts
   from different insert families show that in the laminar flow regime, the
   mesh insert performed the best whereas, the concentric coils achieved
   the highest Nusselt number augmentation in the turbulent regime,
   relative to the smooth pipe with no inserts. From the practical aspects,
   concentric coils were recommended as the best insert among those tested,
   which shows an overall Nusselt number enhancement of 110\% in the low
   Reynolds number range and 460\% in the high Reynolds number range. The
   impact of collector inclination of the performance of these insert
   devices was also investigated. The results show that the channel
   inclination does not have a significant impact on the Nusselt number
   enhancement. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Fast pyrolysis of birch bark sawdust with partial (air) oxidation was
   studied in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor at reaction temperatures of
   500 and 550 degrees C. The bio-oil vapors were fractionated using a
   series of three condensers maintained at desired temperatures, providing
   a dry bio-oil with less than 1 wt.\% water and over 93\% of the total
   bio-oil energy.
   Oxygen feed was varied to study its effect on yield, composition, and
   energy recovery in the gas, char and oil products. The addition of
   oxygen to the pyrolysis process increased the production of gases such
   as CO and CO2. It also changed the dry bio-oil properties, reducing its
   heating value, increasing its oxygen content, reducing its average
   molecular weight and its concentration of heavy bio-oil compounds, while
   increasing its viscosity and its phenolics concentration. The lower
   reaction temperature of 500 degrees C was preferred for both dry bio-oil
   yield and quality.
   Autothermal operation of the pyrolysis process was achieved with an
   oxygen feed of 0.08 g per g of biomass at the reaction temperatures of
   500 and 550 degrees C. At these two temperatures, when compared with the
   standard pyrolysis with pure nitrogen, the yield of dry bio-oil was
   reduced by 22\% and 31\%, whereas the total energy content of the dry
   bio-oil was reduced by 25\% and 34\%, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Almost all previously proposed single-stage, three-phase ac-dc
   converters are based on the boost converter, and the strengths and
   weaknesses of boost-based single-stage converters are well known. This
   is not the case for buck-based single-stage converters as little, if
   any, comparable research has been performed on these converters. The
   authors have previously investigated a three-phase ac-dc, single-stage
   buck-type converter that can simultaneously perform power factor
   correction and dc-dc conversion using the standard phase-shift
   pulse-width modulation technique for dc-dc full-bridge converters. This
   paper is a continuation of that work as its main focus is a comparison
   of the performance and characteristics of this converter with those of a
   modified version of the same converter. In this paper, the fundamental
   principles of both the converters are explained, the modes of operation
   of the modified converter are explained in detail and a procedure for
   the design of this converter is demonstrated with an example.
   Experimental results obtained from a prototype of the modified converter
   are presented and based on these results; the two converters are
   compared in terms of parameters such as input power factor and
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new integrated three-level ac-dc converter is
   presented. The proposed converter integrates the operation of the boost
   power factor correction and the three-level dc-dc converter. The
   converter is made to operate with two independent controllers-an input
   controller that performs power factor correction and regulates the dc
   bus and an output controller that regulates the output voltage. The
   input controller prevents the dc-bus voltage from becoming excessive
   while still allowing a single-stage converter topology to be used. The
   paper explains the operation of the new converter in detail and
   discusses its features and a procedure for its proper design.
   Experimental results obtained from a prototype are presented to confirm
   the feasibility of the new converter.}},

Abstract = {{A modular voltage-source inverter (MVSI) uses individual three-phase
   modules in a shunt connection to allow lower power rated inverters to be
   implemented in higher power applications. It is standard practice to
   implement each module with the same pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) pattern.
   This paper proposes a new PWM approach for MVSIs for which each module
   is made to operate with a different PWM pattern. It is shown in this
   paper how more output voltage harmonics can be eliminated with the new
   approach than with the standard approach and how the new approach can be
   expanded to significantly reduce zero-sequence current that circulates
   among the inverter modules. The mathematical formulations needed to
   generate appropriate PWM patterns for the new PWM approach and
   experimental results obtained from a prototype MVSI are presented in

Title = {{Viscoelastic effects on frequency tuning of a dielectric elastomer
   membrane resonator}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{As a recent application of dielectric elastomers (DEs), DE resonators
   have become an alternative to conventional silicon-based resonators used
   in MEMS and have attracted much interest from the research community.
   However, most existing modeling works for the DE resonators ignore the
   intrinsic viscoelastic effect of the material that may strongly
   influence their dynamic performance. Based on the finite-deformation
   viscoelasticity theory for dielectrics, this paper theoretically
   examines the in-plane oscillation of a DE membrane resonator to
   demonstrate how the material viscoelasticity affects the actuation and
   frequency tuning processes of the resonator. From the simulation
   results, it is concluded that not only the applied voltage can change
   the natural frequency of the resonator, but also the inelastic
   deformation contributes to frequency tuning. Due to the viscoelasticity
   of the material, the electrical loading rate influences the actuation
   process of the DE resonator, while it has little effect on the final
   steady frequency tuned by the prescribed voltage within the safety
   range. With the consideration of the typical failure modes of the
   resonator and the evolution process of the material, the tunable
   frequency range and the safe range of the applied voltage of the DE
   membrane resonator with different dimension parameters are determined in
   this work, which are found to be dependent on the electrical loading
   rate. This work is expected to provide a better understanding on the
   frequency tuning of viscoelastic DE membrane resonators and a guideline
   for the design of DE devices. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{NPAS3 variants in schizophrenia: a neuroimaging study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: This research is a one-site neuroimaging component of a
   two-site genetic study involving patients with schizophrenia at early
   and later stages of illness. Studies support a role for the neuronal
   Per-Arnt-Sim 3 (NPAS3) gene in processes that are essential for normal
   brain development. Specific NPAS3 variants have been observed at an
   increased frequency in schizophrenia. In humans, NPAS3 protein was
   detected in the hippocampus from the first trimester of gestation. In
   addition, NPAS3 protein levels were reduced in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex of some patients with schizophrenia. Npas3 knockout
   mice display behavioural, neuroanatomical and structural changes with
   associated severe reductions in neural precursor cell proliferation in
   the hippocampal dentate gyrus. This study will evaluate the hypothesis
   that the severe reductions in neural precursor cell proliferation in the
   dentate gyrus will be present to some degree in patients carrying
   schizophrenia-associated NPAS3 variants and less so in other patients.
   Methods/Design: Patients enrolled in the larger genetic study (n = 150)
   will be invited to participate in this neuroimaging arm. The genetic
   data will be used to ensure a sample size of 45 participants in each
   genetic subgroup of patients (with and without NPAS3 variants). In
   addition, we will recruit 60 healthy controls for acquisition of
   normative data. The following neuroimaging measures will be acquired
   from the medial temporal region: a) an index of the microcellular
   environment; b) a macro- structural volumetric measure of the
   hippocampus; and c) concentration levels of N-acetylaspartate, a marker
   of neuronal health.
   Discussion: This study will help to establish the contribution of the
   NPAS3 gene and its variants to brain tissue abnormalities in
   schizophrenia. Given the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the
   disorder and the large variation in outcomes, the identification of
   biological subgroups may in future support tailoring of treatment
   approaches in order to optimize recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Computational measurement of joint contact distributions offers the
   benefit of non-invasive measurements of joint contact without the use of
   interpositional sensors or casting materials. This paper describes a
   technique for indirectly measuring joint contact based on overlapping of
   articular cartilage computer models derived from CT images and
   positioned using in vitro motion capture data. The accuracy of this
   technique when using the physiological nonuniform cartilage thickness
   distribution, or simplified uniform cartilage thickness distributions,
   is quantified through comparison with direct measurements of contact
   area made using a casting technique. The efficacy of using indirect
   contact measurement techniques for measuring the changes in contact area
   resulting from hemiarthroplasty at the elbow is also quantified. Using
   the physiological nonuniform cartilage thickness distribution reliably
   measured contact area (ICC=0.727), but not better than the assumed bone
   specific uniform cartilage thicknesses (ICC=0.673). When a contact
   pattern agreement score (s(agree)) was used to assess the accuracy of
   cartilage contact measurements made using physiological nonuniform or
   simplified uniform cartilage thickness distributions in terms of size,
   shape and location, their accuracies were not significantly different (p
   > 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that cartilage contact
   can be measured indirectly based on the overlapping of cartilage contact
   models. However, the results also suggest that in some situations,
   inter-bone distance measurement and an assumed cartilage thickness may
   suffice for predicting joint contact patterns. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Pages = {{1657-1670}},

Abstract = {{Galloping refers to wind-induced, low-frequency, large-amplitude
   oscillations that have been more frequently observed for a bundle
   conductor than for a single conductor. In the present work two different
   models are built to investigate the galloping of a bundle conductor: (1)
   a finite curved beam element method and (2) a hybrid model based on
   curved beam element theory. The finite curved beam element model is
   effective in dealing with the spacers between the bundled conductors and
   the joint between the conductors and spacers that can be simulated as a
   rigid joint or a hinge. Furthermore, the finite curved beam element
   model can be used to deal with large deformation. The hybrid model
   invokes the small deformation hypothesis and has a high computational
   efficiency. A hybrid model based on conventional cable element theory is
   also programmed to be compared with the aforementioned models based on
   curved beam element theory. Numerical examples are presented to assess
   the accuracy of the different models in predicting the equilibrium
   conductor position, natural frequencies and galloping amplitude. The
   results show that the curved beam element models, involving more degrees
   of freedom and coupling of translational and torsional motion, are more
   accurate at simulating the static and dynamic characters of an iced
   quad-conductor bundle. The use of hinges, rather than rigid connections,
   reduces the structural response amplitudes of a galloping conductor
   bundle. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organic-inorganic hybrid films composed of nickel
   hexacyanoferrate/polyaniline (NiHCF/PANI) were successfully fabricated
   on a carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified Pt substrate using pulse
   potentiostatic method (PPM). Morphologies and structures of the
   as-prepared hybrid films were characterized using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The amounts and structures
   of PANI and NiHCF were respectively tuned by adjusting the operation
   conditions in PPM, and the films with homogeneous cubic NiHCF/PANI
   hybrid nano-particles exhibit high electrocatalytic property and
   ``insoluble{''} form of NiHCF were achieved. Due to the electrochemical
   oxidation effect of pulse potential, new functional groups such as
   hydroxyl, hydrogen sulfuric acid ester were introduced onto CNTs, which
   resulted in an acidic micro-environment for PANI to maintain its
   electroactivity in neutral aqueous solutions. Such hybrid films were
   applied for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection, and a linear dependence
   on H2O2 concentration in the range of 1.25 x 10(-6) to 2.95 x 10(-3) M
   (r = 0.998) with a high sensitivity of 3119 mA M-1 cm(-2) were obtained.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{135}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Oxidation of reactive mine tailings and subsequent generation of acid
   mine drainage (AMD) have been long recognized as the largest
   environmental concern for the mining industry. Laboratory studies on
   utilization of coal fly ash in management of reactive mine tailings have
   shown reducing water and oxygen infiltration into tailings matrix, thus
   preventing oxidation of sulphide minerals and acid generation. However,
   few data from field studies to evaluate the performance of co-placement
   of mine tailings and fly ash (CMF hereafter) are reported in the open
   literature. This paper documents the construction and instrumentation of
   three CMF systems on the Musselwhite mine located in Ontario, Canada and
   presents results of 3-year real time monitoring. The field data
   indicates that the CMFs reduced the ingress of water due to cementation
   generated by hydration of fly ash. It was also found that the electrical
   conductivity of leachate from CMFs decreased in the early stage of
   co-placement, compared to the control. With further study, the principle
   and approach demonstrated in this paper can be adopted as a sustainable
   technology in the mine tailings management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Volumetric scale-up of smouldering remediation of contaminated materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{268}},
Pages = {{51-60}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Smouldering remediation is a process that has been introduced recently
   to address non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contamination in soils and
   other porous media. Previous work demonstrated this process to be highly
   effective across a wide range of contaminants and soil conditions at the
   bench scale. In this work, a suite of 12 experiments explored the
   effectiveness of the process as operating scale was increased 1000-fold
   from the bench (0.003 m(3)) to intermediate (0.3 m(3)) and pilot
   field-scale (3 m(3)) with coal tar and petrochemical NAPLs. As scale
   increased, remediation efficiency of 97-99.95\% was maintained.
   Smouldering propagation velocities of 0.6-14 x 10(-5) m/s at Darcy air
   fluxes of 1.54-9.15 cm/s were consistent with observations in previous
   bench studies, as was the dependence on air flux. The pilot field-scale
   experiments demonstrated the robustness of the process despite
   heterogeneities, localised operation, controllability through airflow
   supply, and the importance of a minimum air flux for
   self-sustainability. Experiments at the intermediate scale established a
   minimum-observed, not minimum-possible, initial concentration of 12,000
   mg/kg in mixed oil waste, providing support for the expectation that
   lower thresholds for self-sustaining smouldering decreased with
   increasing scale. Once the threshold was exceeded, basic process
   characteristics of average peak temperature, destructive efficiency, and
   treatment velocity were relatively independent of scale. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Formaldehyde used in manufacture and curing of phenol formaldehyde (PF)
   resins is a big challenge for the PF industry with respect to
   sustainability and human health. Glucose has grand potential to replace
   formaldehyde in synthesis of bio-based phenolic novolac resins curable
   with hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, derived from formaldehyde), an
   obstacle to achieve formaldehyde-free curing. This study reports the
   curing of phenol-glucose novolac resin with a bis-phenol-A type epoxy
   without using HMTA. The curing process was investigated by using dynamic
   differential scanning calorimetry measurements at different heating
   rates. Apparent activation energy of the curing reaction is 109.6
   kJ/mol. Sestak-Berggren equation model was determined to be the reaction
   model according to Malek methods. The model-predicted reaction rates
   showed a good agreement with the experimental results. The results
   showed that the curing process was complicated; the kinetics expression
   was shown to be first-order autocatalytic reaction.}},

   produce hydrogen. The parametric study shows that the hydrogen yield is
   relatively insensitive to the steam/zinc molar ratio and inversely
   proportional to the argon/steam molar ratio. For large argon to steam
   molar ratios, hydrogen yield is relatively insensitive to the inlet
   temperature of zinc and steam, and increases marginally with an increase
   in the argon inlet temperature. Five different reactor configurations
   were evaluated comprehensively. Among all configurations, a cylindrical
   reactor with a tangential inlet for argon and zinc, and a radial inlet
   for steam (both in the bottom plane of the reactor) and a tangential
   outlet in the top plane of the reactor produced the highest hydrogen
   yield of 88\%. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) particles were injected into a
   contaminated sandy subsurface area in Sarnia, Ontario. The nZVI was
   synthesized on site, creating a slurry of 1 g/L nanoparticles using the
   chemical precipitation method with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the
   reductant in the presence of 0.8\% wt. sodium carboxymethylcellulose
   (CMC) polymer to form a stable suspension. Individual nZVI particles
   formed during synthesis had a transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   quantified particle size of 86.0 nm and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   quantified hydrodynamic diameter for the CMC and nZVI of 624.8 nm. The
   nZVI was delivered to the subsurface via gravity injection. Peak
   normalized total Fe breakthrough of 71\% was observed 1 m from the
   injection well and remained above 50\% for the 24 h injection period.
   Samples collected from a monitoring well 1 m from the injection
   contained nanoparticles with TEM-measured particle diameter of 80.2 nm
   and hydrodynamic diameter of 562.9 nm. No morphological changes were
   discernible between the injected nanoparticles and nanoparticles
   recovered from the monitoring well. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (EDS) was used to confirm the elemental composition of the iron
   nanoparticles sampled from the downstream monitoring well, verifying the
   successful transport of nZVI particles. This study suggests that CMC
   stabilized nZVI can be transported at least 1 m to the contaminated
   source zone at significant Fe-0 concentrations for reaction with target
   contaminants.}},

   deformations observed in steel braced Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames.
   To further enhance the seismic performance of these frames, the use of
   SMA bars to reinforce their beams is investigated in this paper.
   Three-story and nine-story SMA-braced RC frames are designed utilizing
   regular steel reinforcing bars. Their seismic performance is examined
   using twenty seismic ground motions. The frames are then re-designed
   using SMA reinforcing bars. Different design alternatives representing
   different locations for the SMA reinforcing bars are considered. The
   optimum locations for the SMA bars are identified after analysing the
   design alternatives. The seismic performance of these frames has
   indicated better deformability when SMA bars are used in the beams.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying cause of major cardiovascular events, such as myocardial
   infarctions and strokes, is atherosclerosis. For accurate diagnosis of
   this inflammatory disease, molecular imaging is required. Toward this
   goal, we sought to develop a nanoparticle-based, high aspect ratio,
   molecularly targeted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agent.
   Specifically, we engineered the plant viral nanoparticle platform
   tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to target vascular cell adhesion molecule
   (VCAM)-1, which is highly expressed on activated endothelial cells at
   atherosclerotic plaques. To achieve dual optical and MR imaging in an
   atherosclerotic ApoE(-/-) mouse model, TMV was modified to carry
   near-infrared dyes and chelated Gd ions. Our results indicate molecular
   targeting of atherosclerotic plaques. On the basis of the multivalency
   and multifunctionality, the targeted TMV-based MR probe increased the
   detection limit significantly; the injected dose of Gd ions could be
   further reduced 400x compared to the suggested clinical use,
   demonstrating the utility of targeted nanoparticle cargo delivery.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of published work shows that proton (hydrogen 1 {[}H-1])
   magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy has evolved from a research tool
   into a clinical neuroimaging modality. Herein, the authors present a
   summary of brain disorders in which MR spectroscopy has an impact on
   patient management, together with a critical consideration of common
   data acquisition and processing procedures. The article documents the
   impact of 1H MR spectroscopy in the clinical evaluation of disorders of
   the central nervous system. The clinical usefulness of 1H MR
   spectroscopy has been established for brain neoplasms, neonatal and
   pediatric disorders (hypoxia-ischemia, inherited metabolic diseases, and
   traumatic brain injury), demyelinating disorders, and infectious brain
   lesions. The growing list of disorders for which 1H MR spectroscopy may
   contribute to patient management extends to neurodegenerative diseases,
   epilepsy, and stroke. To facilitate expanded clinical acceptance and
   standardization of MR spectroscopy methodology, guidelines are provided
   for data acquisition and analysis, quality assessment, and
   interpretation. Finally, the authors offer recommendations to expedite
   the use of robust MR spectroscopy methodology in the clinical setting,
   including incorporation of technical advances on clinical units. (c)

Abstract = {{We developed novel methodology for investigating the use of quantitative
   relaxometry (T1 and T2) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for
   lateralization in temporal lobe epilepsy. Patients with mesial temporal
   sclerosis confirmed by pathology (N=.8) and non-MTS unilateral temporal
   lobe epilepsy (N=6) were compared against healthy controls (N=19) using
   voxelbased analysis restricted to the anterior temporal lobes, and
   laterality indices for each MRI metric (T1, T2, fractional anisotropy
   (FA), mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivities) were computed
   based on the proportion of significant voxels on each side. The
   diffusivity metrics were the most lateralizing MRI metrics in MTS and
   non-MTS subsets, with significant differences also seen with FA, T1 and
   T2. Patient-specific multi-modal laterality indices were also computed
   and were shown to clearly separate the left-onset and right-onset
   patients. Marked differences between left-onset and right-onset patients
   were also observed, with left-onset patients exhibiting stronger
   laterality indices. Finally, neocortical abnormalities were found to be
   more common in the non-MTS patients. These preliminary results on a
   small sample size support the further investigation of quantitative MRI
   and multi-modal image analysis in clinical determination of seizure
   onset. The presence of more neocortical abnormalities in the nonMTS
   group suggests a role in seizure onset or propagation and motivates the
   investigation of more sensitive histopathological analysis to detect and
   delineate potentially subtle neocortical pathology. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{60-74}},

Abstract = {{Fatigue failure of sign, luminaire, and traffic signal support
   structures has been observed. One of the causes is attributed to the
   along-wind loading (i.e., the natural wind gusts). The Canadian Highway
   Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) is not specific on the fatigue design wind
   pressure for these structures. The fatigue design wind load for the
   support structures recommended in American Association of State Highway
   and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) is developed based on the
   ``infinite-life{''} approach, and by assuming that the stress range can
   be estimated considering that the response due to natural wind gusts can
   be represented as a constant amplitude sinusoid. The adequacy of this
   assumption and the implied structural reliability by using the
   recommended fatigue design wind load are unknown. This study assesses
   the statistics of the stress range caused by natural wind gusts for the
   support structures that are amenable for simplified structural
   representation. The statistics are used together with a probabilistic
   model of hourly-mean wind speed and fatigue capacity to estimate the
   fatigue reliability. The results indicate that the recommended fatigue
   design requirement for the support structures in AASHTO results in a
   widely varying reliability index. This is because the recommendation
   does not take into account the damping ratio or stress cycles or
   spatially varying statistics of wind climate. The results are also used
   as the basis to suggest an alternative requirement for fatigue design.
   The parameters involved in the requirement are calibrated based on
   selected target reliability, and a ready to use Canadian wind map for
   the fatigue design is provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An effective numerical technique to calculate the reactions of a
   multi-spanned transmission line conductor system, under arbitrary loads
   varying along the spans, is developed. Such variable loads are generated
   by High Intensity Wind (HIW) events in the form of tornadoes and
   downburst. First, a semi-closed form solution is derived to obtain the
   displacements and the reactions at the ends of each conductor span. The
   solution accounts for the nonlinearity of the system and the flexibility
   of the insulators. Second, a numerical scheme to solve the derived
   closed-form solution is proposed. Two conductor systems are analyzed
   under loads resulting from HIW events for validation of the proposed
   technique. Non-linear Finite Element Analyses (FEA) are also conducted
   for the same two systems. The responses resulting from the technique are
   shown to be in a very good agreement with those resulting from the FEA,
   which confirms the technique accuracy. Meanwhile, the semi-closed form
   technique shows superior efficiency in terms of the required
   computational time. The saving in computational time has a great
   advantage in predicting the response of the conductors under HIW events,
   since this requires a large number of analyses to cover different
   potential locations and sizes of those localized events.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon coating is a simple, effective and common technique for improving
   the conductivity of active materials in lithium ion batteries. However,
   carbon coating provides a strong reducing atmosphere and many factors
   remain unclear concerning the interface nature and underlying
   interaction mechanism that occurs between carbon and the active
   materials. Here, we present a size-dependent surface phase change
   occurring in lithium iron phosphate during the carbon coating process.
   Intriguingly, nanoscale particles exhibit an extremely high stability
   during the carbon coating process, whereas microscale particles display
   a direct visualization of surface phase changes occurring at the
   interface at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a comprehensive
   understanding of the effect of particle size during carbon coating and
   the interface interaction that occurs on carbon-coated battery
   material-allowing for further improvement in materials synthesis and
   manufacturing processes for advanced battery materials.}},

Volume = {{254}},
Pages = {{407-415}},

Abstract = {{A new image processing method based on image calibration has been
   developed to visualize clusters in a Plexiglas rectangular circulating
   fluidized bed (CFB) riser at the fully developed region. A high speed
   video camera is adopted with FCC particles of 67 mu m used as the bed
   material. In order to make sure day-to-day shooting images reliable and
   comparable under the same light illumination during the whole shooting
   period, a reference plate is made first to verify the light illumination
   consistency. After the verification, the relationship between solids
   holdup and image grayscale is calibrated in the same riser with both
   calibration curve and equation obtained. With given solids holdup
   thresholds increasing from 0.01 to 0.1 cluster size clearly decreases
   while cluster solids holdup increases by transforming gray images into
   binary ones. The variation of cluster profiles with different thresholds
   also reveals that there is a solids holdup gradient inside the cluster
   with a lower value at the surface and a higher one in the core. The
   change in dense phase holdup or cluster population with operating
   conditions is indicated by the variation of the black area under given
   solids holdup thresholds, which compare well with the well-known fact
   reported by many previous studies: higher G(s) and lower U-g are
   beneficial for clusters with higher solids holdup to form, while lower
   G, and higher Ug induce clusters to breakup. This consistency proves
   that the image processing method developed in the present study is
   effective and very useful. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Micro computed tomography (MCT) shows detailed root canal
   morphology that is not seen with traditional tooth clearing. However,
   alternative image reformatting techniques in MCT involving 2-dimensional
   (2D) minimum intensity projection (MinIP) and 3-dimensional (3D)
   volume-rendering reconstruction have not been directly compared with
   clearing. The aim was to compare alternative image reformatting
   techniques in MCT with tooth clearing on the mesiobuccal (MB) root of
   maxillary first molars. Methods: Eighteen maxillary first molar MB roots
   were scanned, and 2D MinIP and 3D volume-rendered images were
   reconstructed. Subsequently, the same MB roots were processed by
   traditional tooth clearing. Images from 2D, 3D, 2D + 3D, and clearing
   techniques were assessed by 4 endodontists to classify canal
   configuration and to identify fine anatomic structures such as accessory
   canals, intercanal communications, and loops. Results: All image
   reformatting techniques in MCI showed detailed configurations and
   numerous fine structures, such that none were classified as simple type
   I or II canals; several were classified as types III and IV according to
   Weine classification or types IV, V, and VI according to Vertucci; and
   most were nonclassifiable because of their complexity. The clearing
   images showed less detail, few fine structures, and numerous type I
   canals. Classification of canal configuration was in 100\% intraobserver
   agreement for all 18 roots visualized by any of the image reformatting
   techniques in MCI but for only 4 roots (22.2\%) classified according to
   Weine and 6 (33.3\%) classified according to Vertucci, when using the
   clearing technique. Conclusions: The combination of 2D MinIP and 3D
   volume-rendered images showed the most detailed canal morphology and
   fine anatomic structures.}},

Volume = {{185}},

Abstract = {{The Canadian supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) can be modeled as
   a multiple-input multiple-output system. It has a high power-to-flow
   ratio, strong cross coupling, and a high degree of nonlinearity in its
   dynamic characteristics. Because of the existence of strong cross
   coupling among system inputs and outputs, it is difficult for a
   traditional control system design methodology to produce a satisfactory
   control system. In this paper, the direct Nyquist array method is used
   first to decouple the system into a diagonally dominant form via a
   precompensator. After decoupling the system successfully, three
   single-input single-output dynamic compensators are synthesized in the
   frequency domain. By using the precompensator, the temperature variation
   because of disturbances at the reactor power and pressure is
   significantly reduced. The control system can effectively maintain the
   overall system stability and regulate the plant around a specified
   operating condition. To deal with the nonlinearities, a control strategy
   based on gain scheduling is adopted. Different sets of controllers are
   used for the plant at different load conditions. The proposed control
   strategies have been evaluated under various operating scenarios. The
   robustness of the controller with respect to operating condition changes
   is also investigated. It is shown that the decoupling control can
   effectively reduce the cross coupling inherent in the Canadian SCWR, and
   gain scheduling control can successfully achieve satisfactory
   petformance for different operating conditions.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION \& BIODEGRADATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{83-90}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The ability of microorganisms to use polyethylene as a carbon source has
   only been recently established. This result has significance both from
   an environmental point of view, due to the accumulation of millions of
   tons of waste plastics every year, but also regarding the conservation
   of integrity for infrastructures incorporating this plastic. A number of
   microorganisms with the ability to grow on polyethylene have been
   isolated. The effects of these microorganisms on the physiochemical
   properties of this polymer have been described; these include changes in
   crystallinity, molecular weight, topography of samples and the
   functional groups found on the surface. Although the bio-degradation and
   bio-deterioration of polyethylene has been demonstrated by several
   researchers, the enzymes involved and mechanisms associated with these
   phenomena are still unclear. Nevertheless, it is recognized that both
   enzymatic and abiotic factors (such UV light) can mediate the initial
   oxidation of polyethylene chains, and given the chemical similarity
   between polyethylene and olefins it has been suggested that the
   metabolic pathways for degradation of hydrocarbons can be used once the
   size of polyethylene molecules decrease to an acceptable range for
   enzyme action (typically from 10 to 50 carbons). The long-range
   structure and morphology of polyethylene have shown important roles,
   with amorphous regions being more prone to microbial attack than
   crystalline ones. This review focuses on the recent hypotheses and
   experimental findings regarding the biodegradation of polyethylene. (C)

Abstract = {{Un-physiological loads play an important role in the degenerative
   process of inter-vertebral discs (IVD). In this study, we used an in
   vitro and in vivo rat model to investigate the mechanism of nucleus
   pulposus (NP) cells apoptosis induced by mechanical stress.
   Static compressive load to IVDs of rat tails was used as the in vivo
   model. For the in vitro model, NP cells were tested under the
   physiological and un-physiological loading. For histological
   examination, apoptotic index study, and apoptotic gene expression, we
   also selected cytokines {[}bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2/7,
   insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, platelet-derived growth factor
   (PDGF)] to be analyzed.
   Under mechanical loading, cellular density was significantly decreased,
   but there was an increase of TUNEL positive cells and apoptosis index.
   In a dose-dependent manner; the necrosis became apparent in the
   un-physiologic strain. The selected cytokines (BMP-2/7, IGF-1, PDGF) can
   significantly reduce the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells.
   We conclude that the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway plays
   an important role in the compressive load-induced apoptosis of NP cells.
   Combination therapy reducing the mechanical load and selected cytokines
   (BMP-2/7, IGF-1 and PDGF) may have considerable promise in the treatment
   of spine disc degeneration.}},

Title = {{Towards clinical prostate ultrasound elastography using full inversion
   approach}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Various types of cancers including prostate cancer are known to
   be associated with biological changes that lead to tissue stiffening.
   Digital rectal examination is based on manually palpating the prostate
   tissue via the rectum. This test lacks sufficient accuracy required for
   early diagnosis which is necessary for effective management of prostate
   cancer. To develop an effective prostate cancer diagnostic technique,
   the authors propose an imaging technique that maps the distribution of
   the relative prostate tissue's elasticity modulus. Unlike digital rectal
   examination, this technique is quantitative, capable of accurately
   detecting small prostate lesions that cannot be sensed by manual
   palpation, and its accuracy is independent of the physician's
   experience.
   Methods: The proposed technique is a quasistatic elastography technique
   which uses ultrasound imaging to acquire tissue displacements resulting
   from transrectal ultrasound mechanical stimulation. The system involves
   a standard ultrasound imaging unit with accessibility to its
   radiofrequency data. The displacements are used as data for the tissue
   elasticity reconstruction. This reconstruction does not require tissue
   segmentation and is based on physics governing tissue mechanics. It is
   formulated using an inverse problem framework where elastic tissue
   deformation equations are fully inverted using an iterative scheme where
   each iteration involves stress calculation followed by elastic modulus
   updating until convergence is achieved. In silico and tissue mimicking
   phantom studies were conducted to validate the proposed technique,
   followed by a clinical pilot study involving two prostate cancer
   patients with whole-mount histopathology analysis on prostatectomy
   specimens to confirm a cancer location.
   Results: The phantom studies demonstrated robustness and reasonably high
   accuracy of the proposed method. Obtained Young's modulus ratios
   indicated reconstruction errors of less than 12\%. Reconstructed elastic
   modulus images of the two clinical cases were compared to whole-mount
   histopathology slides where cancerous areas were identified. This
   comparison indicated marked tissue stiffening in the cancer area with
   reasonably accurate consistency observed between cancerous lesions
   identified by histopathology and high stiffness areas of the
   elastography images.
   Conclusions: Results obtained from the phantom and patient studies
   indicate that the proposed method is reasonably accurate for detecting
   cancerous lesions. The proposed system does not require any additional
   hardware attachment for mechanical stimulation or data acquisition while
   the elasticity reconstruction algorithm can be easily implemented,
   leading to a low cost system that can be potentially utilized as an
   effective clinical tool for prostate cancer diagnosis. c 2014 American
   Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{Reference wind velocity pressures corresponding to specified return
   period wind speeds are provided in several Canadian design codes. A
   review of the two most recent editions of the National Building Code of
   Canada (NBCC) indicates that significant changes in some 50-year return
   period wind speeds, vAH-50, were introduced in the 2010 version of the
   NBCC-2010 compared to the previous NBCC-2005. The changes are due to
   analysis approaches, available wind records, and a re-examination of
   anemometer histories. To potentially improve the estimates of vAH-50,
   wind records in the Environment Canada HLY01 digital archive were
   processed. Two hundred and thirty-five meteorological stations are
   considered in the analysis, and height and exposure corrected annual
   maximum hourly-mean wind speed, VAH, are extracted. Statistical analysis
   and distribution fitting were carried out using the Gumbel distribution
   and generalized extreme value distribution and several fitting methods
   were employed. The results indicate that it is preferable to treat VAH
   as a Gumbel variate, and to carry out the fit using the generalized
   least-squares method. Wind speed contour maps for Canada are developed
   based on the estimated vAH-T for T equal to 50, 500, and 1000 years. A
   comparison of the maps of vAH-50 to those inferred from NBCC-2005 and
   NBCC-2010 shows that the developed map retains some of the smoothness of
   the wind speeds exhibited in NBCC-2010, while maintains the localized
   wind speed features presented in NBCC-2005. Results also show that the
   wind speed corresponding to the factored design wind load in NBCC-2010
   is associated with a return period ranging from 200 to 5000 years, but
   for 90\% of stations considered, the range narrows to 300 to 900 years.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to develop and validate a finite element
   model of the distal radius to simulate impact loading. Eight-node
   hexahedral meshes of the bone and impactor components were created.
   Three separate impact events were simulated by altering the impact
   velocity assigned to the model projectile (pre-fracture, crack and
   fracture). Impact forces and maximum and minimum principal strains were
   calculated and used in the validation process by comparing with
   previously collected experimental data. Three measures of mesh quality
   (Jacobians, aspect ratios and orthogonality) and four validation methods
   (validation metric, error assessment, fracture comparisons and ensemble
   averages) assessed the model. The element Jacobians, aspect ratios and
   orthogonality measures ranged from 0.08 to 12, 1.1 to 26 and -70 degrees
   to 80 degrees, respectively. The force and strain validation metric
   ranged from 0.10 to 0.54 and 0.35 to 0.67, respectively. The estimated
   peak axial force was found to be a maximum of 28.5\% greater than the
   experimental (crack) force, and all forces fell within +/- 2 standard
   deviation of the mean experimental fracture forces. The predicted
   strains were found to differ by a mean of 33\% across all impact events,
   and the model was found to accurately predict the location and severity
   of bone damage. Overall, the model presented here is a valid
   representation of the distal radius subjected to impact.}},

Abstract = {{RNAi can specifically regulate gene expression, but efficient delivery
   of siRNA in vivo is difficult while it has been shown that modified
   carbon nanotubes (CNT) protect siRNA, facilitate entry into cells and

   polyethyleimine (PEI-SA). In this study, the water soluble CNT,
   PEI-SA/CNT (IS/C) were isolated and characterized, the gene silencing
   induced by IS/C/siRNA complexes was achieved in vitro in B16-F10 cells.
   In vivo delivery was topically applied to shaved mouse skin, as well as
   topically to a C57BL/6 mice melanoma model. We found significant uptake
   of Cy3-labeled siRNA specific to Braf (siBraf) and gene silencing in the

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the catalytic ozone
   decomposition reaction in a circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) riser, using
   iron-impregnated fluid catalytic cracking particles as catalyst, is
   carried out. The catalytic reaction is defined as a one-step reaction,
   and the reaction equation is modified by with respect to the particle
   surface area, A(p), and an empirical coefficient. The Eularian-Eularian
   method with the kinetic theory of granular flow is used to solve the
   gas-solids two-phase flow in the CFB riser. The simulation results are
   compared with experimental data, and the reaction rate is modified by
   using an empirical coefficient, to provide better simulation results
   than the original reaction rate. Moreover, the particle size has great
   effects on the reaction rate. The generality of the CFD model is further
   validated under different operating conditions of the riser.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured -Fe2O3 with and without fluorine substitution were
   successfully obtained by a green route, that is, microwave irradiation.
   The hematite phase materials were evaluated as a high-performance
   electrode material in a hybrid supercapacitor configuration along with
   activated carbon (AC). The presence of fluorine was confirmed through
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.
   Fluorine-doped Fe2O3 (F-Fe2O3) exhibits an enhanced pseudocapacitive
   performance compared to that of the bare hematite phase. The F-Fe2O3/AC
   cell delivered a specific capacitance of 71Fg(-1) at a current density
   of 2.25Ag(-1) and retained approximately 90\% of its initial capacitance
   after 15000cycles. Furthermore, the F-Fe2O3/AC cell showed a very high
   energy density of about 28Whkg(-1) compared to bare hematite phase
   (approximate to 9Whkg(-1)). These data clearly reveal that the
   electrochemical performance of Fe2O3 can be improved by fluorine doping,

Abstract = {{Objectives. To synthesize a glass-ceramic (GC) that is suitable for
   non-metallic one-piece dental implant application.
   Methods. Three glasses in a SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-CaF2-K2O-B2O3-P2O5-CeO2-Y2O3
   system were produced by wet chemistry. Differential thermal analysis
   (DTA) was carried out to determine the glass crystallization kinetic
   parameters and the heating schedules that were used for sintering of
   GCs. Crystalline phases and crystal morphologies were studied by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively.
   Mechanical properties of the GCs were determined by ultrasonic and
   indentation tests and its machinability were evaluated. Chemical
   durability was carried out according to ISO 6872, whereas testing
   chemical degradation in tris buffered solution was executed according to
   ISO 10993-14.
   Results. XRD of the GC specimens showed that wollastonite was the main
   crystalline with other secondary phases; GC2 had cristobalite as an
   additional phase. SEM of the GCs revealed dense acicular interlocking
   crystals. Young's modulus of elasticity (E), true hardness (H-o) and
   fracture toughness (K-IC) of the GCs were 89-100 GPa, 4.85-5.17 GPa and
   4.62-5.58 MPa m(0.5), respectively. All GCs were demonstrated excellent
   machinability. The GCs exhibited various chemical durability and
   degradation rates. K-1C values of the GCs following chemical durability
   testing were not significantly different from those of the original
   materials (p > 0.05). GC2 exhibited significantly higher K-1C value
   compared with GC1 and GC3 (p < 0.05) and its chemical durability
   satisfied ISO 6872 specification for dental ceramics.
   Significance. Wollastonite-cristobalite GC can be considered as a
   promising material for one-piece dental implant applications due to its
   strength, machinability and chemical durability. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{Membranes' response to lateral tension, and eventual rupture, remains
   poorly understood. In this study, pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
   (DPPC) lipid bilayers, under tension/pressure, were studied using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The irreversible membrane breakdown
   is demonstrated to depend on the amplitude of lateral tension, loading
   rate, and the size of the bilayer. In all of our simulations, -200 bar
   lateral pressure was found to be enough to rupture lipid membrane
   regardless of the loading rate or the membrane size. Loading rate and
   membrane size had a significant impact on rupture. A variety of dynamic
   properties of lipid molecules, probability distribution of area per
   lipid particularly, have been determined, and found to be fundamental
   for describing membrane behavior in detail, thus providing the
   quantitative description for the requirement of membrane rupture. (C)

Abstract = {{Many wind design codes provide recommended values of the drag
   coefficient for generic lattice frame geometries based on the solidity
   ratio. The solidity ratio of a lattice structure often varies along its
   length or height, resulting in a piecewise treatment in design. By
   definition, the solidity ratio is only dependent on the amount of solid
   area to the total enclosed area of a frame, and therefore does not
   account for member spacing or the number of members within the
   framework; this has implications for some nonuniform sections used in
   lattice tower design. Drag coefficients for many geometric
   configurations were measured in a wind tunnel with the focus placed on
   configurations having an identical solidity ratio but different member
   spacing ratios. It was observed that the drag coefficient varied with
   the member spacing ratio as well as with the number of members in the
   frame. The results suggest that the solidity ratio alone may not be
   sufficient for describing the drag coefficient of a lattice frame having
   a nonuniform solid area distribution. Recommendations are made for
   future research in this area, which may lead to better estimate of the
   drag coefficient for nonuniform lattice sections.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer matrix composites are seeing increased use in the automotive
   industry due to their significant potential for vehicle mass reduction,
   but are hampered by the lack of sufficient material models to predict
   their plastic deformation. Material models using fiber-matrix
   interfacial strength as an input show promise in predicting the
   inelastic mechanical properties. This study presents a new method to
   directly measure the interfacial shear and normal strengths via a model
   system. The lap-shear test is modified to measure the interfacial shear
   strength, while a modified tensile test is conducted to measure the
   interfacial normal strength. The degree of cure and the addition of
   silane coupling agents are introduced as independent variables to
   examine their effect on interfacial strengths. The experimental results
   for a glass/epoxy system are reported and are validated against
   traditional interfacial measurement tests. The lap shear test is a
   rapid, cost-effective tool to quantitatively measure the interfacial
   strength of a polymer composite system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{233-243}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{An experimental work is reported that studied the effect of mixed
   convection on the mean and turbulent flow structure in the near wall
   region inside a horizontal square channel heated from below at low
   Reynolds numbers (Re) and high Grashof numbers (Gr). The Gr/Re-2 values
   ranged from 9 to 106 indicating that natural convection was dominant
   over forced convection for all studied cases. Velocity fields were
   measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV) in the vertical mid
   plane and two horizontal planes close to the heated wall. The results
   show that the bottom wall heating altered the mean velocity field and
   induced turbulence. Both mean and turbulent velocity magnitudes showed
   partial dependency on the Gr/Re-2 ratio. In the higher range of Gr/Re-2,
   mean streamwise velocity showed larger magnitude whereas, in the lower
   range of Gr/Re-2, streamwise and spanwise turbulent velocities have
   larger magnitudes. The streamwise and spanwise turbulent velocity
   magnitudes were also found to be largest close to the heated wall. It
   was observed that in the vicinity of the heated wall, the warm fluid
   converges along the streaks which initiate the rising plumes while the
   falling parcels of cooler fluid disperse in the spanwise plane. (C) 2013

   Implant-Cement Interface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},

Abstract = {{The application of stem surface treatments and finishes are common
   methods for improving stem-cement interface stability in joint
   replacement systems; however, success of these surfaces has been
   variable. As opposed to applying a treatment or finish, altering stem
   design through changing the surface topography of the base stem material
   may offer some advantages. This study compared the effect of stem
   circumferential grooving on the torsional and axial stability of
   cemented stems. Fifteen metal stems were machined from cobalt chrome to
   have smooth (n = 5) or circumferential-grooved surfaces, where groove
   depth and spacing was either 0.6mm (n = 5) or 1.1mm (n = 5). Stems were
   potted in aluminum tubes using bone cement, left 24 h to cure, and
   placed in a materials testing machine for testing using a cyclic
   staircase loading protocol at 1.5 Hz. All stems were tested
   independently in compression and torsion on separate testing days, using
   the same stems repotted with new cement. Motion of the stem was tracked,
   and failure was defined either as rapid increase in stem motion, or
   completion of the loading protocol. Statistical analysis was used to
   compare interface strength and stem motion prior to failure. Grooved
   stems demonstrated increased interface strength (p < 0.001) and reduced
   motion (p < 0.01) compared to smooth stems under compression. In
   torsion, no significant difference was found in strength among the
   grooved and smooth stems (p = 0.10); however, grooved 1.1mm demonstrated
   greatest interface motion prior to catastrophic failure (p < 0.01).
   Overall, circumferential-grooved stems offered improved stability under
   compression, and comparable stability in torsion, relative to the smooth
   stems.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization
   has been known as a convenient method for the synthesis of polymers of
   designed molecular structures. Of particular interest are bifunctional
   or multifunctional chain-transfer agents (CTAs) which could be employed
   in the development of advanced materials via RAFT polymerization. In the
   present study, four bifunctional 2-(alkoxycarbonothioylthio) RAFT CTAs
   with COOH functionalities containing methoxy, ethoxy, isopropoxy, and
   octyloxy groups, respectively, were synthesized and characterized by
   FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. Polymerizations of vinyl acetate using these
   CTAs exhibited increased molecular weight with consumption of monomer
   and relatively narrow dispersities, indicative of living polymerization
   behavior. The effect of the concentration of 2-(ethoxycarbonothioylthio)
   acetic acid on the polymerization was examined, revealing that higher
   concentration of CTA led to lower molecular weight and narrower
   dispersity. As an example of the application of the synthesized
   bifunctional CTAs, TiO2-poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) nanocomposites were
   synthesized via a one-pot process and characterized by TGA, DSC, TEM,
   and affinity test, suggesting attachment of PVAc onto the nano-TiO2

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{A prediction model, which describes linear relationship between the
   nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and the in-cylinder heat release rate in
   a direct-injection diesel engine, was developed through numerical
   simulations. A modified KIVA-3 V code was used to calculate NOx
   formations and to conduct heat release analyses in a direct-injection
   diesel engine under different operating conditions. The numerical
   simulation results indicated that the NOx formation amount was related
   to both the magnitude and the timing of the peak heat release rate in
   each engine cycle. Based on the above observations, a control-oriented
   dynamic NOx model was constructed and then implemented into a feedback
   emission control system on a small diesel engine. A new
   parameter-combustion acceleration-was proposed in this research to
   describe the intensity of the premixed combustion. Experimental work was
   also conducted to measure the real-time in-cylinder pressure at each
   crank-angle when the engine was running and the heat release rate was
   calculated instantaneously to control an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)
   valve. The experimental results showed that the proposed NOx prediction
   model was effective in controlling NOx emissions under high rpm
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic cracking reactions, performed on commercial catalysts, are
   difficult to follow because of the simultaneous deactivation of the
   catalyst as consequence of coke deposition on catalyst surfaces during
   cracking of hydrocarbon molecules. In this work, a model for catalyst
   deactivation in terms of fouling because of blockage of micropores of
   the catalyst is used to estimate activity independently of reaction
   rates; later cracking kinetic rates of a model compound are estimated.
   It was found that the expected low energy of coke deposition reactions
   dominate the process, however these reactions are not easy to estimate a
   priori because of the definition of coke as a lumped entity. A
   comprehensive model of a CREC-Riser simulator Reactor is developed in
   order to consider mass balances for each specific operating condition.
   Three temperatures and two contact times are used to evaluate frequency
   factors and activation energies of the reactions that take place during
   the catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-tri-isopropyl benzene in two cases, with
   catalyst coming from an industrial unit and with catalyst pre-coked in

Abstract = {{Presence of contaminants, such as gasoline, moisture, and coolant in the
   engine lubricant indicates mechanical failure within the engine and
   significantly reduces lubricant quality. This paper describes a novel
   sensing system, its methodology and experimental verifications for
   analysis of the presence of contaminants in the engine lubricants. The
   sensing methodology is based on the statistical shape analysis
   methodology utilizing optical analysis of the distortion effect when an
   object image is obtained through a thin random optical medium. The
   novelty of the proposed sensing system lies within the employed
   methodology which an object with a known periodic shape is introduced
   behind a thin film of the contaminated lubricant. In this case, an
   acquired image represents a combined lubricant-object optical
   appearance, where an a priori known periodical structure of the object
   is distorted by a contaminated lubricant. The object, e.g. a stainless
   steel woven wire cloth with a mesh size of 65 x 65 mu m(2) and a
   circular wire diameter of 33 mu m was placed behind a microfluidic
   channel, containing engine lubricant and optical images of flowing
   lubricant with stationary object were acquired and analyzed. Several
   parameters of acquired optical images, such as, color of lubricant and
   object, object shape width at object and lubricant levels, object
   relative color, and object width non-uniformity coefficient, were
   proposed. Measured on-line parameters were used for optical analysis of
   fresh and contaminated lubricants. Estimation of contaminant presence
   and lubricant condition was performed by comparison of parameters for
   fresh and contaminated lubricants. Developed methodology was verified
   experimentally showing ability to distinguish lubricants with 1\%, 4\%,
   7\%, and 10\% coolant, gasoline and water contamination individually and
   in a combination form of coolant (0\%-5\%) and gasoline (0\%-5\%). Crown

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional printing was used to fabricate various metallic
   structures by directly integrating a Br-containing vinyl-terminated
   initiator into the 3D resin followed by surface-initiated
   atomic-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and subsequent electroless
   plating. Cu- and Ni-coated complex structures, such as microlattices,
   hollow balls, and even Eiffel towers, were prepared. Moreover, the
   method is also capable of fabricating ultralight cellular metals with
   desired structures by simply etching the polymer template away. By
   combining the merits of 3D printing in structure design with those of
   ATRP in surface modification and polymer-assisted ELP of metals, this
   universal, robust, and cost-effective approach has largely extended the
   capability of 3D printing and will make 3D printing technology more
   practical in areas of electronics, acoustic absorption, thermal

Abstract = {{In this study, biocompatible and proton-resistant CdSe quantum dots
   (QDs) assembled on gelatin nanospheres (GNs) have been synthesized by
   combining the two-step desolvation method with the layer-by-layer
   assembly technique. The core-shell fluorescent gelatin nanosphere
   consists of a gelatin core and a four-layer shell of hydrophilic CdSe
   QDs assembled through polyelectrolytes (PE). The morphology,
   microstructures, and photostability of the hybrid spheres were further
   investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), fluorospectrometery, and confocal fluorescent
   microscopy (CFM), respectively. The average diameter of the hybrid
   QDs-gelatin nanospheres (QDs-GNs) is estimated at 484 +/- 40 nm. Our
   results indicate that the 20 +/- 5 nm of the shell is attributed to the
   four-layer of CdSe QDs assembled through the PE. QD-GNs show a strong
   photoluminescence with the maximum emission (lambda(em)) at 613 nm at
   the excitation wavelength of 470 nm. The core-shell QDs-GNs are able to
   resist quenching in acidic solution (pH < 4). Furthermore, core-shell
   QDs-GNs show a longer lifetime in a broad range of pH values, from 9 to
   1. The calculated average lifetime (tau(ave)) of QDs-GNs is about 889
   +/- 23 ps, which is 3-fold longer than that of MUA-QDs (263 +/- 10 ps)
   at pH 7.0. The enhanced lifetime of QDs-GNs is almost 9 times of that of
   CdSe QDs when pH value is 1. Meanwhile, the cell viability study shows
   that no significant toxic effect is imposed on the NIH/3T3 mouse
   fibroblast cell line when the concentration of QD-GNs is below 5 mg/mL.
   It is expected that this new biocompatible fluorescent nanospheres could
   be an excellent alternative fluorescent imaging agent for cell labeling,
   especially in acidic conditions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{A scheme for terahertz (THz) generation from intraband transition in a
   self-assembled quantum dot (QD) molecule coupled to a metallic
   nanoparticle (MNP) is analyzed. The QD structure is described as a
   three-level atom-like system using the density matrix formalism. The MNP
   with spherical geometry is considered in the quasistatic approximation.
   A femtosecond laser pulse creates a coherent superposition of two
   subbands in the quantum dots and produces localized surface plasmons in
   the nanoparticle which act back upon the QD molecule via dipole-dipole
   interaction. As a result, coherent THz radiation with a frequency
   corresponding to the interlevel spacing can be obtained, which is
   strongly modified by the presence of the MNP. The peak value of the
   terahertz signal is analyzed as a function of nanoparticle's size, the
   MNP to QD distance, and the area of the applied laser field. In
   addition, we theoretically demonstrate that the terahertz pulse
   generation can be effectively controlled by making use of a train of
   femtosecond laser pulses. We show that by a proper choice of the
   parameters characterizing the pulse train a huge enhancement of the
   terahertz signal is obtained. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of moisture content on flowability of six pharmaceutical
   powders (microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
   (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), corn
   starch, and potato starch) was investigated. Powder flowability was
   measured using established static techniques and emerging dynamic
   avalanche behavior measurements. Static techniques did not provide
   enough resolution to clearly identify changes in flowability due to
   increasing powder moisture content. Avalanche time and its standard
   deviation showed that flowability of MCC, CMC, PVP, and potato starch
   decreased after a critical moisture content, flowability of corn starch
   increased and flowability did not significantly change for HPMC. The
   moisture decreased flowability by forming stronger interparticle liquid
   bridges and increased flowability by acting as a lubricant. The dynamic
   density of the celluloses and PVP decreased linearly with increasing
   moisture content as the particles swelled with water. The starches also
   swelled and decreased in dynamic density, but only after a moisture
   content corresponding to monolayer coverage of water around the
   particles was reached. As flowability and dynamic density change with
   moisture content, to ensure consistent production of high-quality
   tablets, the moisture content of the powders must be measured and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a framework for energy efficient resource
   allocation in multiuser localized SC-FDMA with synchronous HARQ
   constraints. Resource allocation is formulated as a two-stage problem
   where resources are allocated in both time and frequency. The impact of
   retransmissions on the time-frequency problem segmentation is handled
   through the use of a novel block scheduling interval specifically
   designed for synchronous HARQ to ensure uplink users do not experience
   ARQ blocking. Using this framework, we formulate the optimal margin
   adaptive allocation problem, and based on its structure, we propose two
   suboptimal approaches to minimize average power allocation required for
   resource allocation while attempting to reduce complexity. Results are
   presented for computational complexity and average power allocation
   relative to system complexity and data rate, and comparisons are made
   between the proposed optimal and suboptimal approaches.}},

Title = {{Supercritical fluid chromatography of North American ginseng extract}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{115-123}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) using supercritical carbon
   dioxide (scCO(2)) is considered as a ``green{''} separation method,
   particularly suitable for the isolation of thermally unstable bioactive
   components. However, co-solvent and additives are often required in the
   mobile phase due to the poor solubility of polar components in scCO(2).
   In the present study, the effect of temperature and pressure on the
   separation of ginsenosides was studied with methanol being added to the
   CO2 mobile phase. Acidic, basic, and ionic additives were introduced to
   the mobile phase, respectively, to study their effect on the separation
   of ginsenosides. The best separation conditions were achieved by adding
   trifluoroacetic acid in methanol (0.05\% v/v) at 50 degrees C and 150
   bar. A high-concentration component in the extracts from the
   supercritical fluid extraction of North American ginseng was isolated by
   SFC and identified as sucrose using NMR, HPLC, and ESI-MS. These results
   show that SEC is a promising technique for the separation, isolation,
   and identification of ginseng extracts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The author examined wind loads on low-profile, roof-mounted solar
   arrays, placed on large, low-rise buildings with nearly flat roofs by
   using scale models in a boundary layer wind tunnel. The author also
   examined the effects of building size and array geometry on enveloping
   curves of area-averaged pressure coefficients, typical of use for
   design. It was found that wind loads on the array increase with building
   size; normalizing the effective wind area by the building wall size
   leads to enveloping curves that collapse onto a single curve for each
   array geometry. For tilt angles less than 10 degrees, there is an
   approximate linear increase in the pressure coefficients as the tilt
   angle increases. For arrays with tilt angles of 10 degrees or more, the
   wind loads do not depend significantly on the tilt angle and are
   relatively constant. Roof zones for wind loads on solar arrays are
   larger than roof zones for bare roofs and depend on the array tilt
   angle.}},

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF TIME-DEPENDENT MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{293-308}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Stability of pseudoplastic rotational flow between cylinders in presence
   of an independent axial component is investigated. The fluid is assumed
   to follow the Carreau model and mixed boundary conditions are imposed.
   The conservation of mass and momentum equations give rise to a
   four-dimensional low-order dynamical system, including additional
   nonlinear terms in the velocity components originated from the
   shear-dependent viscosity. In absence of the axial flow, as the
   pseudoplasticity effects increases, the purely-azimuthal base flow loses
   its stability to the vortex structure at a lower critical Taylor number.
   Emergence of the vortices corresponds to the onset of a supercritical
   bifurcation also present in the flow of a linear fluid. However, unlike
   the Newtonian case, pseudoplastic Taylor vortices lose their stability
   as the Taylor number reaches a second critical number corresponding to
   the onset of a Hopf bifurcation. Existence of an axial flow induced by a
   pressure gradient appears to further advance each critical point on the
   bifurcation diagram. In continuation, complete flow field together with
   viscosity maps is analyzed for different flow scenarios. Through
   evaluation of the Lyapunov exponent, flow stability and temporal
   behavior of the system for cases with and without axial flow are brought
   to attention.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effects of stabilizing fast pyrolysis oil (PO) with glycerol via
   catalytic glycerol pretreatment on upgrading via hydrodeoxygenation
   (HDO) or thermal treatment (TT) were studied. Nonstabilized (original)
   fast pyrolysis oil was also upgraded via HDO or TT to obtain benchmarks.
   Generally, HDO decreases the molecular weight of PO. The major
   beneficial effect of stabilization with glycerol was reduction in
   molecular weight of the upgraded oil. However, it was observed that the
   molecular weight reduction was largely induced by the dilution effect of
   glycerol/glycerol-derived fragments. It should also be noted that
   glycerol-consuming reactions via decreasing the carboxylic acid and
   phenolic contents of PO (e.g., via esterification) may play a role in
   reducing self-polymerization during HDO or TT. Stabilization of PO with
   glycerol, however, led to an increase in the yield of aqueous fractions
   of HDO and TT due to the formation of hydrophilic fragments from
   glycerol and PO constituents. After HDO, the oil fractions of stabilized
   and nonstabilized PO exhibited similar H/C and O/C molar ratios,
   suggesting that oxygen removal from the oil fractions was not
   significantly affected by stabilization.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of recent technological advancement is linked to
   the widespread adoptions of ultra-short picosecond (ps) pulsed laser in
   various applications of material processing. The superior capability of
   this laser is associated with the precise control of laser-material
   interaction as an outcome of extremely short interaction times resulting
   in almost-negligible heat affected zones. In this context, the present
   study explores the applicability of a picosecond laser in laser
   micro-polishing (L mu P) of Ni-based superalloy Inconel 718 (IN718). The
   specific research goals of the present study constitute determination of
   melting regime-a mandatory phase for L mu P, establishing the concept of
   polishability of the spatial contents of the initial surface topography
   and experimental demonstration of the process capability of a ps laser
   for potential micro-polishing applications. The initial surface
   topography was prepared by micromilling operation with a step-over of 50
   mu m and scallop height of 2 mu m. The L mu P experiments were performed
   at five different levels of fluence associated with the melting regime
   by changing the focal offset, a parameter denoting the working distance
   between workpiece surface and focusing lens focal plane. The L mu P
   performance was evaluated based on the line profiling average surface
   roughness (R-a) spectrum distributed at different spatial wavelength
   intervals along the laser path trajectory. Furthermore, additional
   statistical metrics such as material ratio and power spectral density
   functions were analyzed in order to establish the process parameters
   associated with best achievable surface finish. The applicability of ps
   L mu P was demonstrated in two regimes-1D (line) and 2D (area)
   polishing. During 1D L mu, significant (similar to 52 \%) improvement of
   the surface quality was achieved by reducing an R-a value from 0.50 mu m
   before polishing to an R-a value of 0.24 mu m across the laser path
   trajectory on initially ground surface. In addition, an initially
   micromilled area of 4.5x4.5 mm was L mu Ped resulting in the reduction
   of an areal topography surface roughness (S-a) value from 0.435 to 0.127
   mu m (70.8 \% surface quality improvement).}},

Abstract = {{The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) have both been implicated in the cognitive control of saccadic eye
   movements by single neuron recording studies in nonhuman primates and
   functional imaging studies in humans, but their relative roles remain
   unclear. Here, we reversibly deactivated either dlPFC or ACC subregions
   in macaque monkeys while the animals performed randomly interleaved pro-
   and antisaccades. In addition, we explored the whole-brain functional
   connectivity of these two regions by applying a seed-based resting-state
   functional MRI analysis in a separate cohort of monkeys. We found that
   unilateral dlPFC deactivation had stronger behavioral effects on
   saccades than unilateral ACC deactivation, and that the dlPFC displayed
   stronger functional connectivity with frontoparietal areas than the ACC.
   We suggest that the dlPFC plays a more prominent role in the preparation
   of pro- and antisaccades than the ACC.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of incorporating shrinkage reducing admixtures
   (SRA) and/or wollastonite microfibers on the early-age shrinkage
   behavior and cracking potential of ultra-high performance concrete
   (UHPC) was explored. Wollastonite microfibers were added at rates of
   0\%, 4\% and 12\% as partial volume replacement for cement, while SRA
   was added at 1\% and 2\% by cement weight. Results show that the
   reinforcing effect induced by wollastonite microfibers mitigated the
   reduction in compressive strength induced by SRA. Addition of
   wollastonite microfibers to SRA mixtures did not impart a significant
   change in the measured free shrinkage strain, while it enhanced the
   cracking resistance compared to that of mixtures incorporating SRA
   alone. Moreover, adding wollastonite microfibers reduced the leaching of
   SRA from concrete under submerged conditions, thus leading to higher
   efficiency of SRA in reducing shrinkage. Partially replacing cement with
   natural wollastonite microfibers also leads to a reduction in the cement
   factor, which represents economic and environmental benefits. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Single-crystalline Ta5Si3 nanostructures with a complex morphology were
   synthesized through a catalyst-free, chemical vapor deposition method
   under low pressures. The morphology, structure, and composition of
   deposited nanostructures were studied by scanning electron microscopy,

   These nanostructures have lengths of up to several tens of micrometers
   and an average thickness of 13 nm. It was found that the formation of
   networked Ta5Si3 nanostructures is highly sensitive to the vapor
   pressure of tantalum chloride and silica and is based on a vapor solid
   mechanism. Results indicate that, with the decrease of silica vapor
   pressure, the Ta5Si3 networked nanowires evolve into networked
   nanoribbons and nanosheets via two-dimensional growth. Cyclic
   voltammetry measurements of the Ta5Si3 nanostructures show superior
   electrochemical capacitance properties of nanosheets compared to
   nanowires. It is expected that these nanostructures have great potential

Abstract = {{LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC) is a highly promising cathode material for use
   in lithium ion batteries; unfortunately, its poor cycling performance at
   high cutoff voltages hinders its commercialization. In this study, for
   the first time, we employ atomic layer deposition (ALD) to coat lithium
   tantalum oxide, a solid-state electrolyte, with varying thicknesses on
   NMC in an attempt to improve battery performance. Our results indicate
   that utilization of a solid-state electrolyte as a coating material for
   NMC significantly improves performance at high cutoff voltages but is
   strongly dependent on coating thicknesses. Our investigation revealed
   that a thicker coating proved to be beneficial in preventing cathode
   material dissolution into the electrolyte and aided in maintaining the
   microstructure of NMC. Consequently, a thicker ALD coating resulted in
   increased electrochemical impedance of the cathode. The results of this
   study indicate that an optimized coating thickness is needed in order to
   strike a balance between maintaining structural stability while
   minimizing electrochemical impedance. The coating thicknesses are
   functionally specific, and for the best improvement of a cathode, a
   particular coating thickness should be sought.}},

Title = {{Regional Assessment of Cardiac Left Ventricular Myocardial Function via

Abstract = {{Automating the detection and localization of segmental (regional) left
   ventricle (LV) abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
   recently sparked an impressive research effort, with promising
   performances and a breadth of techniques. However, despite such an
   effort, the problem is still acknowledged to be challenging, with much
   room for improvements in regard to accuracy. Furthermore, most of the
   existing techniques are labor intensive, requiring delineations of the
   endo- and/or epi-cardial boundaries in all frames of a cardiac sequence.
   The purpose of this study is to investigate a real-time machine-learning
   approach which uses some image features that can be easily computed, but
   that nevertheless correlate well with the segmental cardiac function.
   Starting from a minimum user input in only one frame in a subject
   dataset, we build for all the regional segments and all subsequent
   frames a set of statistical MRI features based on a measure of
   similarity between distributions. We demonstrate that, over a cardiac
   cycle, the statistical features are related to the proportion of blood
   within each segment. Therefore, they can characterize segmental
   contraction without the need for delineating the LV boundaries in all
   the frames. We first seek the optimal direction along which the proposed
   image features are most descriptive via a linear discriminant analysis.
   Then, using the results as inputs to a linear support vector machine
   classifier, we obtain an abnormality assessment of each of the standard
   cardiac segments in real-time. We report a comprehensive experimental
   evaluation of the proposed algorithm over 928 cardiac segments obtained
   from 58 subjects. Compared against ground-truth evaluations by
   experienced radiologists, the proposed algorithm performed
   competitively, with an overall classification accuracy of 86.09\% and a
   kappa measure of 0.73.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of micro-computed
   tomography to quantify wear in preclinical pin-on-plate testing of
   materials for use in joint arthroplasty. Wear testing of CoCr pins
   articulating against six polyetheretherketone plates was performed using
   a pin-on-plate apparatus over 2 million cycles. Change in volume due to
   wear was quantified with gravimetric analysis and with micro-computed
   tomography, and the volumes were compared. Separately, the volume of
   polyetheretherketone pin-on-plate specimens that had been soaking in
   fluid for 52 weeks was quantified with both gravimetric analysis and
   micro-computed tomography, and repeated after drying. The volume change
   with micro-computed tomography was compared to the mass change with
   gravimetric analysis. The mean wear volume measured was 8.02 +/- 6.38
   mm(3) with gravimetric analysis and 6.76 +/- 5.38 mm(3) with
   micro-computed tomography (p = 0.06). Micro-computed tomography volume
   measurements did not show a statistically significant change with drying
   for either the plates (p = 0.60) or the pins (p = 0.09), yet drying had
   a significant effect on the gravimetric mass measurements for both the
   plates (p = 0.03) and the pins (p = 0.04). Micro-computed tomography
   provided accurate measurements of wear in polyetheretherketone
   pin-on-plate test specimens, and no statistically significant change was
   caused by fluid uptake. Micro-computed tomography quantifies wear depth
   and wear volume, mapped to the specific location of damage on the
   specimen, and is also capable of examining subsurface density as well as
   cracking. Its noncontact, nondestructive nature makes it ideal for
   preclinical testing of materials, in which further additional analysis
   techniques may be utilized.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of partial discharge (PD) using ultra-high frequency
   (UHF) method is considered an effective approach to monitor the online
   condition of the equipment, which is used to facilitate the detection of
   incipient defects in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS). In this paper, in
   order to assess the severity of PD defects using UHF method, the actual
   220-kV GIS were subjected to experimentation. The PD was measured
   simultaneously by using the UHF method and the IEC60270 measurement
   technique. The combined measurement has been carried out on different
   defects in PD test cells, including the floating metal, metallic
   protrusion, and void in epoxy resin. The inner coupler installed in the
   GIS tank, and the outer coupler placed outside the spacer, are used to
   measure the UHF signal. The relationship of the apparent charge and the
   amplitude of the time-domain signal, and the integral energy from 300
   MHz to 1.6 GHz of the signal induced by PD in GIS are analyzed
   thoroughly. In this way, the severity of PD can be quantified using the
   UHF signal. In addition, to verify the sensitivity of the UHF detection
   method, a pulse generator with a rise time of about 500 ps is designed.
   The GIGRE method for the verification of sensitivity, which is used
   worldwide, is applied in the experiment. The results of the pulse

Abstract = {{As the first clinically approved gadolinium-based blood-pool MRI
   contrast agent, gadofosveset was designed to bind to human serum albumin
   (HSA) reversibly, extending the circulation time in the bloodstream.
   This valuable pharmacokinetic property required for vasculature imaging,
   however, raises the risk of release and accumulation of gadolinium in
   vivo. The binding of gadofosveset to HSA significantly increases the
   relaxivity at low field, which decreases drastically when the magnetic
   field increases, limiting the applications of gadofosveset at fields of
   3 T and higher. To address those challenges, we evaluated a novel
   dimeric manganese(III) porphyrin (MnP2) in vitro and in vivo as a
   potential gadolinium-free blood-pool agent. Through multiple
   spectroscopic studies, we demonstrated that MnP2 binds to HSA tightly.
   MnP2 exhibits a moderate relaxivity decrease on HSA binding.
   Nevertheless, owing to the unique field-dependent relaxation behaviors
   and the dimeric construct (two Mn-III ions per complex), MnP2-HSA has a
   molar relaxivity twice that of the gadofosveset-HSA complex at 3 T.
   Through intravenous injection in rats, MnP2 exhibits long retention and
   significant contrast enhancement in the vascular compartment, as tested
   in a 3-T high-field clinical MRI scanner. Taken together, these data
   demonstrate that MnP2 represents a new class of gadolinium-free
   blood-pool agents suitable for both regular and high-field applications.}},

Title = {{Evolutionary optimization technique for site layout planningl}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{48-55}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Solving the site layout planning problem is a challenging task. It
   requires an iterative approach to satisfy design requirements (e.g.
   energy efficiency, skyview, daylight, roads network, visual privacy, and
   clear access to favorite views). These design requirements vary from one
   project to another based on location and client preferences. In the Gulf
   region, the most important socio-cultural factor is the visual privacy
   in indoor space. Hence, most of the residential houses in this region
   are surrounded by high fences to provide privacy, which has a direct
   impact on other requirements (e.g. daylight and direction to a favorite
   view). This paper introduces a novel technique to optimally locate and
   orient residential buildings to satisfy a set of design requirements.
   The developed technique is based on genetic algorithm which explores the
   search space for possible solutions. This study considers two
   dimensional site planning problems. However, it can be extended to solve
   three dimensional cases. A case study is presented to demonstrate the
   efficiency of this technique in solving the site layout planning of
   simple residential dwellings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{LiCoO2 in the commercial lithium ion batteries has been suffering from
   its poor cycling performance at high cutoff voltages. In this study, we
   employ an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to surface-modify a
   LiCoO2 material with various thickness-controlled metal oxide (TiO2,
   ZrO2 and Al2O3) coatings to improve its battery performance. The effects
   of the metal oxide coatings on the electrochemical performance of LiCoO2
   electrode are studied in detail. It is demonstrated that a uniform and
   dense coating via the ALD route on LiCoO2 powder can lower the battery
   performance due to an obvious decrease in lithium diffusion and electron
   transport with the coating layers. In contrast, it is revealed that a
   direct coating on prefabricated LiCoO2 electrodes performs much better
   than a coating on LiCoO2 powders. It is further disclosed that the
   improved electrochemical performance of coated LiCoO2 electrode is
   highly dependent on the coating materials. Of the three coating
   materials, the Al2O3 coating results in the best cycling stability while
   the ZrO2 coating contributes to the best rate capability. It is thus
   suggested that the coating materials are functionally specific, and for
   the best improvement of a cathode, a particular coating material should
   be sought. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Limitations in guidelines and standards on the amount of clay in sand
   and coarse aggregate micro-fines and the influence of such micro-fines
   on fresh and hardened concrete properties is often ambiguous for
   practitioners and quality control professionals. This is compounded by
   conflicting related data in the open literature and the inadequacy of
   some standard test procedures for capturing the real problems associated
   with the presence of clays in cement-based materials. This paper
   examines the various types of clay, limitations on clays in aggregates
   in various standards, and the test methods used to assess the presence
   of clays in aggregates. A critical overview of literature on the
   possible effects of clay in cement-based materials is provided,
   including effects on water demand, workability, mechanical strength,
   dimensional stability and chemical admixtures dosage. The problem of
   dimensional stability of aggregates bearing clay minerals is examined.
   Possible chemical treatment of clays to mitigate their detrimental
   effects in concrete is also outlined. Finally, emerging research on
   using nano-clays in cement-based materials is highlighted and
   recommendations to resolve ambiguity related to the presence of clays in
   cement-based materials are proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Stochastic weather generators have evolved as tools for creating long
   time series of synthetic meteorological data at a site for risk
   assessments in hydrologic and agricultural applications. Recently, their
   use has been extended as downscaling tools for climate change impact
   assessments. Non-parametric weather generators, which typically use a
   K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) resampling approach, require no statistical
   assumptions about probability distributions of variables and can be
   easily applied for multi-site use. Two characteristics of traditional
   K-NN models result from resampling daily values: (1) temporal
   correlation structure of daily temperatures may be lost, and (2) no
   values less than or exceeding historical observations can be simulated.
   Temporal correlation in simulated temperature data is important for
   hydrologic applications. Temperature is a major driver of many processes
   within the hydrologic cycle (for example, evaporation, snow melt, etc.)
   that may affect flood levels. As such, a new methodology for simulation
   of climate data using the K-NN approach is presented (named KnnCAD
   Version 4). A block resampling scheme is introduced along with
   perturbation of the reshuffled daily temperature data to create 675years
   of synthetic historical daily temperatures for the Upper Thames River
   basin in Ontario, Canada. The updated KnnCAD model is shown to
   adequately reproduce observed monthly temperature characteristics as
   well as temporal and spatial correlations while simulating reasonable
   values which can exceed the range of observations. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Poly(ester amide)s (PEAs) composed of variable diols, dicarboxylic
   acids, and a-amino acids were synthesized and characterized to elucidate
   structure property relationships. The PEAs were synthesized using both
   solution and interfacial approaches to obtain varying molecular weights
   (MWs) and polydispersities. Studies using differential scanning
   calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction revealed a range of amorphous
   and semicrystalline behavior that was dependent on structure. The
   viscosities of the PEAs as a function of temperature were studied by
   rheology, and phase transitions were confirmed for some polymers.
   Mechanical properties were also investigated, and it was found that the
   PEAS could be tuned to exhibit elastomeric or brittle behavior by
   varying both the length of the diol and the amino acid moiety. This
   information provides new insights into the effects of PEA structure, MW,
   and MW distribution on PEA properties and will aid in the design and
   selection of PEAS with optimal properties for targeted applications.}},

Abstract = {{The crystal structure and charge transport properties of the prototypal
   oxobenzene-bridged 1,2,3-bisdithiazolyl radical conductor 3a are
   strongly dependent on pressure. Compression of the as-crystallized
   alpha-phase, space group Fdd2, to 3-4 GPa leads to its conversion into a
   second or beta-phase, in which F-centering is lost. The space group
   symmetry is lowered to Pbn2(1), and there is concomitant halving of the
   a and b axes. A third or gamma-phase, also space group Pbn2(1), is
   generated by further compression to 8 GPa. The changes in packing that
   accompany both phase transitions are associated with an ``ironing
   out{''} of the ruffled ribbon-like architecture of the alpha-phase, so
   that consecutive radicals along the ribbons are rendered more nearly
   coplanar. In the beta-phase the planar ribbons are propagated along the
   b-glides, while in the gamma-phase they follow the n-glides. At ambient
   pressure 3a is a Mott insulator, displaying high but activated
   conductivity, with sigma(300 K) = 6 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and E-act = 0.16
   eV. With compression beyond 4 GPa, its conductivity is increased by 3
   orders of magnitude, and the thermal activation energy is reduced to
   zero, heralding the formation of a metallic state. High pressure
   infrared absorption and reflectivity measurements are consistent with
   closure of the Mott-Hubbard gap near 4-5 GPa. The results are discussed
   in the light of DFT calculations on the molecular and band electronic
   structure of 3a. The presence of a low-lying LUMO in 3a gives rise to
   high electron affinity which, in turn, creates an electronically much
   softer radical with a low onsite Coulomb potential U. In addition;
   considerable crystal orbital (SOMO/LUMO) mixing occurs upon
   pressurization, so that a metallic state is readily achieved at
   relatively low applied pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Attempts at understanding nanoparticle fate and transport in the
   subsurface environment are currently hindered by an inability to
   quantify nanoparticle behavior at the pore scale (within and between
   pores) within realistic pore networks. This paper is the first to
   present a method for high resolution quantification of silver
   nanoparticle (nAg) concentrations within porous media under controlled
   experimental conditions. This method makes it possible to extract silver
   nanoparticle concentrations within individual pores in static and
   quasi-dynamic (i.e., transport) systems. Quantification is achieved by
   employing absorption-edge synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography
   (SXCMT) and an extension of the Beer-Lambert law. Three-dimensional maps
   of X-ray mass linear attenuation are converted to SXCMT-determined nAg
   concentration and are found to closely match the concentrations
   determined by ICP analysis. In addition, factors affecting the quality
   of the. SXCMT-determined results are investigated: 1) The acquisition of
   an additional above-edge data set reduced the standard deviation of
   SXCMT-determined ; 2) X-ray refraction at the grain/water interface
   artificially depresses the SXCMT-determined concentrations within 18.1
   mu m concentrationsof a grain surface; 3) By treating the approximately
   20 x 10(6) voxels within each data set statistically (i.e., averaging),
   a high level of confidence in the SXCMT-determined mean concentrations
   can be obtained. This novel method provides the means to examine. a wide
   range of properties related to nanoparticle transport in controlled
   laboratory, porous medium experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the 3-D oscillations and coalescence of water
   droplets deposited on a dielectric substrate under the effect of a
   rotating electric field, taking into account the effect of frequency of
   the applied AC voltage and the value of the contact angle. Motion of the
   fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, which are solved both
   inside and outside the droplet (ensuring the conservation of volume of
   the droplets).
   The time variation of the shape of a perfectly conducting droplet placed
   between two orthogonal pairs of parallel electrodes with two-phase
   voltage excitation demonstrates that a water droplet vibrates strongly
   at certain frequencies. It was found that the resonance frequency and
   the magnitude of the deformation strongly depend on the surface
   properties.
   This paper also presents a new design of an electrowetting mixer using
   the rotating electric field and offers a new method to effectively mix
   two droplets over a different range of AC frequencies. Two regimes were
   observed for droplet coalescence: (1) coalescence due to the high
   droplet deformation, (2) coalescence due to the interaction of
   electrically induced dipoles. Numerical simulations confirm that by
   increasing the electric capillary number, the first coalescence regime
   starts at lower frequencies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) from chemical unzipping of carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) have been reported to be a suitable candidate for lithium ion
   battery materials, but very few of them focused on controlling GNRs with
   different unzipping levels. Here we present a study of GNRs with
   controlled unzipping level and the prevailing factors that affect the
   lithium storage performance at early and final unzipping level; besides,
   the effect of thermal reduction has been investigated. On the basis of
   Raman and BET surface area tests, we found that the unzipping of CNTs
   starts with surface etching and then proceeds to partial and full
   unzipping and finally fragmentation and aggregation. Galvanostatic
   charge discharge reveals that defect increase is mainly responsible for
   the capacity enhancement at the early unzipping level; surface area drop
   is associated with the capacity fade at the final unzipping level.
   Surface functional groups can result in low electrical conductivity and
   therefore cause capacity drop within several cycles. The GNRs with
   controlled unzipping level display, different electrochemical behaviors
   and thus can provide rational choices for researchers who are searching
   for desired functions using GNRs as additives in lithium ion batteries.}},

   crossflow filtration. The steady state flux increased initially with the
   transmembrane pressure (TMP), then reached a plateau at a relatively low
   TMP of approximate to 15kPa, beyond which a steady operation was
   achieved, and there were practically no advantages of increasing the
   TMP. The pressure independent limiting flux increased with increasing
   the crossflow velocity and was found to scale with the membrane surface
   shear rate to the power of 0.35. The data were modeled satisfactorily

Abstract = {{Extreme rainfall events that are occurring more frequently as an effect
   of climate change and variability are causing increasing damages to
   municipal infrastructure. A methodology is developed to quantify the
   risk to municipal infrastructure from climate change-related flooding.
   The risk is measured using a combination of flow/frequency, stage/damage
   and damage/frequency curves. The measure of risk is termed the Risk
   Index and calculated for each infrastructure element within a
   municipality. The risk is aggregated and summed by spatial unit and
   presented in the form of risk tables and maps. The risk index takes into
   account both quantitative and qualitative information obtained from
   research and interviews with technical experts. The results from the
   application of the methodology to a municipality will lead to better
   policy and informed decision making.}},

Abstract = {{NiCo nanoparticles was uniformly doped on ZnO nanorod arrays by
   electroless polyol method. The effect of the deposition time (t) on the

   nanocomposition is detected when t <30 min. The atomic ratio of Ni to Co
   is approaching to 1: 1 when t increases to 60 min. In addition,
   NiCo-doped ZnO nanorods show typical superparamagnetic properties when t
   <30 min, while the ferromagnetic properties is more obvious when t
   increases to 60 min. The saturation magnetization (Ms) of the ZnO-CoNi
   nanocomposite is about 95 emu/g which is smaller than that of bulk
   Ni50Co50. It could be attributed to the oxidation of the surface of
   NiCo-ZnO nanocmposites.}},

Abstract = {{Interdigitated capacitors (IDC) are extensively used for a variety of
   chemical and biological sensing applications. Printing and
   functionalizing these IDC sensors on bendable substrates will lead to
   new innovations in healthcare and medicine, food safety inspection,
   environmental monitoring, and public security. The synthesis of an
   electrically conductive aqueous graphene ink stabilized in deionized
   water using the polymer Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) is introduced in
   this paper. CMC is a nontoxic hydrophilic cellulose derivative used in
   food industry. The water-based graphene ink is then used to fabricate
   IDC sensors on mechanically flexible polyimide substrates. The
   capacitance and frequency response of the sensors are analyzed, and the
   effect of mechanical stress on the electrical properties is examined.
   Experimental results confirm low thin film resistivity (similar to
   6.6x10(-3) Omega-cm) and high capacitance (>100 pF). The printed sensors
   are then used to measure water content of ethanol solutions to
   demonstrate the proposed conductive ink and fabrication methodology for
   creating chemical sensors on thin membranes.}},

Abstract = {{Non-conductive graphene oxide (GO) particles (70\% carbon, 30\% oxygen)
   synthesized directly from inexpensive graphite powders are hydrophilic
   and can be dispersed homogeneously in water based solutions. In this
   study, thin film electrode traces are produced from a GO aqueous
   suspension using a commercially available inkjet printer. Once deposited
   on the functionalized substrate the printed film is thermally annealed
   to remove excess water and harden the material. The electrical
   conductivity of the high resistance (>10M Omega) annealed film is
   increased through the removal of oxygen molecules using a focused 775nm,
   120fs pulsed laser. The electrical properties of select target areas on
   the thermally reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film can be tuned by
   adjusting the laser power, material feed rate, and the number of passes
   that the beam makes over the target surface. Experiments demonstrate
   that the rGO trace can be modified over a wide range of sheet resistance
   values (1M Omega to 2k Omega) for a similar to 1 mu m thick film. The
   proposed fabrication method can also be used to create a variety of
   resistive and semiconductor components on printed thin films, conductive

Abstract = {{Due to the special structures of cell membrane, good internalization is
   one of major concerns on using large nanospheres as carriers for
   labeling and treatment of cancer. We herein report fluorescent gelatin
   nanosphers (GNs) coated with CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) to form a
   viable vehicle for theranostic applications. Anti-human immunoglobulin G
   Fab formation, anti-IgG Fab, is bioconjugated on to the hybrid
   fluorescent GNs for targeted delivery (QDs-GNs-anti-IgG Fab). Human
   osteosarcoma cell line is used in studying the interaction between
   hybrid fluorescent GNs with and without anti-IgG Fab. The average
   particle size of the fluorescent GNs bioconjugated with antibodies is
   estimated at 480 +/- 50 nm. The emission (lambda em) of the fluorescent
   GNs is around 652 nm. The quantitative analysis on the surface
   modification and bioconjugation of GNs has been discussed in this paper.
   The three-dimensional z-stacking fluorescent images reveal that the
   hybrid GNs with anti-IgG Fab has similar to 1.5 times increase in
   internalization with human osteosarcoma cells than GNs without the
   antibody fragment. The improved cellular interaction of the QDs-GN-anti
   IgG Fab is attributed to the bioconjugation of antibodies which can
   provide specificity for targeted drug delivery. Relative cell viability
   (\%) is larger than 80\% for each type of functionalized GNs up to 40 mu
   g/mL. We expect that the functionalized gelatin sphere can offer an
   effective theranostic tool for targeted drug delivery and direct imaging
   confirmation simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles incorporating within polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) were deposited on the surface of silicone hydrogel through
   matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE). In this process,
   frozen sample was irradiated under a pulsed Nd:YAG 532nm laser for one
   hour. The MAPLE process is able to maintain the chemical backbone of
   polymer, and prevents the nanocomposite coating from contamination. Our
   results indicate that the ZnO-PEG nanocomposite coating reduces over
   50\% protein absorption on silicone hydrogel. The cytotoxicity study
   shows that the ZnO-PEG nanocomposites deposited on silicone hydrogels do
   not impose the toxic effect on mouse NIH/3T3 cells. In addition,
   MAPLE-deposited ZnO-PEG nanocomposite inhibits the bacterial growth
   significantly. After 4 hours' culturing, the relative numbers of E. coli
   on the nanocomposite coated silicone hydrogel declines to 0.07.
   Consequently, the ZnO-PEG deposited by MAPLE process can significantly
   prevent silicone hydrogels from protein fouling and bacterial
   contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Software development can be considered to be the most uncertain project
   when compared to other projects due to uncertainty in the customer
   requirements, the complexity of the process, and the intangible nature
   of the product. In order to increase the chance of success in managing a
   software project, the project manager(s) must invest more time and
   effort in the project planning phase, which involves such primary and
   integrated activities as effort estimation and risk management, because
   the accuracy of the effort estimation is highly dependent on the size
   and number of project risks in a particular software project. However,
   as is common practice, these two activities are often disconnected from
   each other and project managers have come to consider such steps to be
   unreliable due to their lack of accuracy. This chapter introduces the
   Fuzzy-ExCOM Model, which is used for software project planning and is
   based on fuzzy technique. It has the capability to not only integrate
   the effort estimation and risk assessment activities but also to provide
   information about the estimated effort, the project risks, and the
   effort contingency allowance necessary to accommodate the identified
   risk. A validation of this model using the project's research data shows
   that this new approach is capable of improving the existing COCOMO
   estimation performance.}},

   Neuro-Fuzzy Function Point Backfiring (NFFPB) model. The neural network
   and fuzzy logic designs are introduced for both models. Both estimation
   models are compared against the same data source of software projects.
   It is found that the original NFFPB model outperforms the extended
   model. The results are investigated, and it is explained why the
   extended model performed worse.}},

Abstract = {{Many computer vision problems require optimization of binary
   non-submodular energies. We propose a general optimization framework
   based on local submodular approximations (LSA). Unlike standard LP
   relaxation methods that linearize the whole energy globally, our
   approach iteratively approximates the energies locally. On the other
   hand, unlike standard local optimization methods (e.g. gradient descent
   or projection techniques) we use non-linear submodular approximations
   and optimize them without leaving the domain of integer solutions. We
   discuss two specific LSA algorithms based on trust region and auxiliary
   function principles, LSA-TR and LSA-AUX. These methods obtain
   state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications outperforming
   many standard techniques such as LBP, QPBO, and TRWS. While our paper is
   focused on pairwise energies, our ideas extend to higher-order problems.

Abstract = {{Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) is used for
   uplink data transmission in Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems. SC-FDMA
   requires contiguous resource blocks (Illis) allocation for each user,
   which challenges the uplink resource allocation in LTE. The contiguity
   constraint turns the allocation problem into a non-convex optimization
   problem. The optimal solution is achieved by solving a binary integer
   programming (HIP) problem which is computationallyexpensive. In this
   work, we propose a genetic algorithm that is able to solve the resource
   allocation problem in the LIE uplink. The proposed algorithm maintains
   all the system constraints and provides a solution with lower complexity
   compared with the optimal solution. The proposed GA is evaluated and
   compared with the optimal approach in terms of efficiency and time
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing success as a paradigm stems from the concepts its
   implementation was based on. Dynamic scalability and flexible
   pay-as-you-go pricing options attract business clients. However,
   efficient implementation of virtualization is the core that makes all
   these parts tick. To make that possible, cloud service providers need a
   thorough virtual network mapping system that allocates computational and
   network resources in a way that guarantees the quality of service
   conditions for clients while maximizing providers' revenue and resource
   utilization. In this paper, a comprehensive system is introduced to
   solve virtual network mapping for a set of connection requests sent by
   cloud clients. Connections are collected in time intervals called
   windows. Consequently, node mapping and link mapping are performed.
   Different window size selection schemes are introduced and evaluated.
   Simulation results show that the dynamic window size algorithm achieves
   cloud service providers objectives in terms of served connections ratio,
   resource utilization and computational overhead.}},

   the depth information from the Microsoft Kinect camera for the Xbox 360
   gaming console, and a secondary light camera in a stereo camera
   configuration. In the paper we explain how the configuration is setup,
   and how it is used to extract the skeletal data from the Kinect camera
   and project this skeletal data onto the secondary camera's image. The
   results of the extraction are tested for accuracy, and potential

Abstract = {{A peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction technique that exploits
   the principle of differential encoding of subcarriers is proposed and
   investigated. The absolute maximum sample of the time-domain OFDM symbol
   is chosen as the reference to carry out the differential encoding
   process at the transmitter. A real multiplier (delta) is applied to this
   reference to achieve appropriate PAPR level. Information about the
   proposed reference, however, is required to be communicated to the
   receiver, which performs the reverse effect to obtain back the original
   sequence of samples. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is
   evaluated through extensive computer simulations and complementary
   cumulative distribution function (CCDF) are obtained as a function of
   number of subcarriers and modulations. Numerical results confirm that
   significant reduction in PAPR can be achieved. For example, the proposed
   technique reduces the 0.1 percent PAPR to 1.5 dB for a 1024 subcarrier
   OFDM system, resulting in 10.3 dB reduction. Moreover, error
   performances of the OFDM system before and after applying the proposed
   technique are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical
   results show that the average bit error rate performance of the proposed
   system does not degrade relative to the un-encoded system. An
   investigation of the complexity of the proposed technique with other
   techniques show that it is quite low complex.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic nature of traffic over Internet protocol (IP) networks often
   induce high end-to-end latency and packet loss rate. These problems
   hamper the Quality of Service (QoS) of various conventional and emerging
   applications over Internet. In order to mitigate these challenges and
   improve the network efficiency, an adaptive compression technique (ACT)
   is proposed. ACT exploits lossless data compression algorithms where
   compression is applied seamlessly to a packet's payload. Our adaptive
   compression is based on the situational awareness of a given network
   derived from gathered network statistical data, such as the varying
   Round Trip Time (RTT) as well as the packet loss rate during a
   transmission session. The real-time observation of the varying RTT and
   packet loss rate triggers the ACT compression when a defined threshold,
   which is compared to the observed values, is crossed. Using Network
   Simulator 3 (NS3), two different real-time latency reduction schemes
   using ACT were compared with an uncompressed transmission. The results
   show ACT improvement in network conditions such as reducing the number
   of dropped packets by approximately 30\%, as well as, reducing delayed
   packet transmissions by 26.5\% which results in fundamentally increasing
   the TCP efficiency by approximately 3\%.}},

Abstract = {{In the Big Data community, MapReduce has been seen as one of the key
   enabling approaches for meeting continuously increasing demands on
   computing resources imposed by massive data sets. The reason for this is
   the high scalability of the MapReduce paradigm which allows for
   massively parallel and distributed execution over a large number of
   computing nodes. This paper identifies MapReduce issues and challenges
   in handling Big Data with the objective of providing an overview of the
   field, facilitating better planning and management of Big Data projects,
   and identifying opportunities for future research in this field. The
   identified challenges are grouped into four main categories
   corresponding to Big Data tasks types: data storage (relational
   databases and NoSQL stores), Big Data analytics (machine learning and
   interactive analytics), online processing, and security and privacy.
   Moreover, current efforts aimed at improving and extending MapReduce to
   address identified challenges are presented. Consequently, by
   identifying issues and challenges MapReduce faces when handling Big
   Data, this study encourages future Big Data research.}},

   to extend time-resolved laser-induced incandescence (TiRe-LII), a
   combustion diagnostic used for sizing soot, to size silicon
   nanoparticles. TiRe-LII measurements are made on silicon nanoparticles
   synthesized in a low-pressure plasma reactor containing argon. Molecular
   dynamics (MD) is used to predict the accommodation coefficient between
   silicon nanoparticles and argon and helium, which is needed to interpret
   the TiRe-LII data. The MD-derived thermal accommodation coefficients
   will be validated by comparing them to experimentally-derived values
   found using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fully study various phenomena related to small wind turbines
   (WTs) in wind energy conversion systems (WECSs), a comprehensive model
   that considers their mechanical, electrical and aerodynamic aspects is
   needed. One such phenomenon is furl, which is a mechanical mechanism
   that protects small horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) against excess
   speed and power. In this paper, a new detailed model for a small
   permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based WT with furling
   control is developed. The system under study is a variable speed WT/
   PMSG configuration that uses back to back voltage source IGBT converters
   to connect to the grid network. For the model, software such as TurbSim
   and FAST was used to model a wind profile and the mechanical parts of
   the WT and Simulink/ MATLAB was used to model the WT generator and
   electrical controllers; the voltage source converters (VSCs) were
   operated with a field oriented control (FOC) method. Simulation results
   that show the performance of the small WT with furling control under
   different environmental and network conditions are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The development of low Reynolds number channel flow during mixed
   convection has been investigated experimentally. The measurements were
   taken at five different locations along the heating section of the
   channel. The experiments were conducted at bottom wall temperatures of
   35, 45 and 55 degrees C at a flow rate of 0.0315 kg/s (corresponding to
   the unheated Reynolds number of 450). Grashof number ranged from 9.8 x
   10(6) to 3.9 x 10(7). The results showed that the buoyancy-driven
   secondary flow was generated right from the upstream tip of the channel
   heated section and was enhanced in the downstream direction.
   Accordingly, turbulence was generated and enhanced in the same
   direction. The mean streamwise velocity accelerated in the region close
   to the bottom heated wall in the downstream direction and the rate of
   acceleration increased with an increase in the bottom wall temperature.
   The turbulent streamwise and vertical velocities approximately reached
   close to the development state near the end of the channel heated
   section for the lowest bottom wall temperature while at the higher two
   bottom wall temperatures, the turbulent velocities were found to
   progress along the channel heated section.}},

Abstract = {{The bubbling of liquid with gases is required in a number of important

   innovative nozzle design for reducing the size of bubbles generated in
   stagnant liquid, at constant gas flow conditions, was tested and
   evaluated for two nozzles diameter as well as different gas flow rates.
   This technique is based on the creation of one or two side holes in the
   nozzle near the main nozzle hole so that the diameter of these side
   holes is lower than the inner nozzle diameter. Results show that the new
   nozzle design produced smaller bubbles with higher detachment frequency
   in comparison with those bubbles generated from the standard nozzle with

Abstract = {{Injection of bubbly gas flow into a liquid stream has wide application
   in chemical and biochemical industries. In these applications,
   generation of smaller bubble at higher frequency is desirable to achieve
   better reaction efficiency.
   We report on an experimental study conducted to investigate the bubble
   formation in liquid cross-flow using a novel nozzle design developed by
   Gadallah and Siddiqui {[}1]. This design is based on the creation of two
   side holes in the standard nozzle near the main nozzle hole. The
   experiments were performed in an acrylic square flow channel and high
   speed imaging was used to capture bubble dynamics. An image processing
   algorithm was used to quantify the size and frequency of detached
   bubbles and to track each individual bubble at different gas flow rates
   and liquid velocities.
   The results show that the new design of nozzle generates more bubbles of
   smaller size compared to the standard nozzle with no side hole at low
   liquid flow rates. It was observed that while the liquid velocity has
   crucial affect on the bubble size and detachment frequency from a
   standard nozzle, these parameters are weakly dependent on the liquid
   flow rate in the novel nozzle. The results show that at low liquid flow
   rates or in the stagnant liquid, the novel nozzle generates bubbles that
   are more than 20\% smaller in size and more than two times faster
   compared to the standard nozzle.}},

Abstract = {{The capabilities of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in solving nonlinear
   and non-convex optimization problems are significant. Among the many
   types of methods, differential evolution (DE) is an effective
   population-based stochastic algorithm, which has emerged as very
   competitive. Since its inception in 1995, many variants of DE to improve
   the performance of its predecessor have been introduced. In this
   context, opposition-based differential evolution (ODE) established a
   novel concept in which, each individual must compete with its opposite
   in terms of the fitness value in order to make an entry in the next
   generation. The generation of opposite points is based on the
   population's current extreme points (i.e., maximum and minimum) in the
   search space; these extreme points are not proper representatives for
   whole population, compared to centroid point which is inclusive
   regarding all individuals in the population. This paper develops a new
   scheme that utilizes the centroid point of a population to calculate
   opposite individuals. Therefore, the classical scheme of an opposite
   point is modified accordingly. Incorporating this new scheme into ODE
   leads to an enhanced ODE that is identified as centroid opposition-based
   differential evolution (CODE). The performance of the CODE algorithm is
   comprehensively evaluated on well-known complex benchmark functions and
   compared with the performance of conventional DE, ODE, and some other
   state-of-the-art algorithms (such as SaDE, ADE, SDE, and jDE) in terms
   of solution accuracy. The results for CODE are promising.}},

Abstract = {{Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or brain bleeding is a common
   condition among pre-term infants that occurs in 15-30\% of very low
   birth weight preterm neonates. Infants with IVH are at risk of
   developing progressive dilatation of the ventricles, a pathology called
   hydrocephalus. The ventricular size of patients with mild enlargement of
   cerebral ventricles is monitored by ultrasound or MR imaging of the
   brain for 1-2 years, as they are at risk of developing hydrocephalus.
   This paper proposes an accurate and numerically efficient algorithm to
   the segmentation of the cerebral ventricle system of pre-term IVH
   neonates from 3D T1 weighted MR images. The proposed segmentation
   algorithm makes use of the convex optimization technique combined with
   the learned priors of image intensities and label probabilistic map,
   which is built from a multi-atlas registration scheme. The leave-one-out
   cross validation using 10 IVH patient T1 weighted MR images showed that
   the proposed method yielded a mean DSC of 83.1\% +/- 4.2\%, a MAD of 1.0
   +/- 0.7 mm, a MAXD of 11.3 +/- 7.3 mm, and a VD of 6.5\% +/- 6.2\%,
   suggesting that it can be used in clinical practice for ventricle volume
   measurements of IVH neonate patients.}},

Abstract = {{The well-established low-cost broadband OFDM-based wireless systems in
   license-exempt bands, including worldwide interoperability for microwave
   access (WiMAX) systems, have drawn considerable attention for radar
   related applications over the past decade. This paper explores an idea
   of utilizing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiMAX base stations (BSs)
   in unlicensed band for monostatic airborne synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) application. The OFDM PHY of the WiMAX base station has been
   redesigned to meet the requirements of airborne stripmap SAR
   applications. The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) offered by standard
   WiMAX BSs can neither satisfy Doppler bandwidth nor expand SAR slant
   range. To increase PRF, we propose an RF front modification by employing
   WiMAX BSs together with a microwave double-pole-double-throw (DPDT)
   switch and two absorbing loads. Further, a standard WiMAX BS receiver
   can be directly used to acquire raw data of targets. Simulation results
   show the proposed scheme can significantly increase the range with
   limited transmission power.}},

Abstract = {{Operator-dependent settings such as the wall filter cut-off frequency
   control the incidence of artifacts in Doppler images and limit the
   reliability of comparisons of Doppler vascular indices across
   longitudinal studies. To address this problem, the wall filter selection
   curve (WFSC) method was developed to objectively select the cut-off
   frequency. This paper reports the first evaluation of the effectiveness
   of the WFSC method for imaging a tumor model. 3-D power Doppler data
   were acquired from murine breast cancer tumors over a six-week study and
   the WFSC method was applied to select a cut-off frequency for the wall
   filter. Images reconstructed using the WFSC method were compared to
   images processed using a fixed cut-off frequency. Selection curves for
   tumor images were consistent with flow-phantom data from previous
   studies. The mean WFSC-selected cut-off showed significant variation
   among images acquired at different time points from each tumor (two-way
   ANOVA, p < 0.0001), which demonstrates the relevance of adjusting the
   cut-off frequency to match changing flow conditions. 3-D images
   processed using the WFSC method depicted additional vascular structures
   compared to volumes processed using a fixed cut-off frequency.
   Therefore, the WFSC method can facilitate acquisition of reliable
   Doppler images by inexperienced or time-sensitive operators.}},

   proposed and implemented in the optimization problem based on historical

   RTOD is evaluated through studying of ESS operation for different
   possible cases, and the results are discussed. As an example of
   utility-scale ESSs, a compressed air energy storage (CAES) is used to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. The investigation
   results reveal that the external congestion relief commands should be
   forecasted and incorporated as part of the RTOD to achieve optimal

Abstract = {{Cardiac ablation using flexible catheters is a common interventional
   procedure for treating cardiac arrhythmia. This procedure is performed
   under image guidance and the contact force between the ablation tip and
   the heart tissue is one of the factors that greatly impacts the efficacy
   of the ablation procedure. This paper investigates the feasibility of
   estimating the force that the catheter tip exerts on the heart tissue by
   monitoring the changes in the shape of the deflectable distal shaft of
   the catheter (henceforth called the ``deflectable shaft{''} or the ``
   shaft{''} of the catheter). It is shown that variations in the shaft
   curvature provide information about how much force the catheter tip is
   exerting at its point of contact. Consequently, an index is defined for
   determining the range of contact forces based on the shaft curvature.
   Experimental results show that the defined index can correctly detect
   the range of applied contact forces in more than 80\% of the cases. This
   study proves that the flexibility of the deflectable shaft provides a
   means of estimating contact forces exerted by the catheter tip.}},

Abstract = {{Performing predictive modelling, such as anomaly detection, in Big Data
   is a difficult task. This problem is compounded as more and more sources
   of Big Data are generated from environmental sensors, logging
   applications, and the Internet of Things. Further, most current
   techniques for anomaly detection only consider the content of the data
   source, i.e. the data itself, without concern for the context of the
   data. As data becomes more complex it is increasingly important to bias
   anomaly detection techniques for the context, whether it is spatial,
   temporal, or semantic. The work proposed in this paper outlines a
   contextual anomaly detection technique for use in streaming sensor
   networks. The technique uses a well-defined content anomaly detection
   algorithm for real-time point anomaly detection. Additionally, we
   present a post-processing context-aware anomaly detection algorithm
   based on sensor profiles, which are groups of contextually similar
   sensors generated by a multivariate clustering algorithm. Our proposed
   research has been implemented and evaluated with real-world data
   provided by Powersmiths, located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate classification is used in neuroimaging studies to infer
   brain activation or in medical applications to infer diagnosis. Their
   results are often assessed through either a binomial or a permutation
   test. Here, we simulated classification results of generated random data
   to assess the influence of the cross-validation scheme on the
   significance of results. Distributions built from classification of
   random data with cross-validation did not follow the binomial
   distribution. The binomial test is therefore not adapted. On the
   contrary, the permutation test was unaffected by the cross-validation
   scheme. The influence of the cross-validation was further illustrated on
   real-data from a brain-computer interface experiment in patients with
   disorders of consciousness and from an fMRI study on patients with
   Parkinson disease. Three out of 16 patients with disorders of
   consciousness had significant accuracy on binomial testing, but only one
   showed significant accuracy using permutation testing. In the fMRI
   experiment, the mental imagery of gait could discriminate significantly
   between idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients and healthy subjects
   according to the permutation test but not according to the binomial
   test. Hence, binomial testing could lead to biased estimation of
   significance and false positive or negative results. In our view,
   permutation testing is thus recommended for clinical application of
   classification with cross-validation. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel respiratory motion compensation (MC)
   technique for hybrid PET/MR system. Existing PET/MR respiratory MC
   techniques mainly rely on respiratory gating to reconstruct 3D MR images
   for different respiratory phases, and use image registration techniques
   to estimate the deformation between different respiratory phases. A well
   known limitation of respiratory gating is its assumption that breathing
   motion is perfectly periodic, therefore MC techniques based on gated MR
   are sensitive to irregular breathing patterns. To address this
   limitation, the proposed technique uses dynamic 2D MRIs for PET/MR
   respiratory motion estimation. A static 3D MRI and a series of dynamic
   2D MRIs are acquired before and during the PET data acquisition,
   respectively. The dynamic 2D MRIs are registered against the static 3D
   MRI using a novel deformable 2D+t to 3D image registration method to
   derive a 3D+t deformation field, which is then used for motion corrected
   PET reconstruction. The proposed method is validated on synthetic PET/MR
   data and real MR data, demonstrating its efficacy to compensate for
   irregular respiratory motion and to deblur the PET image.}},

   a dc/ac Voltage-Source Converter (VSC) and various controllers. The
   voltage and frequency control scheme of the VSC is designed based on
   feed-forward and decoupling compensation techniques to lessen the impact
   of the load dynamics. Moreover, the control of the boost converter is
   developed to mitigate current ripple of the FC. The model was

   with respect to power, pulse width variation, beam quality, higher

Abstract = {{An efficient and accurate segmentation of 3D transrectal ultrasound
   (TRUS) images plays an important role in the planning and treatment of
   the practical 3D TRUS guided prostate biopsy. However, a meaningful
   segmentation of 3D TRUS images tends to suffer from US speckles,
   shadowing and missing edges etc, which make it a challenging task to
   delineate the correct prostate boundaries. In this paper, we propose a
   novel convex optimization based approach to extracting the prostate
   surface from the given 3D TRUS image, while preserving a new global
   volume-size prior. We, especially, study the proposed combinatorial
   optimization problem by convex relaxation and introduce its dual
   continuous max-flow formulation with the new bounded flow conservation
   constraint, which results in an efficient numerical solver implemented
   on GPUs. Experimental results using 12 patient 3D TRUS images show that
   the proposed approach while preserving the volume-size prior yielded a
   mean DSC of 89.5\% +/- 2.4\%, a MAD of 1.4 +/- 0.6 mm, a MAXD of 5.2 +/-
   3.2 mm, and a VD of 7.5\% +/- 6.2\% in similar to 1 minute,
   deomonstrating the advantages of both accuracy and efficiency. In
   addition, the low standard deviation of the segmentation accuracy shows
   a good reliability of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Focal therapy of localized prostate cancer is receiving increased
   attention due to its potential for providing effective cancer control in
   select patients with minimal treatment-related side effects. Magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI)-guided focal laser ablation (FLA) therapy is an
   attractive modality for such an approach. In FLA therapy, accurate
   placement of laser fibers is critical to ensuring that the full target
   volume is ablated. In practice, error in needle placement is invariably
   present due to pre-to intra-procedure image registration error, needle
   deflection, prostate motion, and variability in interventionalist skill.
   In addition, some of these sources of error are difficult to control,
   since the available workspace and patient positions are restricted
   within a clinical MRI bore. In an attempt to take full advantage of the
   utility of intra-procedure MRI, while minimizing error in needle
   placement, we developed an MRI-compatible mechatronic system for guiding
   needles to the prostate for FLA therapy. The system has been used to
   place interstitial catheters for MRI-guided FLA therapy in eight
   subjects in an ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial. Data from these cases
   has provided quantification of the level of uncertainty in needle
   placement error. To relate needle placement error to clinical outcome,
   we developed a model for predicting the probability of achieving
   complete focal target ablation for a family of parameterized treatment
   plans. Results from this work have enabled the specification of
   evidence-based selection criteria for the maximum target size that can
   be confidently ablated using this technique, and quantify the benefit
   that may be gained with improvements in needle placement accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In targeted 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy, patient and
   prostate movement during the procedure can cause target misalignments
   that hinder accurate sampling of pre-planned suspicious tissue
   locations. Multiple solutions have been proposed for motion compensation
   via registration of intra-procedural TRUS images to a baseline 3D TRUS
   image acquired at the beginning of the biopsy procedure. While 2D TRUS
   images are widely used for intra-procedural guidance, some solutions
   utilize richer intra-procedural images such as bi- or multi-planar TRUS
   or 3D TRUS, acquired by specialized probes. In this work, we measured
   the impact of such richer intra-procedural imaging on motion
   compensation accuracy, to evaluate the tradeoff between cost and
   complexity of intra-procedural imaging versus improved motion
   compensation. We acquired baseline and intra-procedural 3D TRUS images
   from 29 patients at standard sextant-template biopsy locations. We used
   the planes extracted from the 3D intra-procedural scans to simulate 2D
   and 3D information available in different clinically relevant scenarios
   for registration. The registration accuracy was evaluated by calculating
   the target registration error (TRE) using manually identified homologous
   fiducial markers (micro-calcifications). Our results indicate that TRE
   improves gradually when the number of intra-procedural imaging planes
   used in registration is increased. Full 3D TRUS information helps the
   registration algorithm to robustly converge to more accurate solutions.
   These results can also inform the design of a fail-safe workflow during
   motion compensation in a system using a tracked 2D TRUS probe, by
   prescribing rotational acquisitions that can be performed quickly and
   easily by the physician immediately prior to needle targeting.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: T2 weighted and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) show promise in isolating prostate tumours. Dynamic contrast
   enhanced (DCE)-MRI has also been employed as a component in
   multi-parametric tumour detection schemes. Model-based parameters such
   as K-trans are conventionally used to characterize DCE images and
   require arterial contrast agent (CR) concentration. A robust parameter
   map that does not depend on arterial input may be more useful for target
   volume delineation. We present a dimensionless parameter (W-io) that
   characterizes CR wash-in and washout rates without requiring arterial CR
   concentration. W-io is compared to K-trans in terms of ability to
   discriminate cancer in the prostate, as demonstrated via comparison with
   histology.
   Methods: Three subjects underwent DCE-MRI using gadolinium contrast and
   7 s imaging temporal resolution. A pathologist identified cancer on
   whole-mount histology specimens, and slides were deformably registered
   to MR images. The ability of W-io maps to discriminate cancer was
   determined through receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)
   analysis.
   Results: There is a trend that W-io shows greater area under the ROC
   curve (AUC) than K-trans with median AUC values of 0.74 and 0.69
   respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant based
   on a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p = 0.13).
   Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate that W-io shows potential as a
   tool for K-trans QA, showing similar ability to discriminate cancer in
   the prostate as K-trans without requiring arterial CR concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Mitral regurgitation (MR) occurs when the mitral valve cannot close
   properly during systole. The NeoChord(C) tool aims to repair MR by
   implanting artificial chordae tendineae on flail leaflets inside the
   beating heart, without a cardiopulmonary bypass. Image guidance is
   crucial for such a procedure due to the lack of direct vision of the
   targets or instruments. While this procedure is currently guided solely
   by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), our previous work has
   demonstrated that guidance safety and efficiency can be significantly
   improved by employing augmented virtuality to provide virtual
   presentation of mitral valve annulus (MVA) and tools integrated with
   real time ultrasound image data. However, real-time mitral annulus
   tracking remains a challenge. In this paper, we describe an image-based
   approach to rapidly track MVA points on 2D/biplane TEE images. This
   approach is composed of two components: an image-based phasing component
   identifying images at optimal cardiac phases for tracking, and a
   registration component updating the coordinates of MVA points.
   Preliminary validation has been performed on porcine data with an
   average difference between manually and automatically identified MVA
   points of 2.5mm. Using a parallelized implementation, this approach is
   able to track the mitral valve at up to 10 images per second.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time registration of pre-operative magnetic resonance (MR) or
   computed tomography (CT) images with intra-operative Ultrasound (US)
   images can be a valuable tool in image-guided therapies and
   interventions. This paper presents an automatic method for dynamically
   tracking the deformation of a soft tissue based on registering
   pre-operative three-dimensional (3D) MR images to intra-operative
   two-dimensional (2D) US images. The registration algorithm is based on
   concepts in state estimation where a dynamic finite element (FE)-based
   linear elastic deformation model correlates the imaging data in the
   spatial and temporal domains. A Kalman-like filtering process estimates
   the unknown deformation states of the soft tissue using the deformation
   model and a measure of error between the predicted and the observed
   intra-operative imaging data. The error is computed based on an
   intensity-based distance metric, namely, modality independent
   neighborhood descriptor (MIND), and no segmentation or feature
   extraction from images is required. The performance of the proposed
   method is evaluated by dynamically deforming 3D pre-operative MR images
   of a breast phantom tissue based on real-time 2D images obtained from an
   US probe. Experimental results on different registration scenarios
   showed that deformation tracking converges in a few iterations. The
   average target registration error on the plane of 2D US images for
   manually selected fiducial points was between 0.3 and 1.5 mm depending
   on the size of deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Image-guided percutaneous ablation is the standard treatment for focal
   liver tumors deemed inoperable and is commonly used to maintain
   eligibility for patients on transplant waitlists. Radiofrequency (RFA),
   microwave (MWA) and cryoablation technologies are all delivered via one
   or a number of needle-shaped probes inserted directly into the tumor.
   Planning is mostly based on contrast CT/MRI. While intra-procedural CT
   is commonly used to confirm the intended probe placement, 2D ultrasound
   (US) remains the main, and in some centers the only imaging modality
   used for needle guidance. Corresponding intraoperative 2D US with
   planning and other intra-procedural imaging modalities is essential for
   accurate needle placement. However, identification of matching features
   of interest among these images is often challenging given the limited
   field-of-view (FOV) and low quality of 2D US images. We have developed a
   passive tracking arm with a motorized scan-head and software tools to
   improve guiding capabilities of conventional US by large FOV 3D US scans
   that provides more anatomical landmarks that can facilitate registration
   of US with both planning and intra-procedural images. The tracker arm is
   used to scan the whole liver with a high geometrical accuracy that
   facilitates multi-modality landmark based image registration. Software
   tools are provided to assist with the segmentation of the ablation
   probes and tumors, find the 2D view that best shows the probe(s) from a
   3D US image, and to identify the corresponding image from planning CT
   scans. In this paper, evaluation results from laboratory testing and a
   phase 1 clinical trial for planning and guiding RFA and MWA procedures
   using the developed system will be presented. Early clinical results
   show a comparable performance to intra-procedural CT that suggests 3D US
   as a cost-effective alternative with no side-effects in centers where CT
   is not available.}},

Abstract = {{Two dimensional (2D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate
   biopsy is the standard approach for definitive diagnosis of prostate
   cancer (PCa). However, due to the lack of image contrast of prostate
   tumors needed to clearly visualize early-stage PCa, prostate biopsy
   often results in false negatives, requiring repeat biopsies. Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been considered to be a promising imaging
   modality for noninvasive identification of PCa, since it can provide a
   high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of early stage PCa.
   Our main objective is to develop and validate a registration method of
   3D MR-TRUS images, allowing generation of volumetric 3D maps of targets
   identified in 3D MR images to be biopsied using 3D TRUS images. Our
   registration method first makes use of an initial rigid registration of
   3D MR images to 3D TRUS images using 6 manually placed approximately
   corresponding landmarks in each image. Following the manual
   initialization, two prostate surfaces are segmented from 3D MR and TRUS
   images and then non-rigidly registered using a thin-plate spline (TPS)
   algorithm. The registration accuracy was evaluated using 4 patient
   images by measuring target registration error (TRE) of manually
   identified corresponding intrinsic fiducials (calcifications and/or
   cysts) in the prostates. Experimental results show that the proposed
   method yielded an overall mean TRE of 2.05 mm, which is favorably
   comparable to a clinical requirement for an error of less than 2.5 mm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a convex optimization-based algorithm for
   segmenting myocardial infarct from clinical 2D late-gadolinium enhanced
   magnetic resonance (LGE-MR) images. Previously segmented left
   ventricular (LV) myocardium was used to define a region of interest for
   the infarct segmentation. The infarct segmentation problem was
   formulated as a continuous min-cut problem, which was solved using its
   dual formulation, the continuous max-flow (CMF). Bhattacharyya intensity
   distribution matching was used as the data term, where the prior
   intensity distributions were computed based on a training data set
   LGE-MR images from seven patients. The algorithm was parallelized and
   implemented in a graphics processing unit for reduced computation time.
   Three-dimensional (3D) volumes of the infarcts were then reconstructed
   using an interpolation technique we developed based on logarithm of
   odds. The algorithm was validated using LGE-MR images from 47 patients
   (309 slices) by comparing computed 2D segmentations and 3D
   reconstructions to manually generated ones. In addition, the developed
   algorithm was compared to several previously reported segmentation
   techniques. The CMF algorithm outperformed the previously reported
   methods in terms of Dice similarity coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the concept of authority adjustment in a dual-user
   system and presents a wave-variable-based controller to guarantee
   dual-user system stability in the presence of a time-varying
   dominance-factor and a constant communication delay. A time-varying
   dominance factor is useful in a dual-user system as it provides greater
   convenience and practicality in telerobotics-based applications such as
   surgical training. However, despite the importance of this issue, it has
   not received much attention in the literature on dual-user systems. The
   controller proposed in this paper includes a local impedance-based
   controller adopted from the literature for each robot and a wave
   transformation modified for the dual-user system with a time-varying
   dominance-factor. In order to investigate closed-loop stability,
   passivity theory has been applied and it has been shown that the
   proposed wave-variable-based controller guarantees system stability in
   the presence of a time-varying dominance factor, while the communication
   channels have constant time delays. Validity of the controller has been
   demonstrated via experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a control strategy for a distributed generation (DG) unit
   that provides a seamless transition between grid connected mode and
   islanded mode is presented. Instead of switching between current control
   and voltage control modes as commonly proposed in the literature, a
   voltage control mode is used in both grid connected and standalone
   modes. The output voltage and frequency are controlled to regulate the
   reactive and real power injected into the grid, respectively. In the
   islanded mode, the output voltage and frequency of the DG unit are
   regulated at their nominal values. Therefore, transition between
   operation modes is achieved by switching the voltage and frequency
   references of the same voltage controller. When the grid is interrupted,
   the DG unit supplies only the load automatically with no abrupt
   transients in the local load voltage and current, even before the
   islanding is detected. The principle and implementation of the control
   strategy to detect the grid conditions and islanding, and to switch
   seamlessly between the two operating modes are developed. The control
   strategy is validated through simulations using a detailed switching
   models in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.}},

Abstract = {{Computer models capable of predicting elbow flexion and extension range
   of motion (ROM) limits would be useful for assisting surgeons in
   improving the outcomes of surgical treatment of patients with elbow
   contractures. A simple and robust computer-based model was developed
   that predicts elbow joint ROM using bone geometries calculated from
   computed tomography image data. The model assumes a hinge-like
   flexion-extension axis, and that elbow passive ROM limits can be based
   on terminal bony impingement. The model was validated against
   experimental results with a cadaveric specimen, and was able to predict
   the flexion and extension limits of the intact joint to 0 degrees and 3
   degrees, respectively. The model was also able to predict the flexion
   and extension limits to 1 degrees and 2 degrees, respectively, when
   simulated osteophytes were inserted into the joint. Future studies based
   on this approach will be used for the prediction of elbow
   flexion-extension ROM in patients with primary osteoarthritis to help
   identify motion-limiting hypertrophic osteophytes, and will eventually
   permit real-time computer-assisted navigated excisions.}},

   nodes by minimizing the total power consumption in the network subject
   to two separate rate constraints for each transceiver. We then present
   an algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. Our simulation
   result shows that the proposed algorithm significantly outperform an

   receive the same levels of power and the total power is equal to that

Abstract = {{We consider the design of a distributed online learning and access
   mechanism for dynamic spectrum access, where channel availability
   statistics are unknown to each secondary user (SU). Unlike existing
   distributed access policies, we explore the instantaneous channel gain
   of SUs' channels for multi-user multi-channel diversity gain. We
   consider an auction-based approach. For the primary channels with
   heterogeneous statistics, we apply the unit demand auction {[}1] to
   determine each SU's selection of a primary channel based on its
   instantaneous rate over each channel. We further propose a learning
   based unit demand (LBUD) auction, where each SU only bids for the M-best
   channels estimated by itself through distributed learning. The new
   mechanism not only reduces communication overhead, but also improves the
   throughput performance when the primary channels have dissimilar
   availability statistics. In addition, we show that the LBUD auction
   preserves the strong property of unit demand auction, i.e. it is
   dominant strategy incentive compatible. To improve the convergence speed
   of the iterative procedure of channel allocation in the auction, we also
   propose an adaptive price increment algorithm. Simulations show the
   effectiveness of our proposed auction mechanism in throughput gain by
   exploring instantaneous channel fade.}},

Abstract = {{Metal matrix composites (MMCs), as a new generation of materials; have
   proven to be viable materials in various industrial fields such as
   biomedical and aerospace. In order to achieve a valuable modification in
   various properties of materials, metallic matrices are reinforced with
   additional phases based on the chemical and/or physical properties
   required in the in-service operating conditions. The presence of the
   reinforcements in MMCs improves the physical, mechanical and thermal
   properties of the composite; however it induces significant issues in
   the domain of machining, such as high tool wear and inferior surface
   finish. The interaction between the tool and abrasive hard reinforcing
   particles induces complex deformation behaviour in the MMC structure.
   Sever tool wear is technically the most important drawback of machining
   MMCs.
   In this study a statistical model is developed to estimate the mean
   residual life (MRL) of the cutting tool during machining Ti-MMCs.
   Initial wear, steady wear and rapid wear regions in the tool wear curve
   are regarded as the different states in the statistical model. Hence,
   the valuable information regarding the estimated total time spent in
   each state, called the sojourn time, and the transition times between
   the states are obtained from the model.
   In this paper the standard cutting conditions, based on the
   recommendation of the tool supplier, are adopted. Based on a Weibull
   model, the reliability and hazard functions are obtained and are
   utilized in order to calculate the MRL and the sojourn times. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Stimuli-responsive micelles formed from amphiphilic copolymers are
   promising materials for the delivery of drugs and can potentially lead
   to enhanced biological properties and efficacies. Among the available
   stimuli, light is particularly attractive, as it can be highly localized
   in time and space. Described here is the development of a new fully
   photodegradable poly(ester amide) (PEA) backbone. Degradation in
   response to UV light was demonstrated by UV-vis spectroscopy, NMR
   spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography. Upon the incorporation
   of an L-aspartic acid-based monomer, providing carboxylic acid
   functional handles along the PEA backbone, the anticancer drug
   paclitaxel (PTX) was conjugated by an ester linkage and poly(ethylene
   oxide) was conjugated via an amide linkage to impart amphiphilicity.
   Micelles were prepared from the resulting amphiphilic copolymer and were
   demonstrated to break down in response to UV irradiation. This led to
   accelerated release of PTX, which is believed to result from the
   increased exposure of the ester linkages to water upon micelle
   disruption. The in vitro toxicities of both UV irradiated and
   non-irradiated micelles were also evaluated and compared to PTX in
   Cremophor EL-ethanol and to micelles without drug.}},

Abstract = {{Wood fiber/plastic composites (WPCs) have attracted considerable
   attention in the construction, furniture, automotive, electronics,
   packaging, and aerospace industries. However, their shortcomings such as
   high density, low ductility, and low impact strength have limited their
   utility in many applications. These shortcomings can be effectively
   compensated for through the foaming of WPC. Foaming technology is a
   family of different processing methods that can produce WPC parts with
   numerous bubbles created by a blowing agent. However, it is not easy to
   obtain fine and uniform cell structures, which are critical to the
   maintenance of mechanical properties when the density is reduced. This
   chapter reviews recent advances in WPC foams, especially focusing on
   their processing technologies. First, we recapitulate the fundamentals
   of foaming process, and then review three types of foam processing
   technologies, i.e., (i) batch foaming processing, (ii) extrusion foaming
   processing, and (iii) injection foam molding processing.}},

Abstract = {{Progesterone, extensively used in human as well as veterinary medicines
   is a progestogen type of hormone. With the aim for hunting the stable

   stabilization of less stable form by co-crystallization. An overview of
   two monotropically related forms of progesterone form-I and form-II,
   synthetic enantiomer, ent-progesterone and racemic progesterone is
   provided. Different methods reported in the literature for the formation
   of polymorphs of progesterone are discussed here. After extensive manual
   screening it has been found that, though there are few methods mentioned
   in the literature for the formation of form-II, there is a lack of
   reproducibility in the recipes. This contribution also briefly reviews
   three other forms of progesterone (form-III, form-IV and form-V) which
   appear only in equilibrium melt and cannot be structurally
   characterized. Finally, comparison of different physical properties of
   form-I and form-II are also addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments conducted in a large wind tunnel set-up investigate the 3D
   flow dynamics within the near-wake region of a horizontal axis wind
   turbine. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements quantify the mean
   and turbulent components of the flow field. Measurements are performed
   in multiple adjacent horizontal planes in order to cover the area behind
   the rotor in a large radial interval, at several locations downstream of
   the rotor. The measurements were phase-locked in order to facilitate the
   re-construction of the three-dimensional flow field. The mean velocity
   and turbulence characteristics clearly correlate with the near-wake
   vortex dynamics and in particular with the helical structure of the
   flow, formed immediately behind the turbine rotor. Due to the tip and
   root vortices, the mean and turbulent characteristics of the flow are
   highly dependent on the azimuth angle in regions close to the rotor and
   close to the blade tip and root. Further from the rotor, the
   characteristics of the flow become phase independent. This can be
   attributed to the breakdown of the vortical structure of the flow,
   resulting from the turbulent diffusion. In general, the highest levels
   of turbulence are observed in shear layer around the tip of the blades,
   which decrease rapidly downstream. The shear zone grows in the radial
   direction as the wake moves axially, resulting in velocity recovery
   toward the centre of the rotor due to momentum transport.}},

Abstract = {{High quality, controlled-structure nanowires (NWs), grown on a
   transparent flexible substrate, have attracted great interest as a mean
   of harvesting solar and mechanical energy. Clarifying their optical and
   piezoelectric properties is essential for this application. In this
   paper, vertically aligned lithium (Li) doped p-type ZnO NWs were grown,
   on a micro-patterned transparent flexible polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)
   substrate, by electrochemical deposition at 88 degrees C. The substrate
   was coated with aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) thin layer, which served as a
   good seed layer and a transparent conductive oxide layer. Varying the
   seed layer thickness gave control of the individual NWs' diameter,
   density and alignment. The effect of doping on the optical band-gap,
   crystalline quality and Schottky barrier were investigated by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and piezoelectric characterization. The
   piezoelectric polarization induced piezo-potential in strained ZnO NWs
   can drive the flow of electrons without an applied electric bias, thus
   can be used to harvest mechanical energy and convert it into
   electricity. To prove this concept, flexible piezoelectric energy
   harvesters based on an array of ZnO NWs were fabricated. Results show
   that the patterned p-type NW-based energy harvester produces 26-fold
   output voltage and 19-fold current compared to the conventional un-doped
   ZnO NW energy harvester from the same acceleration input.}},

   stages of corrosion are the Al8Mn5 intermetallics while a beta-Mg17Al12
   precipitate contaminated with Ni becomes cathodically active at a later
   stage of corrosion. This approach demonstrates the power of correlative
   approaches to probe and understand local electrochemical phenomena. (c)

Abstract = {{The success of orthopedic and dental implants largely depends on their
   biocompatibility with the surrounding body environment and the
   biocompatibility depends on the physical, chemical, mechanical,
   topographical and biological properties of the implant materials chosen.
   Since the last few decades, titanium and its alloys have been among the
   most widely used ones due to their superior biocompatibility and
   mechanical properties; however, pure titanium needs to be pre and/or
   post treated chemically or physically to maintain appropriate textures
   and surface roughness. In the present study, TiO2 nanoparticles
   incorporated polymeric powder coatings consisting of smooth and
   micro-nano scale roughness were developed that exhibited
   biocompatibility towards Human Embryonic Palatial Mesenchymal (HEPM)
   Cells. In addition, an experimental set up was designed and executed to
   evaluate the adhesion/ bond strength of the coating and to measure the
   load bearing capacity that the coatings can withstand before being
   detached from the substrate. Coating's topographical features were
   analyzed by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were
   performed to evaluate the thermal stability of the coating materials.}},

Title = {{Magnetic anisotropy induced in NiCo granular nanostructures by ZnO
   nanorods deposited on a polymer substrate}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{89}},
Pages = {{47987-47991}},
Abstract = {{Hetero-nanostructures made of NiCo and ZnO nanostructures have been
   deposited on a polymer substrate through a two-step method. First a ZnO
   nanorod array was grown on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate by a
   hydrothermal method. NiCo granular nanostructures were then deposited on
   the ZnO nanorod array through an electroless polyol process with
   precursors of Ni complex and Co complex in a mole ratio of 50 : 50. The
   effect of deposition time (t) on the structure and properties of the
   hetero-nanostructures has been studied. Ni-rich nanostructures are
   observed when t < 30 min. With t increasing, the atomic ratio (at.\%) of
   Ni to Co approaches 50 : 50. In addition, a magnetic field (10 kOe) was
   applied on the hetero-nanostructures, which was parallel and
   perpendicular to the ZnO nanorods. The magnetization (M-s) of the NiCo
   nanostructures deposited on ZnO nanorods when t = 60 min is measured at
   93.4 emu g(-1). The results of magnetic measurements and X-ray
   absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) suggest that the
   slightly lower magnetizations of the hetero-nanostructures may be caused
   by the oxidation of Co and Ni on the surface of the granular films. The
   values of squareness ratio (M-r/M-s) of the hetero-nanostructures with t
   are far below 0.5. Moreover, the coercivity (H-c) value of the
   hetero-nanostructures measured in the direction perpendicular to the ZnO
   nanorods is higher than that in the parallel direction. Therefore, the
   deposited NiCo granular nanostructures are perpendicular to the plane of
   the PDMS substrate, and show perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. These
   results clearly demonstrate that the rod-shaped non-magnetic
   nanomaterials can significantly affect the magnetic anisotropy of the
   hetero-nanostructures.}},

Title = {{A Study on Strategic Provisioning of Cloud Computing Services}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Cloud computing is currently emerging as an ever-changing, growing
   paradigm that models ``everything-as-a-service.{''} Virtualised physical
   resources, infrastructure, and applications are supplied by service
   provisioning in the cloud. The evolution in the adoption of cloud
   computing is driven by clear and distinct promising features for both
   cloud users and cloud providers. However, the increasing number of cloud
   providers and the variety of service offerings have made it difficult
   for the customers to choose the best services. By employing successful
   service provisioning, the essential services required by customers, such
   as agility and availability, pricing, security and trust, and user
   metrics can be guaranteed by service provisioning. Hence, continuous
   service provisioning that satisfies the user requirements is a mandatory
   feature for the cloud user and vitally important in cloud computing
   service offerings. Therefore, we aim to review the state-of-the-art
   service provisioning objectives, essential services, topologies, user
   requirements, necessary metrics, and pricing mechanisms. We synthesize
   and summarize different provision techniques, approaches, and models
   through a comprehensive literature review. A thematic taxonomy of cloud
   service provisioning is presented after the systematic review. Finally,
   future research directions and open research issues are identified.}},

Abstract = {{As academic relationship networks are implied in various academic
   activities which relate to study and work experiences of scholars,
   extracting the transaction information of academic activities is
   important for mining academic relations networks. For the
   characteristics of long-distance dependencies in Chinese sentences of
   academic activities, this paper proposes to extract the transaction
   information from Chinese documents by using sequence forecast based on
   Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Often, in research project
   applications, the resumes of applicant and team members include many
   complex Chinese sentences about academic activities. We design novel
   methods to analyze special sentence patterns in those resumes. More
   specifically, we focus on the design of feature templates according to
   the sentences characteristics of academic activities, and employ the
   regular matching method to deal with inaccurate words segmentation,
   especially for academic-specific words. Through evaluating tests, we
   choose the optimum feature templates and input to CRF++ model to label
   trunk words of the sentences. The transaction information extraction of
   academic activities is implemented. Experimental results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for evaluating dynamic wind load
   effects on a heliostat. A 1:50 scale pressure model of the heliostat is
   examined in a boundary layer wind tunnel. The model is instrumented with
   58 pressure taps, with sufficient resolution to capture the abrupt
   spatial and temporal changes in wind forcing due to the turbulent nature
   of the wind. Time histories of generalized forces are generated from the
   wind tunnel data, in combination with structural modal analysis and a
   wind climate model of the site. Critical load effects are examined in
   order to develop pressure distributions for detailed stress analysis of
   selected structural elements. The analysis provides optimized loading
   distributions which are found to be considerably lower than Eurocode
   estimations for global uplift and drag forcing, with favorable and
   unfavorable implications in the design of individual structural

Abstract = {{Multispectral imaging technologies rely on interference-based optical
   filters or grating structures that add cost, size and weight to
   multispectral camera systems. Nanostructures offer an attractive
   alternative since their optical properties can be specified precisely
   during fabrication and nanostructures are suitable for integration into
   present camera technologies. However, nanostructure-based optical
   filters have broad-band transmission properties and poor out-of-band
   blocking that reduce their spectroscopic performance and therefore limit
   their usefulness in multispectral imaging applications. In an attempt to
   break through these barriers, our group has developed a series of
   nanostructure-based optical filters with progressively improved optical
   transmission properties. The devices rely on the principle of index
   matching to reduce the transmission bandwidth and improve the
   out-of-band blocking. We have investigated the effect of packing the
   optical filters in proximity to one another, as well as the use of a
   tiled arrangement of several thousand optical filters for snapshot
   multispectral imaging in chemical analysis. Based on these studies, we
   conclude that nanostructure-based optical filters are suitable for
   multispectral imaging in the near infrared. In the future,
   nanostructure-based optical filters may be useful for integration into
   diagnostic instrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We aimed to develop a way to rapidly generate multi-modality
   (MRI-CT) pulmonary imaging structure-function maps using novel non-rigid
   image registration methods. This objective is part of our overarching
   goal to provide an image processing pipeline to generate pulmonary
   structure-function maps and guide airway-targeted therapies.
   Methods: Anatomical H-1 and functional He-3 MRI were acquired in 5
   healthy asymptomatic ex-smokers and 7 ex-smokers with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at inspiration breath-hold.
   Thoracic CT was performed within ten minutes of MRI using the same
   breath-hold volume. Landmark-based affine registration methods
   previously validated for imaging of COPD, was based on corresponding
   fiducial markers located in both CT and H-1 MRI coronal slices and
   compared with shape-based CT-MRI non-rigid registration. Shape-based
   CT-MRI registration was developed by first identifying the shapes of the
   lung cavities manually, and then registering the two shapes using affine
   and thin-plate spline algorithms. We compared registration accuracy
   using the fiducial localization error (FLE) and target registration
   error (TRE).
   Results: For landmark-based registration, the TRE was 8.4 +/- 5.3 mm for
   whole lung and 7.8 +/- 4.6 mm for the R and L lungs registered
   independently (p=0.4). For shape-based registration, the TRE was 8.0 +/-
   4.6 mm for whole lung as compared to 6.9 +/- 4.4 mm for the R and L lung
   registered independently and this difference was significant (p=0.01).
   The difference for shape-based (6.9 +/- 4.4 mm) and landmark-based R and
   L lung registration (7.8 +/- 4.6 mm) was also significant (p=.04)
   Conclusion: Shape-based registration TRE was significantly improved
   compared to landmark-based registration when considering L and R lungs
   independently.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac ischemic injuries can be classified into two main categories:
   reversible and irreversible. Treatment of reversible damages is possible
   through revascularization therapies. Clinically, it is quite vital to
   determine the reversibility of ischemic injuries and local efficiency
   using accurate diagnostics techniques. For this purpose, a number of
   imaging techniques have been developed. To our knowledge, while some of
   these techniques are capable of assessing tissue viability which is
   believed to be correlated with ischemic injuries reversibility, none of
   them are capable of providing information about local myocardial tissue
   efficiency. Note that this efficiency indicates the local tissue
   contribution to the overall (global) heart mechanical function which is
   characterized by parameters such as ejection fraction. While contraction
   force generation of the myocardium is a reliable and straightforward
   mechanical measure for the local myocardium functionality, it is also
   hypothesized that the level of damage reversibility expected from
   therapy is proportional to the intensity and distribution of these
   forces. As such this research involves developing a new imaging
   technique for cardiac contraction force quantification. This work is
   also geared towards another application, namely Cardiac
   Resynchronization Therapy (CRT), specifically for electrode leads
   configuration optimization. The latter has not been tackled through a
   systematic technique thus far. In the proposed method, contraction force
   reconstruction is accomplished by an inverse problem algorithm solved
   through an optimization framework which uses forward mechanical
   modelling of the myocardium iteratively to obtain the contraction forces
   field. As a result, the method requires a forward mechanical model of
   the myocardium which is computationally efficient and robust against
   divergence. Therefore, we developed such a model which considers all
   aspects of the myocardial mechanics including hyperelasticity,
   anisotropy, and active contraction forces of the fibers. This model
   assumes two major parts for the myocardium consisting background tissue
   and reinforcement bars simulating myocardial fibers. The finite element
   simulations of this model demonstrated reasonably good performance in
   mimicking left ventricle (LV) contractile function.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer detection at early stages is crucial for desirable
   treatment outcome. Among available imaging modalities, ultrasound (US)
   elastography is being developed as an effective clinical tool for
   prostate cancer diagnosis. Current clinical US elastography systems
   utilise strain imaging where tissue strain images are generated to
   approximate the tissue elastic modulus distribution. While strain images
   can be generated in real-time fashion, they lack the accuracy necessary
   for having desirable sensitivity and specificity. To improve strain
   imaging, full inversion based elastography techniques were proposed.
   Among these techniques, a constrained elastography technique was
   developed which showed promising results as long as the tumor and
   prostate geometry can be obtained accurately from the imaging modality
   used in conjunction with the elastography system. This requirement is
   not easy to fulfill, especially with US imaging. To address this issue,
   we present an unconstrained full inversion prostate elastography method
   in conjunction with US imaging where knowledge of tissue geometry is not
   necessary. One of the reasons that full inversion elastography
   techniques have not been routinely used in the clinic is lack of
   clinical validation studies. To our knowledge, no quasi-static full
   inversion based prostate US elastography technique has been applied in
   vivo before. In this work, the proposed method was applied to clinical
   prostate data and reconstructed elasticity images were compared to
   corresponding annotated histopathology images which is the first
   quasi-static full inversion based prostate US elastography technique
   applied successfully in vivo. Results demonstrated a good potential for
   clinical utility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Low-birthweight infants are at an increased risk of a compromised airway
   when restrained in a child safety seat (CSS). Neonatal intensive care
   units (NICUs) use rolled towels and other positioning aids with a
   variety of unique techniques and methodologies to adapt a CSS to the
   specialised needs of this particular population at the time of
   discharge. A preemie positioning device (PPD) was developed as an
   enhancement to the existing occupant restraints, taking into
   consideration infant anthropometry, materials with suitable properties
   and analyses of infant airway patency. A numerical model consisting of a
   five-point CSS with the PPD and a novel anthropomorphic testing device
   representing a small infant weighing less than 2.5kg was developed. The
   performance of the PPD was assessed through observation of the angle of
   the neck in flexion-extension bending during driving scenarios which may
   inhibit the respiratory function of a low-birthweight infant. Three foam
   materials and three PPD geometries exhibited more favourable neck angles
   with the PPD. In braking and roundabout scenarios the neck angle was
   increased in the range of 10 degrees-30 degrees. A sharp-turn manoeuvre
   yielded similar results with and without the PPD in terms of the final
   position of the head with respect to the torso. The proposed positioning
   aid is predicted to reduce the likelihood of respiratory compromise
   resulting from repositioning of the infant due to vehicle excitations.
   Analyses of crash performance indicate that with proper selection of the
   foam the PPD has similar or improved performance over a commercial CSS.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{11099-11106}},
Abstract = {{A short time microwave irradiation based synthesis method of phase pure
   cubic CoS2 nanoparticles is reported in this study for the first time.
   The energy density (ED) of hybrid supercapacitors based on CoS2 as an
   anode having activated carbon as a cathode has been enhanced by using
   the higher operating potential of organic electrolytes and by increasing
   the concentration of the mobile ionic species at the negative electrode,
   in addition to the lithium ions present in the electrolyte. The specific
   capacitance delivered by non-lithiated CoS2 nanoflakes was 52 F g(-1) at
   a current rate of 0.7 A g(-1) between 0 and 3 V using a LiPF6-based
   electrolyte. Increasing the concentration of the mobile ionic species,
   i.e., lithium, at the anode enhanced the performance of the hybrid
   supercapacitor to 119 F g(-1) at a current rate of 0.7 A g (1). The
   hierarchical arrangement of pores in the electroactive material allowed
   high electrolyte access and reduced the length of the ionic pathway.
   Consequently, the lithiated form exhibited an ED of 37 W h kg(-1) with a
   power density of 1 kW kg(-1) at a current rate of 0.7 A g(-1), compared
   to only 15 W h kg(-1) for the non-lithiated sample. Furthermore, both
   samples maintained superior stability over extended cycling for 10 000
   cycles at a very high PD of 4 kW kg(-1) with a capacitance retention of
   100\% for the lithiated sample and 80\% for the non-lithiated sample.
   These results will be useful in the fabrication of high ED, high rate
   hybrid supercapacitors for electric vehicle applications.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit the doubly-layered sandwich detector configuration for
   single-shot dual-energy x-ray imaging. In order to understand its proper
   operation, we investigated the contrast-to-noise performance in terms of
   the x-ray beam setup using the Monte Carlo methods. Using a pair of
   active photodiode arrays coupled to phosphor screens, we have built a
   sandwich detector. For better spectral separation between the projection
   images obtained from the front and rear detectors during a single x-ray
   exposure, we inserted a copper sheet between two detectors. We have
   successfully obtained soft tissue-and bone-enhanced images for a
   postmortem mouse with the developed sandwich detector using weighted
   logarithmic subtraction, and the image quality was comparable to those
   achieved by the conventional kVp-switching technique. Although some
   problems to be mitigated for the optimal and practical use, for example,
   the scatter effect and image registration, are still left, the
   performance of the sandwich detector for single-shot dual-energy x-ray
   imaging is promising. We expect that the active sandwich detector will
   provide motion-artifact-free dual-energy images with a reasonable image

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used for
   image-guided biopsy and focal therapy of prostate cancer. A combined
   rigid and deformable registration technique is proposed to register
   pre-treatment diagnostic 3 T magnetic resonance (MR) images, with the
   identified target tumor(s), to the intra-treatment 1.5 T MR images. The
   pre-treatment 3 T images are acquired with patients in strictly supine
   position using an endorectal coil, while 1.5 T images are obtained
   intra-operatively just before insertion of the ablation needle with
   patients in the lithotomy position. An intensity-based registration
   routine rigidly aligns two images in which the transformation parameters
   is initialized using three pairs of manually selected approximate
   corresponding points. The rigid registration is followed by a deformable
   registration algorithm employing a generic dynamic linear elastic
   deformation model discretized by the finite element method (FEM). The
   model is used in a classical state estimation framework to estimate the
   deformation of the prostate based on a similarity metric between pre-
   and intra-treatment images. Registration results using 10 sets of
   prostate MR images showed that the proposed method can significantly
   improve registration accuracy in terms of target registration error
   (TRE) for all prostate substructures. The root mean square (RMS) TRE of
   46 manually identified fiducial points was found to be 2.40 +/- 1.20 mm,
   2.51 +/- 1.20 mm, and 2.28 +/- 1.22 mm for the whole gland (WG), central
   gland (CG), and peripheral zone (PZ), respectively after deformable
   registration. These values are improved from 3.15 +/- 1.60 mm, 3.09 +/-
   1.50 mm, and 3.20 +/- 1.73 mm in the WG, CG and PZ, respectively
   resulted from rigid registration. Registration results are also
   evaluated based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean absolute
   surface distances (MAD) and maximum absolute surface distances (MAXD) of
   the WG and CG in the prostate images.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible batteries possess several unique features including high
   flexibility, lightweight and easy portability, high specific power and
   energy density, and remarkable rate capability, etc. So far, many
   different kinds of flexible batteries have been invented. The batteries,
   according to the electrochemical processes in a cell, can be categorized
   as flexible alkaline batteries, plastic batteries (or all-polymer
   batteries), polymer lithium-metal batteries (with lithium foil as an
   anode), and flexible rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs), etc.
   Among these, flexible LIBs attract more rapidly increasing attention. As
   compared to the conventional rechargeable LIBs, fabrication of flexible
   LIBs is more challenging. An optimal match among the core components,
   i.e., nanostructured electrode materials, shape-conformable solid
   electrolytes, and soft current collectors should be achieved, so that
   the batteries maintain stable electrochemical performances even though
   they are deformed to fit the powered devices. Thus, fabrication of such
   batteries is not cost-effective and hence, is also inefficient. In the
   search for the potential core components for flexible LIBs, much
   progress has been made in screening solid state electrolytes, soft
   current collectors and electrode materials, and in electrode design and
   full LIB cell assembly (particularly in managing to get the three core
   components to work harmonically). There are also studies focusing on
   fundamental understanding and simulation of fully flexible LIBs. They
   reliably anticipate and describe the battery performances that are not
   easily explored experimentally using the present state-of-the-art
   technologies. In this review, we systematically summarize the advances
   in flexible LIBs research, with focus on the development of flexible
   electrodes. The review proceeds in terms of the processes for making
   electrodes and full LIB cells so as to emphasize the materials and
   process technologies. The development of solid state electrolytes and
   the fundamental understanding and simulation of flexible LIBs are also
   addressed. The review concludes with a perspective according to the
   author's experience in the related field, and the potential application
   of printing processes in flexible LIB fabrication is especially
   emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Flooding often has devastating consequences. It is important to
   understand the evolution of these risks as climate changes. Municipal
   infrastructure is designed using historical data that no longer
   accurately represents current climate conditions, indicating
   infrastructure may underperform. The purpose of this study is to apply a
   new methodology for the assessment of climate change caused flood risk
   by Bowering et al. (2013) to the City of London, Ontario, Canada.
   Floodplain maps derived from climate, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
   provide direct input into risk assessment procedure. Inundated
   infrastructure and high risk areas are identified in tables and maps for
   two climate and two hydraulic scenarios. Results indicate the most
   critical flood scenario is the 100 year climate change upper bound and
   high risk is driven by expensive infrastructure located in the
   floodplains. Results of the study are used as the support for climate
   change adaptation policy development and emergency management.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MPMRI) supports
   detection and staging of prostate cancer, but the image characteristics
   needed for tumor boundary delineation to support focal therapy have not
   been widely investigated. We quantified the detectability (image
   contrast between tumor and non-cancerous contralateral tissue) and the
   localizability (image contrast between tumor and non-cancerous
   neighboring tissue) of Gleason score 7 (GS7) peripheral zone (PZ) tumors
   on MPMRI using tumor contours mapped from histology using accurate 2D-3D
   registration.
   Methods: MPMRI {[}comprising T2-weighted (T2W),
   dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
   and contrast transfer coefficient images] and post-prostatectomy
   digitized histology images were acquired for 6 subjects. Histology
   contouring and grading (approved by a genitourinary pathologist)
   identified 7 GS7 PZ tumors. Contours were mapped to MPMRI images using
   semi-automated registration algorithms (combined target registration
   error: 2 mm) For each focus, three measurements of mean +/- standard
   deviation of image intensity were taken on each image: tumor tissue
   (m(T) +/- S-T), non-cancerous PZ tissue < 5 mm from the tumor (m(N) +/-
   s(N)), and non-cancerous contralateral PZ tissue (m(c) +/- s(c)).
   Detectability {[}D = (m(T) - m(c))/root S-T(2) + S-C(2)] and
   localizability {[}L = (m(T) - m(N))/root S-T(2) + S-N(2)] were
   quantified for each focus on each image.
   Results: T2W images showed the strongest detectability, although
   detectability vertical bar D vertical bar >= 1 was observed on either
   ADC or DCE images, or both, for all foci. Localizability on all
   modalities was variable; however, ADC images showed localizability
   vertical bar L vertical bar >= 1 for 3 foci.
   Conclusions: Delineation of GS7 PZ tumors on individual MPMRI images
   faces challenges; however, images may contain complementary information,
   suggesting a role for fusion of information across MPMRI images for
   delineation.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of prostate tumour volume can inform prognosis and treatment
   selection, including an assessment of the suitability and feasibility of
   focal therapy, which can potentially spare patients the deleterious side
   effects of radical treatment. Prostate biopsy is the clinical standard
   for diagnosis but provides limited information regarding tumour volume
   due to sparse tissue sampling. A non-invasive means for accurate
   determination of tumour burden could be of clinical value and an
   important step toward reduction of overtreatment. Multi-parametric
   magnetic resonance imaging (MPMRI) is showing promise for prostate
   cancer diagnosis. However, the accuracy and inter-observer variability
   of prostate tumour volume estimation based on separate expert contouring
   of T2-weighted (T2W), dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), and
   diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI sequences acquired using an endorectal coil
   at 3T is currently unknown. We investigated this question using a
   histologic reference standard based on a highly accurate MPMRI-histology
   image registration and a smooth interpolation of planimetric tumour
   measurements on histology. Our results showed that prostate tumour
   volumes estimated based on MPMRI consistently overestimated histological
   reference tumour volumes. The variability of tumour volume estimates
   across the different pulse sequences exceeded inter-observer variability
   within any sequence. Tumour volume estimates on DCE MRI provided the
   lowest inter-observer variability and the highest correlation with
   histology tumour volumes, whereas the apparent diffusion coefficient
   (ADC) maps provided the lowest volume estimation error. If validated on
   a larger data set, the observed correlations could support the
   development of automated prostate tumour volume segmentation algorithms
   as well as correction schemes for tumour burden estimation on MPMRI.}},

Title = {{Bioconversion of coal: new insights from a core flooding study}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{22779-22791}},
Abstract = {{A pressurized core flooding experiment was performed to better
   understand in situ coal bioconversion processes. The core flooding
   experiment was conducted using a biaxial core holder packed with
   subbituminous coal particles (250-150 mu m grain size) obtained from the
   Highvale mine in Alberta, Canada. The coal pack was inoculated with a
   methanogenic microbial culture enriched from coal and was continuously
   flooded with mineral salt medium and an organic carbon/nitrogen nutrient
   supplement (tryptone). The changes in the physical properties of the
   coal pack during the core flooding suggested coal bioconversion to
   methane under the experimental conditions. Colonization and
   bioconversion of coal by microbes was evident from the change in core
   permeability and presence of metabolites and gas (CH4 and CO2) in the
   effluent. A total of 1.52 mu mol of CH4 was produced per gram of coal
   during the 90 days experiment at 22 degrees C. Signature metabolites
   consistent with anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons, e.g.,
   carboxylic acids, were identified in effluent samples throughout
   incubation. The transient nature of metabolites in effluent samples
   supports fermentation of coal constituents and nutrient supplement to
   simple molecules such as acetic acid, which served as a substrate for
   methanogenesis during the bioconversion process. Accumulation of
   carboxylic acids such as succinic acid in the effluent also demonstrates
   that the coal bioconversion process may be used for extraction of other
   value-added products apart from CH4 generation. Importantly, results
   presented here suggest that coal bioconversion by biostimulation under
   reservoir conditions is a scalable technology with potential for energy
   generation and for overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a hybrid model that includes both a standard finite
   element model and also volume-preserving structural modeling for a
   clinical application involving skull development in infants, with
   particular application to craniostosis modeling. To accommodate the
   growing brain, the skull needs to grow quickly in the first few months
   of life, and most of the growth of the skull at that time occurs at the
   sutures. Craniosynostosis, which is a developmental abnormality, occurs
   when one or more sutures are fused early in life (even in utero) while
   the skull is growing, resulting in an abnormal skull shape. To study
   normal brain-skull growth and to develop a model of craniosynostosis, we
   have developed a hybrid computational model to simulate the relationship
   between the growing deformable brain and the rigid skull. Our model is
   composed of the nine segmented skull plates as rigid surfaces,
   deformable sutures, and a volumetrically controllable deformable brain.
   The Cranial Index (ratio of biparietal width to fronto-occipital length)
   is measured during the simulation, showing a characteristic peak during
   development. Measures of linear growth along each dimension show
   characteristic increases over time. The hybrid simulation framework
   shows promise to support further investigations into abnormal skull
   development. By varying the properties of the sutures in our model, we
   can now simulate different craniosynostosis models, such as
   scaphocephaly and trigonocephaly. In this paper, we show results on the
   evolution of the Cranial Index as calculated using standard landmarks
   and compare to the normal index, and thereby evaluate our model by
   comparing it with patient data.}},

Abstract = {{The present work focuses on the synthesis of lithium ionic conductors
   based on a Li2S-Al2S3-GeS-P2S5 system due to the high ionic conductivity
   exhibited by the constituents of this system. Mechanical milling for a
   short duration and a single step heat treatment at a moderate
   temperature of 550 degrees C resulted in crystalline powders with high
   lithium ionic conductivity at room temperature that are comparable to
   the organic liquid electrolytes. The effect of various aluminum to
   germanium ratios was studied. Among the samples containing Al : Ge, the
   ratio of 30 : 70 was found to show high ionic conductivities of 1.7 x
   10(-3) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and similar to 6 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at
   100 degrees C equivalent. The activation energy of this material was
   significantly less (E-a = 17 kJ mol(-1)), which can be considered to be
   the best value among solid electrolytes. The electrochemical stability
   was analyzed using cyclic voltammetry between -0.3 and 5.0 V and it was
   found that the voltammetric profile was smooth without any additional
   current response, due to electrolyte decomposition, or any other side
   reaction, except a pair of lithium deposition and stripping peaks.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a two-dimensional multispectral imager that exploits the
   extraordinary optical transmission of nanohole arrays (NHAs) in a metal
   film for color separation. The NHA device consisted of blocks in a tiled
   arrangement, where each block contained multiple metallic NHAs, each
   with unique feature geometry to enable separation of a mixture of colors
   into distinct spectral bands. The NHA device was integrated into an
   optical imaging system. The system was used to capture near video-rate
   images of a scene and then unmix the colors within the scene into 4
   spectral bands in the near-infrared regime.}},

Abstract = {{Proline cis-trans isomerization (CTI) plays a key role in the
   rate-determining steps of protein folding. Accurate prediction of
   proline CTI is of great importance for the understanding of protein
   folding, splicing, cell signaling, and transmembrane active transport in
   both the human body and animals. Our goal is to develop a
   state-of-the-art proline CTI predictor based on a biophysically
   motivated intelligent consensus modeling through the use of sequence
   information only (i.e., position specific scores generated by
   PSI-BLAST). The current computational proline CTI predictors reach about
   70-73 percent Q2 accuracies and about 0.40 Matthew correlation
   coefficient (Mcc) through the use of sequence-based evolutionary
   information as well as predicted protein secondary structure
   information. However, our approach that utilizes a novel decision
   tree-based consensus model with a powerful randomized-metalearning
   technique has achieved 86.58 percent Q2 accuracy and 0.74 Mcc, on the
   same proline CTI data set, which is a better result than those of any
   existing computational proline CTI predictors reported in the

Abstract = {{Purpose: Video-based movement analysis software (Dartfish) has potential
   for clinical applications for understanding shoulder motion if
   functional measures can be reliably obtained. The primary purpose of
   this study was to describe the functional range of motion (ROM) of the
   shoulder used to perform a subset of functional tasks. A second purpose
   was to assess the reliability of functional ROM measurements obtained by
   different raters using Dartfish software. Materials and Methods: Ten
   healthy participants, mean age 29 5 years, were videotaped while
   performing five tasks selected from the Disabilities of the Arm,
   Shoulder and Hand (DASH). Video cameras and markers were used to obtain
   video images suitable for analysis in Dartfish software. Three
   repetitions of each task were performed. Shoulder movements from all
   three repetitions were analyzed using Dartfish software. The tracking
   tool of the Dartfish software was used to obtain shoulder joint angles
   and arcs of motion. Test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the
   measurements were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients
   (ICC). Results: Maximum (coronal plane) abduction (118 degrees 16
   degrees) and (sagittal plane) flexion (111 degrees 15 degrees) was
   observed during washing ones hair; maximum extension (68 degrees 9
   degrees) was identified during washing ones own back. Minimum shoulder
   ROM was observed during opening a tight jar (33 degrees 13 degrees
   abduction and 13 degrees 19 degrees flexion). Test-retest reliability
   (ICC = 0.45 to 0.94) suggests high inter-individual task variability,
   and inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.68 to 1.00) showed moderate to
   excellent agreement. Conclusion: Key findings include: 1) functional
   shoulder ROM identified in this study compared to similar studies; 2)
   healthy individuals require less than full ROM when performing five
   common ADL tasks 3) high participant variability was observed during
   performance of the five ADL tasks; and 4) Dartfish software provides a
   clinically relevant tool to analyze shoulder function.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible electronic circuitry is an emerging technology that will
   significantly impact the future of healthcare and medicine, food safety
   inspection, environmental monitoring, and public security. Recent
   advances in drop-on-demand printing technology and electrically
   conductive inks have enabled simple electronic circuits to be fabricated
   on mechanically flexible polymers, paper, and bioresorbable silk.
   Research has shown that graphene, and its derivative formulations, can
   be used to create low-cost electrically conductive inks. Graphene is a
   one atom thick two-dimensional layer composed of carbon atoms arranged
   in a hexagonal lattice forming a material with very high fracture
   strength, high Young's Modulus, and low electrical resistance.
   Non-conductive graphene-oxide (GO) inks can also be synthesized from
   inexpensive graphite powders. Once deposited on the flexible substrate
   the electrical conductivity of the printed GO microcircuit traces can be
   restored through thermal reduction. In this paper, a femtosecond laser
   with a wavelength of 775nm and pulse width of 120fs is used to transform
   the non-conductive printed GO film into electrically conductive oxygen
   reduced graphene-oxide (rGO) passive electronic components by the
   process of laser assisted thermal reduction. The heat affected zone
   produced during the process was minimized because of the femtosecond
   pulsed laser. The degree of conductivity exhibited by the microstructure
   is directly related to the laser power level and exposure time. Although
   rGO films have higher resistances than pristine graphene, the ability to
   inkjet print capacitive elements and modify local resistive properties
   provides for a new method of fabricating sensor microcircuits on a
   variety of substrate surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Non-conductive graphene-oxide (GO) inks can be synthesized from
   inexpensive graphite powders and deposited on functionalized flexible
   substrates using inkjet printing technology. Once deposited, the
   electrical conductivity of the GO film can be restored through laser
   assisted thermal reduction. Unfortunately, the inkjet nozzle diameter
   (similar to 40 mu m) places a limit on the printed feature size. In
   contrast, a tightly focused femtosecond pulsed laser can create precise
   micro features with dimensions in the order of 2 to 3 mu m. The smallest
   feature size produced by laser microfabrication is a function of the
   laser beam diameter, power level, feed rate, material characteristics
   and spatial resolution of the micro-positioning system. Laser
   micromachining can also remove excess GO film material adjacent to the
   electrode traces and passive electronic components. Excess material
   removal is essential for creating stable oxygen-reduced graphene-oxide
   (rGO) printed circuits because electron buildup along the feature edges
   will alter the conductivity of the non-functional film. A study on the
   impact of laser ablation on the GO film and the substrate are performed
   using a 775nm, 120fs pulsed laser. The average laser power was 25mW at a
   spot size of similar to 5 mu m, and the feed rate was 1000-1500mm/min.
   Several simple microtraces were fabricated and characterized in terms of
   electrical resistance and surface topology.}},

Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Degradable biomaterials continue to play a major role in tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine as well as for delivering
   therapeutic agents. Although the chemistry of polyphosphazenes has been
   studied extensively, a systematic review of their applications for a
   wide range of biomedical applications is lacking. Polyphosphazenes are
   synthesized through a relatively well-known two- step reaction scheme
   which involves the substitution of the initial linear precursor with a
   wide range of nucleophiles. The ease of substitution has led to the
   development of a broad class of materials that have been studied for
   numerous biomedical applications including as scaffold materials for
   tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The objective of this
   review is to discuss the suitability of poly(amino acid ester)
   phosphazene biomaterials in regard to their unique stimuli responsive
   properties, tunable degradation rates and mechanical properties, as well
   as in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility. The application of these
   materials in areas such as tissue engineering and drug delivery is
   discussed systematically. Lastly, the utility of polyphosphazenes is
   further extended as they are being employed in blend materials for new
   applications and as another method of tailoring material properties.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The use of ozone as an oxidizing agent for atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   processes is rapidly growing due to its strong oxidizing capabilities.
   However, the effect of ozone on nanostructured substrates such as
   nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and pristine
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PCNTs) are not very well understood and
   may provide an avenue toward functionalizing the carbon nanotube surface
   prior to deposition. The effects of ALD ozone treatment on NCNTs and
   PCNTs using 10 wt. \% ozone at temperatures of 150, 250, and 300 degrees
   C are studied. The effect of ozone pulse time and ALD cycle number on
   NCNTs and PCNTs was also investigated. Morphological changes to the
   substrate were observed by scanning electron microscopy and high
   resolution transmission electron microscopy. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
   measurements were also conducted to determine surface area, pore size,
   and pore size distribution following ozone treatment. The graphitic
   nature of both NCNTs and PCNTs was determined using Raman analysis while
   x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to probe the
   chemical nature of NCNTs. It was found that O-3 attack occurs
   preferentially to the outermost geometric surface of NCNTs. Our research
   also revealed that the deleterious effects of ozone are found only on
   NCNTs while little or no damage occurs on PCNTs. Furthermore, XPS
   analysis indicated that ALD ozone treatment on NCNTs, at elevated
   temperatures, results in loss of nitrogen content. Our studies
   demonstrate that ALD ozone treatment is an effective avenue toward
   creating low nitrogen content, defect rich substrates for use in
   electrochemical applications and ALD of various metal/metal oxides. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a three dimensional (3D) metallic nanostructure, which has
   transmission resonance properties related to both localized surface
   plasmons and propagating surface plasmon polaritons. Various geometrical
   dimensions of the 3D metallic nanostructures were studied by means of
   simulation and experiment with respect to resonance position, resonance
   line width and bulk sensitivity. Narrower resonance line width and
   higher bulk sensitivity were achieved for the 3D nanostructure compared
   to conventional nanohole arrays. Finally, a 3D metallic nanostructure
   functionalized with a biotinylated thiol could detect streptavidin,
   suggesting the device may have potential as a bio-sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Based on video recordings of the movement of the patients with epilepsy,
   this paper proposed a human action recognition scheme to detect distinct
   motion patterns and to distinguish the normal status from the abnormal
   status of epileptic patients. The scheme first extracts local features
   and holistic features, which are complementary to each other.
   Afterwards, a support vector machine is applied to classification. Based
   on the experimental results, this scheme obtains a satisfactory
   classification result and provides a fundamental analysis towards the
   human-robot interaction with socially assistive robots in caring the
   patients with epilepsy (or other patients with brain disorders) in order

Abstract = {{Simultaneous dynamic fluorescent imaging of a suitable untargeted tracer
   in conjunction with any molecular targeted fluorescent agent has been
   shown to be a powerful approach for quantifying cancer-specific cell
   surface receptors in vivo in the presence of non-specific uptake and
   tracer delivery variability. The identification of a ``suitable{''}
   untargeted tracer (i.e., one having equivalent plasma and tissue
   delivery pharmacokinetics to the targeted tracer) for every targeted
   tracer, however, may not always be feasible or could require extensive
   testing. This work presents a ``deconvolution{''} approach capable of
   correcting for plasma and tissue-delivery pharmacokinetic differences
   between tracers by quantifying dynamic differences in targeted and
   untargeted tracer uptake in a receptor-free tissue (one devoid of
   targeted molecular species) and correcting uptake in all other tissues
   accordingly. This deconvolution correction approach is evaluated in
   theoretical models and explored in an in vivo mouse xenograft model of
   human glioma. In the animal experiments, epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR: a receptor known to be overexpressed in the investigated
   glioma cell line) was targeted using a fluorescent tracer with very
   different plasma pharmacokinetics than a second untargeted fluorescent
   tracer. Without correcting for these differences, the dual-tracer
   approach yielded substantially higher estimations of EGFR concentration
   in all tissues than expected; however, deconvolution correction was able
   to produce estimates that matched ex vivo validation.}},

Title = {{Estimating extreme wind speed based on regional frequency analysis}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{67-77}},
Abstract = {{The quantiles of wind speed at spatially distributed locations within a
   region that are needed for codifying wind load can be estimated based on
   the at-site analysis of the annual maximum wind speed using records at a
   number of meteorological stations. The historical wind records and
   available meteorological stations, however, are often short and
   insufficient or unavailable; a decreased sample size increases the
   uncertainty in the estimated quantiles. To overcome the problem with
   data insufficiency, the use of the regional frequency analysis applied
   to annual maximum wind speed is investigated in this study by using wind
   records from 235 Canadian meteorological stations. The analysis uses the
   k-means, hierarchical and self-organizing map clustering to explore
   potential clusters or regions; statistical tests are then applied to
   identify homogeneous regions for subsequent regional frequency analysis.
   Results indicate that the k-means is the preferred exploratory tool for
   the considered data, and that the discordancy measure is valuable to
   identify stations with wind records that may require further scrutiny.
   Results also indicate that the generalized extreme value distribution
   provides a better fit to the normalized data within a cluster than the
   Gumbel distribution. However, the former is associated with low values
   of the upper bound that influence significantly the return period values
   with return period greater than 500 years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{A numerical study, based on a density-dependent variably saturated
   groundwater flow model, was conducted to investigate flow and salt
   transport in a nearshore aquifer under intensified wave conditions
   caused by offshore storms. Temporally varying onshore hydraulic
   gradients due to wave setup were determined as the seaward boundary
   condition for the simulated aquifer. The results showed a rapid increase
   in influxes across the aquifer-ocean interface in response to the wave
   event followed by a more gradual increase in effluxes. The upper saline
   plume first widened horizontally as the wave setup point moved landward.
   It then expanded vertically with recirculating seawater pushed downward
   by the wave-induced hydraulic gradient. The time for the salt
   distribution to return to the prestorm condition was up to a hundred
   days and correlated strongly with the time for seawater to recirculate
   through the aquifer. The pathways of recirculating seawater and fresh
   groundwater were largely modified by the wave event. These pathways
   crossed through the same spatial locations at similar times, indicating
   significant salt-freshwater mixing. The flow and salt transport dynamics
   were more responsive to wave events of longer duration and higher
   intensity, especially in more permeable aquifers with lower fresh
   groundwater discharge. Despite their larger response, aquifers with
   higher permeability and beach slope recovered more rapidly postevent.
   The rapid recovery of the flows compared with the salinity distribution
   should be considered in field data interpretation. Due to their
   long-lasting impact, wave events may significantly influence the
   geochemical conditions and the fate of chemicals in a subterranean
   estuary.}},

Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{Molecular surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing is one of the most
   common applications of an array of periodic nanoholes in a metal film.
   However, metallic nanohole arrays (NHAs) with low-hole count have lower
   resolution and SPR sensing performance compared to NHAswith high-hole
   count. In this paper, we present a compact three-dimensional (3D)
   plasmonic nanostructure with extraordinary optical transmission
   properties benefiting from surface plasmon matching and enhanced
   localized surface plasmon coupling. The 3D nanostructure consisted of a
   gold film containing a NHA with an underlying cavity and a gold nanocone
   array (NCA) at the bottom of the cavity. Each nanocone was aligned with
   the nanohole above and the truncated apex of each nanocone was in close
   proximity (100 nm) to the gold film. The NHA-NCA structures outperformed
   conventional NHA structures in terms of bulk sensitivity and Figure of
   Merit (FOM). Furthermore, the NHA-NCA structure with 525 nm periodicity
   was capable of sensing streptavidin down to 2 nM exhibiting a 10-fold
   increase in streptavidin sensitivity compared to conventional NHA
   structures. The sensitivity and performance of the 3D nanostructure can
   be further improved by exploiting multiplexing methods in combination
   with stable light sources and detection systems.}},

Title = {{Critical overview of blast resistance of different concrete types}},
Journal = {{MAGAZINE OF CONCRETE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{72-81}},
Abstract = {{Past attacks against buildings and civil infrastructure highlight the
   need for blast-resistant structural materials. Numerous studies have
   been conducted on various related techniques and some design guidance
   has been developed to increase the resistance of structures to blast
   loading. Generally, a blast results in a high-amplitude impulse loading
   typically with a very short duration. Hence, the material's response to
   such loading will differ from its response to regular types of loading.
   Consequently, the analysis and design of structures subjected to blast
   loads require a full understanding of the behaviour of materials and
   structural elements under blast loading. This paper presents an overview
   of the behaviour of concrete elements subjected to blast loads. A
   critical discussion of the state of the art on blast resistance of
   conventional and modern concrete materials is provided, along with an

Abstract = {{In this study, a distributed approach to account for dynamic friction
   during needle insertion in soft tissue is presented. As is well known,
   friction is a complex nonlinear phenomenon. It appears that classical or
   static models are unable to capture some of the observations made in
   systems subjected to significant frictional effects. In needle
   insertion, translational friction would be a matter of importance when
   the needle is very flexible, or a stop-and-rotate motion profile at low
   insertion velocities is implemented, and thus, the system is repeatedly
   transitioned from a pre-sliding to a sliding mode and vice versa. In
   order to characterize friction components, a distributed version of the
   LuGre model in the state-space representation is adopted. This method
   also facilitates estimating cutting force in an intra-operative manner.
   To evaluate the performance of the proposed family of friction models,
   experiments were conducted on homogeneous artificial phantoms and animal
   tissue. The results illustrate that our approach enables us to represent
   the main features of friction which is a major force component in
   needle-tissue interaction during needle-based interventions.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study has been carried out based on three-dimensional
   finite element analyses to investigate the impact of the in-plane and
   out-of-plane dimensions on the crack-tip stress fields of clamped SE(T)
   specimens. Both plane-sided and side-grooved specimens with a wide range
   of thickness-to-width ratios (B/W = 1/2, I, 2 and 4), crack lengths
   (a/W- 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7) and strain hardening exponents (n = 5,
   10 and 20) are included in this study. The through-thickness
   distributions of J and CTOD as well as the distribution of the opening
   stress (sigma(0 theta)) ahead of the crack tip at different crack front
   locations are presented. The distributions of J and CTOD over the crack
   front and those of sigma(0 theta) ahead of the crack tip are impacted by
   a/W, B/W, n and the type of specimens (i.e. plane-sided or
   side-grooved). In addition, the empirical equation for calculating CTOD
   from J for SE(T) specimens developed by Shen and Tyson based on
   twodimensional plane-strain finite element analyses is found inadequate
   to be applied to three-dimensional SE(T) specimens except for the
   plane-sided specimens with n = 10 and side-grooved specimens with n = 5.

Abstract = {{This study investigates the in-plane and out-of-plane constraint
   parameters (namely Q, Ay, h and T-z) for clamped single-edge tension
   (SE(T)) specimens based on a comprehensive set of three-dimensional
   finite element analyses reported in a companion paper (Part I). The
   impact of the crack length (a/W), thickness-to-width ratio (B/W) and
   strain hardening exponent (n) on the constraint parameters, and the
   interaction between the constraint parameters are examined. For
   specimens with a given B/W, Q, h and A(2) at the mid plane in general
   increase as a/W increases, but T-z at the mid plane is independent of
   a/W. The impact of B/W on the distributions of Q, Ay and h over the
   crack front is dependent on a/W, but T-z decreases as B/W decreases
   regardless of a/W. The Q, Ay and h values are impacted by n, but T-z is
   essentially independent of n. For SE(T) specimens, T-z is more
   appropriate to capture the out-of-plane constraint. The investigation of
   the interaction between the constraint parameters indicates that Q is
   essentially equivalent to h and correlated to both the in-plane and
   out-of-plane constraints, whereas A(2) is more suited to characterize
   the in-plane constraint. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{A facile method for cross-linking organic molecules has been developed
   by computational modeling, instrumentation design, and experimental
   research. Briefly, organic molecules are hit by H-2 with controllable
   kinetic energy in our novel apparatus where a high flux of hyperthermal
   H-2 is generated. When a C-H bond of the organic molecule is hit by H-2
   at about 20 eV, efficient kinematic energy-transfer in the H-2. H
   collision facilitates the C-H dissociation with nearly 100\% reaction
   probability. When H-2 hits other atoms which are by nature much heavier
   than H-2, mass disparity bars effective energy transfer and this both
   blocks undesirable bond dissociation and reduces unnecessary energy
   wastage. The recombination of the carbon radicals generated by the C-H
   cleavage efficiently completes the production of C-C cross-links at room
   temperature with no additional energy/chemicals requirements. In
   addition to these green chemistry merits, this new method is better than
   other cross-linking techniques which rely on prerequisite reactions to
   add cross-linkers to the organic molecules or additional reactants and
   additives. These promising features are validated by several
   cross-linking trials which demonstrate desirable mechanical, electrical,
   chemical, and biochemical changes while inducing no undesirable damage
   of chemical functionalities in the original molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Laccase-mediator systems have numerous potential uses for green
   oxidations, but their practical use may be limited because the reactive,
   oxidised mediators deactivate the enzyme. TEMPO, 4-hydroxybenzyl
   alcohol, phenothiazine and 2-hydroxybiphenyl caused almost complete
   deactivation of laccase from Trametes versicolor within 24- 140 h. By
   contrast, 18\% activity was retained after 188 h in controls without
   mediator, and 15\% in the presence of ABTS. A biphasic reaction system
   was developed to protect the laccase, by partitioning the mediator into
   water-immiscible ionic liquids. In the presence of {[}C(6)mim]{[}AOT],
   laccase retained 54, 35, 35 and 41\% activity after 188 h in the
   presence of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, phenothiazine and 2-hydroxybiphenyl
   and ABTS, respectively, whilst 30\% activity was retained in the
   presence of {[}N-1 (8) (8) (8)]{[}Sac] and TEMPO. The protection against

Abstract = {{The development of new anti-cancer treatments with greater efficacy and
   fewer side effects remains a significant challenge of modern scientific
   and medical research. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol found in the
   dietary spice turmeric, has been demonstrated to inhibit cancer cell
   survival and proliferation, and to induce apoptosis without promoting
   the development of side effects. However, due to its sparing solubility
   and low bioavailability, curcumin has not yet been clinically used to
   treat cancer. This review describes the main physicochemical properties
   of curcumin, including its chemical structure, stability, and
   degradation products as a function of pH and temperature. It also
   describes the proposed mechanisms by which curcumin exhibits anti-cancer
   activity. Finally, we review the various approaches that have been
   studied to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of curcumin,
   including the preparation of co-crystals, and the development of
   delivery systems based on liposomes, micelles, exosomes, nanoparticles
   and dendrimers.}},

Title = {{Selecting seats for steel industry mobile machines based on seat
   effective amplitude transmissibility and comfort}},
Journal = {{WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT \& REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to help a steel industry partner
   select the most appropriate of three high end heavy equipment seats to
   retrofit a number of their heavy mobile machines used in the steel
   making process.
   PARTICIPANTS: The participants included 8 males (22.3 +/- 2.0 yrs.) and
   8 females (23.5 +/- 1.8 yrs.) with no experience operating heavy mobile
   equipment.
   METHODS: Previously recorded 6-DOF chassis acceleration data from a Pot
   Hauler (a machine which picks up and transports pots of slag) were used
   to extract six, 20 second representative profiles for implementation on
   a lab-based heavy machine simulator (6-DOF Parallel Robotics System
   Corporation robot). Subjects sat on three heavy equipment seats
   (BeGe7150, Grammar MSG 95G1721, and a 6801 Isringhausen with the seat
   pan cushion retrofitted with a Skydex (TM) cushion) mounted on the
   simulator. Each subject completed three trials for each combination of
   seat (n = 3) and vibration profile (n = 6). Chassis and operator/seat
   interface vibration were measured by 2, 6-DOF vibration transducers.
   Variables included Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT)
   (X,Y,Z,Roll, Pitch,Yaw,6DOF Vector Sum) to determine if the seat was
   attenuating or amplifying the vibration, 6-degree of freedom (DOF)
   vibration total value weighted predicted comfort (A(vc)) (according to
   ISO 2631-1) and operator reported comfort (ORC).
   RESULTS: Factorial ANOVAs revealed significant differences (p <= 0.05)
   between seats for all SEAT variables but different seats performed
   better than others depending on the axis. Significant differences
   between males and females were observed for SEAT in X,Y, and Pitch as
   well as for A(vc). As expected there were significant differences
   between vibration profiles for all assessed variables. A number of
   interaction effects were observed, the most frequently occurring of
   which was between seat and vibration profile.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based upon the number of seat and vibration profile
   interactions, results suggest that a single seat is not suited for all
   tested conditions. However, SEAT values for all of the seats tested were
   extremely low (e.g., 6-DOF SEAT < 30\%) indicating that all of the seats
   were capable of providing good vibration attenuation.}},

Title = {{Detailed multidisciplinary monitoring reveals pre- and co-eruptive

Abstract = {{This paper presents a thorough description of Nyamulagira's January 2010
   volcanic eruption (North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo), based on a
   combination of field observation and ground-based and space-borne data.
   It is the first eruption in the Virunga Volcanic Province that has been
   described by a combination of several modern monitoring techniques. The
   2010 eruption lasted 26 days and emitted similar to 45.5x10(6) m(3) of
   lava. Field observations divided the event into four eruptive stages
   delimited by major changes in effusive activity. These stages are
   consistent with those described by Pouclet (1976) for historical
   eruptions of Nyamulagira. Coeruptive signals from ground deformation,
   seismicity, SO2 emission and thermal flux correlate with the eruptive
   stages. Unambiguous pre-eruptive ground deformation was observed 3 weeks
   before the lava outburst, coinciding with a small but clear increase in
   the short period seismicity and SO2 emission. The 3 weeks of precursors
   contrasts with the only precursory signal previously recognized in the
   Virunga Volcanic Province, the short-term increase of tremor and long
   period seismicity, which, for example, were only detected less than 2 h
   prior to the 2010 eruption. The present paper is the most detailed
   picture of a typical flank eruption of this volcano. It provides
   valuable tools for re-examining former-mostly qualitative-descriptions
   of historical Nyamulagira eruptions that occurred during the colonial
   period.}},

Abstract = {{Local heat transfer and column hydrodynamics are investigated in a
   bubble column in presence of internals of different configurations. The
   liquid phase used is tap water and the gas phase is oil-free compressed
   air. The gas velocity is varied over a wide range of 0.03-0.35 m/s. The
   heat transfer variations are measured with a fast response probe capable
   of capturing bubble dynamics as well as detect local flow direction and
   deduce local liquid velocity. Measurements obtained in presence of
   internals are compared with those without internals to elucidate the
   effects of different internals design. Comparisons are based on average
   values and temporal variations obtained with the fast response probe.
   The average gas holdup, local liquid velocity and bubble fractions
   holdups obtained with and without internals are also compared to further
   point out the differences. The observed differences are discussed based
   on the insights provided by these comparisons. The results obtained show
   influence of internals design on column hydrodynamics which need to be
   considered for their proper design and modeling. (C) 2013 The

Abstract = {{The selective synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with

Abstract = {{Sources, effects, disposal methods, and environmental regulations of
   brine are critically reviewed. Desalination is one of the main sources
   of brine in the world. Other sources of brine include solution mining of
   salt domes, and oil and potash mining. In addition to high salinity,
   brine may contain toxic substances such as lead, zinc, copper, arsenic,
   and naphthalene. Research has shown that small changes in salinity and
   temperature could have a significant impact on marine ecosystems. Due to
   their high dilution capabilities, multiport submerged diffusers are
   nowadays considered the most practical solution to protect marine life
   from harmful effects of brine and heat. Currently, the discharge of
   dense brine is usually controlled by allocating large mixing zones
   around the point of discharge. Mixing zones are, however, not always
   suitable to be applied in environmentally sensitive areas. In sensitive
   areas and for the case of brine containing toxic substances, more
   stringent regulations based on well defined minimum return dilution at
   the level of the source are recommended. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   common final position, provided that the directed communication graph
   contains a spanning tree. The convergence analysis of the proposed

Abstract = {{The smart grid is expected to revolutionize existing electrical grid by
   allowing two-way communications to improve efficiency, reliability,
   economics, and sustainability of the generation, transmission, and
   distribution of electrical power. However, issues associated with
   communication and management must be addressed before full benefits of
   the smart grid can be achieved. Furthermore, how to maximize the use of
   network resources and available power, how to ensure reliability and
   security, and how to provide self-healing capability need to be
   considered in the design of smart grids. In this paper, some features of
   the smart grid have been discussed such as communications, demand
   response, and security. Microgrids and issues with integration of
   distributed energy sources are also considered.}},

Abstract = {{Laue diffraction measurements made using polychromatic synchrotron
   x-radiation have revealed significant changes to the microscopic strain
   distributions in an Alloy 600 (UNS N06600) tube following the
   application of a circumferential (hoop) stress and then as a result of
   stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The changes in the elastic and plastic
   strain distributions were studied for the same area near the outer
   diameter of the tube prepared as a C-ring. Following the application of
   the circumferential stress, there was a notable loss of crystal order
   within the outermost 3 mu m to 5 mu m of the tube surface as a result of
   plastic processes; further into the sample the elastic strains in grain
   boundaries become oriented toward the direction of the impressed stress.
   The average intensity of oriented tensile strain is 5x10(-3) within the
   outermost 50 mu m of the C-ring. After corrosion, the elastic strain
   distribution in the same region becomes slightly compressive. The
   strains associated with a network of fine incipient cracks on the
   outside diameter of the C-ring were explored; elastic compressive
   strains were found within few micrometers from the crack center
   presumably as a result of crack opening, while plastic deformation was
   limited to the immediate crack region.}},

   from less than 1 nm to up to 3 nm deposited by atomic layer deposition
   (ALD), which have significant impact on the electrochemical behaviour of
   the composites. The well-defined and optimized Al2O3 layer could not

Abstract = {{Viral nanoparticles (VNPs) are a novel class of bionanomaterials that
   harness the natural biocompatibility of viruses for the development of
   therapeutics, vaccines, and imaging tools. The plant virus, cowpea
   mosaic virus (CPMV), has been successfully engineered to create novel
   cancer-targeted imaging agents by incorporating fluorescent dyes,
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers, and targeting moieties. Using
   straightforward conjugation strategies, VNPs with high selectivity for
   cancer-specific molecular targets can be synthesized for in vivo imaging
   of tumors. Here we describe the synthesis and purification of CPMV-based
   VNPs, the functionalization of these VNPs using click chemistry, and
   their use for imaging xenograft tumors in animal models. VNPs decorated
   with fluorescent dyes, PEG, and targeting ligands can be synthesized in
   one day, and imaging studies can be performed over hours, days, or
   weeks, depending on the application.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{83}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the
   relationship between short echo time pulmonary H-1 magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) signal intensity (SI) and 3He MRI apparent diffusion
   coefficients (ADC), high-resolution computed tomography (CT)
   measurements of emphysema, and pulmonary function measurements.
   Materials and methods: Nine healthy never-smokers and 11 COPD subjects
   underwent same-day plethysmography, spirometry, short echo time ((TE)=
   1.2 ms) H-1 and diffusion-weighted hyperpolarized He-3 MRI (b = 1.6
   s/cm(2)) at 3.0 T. In addition, for COPD subjects only, CT densitometry
   was also performed.
   Results: Mean H-1 SI was significantly greater for never-smokers (12.1
   +/- 1.1 arbitrary units (AU)) compared to COPD subjects (10.9 +/- 1.3
   AU, p = 0.04). The H-1 SI AP-gradient was also significantly greater for
   never-smokers (0.40 AU/cm, R-2=0.94) compared to COPD subjects (0.29
   AU/cm, R-2=0.968, p=0.05). There was a significant correlation between
   H-1 SI and He-3 ADC (r=0.58, p=0.008) and significant correlations
   between H-1 MR SI and CT measurements of emphysema (RA(950), r=0.69,
   p=0.02 and HU15, r=0.66, p=0.03).
   Conclusions: The significant and moderately strong relationship between
   H-1 SI and He-3 ADC, as well as between H-1 SI and CT measurements of
   emphysema suggests that these imaging methods and measurements may be
   quantifying similar tissue changes in COPD and that pulmonary H-1 SI may
   be used to monitor emphysema as a complement to CT and noble gas MRI.

Abstract = {{We studied two-phase cooling heat transfer enhancement from a heated
   disk through falling jets of dielectric fluid, HFE7100, in the presence
   of electrostatic fields. The field is established between the jet and
   the grounded target and the boiling curves are obtained. The boiling
   curves showed surprising deviation from typical boiling curves at
   post-critical heat flux (CHF) regimes. In the absence of electric field,
   the heat flux always falls suddenly as CHF regime reaches. The CHF
   phenomenon is a catastrophic phenomenon accompanying with overshooting
   the surface temperate. However, counter-intuitively, here we
   demonstrated that applying an appropriate electrostatic field, the
   curves became flat at post-CHF regimes and critical heat flux regime can
   be operated at a wide range of superheats. A hypothetical explanation is
   proposed to rationalize the flattened boiling curve observations at the
   CHF regime. Flattening of boiling curves in the presence of electric
   field promotes reliable operation of cooling device at CHF regime. (C)

Title = {{A three-dimensional numerical model for linking community-wide vapour
   risks}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3D) numerical model that couples contaminant
   transport in the saturated zone to vapour transport in the vadose zone
   and vapour intrusion into buildings was developed. Coupling these
   processes allows the simulation of vapour intrusion, arising from
   volatilization at the water table, associated with temporally and
   spatially variable groundwater plumes. In particular, the model was
   designed to permit, for the first time, 3D simulations of risk at
   receptors located in the wider community (i.e., kilometre scale)
   surrounding a contaminated site. The model can account for heterogeneous
   distributions of permeability, fraction organic carbon, sorption and
   biodegradation in the vadose and saturated zones. The model formulation,
   based upon integration of a number of widely accepted models, is
   presented along with verification and benchmarking tests. In addition, a
   number of exploratory simulations of benzene and naphthalene transport
   in a 1000 m long domain (aquifer cross-section: 500 m x 14 m) are
   presented, which employed conservative assumptions consistent with the
   development of regulatory guidance. Under these conservative conditions,
   these simulations demonstrated, for example, that whether houses in the
   community were predicted to be impacted by groundwater and indoor air
   concentrations exceeding regulatory standards strongly depended on their
   distance downgradient from the source and lateral distance from the
   plume centreline. In addition, this study reveals that the degree of
   reduction in source concentration (i.e., remediation) required to
   achieve compliance with standards is less if the risk receptor is in the
   wider community than at the site boundary. However, these example
   scenarios suggest that, even considering community receptors, sources
   with initially high concentrations still required substantial
   remediation (i.e., >99\% reductions in source concentration). Overall,
   this work provides insights and a new tool for considering the
   relationships between contaminated site source zones and community-wide
   risk assessment that allows for development of policies and technical
   approaches for contaminated site management. It is anticipated that this
   coupled model not only will allow significant convenience, for example
   in running suites of Monte Carlo simulations for complex scenarios, but
   will also allow the investigation of vapour intrusion under conditions
   where soil gas concentrations may change over the same timescale as an
   evolving plume. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of an investigation conducted to assess
   the effectiveness of using glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) plates
   to enhance the overstrength and ductility factors of moment resisting
   steel frames. The GFRP plates are bonded to the flanges of steel beams
   of the frame with an aim to enhance their local buckling capacities and
   consequently their ductility. The flexural behaviour of GFRP retrofitted
   beams is first determined using a nonlinear finite element model
   developed in-house. In this numerical model, consistent shell elements
   are used to simulate the flanges and web of the steel beam as well as
   the GFRP plate. The interface between the steel and the GFRP plate is
   simulated using a set of continuous linear spring system representing
   both the shear and peeling stiffness of the adhesive based on values
   obtained from a previous experimental study. The moment-rotation
   characteristics of the retrofitted beams are then implemented into the
   frame model to carry out nonlinear static (pushover) analyses. The
   seismic performance level of the retrofitted frames in terms of
   overstrength and ductility factors is then compared with that of the
   bare frame. The results show a significant enhancement in strength and
   ductility capacities of the retrofitted frames, especially when the
   beams of the frame are slender.}},

Title = {{Reciprocal Responses in the Interaction between Arabidopsis and the

Journal = {{PLANT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{164}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most molecular-genetic studies of plant defense responses to arthropod
   herbivores have focused on insects. However, plant-feeding mites are
   also pests of diverse plants, and mites induce different patterns of
   damage to plant tissues than do well-studied insects (e.g. lepidopteran
   larvae or aphids). The two-spotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae) is
   among the most significant mite pests in agriculture, feeding on a
   staggering number of plant hosts. To understand the interactions between
   spider mite and a plant at the molecular level, we examined reciprocal
   genome-wide responses of mites and its host Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
   thaliana). Despite differences in feeding guilds, we found that
   transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis to mite herbivory resembled
   those observed for lepidopteran herbivores. Mutant analysis of induced
   plant defense pathways showed functionally that only a subset of induced
   programs, including jasmonic acid signaling and biosynthesis of indole
   glucosinolates, are central to Arabidopsis's defense to mite herbivory.
   On the herbivore side, indole glucosinolates dramatically increased mite
   mortality and development times. We identified an indole glucosinolate
   dose-dependent increase in the number of differentially expressedmite
   genes belonging to pathways associated with detoxification of
   xenobiotics. This demonstrates that spider mite is sensitive to
   Arabidopsis defenses that have also been associated with the deterrence
   of insect herbivores that are very distantly related to chelicerates.
   Our findings provide molecular insights into the nature of, and response
   to, herbivory for a representative of a major class of arthropod
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and ciprofloxacin on the
   catabolism of microbial communities was assessed. This was accomplished
   through an ex situ methodology designed to give a priori knowledge on
   the potential for nanoparticles, or other emerging contaminants, to
   affect the catabolic capabilities of microbial communities in the
   environment. Microbial communities from a variety of sources were
   incubated with 31 prespecified carbon sources and either National
   Institute of Standards and Technology reference material 10-nm AuNPs or
   ciprofloxacin on 96-well microtiter plates. From the ciprofloxacin
   study, dose-response curves were generated and exemplified how this
   method can be used to assess the effect of a toxicant on overall
   catabolic capabilities of microbial communities. With 10-nm AuNPs at
   concentrations ranging from 0.01 mu g/mL to 0.5 mu g/mL, rhizosphere
   communities from Typha roots were only slightly catabolically inhibited
   at a single concentration (0.05 mu g/mL); no effects were seen on
   wetland water communities, and a minor positive (i.e., enhanced
   catabolic capabilities) effect was observed for loamy soil communities.
   This positive effect might have been because of a thin layer of citrate
   found on these AuNPs that initiated cometabolism with some of the carbon
   sources studied. Under the conditions considered, the possible adverse
   effects of AuNPs on the catabolic capabilities of microbial communities
   appears to be minimal. Environ Toxicol Chem 2013;33:44-51. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is explored to predict peak
   ground accelerations (PGA) and pseudospectral acceleration (SA) for
   Mexican inslab and interplate earthquakes. A total of 277 and 418
   seismic records with two horizontal components for inslab and interplate
   earthquakes, respectively, are used to train the ANN models by using an
   ANN with a feed-forward architecture with a back-propagation learning
   algorithm. Both ANN with single and two hidden layers are considered.
   For comparison purposes, the PGA and SA values predicted by the trained
   ANN models are compared with those estimated with attenuation relations
   or ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs). The comparison indicates
   that the predicted PGA and SA values by the trained ANN models, in
   general, follow the trends predicted by the GMPEs. However, an extensive
   verification of the trained models must be conducted before they can be
   used for seismic hazard and risk analysis since, on occasion, the PGA
   and SA values predicted by the trained ANN models depart from the
   behaviour observed from the actual records.}},

Abstract = {{Mismatch losses of photovoltaic (PV) arrays under partially shaded
   conditions are examined in this paper. Electrical models of PV arrays
   under different irradiance levels and temperatures are developed. These
   models form the basis for the development of the power peak prediction
   schemes for PV arrays with series-parallel, bridge-linked, and
   total-cross-tied configurations. The developed schemes have been
   validated using commercial PV modules under different irradiance levels
   and partial shading conditions. The experimental results have confirmed
   that the power peak prediction schemes can successfully identify the
   most efficient configuration under any given partial shading conditions.
   Furthermore, the predicted power peaks are within 5\% of the true
   measured ones under almost all the cases.}},

Abstract = {{The present research is focused on the two-step ZnO/Zn thermochemical
   water splitting cycle for hydrogen production. In the present paper, the
   numerical modeling of the first step, which involves endothermic
   reduction of zinc oxide (ZnO), is carried out in a cylindrical reactor
   using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The parametric study shows
   that the fractional conversion of ZnO increases with an increase in the
   flow rate of ZnO, while it decreases with an increase in the ZnO
   particle diameter and carrier gas mass flow rate. Six different reactor
   configurations are also assessed comprehensively. It is observed that a
   cylindrical reactor with a tangential inlet at the top plane and a
   tangential outlet at the bottom plane has higher robustness to the
   variation of various operating parameters with consistently high ZnO
   fractional conversion. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible and printable electronics are attractive techniques which have
   potential for broad applications not only in flexible but also in large
   area electronics. An effective and convenient method of fabricating
   high-resolution copper patterns with high conductivity and strong
   adhesion on flexible photopaper is demonstrated in this paper.
   Functional photopaper was prepared with inkjet printing of a palladium
   salt solution onto its surface, followed by electroless deposition of
   copper. Parameters of the printing process, such as voltage control
   waveform, temperature of printhead and substrate, meniscus vacuum level,
   printing height, etc. were optimized to obtain a robust and high
   resolution printing with feature dimensions down to 50 mm. Through a
   unique thermal sintering process, printed copper lines showed excellent
   conductivity of up to 3.9 x 10(7) S m (1) (>65\% of bulk copper). The
   developed technique was successfully applied for fabricating paper based
   functional flexible circuits such as RFID antennae, micro-inductive
   coils and complex circuit boards.}},

Abstract = {{A novel parallel Remote Center of Motion (RCM) mechanism is proposed for
   a surgical robot designed to perform minimally invasive needle-based
   interventions for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. The proposed
   robot provides four degrees of freedom (DOFs) to orient and move a
   surgical needle within a spherical coordinate system. The RCM is beneath
   the skin surface to minimize the invasiveness of the surgical procedure
   while providing the required workspace. This compact, patient-mounted
   robot benefits from a design capable of measuring the pure interaction
   forces between the needle and the tissue. In this paper, the mechanism
   design and its specifications are described. The kinematic analysis is
   presented and isotropy of the mechanism for targeting tumors is studied.
   Finally, the performance of the proposed robot is evaluated

Abstract = {{Although some technologies have been developed to measure tool-tissue
   interaction forces during minimally invasive surgery (MIS), none of
   these technologies have been approved for use in humans. The primary
   factor preventing the use of sensorized instruments in humans is their
   inability to withstand the stringent conditions present during cleaning
   and sterilization. This paper presents a series of experiments that were
   performed to develop a sterilizable instrument capable of measuring
   tool-tissue interaction forces in three degrees of freedom using strain
   gauges. The experiments provided an appropriate choice of cables and
   connectors, as well as an optimal combination of strain gauge adhesives
   and coatings that allow the sensors to withstand autoclave
   sterilization. A prototype of the sensorized instruments was developed
   and tested. The final prototype was able to withstand a sterilization
   cycle with excellent results (0.10-0.21 N accuracy, 0.05-0.20 N
   repeatability and 0.06-0.21 N hysteresis depending on the measurement
   direction). This work shows that autoclave sterilization is possible for
   a strain-gauge instrumented device.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the issue of kinematic instability for concentric tube
   robots is studied when the following two conditions are considered: (a)
   the robot consists of more than two concentric tubes, and (b) the tubes
   consist of straight sections followed by curved sections. In this paper,
   we use the term ``kinematic instability{''} when the tip position of
   robot in the Cartesian domain jumps from one equilibrium point to
   another while having a constant joint space configuration. This implies
   that in unstable configurations, the ``forward kinematics{''} of the
   robot will have multiple solutions for one set of joint space variables.
   In this paper a novel framework is proposed that can calculate the
   stability condition for the robots consisting of multiple tubes with
   straight sections without solving the nonlinear ordinary differential
   equations. The resulting conditions restrict the pre-curvatures and
   length of the tubes, as a design factor, to guarantee kinematic
   stability within the whole workspace of the robot.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of contact between the catheter tip and cardiac tissue has
   been identified as an important factor in the efficacy of the
   catheter-based cardiac ablation procedures. However, maintaining a
   constant tip/tissue contact force during the procedure is difficult due
   to cardiac and respiratory motions. Robotic manipulation of the catheter
   has the potential to overcome this difficulty and decrease the range of
   variations in the contact force during the ablation procedure. This
   paper investigates the possibility of performing motion compensation for
   conventional steerable ablation catheters using a robotic manipulator.
   The behavior of such catheters is analyzed in free space as well as in
   contact with static and moving targets and the limitations in the
   actuation mechanism are identified. Based on this analysis, a technique
   for synchronizing the motion of the catheter tip with cardiac motion is
   proposed. The suggested control system estimates the frequency of the
   moving target and reshapes the input trajectory accordingly. The
   performance of the resulting system is evaluated experimentally. The
   results show that in the experimental setting, the proposed technique
   reduces the variations in the contact force and noticeably improves the
   quality of tip/tissue contact.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the possibility of using smart technologies to enhance
   rehabilitative therapies has become a reality. Smart technologies can
   adjust their functionality based on real-time performance to provide the
   most effective therapy. This paper presents the design, development and
   testing of a wearable mechatronic brace created to assist in upper limb
   rehabilitation. The purpose of the smart brace is to provide safe
   therapy of musculoskeletal disorders, in particular brachial plexus
   injuries. A control system has been developed that facilitates the
   retraining of the biceps for individuals who have suffered brachial
   plexus nerve damage. Electromyography (EMG) data for flexion and
   extension of the elbow were recorded from three healthy subjects and
   used to scale velocity profiles. The experiments assessed the
   performance of the smart brace in its ability to reproduce a motion, to
   compensate for the effect of muscle disability and to detect fatigue.
   The results showed that the control system was able to adjust velocities
   to accommodate for disability or fatigue. This initial implementation
   provides a control model and logic from which the brace can be improved.
   Future testing of the brace using subjects with a brachial plexus injury
   will help solidify the techniques used for brace control.}},

   that uses multiple views to classify visually similar automotive parts

   vary in size, orientation and luster and are captured from four view
   points. We are able to achieve a classification rate of 97.4\% using our
   dataset. Using an object localization approach for each view we provide
   a method that reduces the time it takes to build the visual vocabularies
   by 36.6\%. Our framework shows has an improved accuracy over using
   single view classification and is fast enough to have practical
   industrial applications for fine-grained classification of very similar
   objects. We are able to demonstrate that ORB descriptors provide
   superior performance and speed over SIFT and SURF descriptors. By
   harnessing the speed and low computational expense of using ORB features

Abstract = {{Widespread use of WiMAX systems has lowered the cost of radio units
   significantly. We previously proposed a low cost single-mode Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) system which took advantage of these low-cost WiMAX
   transceiver units. However, the imaging swath of this system was limited
   due to the short length of the cyclic prefix (CP) of WiMAX. In this
   paper, we propose a multi-mode WiMAX SAR to overcome this limitation.
   Specifically, we first put forward a design of scan-mode WiMAX SAR,
   which significantly expands the slant range swath for surveillance and
   imaging applications. Subsequently, spotlight and squint-mode WiMAX SAR
   are also proposed to enhance imaging quality. Finally, a windowing
   scheme on reference data at the receiver is proposed to reduce ghost
   images in the direction of range. The validity of proposed design is
   confirmed through detailed simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{3D Ultrasound (US) has been developed recently to image the intracranial
   ventricular system of pre-term neonates in order to monitor these
   patients for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and the resultant
   dilatation of the ventricles. 3D US is capable of providing volumetric
   ventricle measurements, compared to clinically used 2D US, relying on
   linear measurements from a single slice, and visual and quantitative
   estimates to determine the severity of ventricular dilatation. In this
   work, we propose a convex optimization-based segmentation approach for
   3D US images of the cerebral ventricles in preterm neonates with IVH.
   The proposed semi-automatic segmentation method makes use of the latest
   development in convex optimization techniques supervised by user
   interactive information. Experiments using 25 3D US images of 5 patients
   (5 time points for each subject) show that our proposed approach yielded
   a mean DSC of 78.9 \% compared to a manually contoured surface. This
   GPU-implemented semi-automated approach reduced the time required per
   segmentation by 1200\% (mean times: 2.5 vs. 30 minutes). In addition,
   the intra-observer variability experiments showed that the variability
   introduced by the user initialization is small in terms of DSC,
   demonstrating a low intra-user variability.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of mobile services and the explosive growth of data
   traffic has created new challenges in cellular networks. Mobile data
   offloading has attracted significant attention, since it has the ability
   to alleviate cellular burden by using complementary resources and thus,
   offers better services to end users. In this paper, we introduce
   intelligence into heterogeneous network management and propose a
   Software-Defined Networking based module framework, which includes Wi-Fi
   based partial data offloading and load balancing. Our objective is to
   make real time decisions for selectively offloading traffic and
   balancing loads, while taking network conditions and quality of service
   (QoS) into consideration. The proposed mechanisms are subject to
   system-level simulations which shows an improvement in load balancing,
   in terms of equilibrium extent and network stability. We also prove that
   with the proposed Wi-Fi partial data offloading algorithm, quality of
   service can be satisfied, while saving a significant amount of cellular
   resources through smart resource allocation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the containment control problem of networked
   uncertain Lagrangian systems with intermittent communication in the
   presence of communication delays and possible information loss.
   Specifically, we present an adaptive distributed control algorithm such
   that a team of followers asymptotically converge to the convex hull
   spanned by multiple non-stationary leaders. The interconnection between
   the systems is represented by a directed graph. Sufficient conditions
   are presented such that the control objective is reached while
   communication between agents is allowed only at some discrete instants
   of time in the presence of irregular communication delays and packet
   dropout. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In a non-cooperative context such as military or spectrum surveillance
   application, a passive adversary has to solve the problem of estimating
   the transmitter parameters. In addition, wireless systems cause
   signaling overhead since their transmitter must inform the receiver
   about the chosen bit allocation table or the Forward Error Correction
   (FEC) scheme. In this work, a perception of a smart receiver able to
   blindly estimate a specific transmission context based on an intercepted
   stream is proposed. In particular, a new technique addressing the blind
   recognition of low-density parity-check (LDPC), convolutional, and turbo
   codes' encoding parameters at the receiver is introduced. The proposed
   blind detection for the FEC code technique considers a new iterative
   method based on Gauss-Jordan elimination through a pivoting algorithm
   devoted to the blind estimation of these codes encoding parameters in a

Abstract = {{Although cooperative relaying has been widely utilized in wireless
   communications, it simultaneously introduces a new source of security
   vulnerabilities to the wireless networks such as denial of service
   attacks. In order to minimize the potential security risks from relays,
   reliable relay authentication schemes become necessitated. In this
   paper, a novel relay authentication scheme is proposed to secure
   amplify-and-forward relay systems through utilizing the device-dependent
   hardware imperfection in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance. In this
   scheme, the I/Q imbalance associated with the receiving and transmission
   of the relaying process is considered as a unique device fingerprint.
   This fingerprint is then utilized to develop a two-parameter hypothesis
   testing based authentication. To enhance the performance in
   differentiating delicate difference between I/Q imbalances, the
   generalized likelihood ratio test for classical linear model is used in
   our hypothesis decision algorithm. The performance of the proposed
   authentication scheme is assessed and validated by numerical
   simulations. The results show significantly enhanced authentication
   accuracy of our new method in comparison with other I/Q imbalance based
   hypothesis decision algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Secret key generation at physical layer has attracted more and more
   attentions as an emerging cryptography method. Compared to traditional
   security approaches, secret key generation at physical layer not only
   avoids the problem of key distribution, but also holds high efficiency
   and low complexity in application. Based on the principle of channel
   reciprocity, Alice and Bob both estimate the channel conditions and
   extract shared keys from this source of common randomness. In this
   paper, we first analyze the basic steps (channel estimation, sample
   quantization and key reconciliation) of secret key generation, key match
   rate with different quantization levels and key reconciliation times are
   also simulated. While in practical situations, different non-reciprocity
   factors affect the channel estimation step, key match rate can be
   greatly decreased and hardly meet real time cryptography requirements.
   In order to increase the key match rate, the unified framework of
   physical layer key generation has been extended to utilizing multiple
   observations of wireless channels to generate secret keys. An improved
   key generation approach with multiple observations can well deal with
   discrepancies between transceivers and keep increasing the key match
   rate. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both validate the
   significant improvement due to multiple observations. With an increased
   number of observations on both sides, the desired key match rate can be
   achieved much greater than with a single observation, and also the
   probability of key recovery by Eve can be decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless positioning systems rely on a minimum number of transmitters
   with known locations as reference nodes to locate a target device.
   However, in harsh environments where the number of available reference
   nodes is inadequate, wireless positioning systems may suffer from
   significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a
   wireless positioning technique utilizing transmitting nodes from other
   co-existing networks to improve the locationing performance in terms of
   accuracy and coverage. The procedure of the proposed location technique
   can be divided into two steps. During the first step, locations of
   extended reference nodes from other co-existing networks-i.e. additional
   active transmitters external to the original positioning network-are
   collaboratively estimated by the original reference nodes. The
   positioning of the target node can then be improved by a combined use of
   the original and newly discovered extended reference nodes. Maximum
   likelihood (ML) principle is applied in both estimation steps. The
   position estimation performance is analyzed and compared with the
   Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Computer simulations show that the
   accuracy of the position estimation using this approach can be improved
   by the joint effort of the extended and original reference nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Although cooperative relaying is generally considered as an attractive
   technique to improve system performances, the additional power
   consumption of a relaying link becomes a consistent concern. In order to
   characterize the power consumption of the dual-hop opportunistic
   relaying with power control, an exact expression for the cumulative
   distribution function of the total required transmission power is
   derived in this paper. Our analysis is based on the scenario that the
   best relay is selected among a set of decode-and-forward relays with
   homogeneous spatial Poisson distribution, such that the
   source-plus-relay power consumption is minimized. The required
   transmission power is evaluated by including the randomness of both path
   loss related to the locations of relays and the channel fading caused by
   multipath propagation. The analytical solution is verified by computer
   simulations and is used to compare the required power of relaying and
   direct links under different channel conditions. The results show that
   the dual-hop relaying is advantageous in long-term power saving by
   requiring a bounded average transmission power, while the power for the
   direct link communication is unbounded in some fading environments.
   Moreover, the required transmission power for the opportunistic relaying
   is less than that of the direct link with a reasonable relay density,
   therefore the cooperative communications can provide the power efficient
   transmission when the relay network is not sparse.}},

   DASA actuation approach. The robot is developed as a proof-of-concept
   prototype intended to demonstrate the capacity of the DASA approach to
   achieve a high degree of interaction safety as well as performance.
   Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches form the basis of the Semi-active
   actuation component, while a unidirectional motor provides the active
   drive for the robot. An antagonistic clutch configuration is implemented
   at the joints to achieve bi-directional actuation without reversal of
   the motor. MR clutches have been shown to exhibit excellent
   torque-to-inertia and torque-to-mass ratios making them likely
   candidates for the development of human-safe actuators. In this paper,
   the safety characteristics of the DASA approach are qualitatively
   discussed. Experimental results highlighting the performance capability
   of the developed robot are given.}},

Abstract = {{The two main objectives in designing a haptic interface are stability
   and transparency. The dynamics of the actuators employed in a haptic
   interface have a significant effect on these goals. In this article, the
   potential benefits of Magneto-Rheological Fluid (MRF) based actuators to
   the field of haptics are discussed. Devices developed with such fluids
   are known to possess superior mechanical characteristics over
   conventional servo systems. This contributes significantly to improved
   stability and transparency of haptic devices. In this study, this idea
   is evaluated from both theoretical and experimental points of view.
   First, the properties of such actuators which motivated this research
   are discussed. Next, two single degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic
   interfaces are used in a virtual wall experiment. These devices take
   advantage of an MRF-based clutch and a brushless DC motor at their core,
   respectively. The results of both devices are compared and show the
   superiority of the MRF-based clutch. In addition, design and analysis of
   a small-scale MRF-based clutch, suitable for a multi-DOF haptic
   interface, is given and its torque capacity, inertia, and mass are
   compared with those of conventional servo systems. Conclusions drawn
   from this investigation indicate that MRF clutch actuation approaches
   can indeed be developed to design haptic interfaces with improved
   stability and transparency.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches have been
   increasingly used for realizing compliant actuation. One difficulty in
   using MR clutches is the existence of nonlinear hysteretic behaviors
   between the input current and output torque of an MR clutch. In this
   paper, a new closed-loop, Field-Programable-Gate-Array (FPGA) based
   control scheme to linearize an MR clutch's input-output relationship is
   presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme is the
   magnetic field acquired from hall sensors within the MR clutch. The FPGA
   board uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior
   of the MR clutch using an estimated model of the clutch magnetic field.
   The local use of an FPGA board will dramatically simplify the use of MR
   clutches for torque actuation. The effectiveness of the proposed
   technique is validated using an experimental platform that includes an
   MR clutch as part of a compliant actuation mechanism. The results
   clearly demonstrate that the use of the FPGA based closed-loop control
   scheme can effectively eliminate hysteretic behaviors of the MR clutch,
   allowing to have linear actuators with predictable behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the presence of limit cycles in the behavior of
   antagonistically coupled Magneto-Rheological (MR) actuators is
   investigated. The actuator considered in this paper was developed and
   described in {[}1] and {[}2]. This actuator offers high torque-to-mass
   and torque-to-inertia ratios, for inherent safe actuation. While the
   antagonistic arrangement is beneficial in improving the actuator
   performance and eliminating backlash, it may result in limit cycles when
   the actuator operates in a position control loop. The occurrence of
   limit cycle depends on the parameters of the actuator as well as the
   controller. An in-depth analysis is carried out in this paper to
   establish a connection between the system parameters and the limit cycle
   occurrence. Moreover, sufficient conditions for avoiding limit cycle are
   derived specifically for a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller.
   Simulations and experimental results validate the analysis and provide
   insights into the limit cycle observed in the operation of antagonistic
   MR actuators.}},

   propose an approach to measure these undesired effects in external

   Compensation of these effects leads to the proposed velocity-based

Abstract = {{Concentric-tube robots can offer a suitable compromise between force and
   curvature control. In a previous study by the authors, a real-time
   trajectory tracking scheme for an unloaded concentric-tube robot was
   developed. One of the practical barriers to the use of a concentric-tube
   robot in medical applications is compensation for the impact of
   environmental forces which can cause drastic deterioration in tracking
   performance. In this paper, by modifying the robot's forward kinematics
   and Jacobian, a new method is developed to facilitate tip tracking in
   real-time while accounting for an external load at the robot's tip. By
   considering the tip deflection resulting from the external load, a novel
   dual-layer control architecture is proposed to compensate for this
   deflection during trajectory tracking. In order to measure the force
   exerted on the tip position of the robot, a new technique is proposed
   that can move the sensing system from the distal tip to the proximal
   base. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an optimization method for designing MR clutches is

   MR clutch, hence its mass, for given output torque and electrical input
   power. The main idea behind this optimization is that the input power
   and output torque are two parameters that are normally known to the
   designer prior to the design of an MR clutch and considering these
   parameters in the optimization as fixed values has a practical
   significance. Having presented the optimization method, we compare the
   characteristics of three different MR clutch configurations in order to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comparison
   between the drum, single-disk and multi-disk configurations of MR
   clutches is performed. Using the proposed method one can select a
   suitable configuration as well as the geometrical dimensions for an MR
   clutch that best suits the requirements of each individual design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an expertise-oriented training platform for
   robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery. The framework builds on
   previous work of the authors and makes use of dual-user teleoperation
   scenario, allowing the presence of an expert in the training loop. A
   Fuzzy-Logic (FL) methodology is proposed, which specifies the level/mode
   of the training required for the trainee according to his/her level of
   proficiency over the task. A major advantage of the proposed FL approach
   is that, having the expert in the loop, it can specify the trainee's
   proficiency level relative to that of the expert in real-time. Moreover,
   based on the relative skills assessment, the proposed FL approach
   decides if or to what extent the trainee should receive a haptic
   guidance force based on Virtual Fixtures or the environment force from
   the interaction between the surgical instrument and tissue at the slave
   side. In addition to the level/mode of the haptics-enabled training
   required for the trainee, the proposed FL framework specifies the
   authority level of the trainees over the operation in real-time,
   according to their proficiency levels over the task. Stability of the
   overall closed-loop teleoperated system is also investigated using the
   small-gain theorem, resulting in a sufficient condition to guarantee
   stability in the presence of constant communication delays. Finally,
   experimental results are given to evaluate the design and feasibility of
   the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade, marine environment monitoring has attracted more
   and more researchers around the world and various marine environment
   monitoring systems have been developed. Traditionally, an oceanographic
   research vessel is used to monitor marine environments, which is very
   expensive and time-consuming and has a low resolution both in time and
   space. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have recently been considered as
   a promising solution for this purpose since they have a number of
   advantages such as easy deployment, unmanned operation, real-time
   monitoring, and relatively low cost. This paper first describes a common
   architecture of WSN-based oceanographic monitoring systems and a general
   architecture of an oceanographic sensor node. Then, it presents a
   detailed review of some related projects, systems, and technologies. It
   also highlights major challenges and research opportunities on the

   resolution. The system was tested for MR compatibility and no visible
   artefacts were seen in the MR images or in the PET detector flood
   images. The temperature of the detector modules was monitored and found
   to stabilize after approximately two hours of operation between 32
   degrees C and 34 degrees C. Photopeak amplitude, energy resolution and
   count rates recorded per crystal were studied at a baseline temperature
   of 30 degrees C and at temperatures ranging from 20 degrees C to 40
   degrees C in increments of 2 degrees C. When bias voltage to the
   detectors was fixed at the value corresponding to an overvoltage of 2.5V
   at 30 degrees C, the photopeak amplitude changed by as much as 19\% and
   28\% at 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C respectively. Energy resolution
   and count rates demonstrated similar degrees of change. Maintaining a
   fixed overvoltage at each temperature point reduced but did not
   completely eliminate the change in these output characteristics. A
   lookup table based on empirical measurements was employed for the
   adjustment of bias voltage at different temperatures to maximize the
   stability of detector modules. Measurements obtained by using this
   lookup table method demonstrate better stability when compared to
   results obtained by using a fixed overvoltage.}},
