Abstract = {{This study discusses factors affecting various processes involved in
   bioremediation coupled with electrokinetics. The study presents
   innovative solutions, and proposes new directions. Environmental
   conditions that have an influence on the characteristics, behavior, and
   metabolism of indigenous microorganisms are presented. The discussion
   focuses on overcoming the unfavorable conditions created by electrolysis
   reactions, prolongation the survival of the microbes at contaminated
   sites, increase of microbial enzyme secretion, improvement of the
   indigenous bacteria metabolic pathways, and exploration of metagenomics
   resources from soil biota. The challenge facing the implementation of
   conventional bioremediation techniques in precisely and effectively
   delivering nutrients to indigenous bacteria, particularly in soils with
   tortuous paths and low hydraulic conductivity is discussed. Current
   knowledge in application of enhanced biostimulation using
   electrokinetics is reviewed. The implementation of bioaugmentation in
   bioremediation cou-pled with electrokinetics to enhance the outcome of
   bioremediation is presented. Effects of phenomena associated with
   electrokinetics in the hybrid remediation approach are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Indentation test has been accepted as one of the most effective and
   simple implemented methodologies for mechanical characterization of the
   different biological tissues. However, there are different challenges in
   practical implementation of indentation test. Tissue preconditioning is
   a kind of experimental difficulties which can influence the
   characterization results considerably. In other words, there is no
   explicit expression for different preconditioning phenomena such as
   dynamic loading, loading rate and loading depth in an indentation test.
   However, indentation test benefits cause to absorb the attention of
   several research groups with different study fields. This paper presents
   a structural study to investigate the effect of preload on mechanical
   characteristics of meniscus tissue. In this regard, bovine medial
   meniscus sample has been modelled based on meniscus internal structure.
   Flat punch indentation tests conducted on meniscus samples considering
   different values for pre-indenting force. The experiments procedures are
   simulated based on an axisymmetric finite element model. In order to
   obtain constitutive parameters, the experimental data fitted to proposed
   constitutive model.}},

Abstract = {{Several interconnected layers of network form the smart grid. The Home
   Area Network (HAN) is the lowest layer of this grid, where reports about
   the various parameters associated with electrical devices are generated.
   For example, parameters could include information about the operation,
   power consumption, energy losses, power factor, etc. associated with the
   electrical devices. The reports generated are often classified as either
   periodic or critical. The critical reports are required to be
   communicated to a control station with minimal delay so that corrective
   measures could be taken quickly at the site of the electrical device.
   This paper presents the modelling and delay of wireless HANs. The
   communication between electrical devices and their associated access
   point can be achieved using several architectures, such as Frequency
   Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA),
   and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). For each of these multiple
   access techniques upper and lower bounds on delay are derived. These
   bounds are a function of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), channel
   interference range, and the number of electrical devices and channels.
   It is noted that transmission of critical reports from electrical
   devices to their access point under the CDMA scheme achieves the least
   delay among the three multiple access techniques considered in the
   paper.}},

Abstract = {{Customized/personalized products are gaining more shares in today's
   product market. Such products need collective efforts from consumers,
   manufacturers and third parties. On the other side, the Internet of
   Things (IoT) with pervasive sensing/actuating/networking ability greatly
   facilitates remote operation of manufacturing activities and efficient
   collaboration among stakeholders. This provides great opportunities to
   the above demand. Thus we propose a full-connection model of product
   lifecycle in the IoT-enabled cloud manufacturing environment. The model
   uses social networks to connect multiple parties and facilitate open
   innovations, IoT to glue physical space to cyber space and cloud
   manufacturing to provide various elastic services, so that the on-demand
   workspace, interaction, information sharing or collective problem
   solving are enabled. We also propose a supporting infrastructure for
   this model using the latest information and communication technologies.
   Finally, we present a RFID (Radio-frequency identification) enabled
   production system for customized/personalized products with the ability
   to enable a new paradigm of ``dynamic processes and close collaborations
   among different roles{''} and secure robust production.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroanatomy is a challenging subject, with novice medical students
   often experiencing difficulty grasping the intricate 3D spatial
   relationships. Most of the anatomical teaching in undergraduate medicine
   utilizes conventional 2D resources. E-learning technologies facilitate
   the development of learner-centered educational tools that can be
   tailored to meet each student's educational needs, and may foster
   improved learning in neuroanatomy, however this has yet to be examined
   fully in the literature. An interactive 3D e-learning module was
   developed to complement gross anatomy laboratory instruction.
   Incorporating such 3D modules may provide additional support for
   students in areas of anatomy that are spatially challenging, such as
   neuroanatomy. Specific anatomical structures and their relative spatial
   positions to other structures can be clearly defined in the 3D virtual
   environment from viewpoints that may not readily be available using
   cadaveric or 2D image modalities. Providing an interactive user
   interface for the 3D module in which the student controls many factors
   may enable the student to develop an improved understanding of the
   spatial relationships. This work outlines the process for the
   development of a 3D interactive module of the cerebral structures
   included in the anatomy curriculum for undergraduate medical students in
   their second year of study.}},

   involving skull-brain co-development in infants, leading to a platform
   for craniosynostosis modeling. Craniosynostosis occurs when one or more
   sutures are fused early in life, resulting in an abnormal skull shape.
   Surgery is required to reopen the suture and reduce intracranial
   pressure, but is difficult without any predictive model to assist
   surgical planning. We aim to study normal brain-skull growth by computer
   simulation, which requires a head model and appropriate mathematical
   methods for brain and skull growth respectively. On the basis of our
   previous model, we further specified suture model into fibrous and
   cartilaginous sutures and develop algorithm for skull extension. We
   evaluate the resulting simulation by comparison with datasets of cases
   and normal growth.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, self-driving vehicles which would shoulder the burden of
   driving and set free human on board are gradually becoming a reality.
   Consequently, the supporting of growing in-vehicle data traffic will be
   challenging in future 5G and vehicular networks, due to the high
   mobility nature of vehicles and the densified irregular distribution on
   road especially during rush time. Therefore in this paper, a
   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enabled integrated 5G-VANET
   architecture is proposed to improve heterogeneous network (HetNet)
   management and aggregate vehicle traffic through IEEE 802.11p; a novel
   vehicle clustering method and dual cluster head design are then
   introduced to reduce signaling overhead and enhance the overall
   communication quality in 5G-VANET HetNet under the coordination of SDN.
   It is also proved by simulation that the proposed design reduced 5G
   users' blocking probability to the operators services with a back-up
   cluster head (CH) in each cluster, and also realized adaptive clustering
   without excessive SDN's processing delay.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, data traffic in-car communication is increasing dramatically,
   due to the emerging technology of self-driving and on-board infotainment
   applications. The direct connections between vehicles and cellular
   infrastructures will introduce significant signalling overhead and
   excessive energy consumption, especially for congested and fast moving
   traffic. In order to improve energy efficiency and achieve green
   networking, an heterogeneous network, 5G-Vehicular Ad Hoc Network
   (5G-VANET) is presented in this paper, which coupling the high data
   rates of VANET and the wide coverage area of 5G. In this integrated
   architecture, vehicles are clustered accordingly, and one vehicle in
   each cluster is selected as a gateway to support aggregated traffic. To
   ensure the capacity of the trunk link between the gateway and base
   station, a Non-orthogonal Multiplexed Modulation (NOMM) scheme is
   proposed in this paper to effectively aggregate the
   Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) traffic and further improve energy
   efficiency. NOMM splits data stream of each user into multi-layers and
   modulate them simultaneously. Sparse spreading code is also applied in
   partially superposing the modulated symbols on several resource blocks.
   Furthermore, we analyzed the energy efficiency of proposed NOMM scheme
   and traditional M-QAM theoretically. It was also validated by simulation
   results that NOMM provides less power consumption than M-QAM modulation.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely considered as the most
   important information gathering platform in enabling Internet of Things
   (IoT). In order to evolve the traditional WSNs for low-power and
   low-loss IoT applications, time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) MAC
   protocol has been proposed to tackle the single channel and inefficient
   medium access drawbacks through improved network topology awareness.
   However, the problem of maintaining the physical topology of a WSN at
   the server end remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a novel
   physical topology discovery scheme for WSNs by exploitation of random
   walk process and iterative multilateration localization algorithm.
   Explicitly, information specific to the sensor nodes, including IDs and
   neighbor tables, are collected in the random walk process. The physical
   topology is then reconstructed at the server end based on the collected
   information and the iterative multilateration localization algorithm.
   Simulation results indicate that the average location offset between the
   established topology and the ground-truth topology can be as low as
   1.26m.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel control of PV solar farm as a STATCOM
   (PV-STATCOM) coordinated with Power System Stabilizers (PSSs) for
   damping of electromechanical oscillations in a power system. A two-area
   power system with a 150 MW PV solar plant connected at the midpoint of
   the tie line is simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC software. During contingencies,
   the capacity of the PV inverter remaining after real power generation is
   utilized for dynamic reactive power exchange to accomplish power
   oscillation damping. The advantage of master-slave feature in
   PSCAD/EMTDC software is utilized for performing the optimization and
   controller coordination. It is demonstrated that a coordinated control
   of PV-STATCOM and PSS can effectively enhance the damping of power
   oscillations, leading to higher power transfers in lines. This novel
   control of PV solar farms will result in a more optimal utilization of
   the expensive PV system asset for grid stabilization and enhancement of

Abstract = {{An Anti-Windup (AW) scheme is developed in this paper for Proportional
   Resonant (PR) controllers in the current control loop of a voltage
   source converter with an LCL filter. The innovation of this scheme lies
   in the fact that the anti-windup feedback signal is distributed to each
   input of the integrator. By controlling the percentage of this
   distribution, one can effectively adjust the phase shift introduced from
   this feedback signals to match that of the reference signal. The issue
   of zero sequence components in the three phase modulation signal has
   also been identified, and their effects have been neutralized by a
   proportional feedback controller. The performance of the proposed scheme
   is validated by simulation by comparing it with existing techniques for
   a grid-connected voltage source converter with a double loop current
   control. It has been shown that the proposed scheme produces lower
   current distortion and a higher power factor.}},

Abstract = {{Buildings are responsible for a significant amount of total global
   energy consumption and as a result account for a substantial portion of
   overall carbon emissions. Moreover, buildings have a great potential for
   helping to meet energy efficiency targets. Hence, energy saving goals
   that target buildings can have a significant contribution in reducing
   environmental impact. Today's smart buildings achieve energy efficiency
   by monitoring energy usage with the aim of detecting and diagnosing
   abnormal energy consumption behaviour. This research proposes a generic
   collective contextual anomaly detection (CCAD) framework that uses
   sliding window approach and integrates historic sensor data along with
   generated and contextual features to train an autoencoder to recognize
   normal consumption patterns. Subsequently, by determining a threshold
   that optimizes sensitivity and specificity, the framework identifies
   abnormal consumption behaviour. The research compares two models trained
   with different features using real-world data provided by Powersmiths,
   located in Brampton, Ontario, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Results related to an extension of the notion of nonlinear conic systems
   to the non-planar case are presented. Specifically, parametrization of
   the non-planar dynamic conic sectors in terms of their central subspace

   non-planar conicity is studied; in particular, it is shown that any
   (Q,S,R)-dissipative system is non-planar conic, and a procedure for
   calculation of the central subspace and the radius is presented. A graph
   separation stability condition for interconnections of non-planar conic
   systems is formulated and proven. The results presented in this work
   will form a background for the future extensions of the scattering

Abstract = {{This paper estimates the accuracy of an algorithm for constructing
   optimal solutions of optimization resource productivity problem within
   the framework of economic growth modeling. The problem is investigated
   using the generalized Pontryagin maximum principle for infinite time
   interval problems. Qualitative analysis of the Hamiltonian system
   reveals that optimal trajectories have a cyclic behavior at a steady
   state neighborhood. This means that the Jacobian evaluated at a steady
   state has complex eigenvalues. A nonlinear stabilizer, constructed for
   saddle steady state, does not exist in this case. In the paper, we
   generalize the structure of a nonlinear stabilizer for the case of a
   focal steady state. Applying the stabilizer to the Hamiltonian system
   obtained from the Pontryagin maximum principle in the case of complex
   eigenvalues, one can derive a closed-loop system which has spiral-formed
   solutions converging to the steady state over time. Optimal trajectories
   in a steady state vicinity have similar behavior and infinitesimal
   closeness of high order to trajectories generated by the proposed
   nonlinear stabilizer. This observation provides the basis of the
   algorithm for constructing solutions of the considered class of optimal
   control problems. Estimation of the algorithm accuracy and performance
   time is provided in terms of the utility function of the optimal control
   problem. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control)

Abstract = {{The growing popularity of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) can be
   attributed to its advantages, which include reduced post-operative pain,
   a shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery. However, MIS requires
   extensive training for surgeons to become experts in their field of
   practice. Different assessment methods have been proposed for evaluating
   the performance of surgeons and residents on surgical simulators.
   Nonetheless, optimal objective performance measures are still lacking.
   In this study, three metrics for minimally invasive skills assessment
   are proposed based on energy expenditure: work, potential energy and
   kinetic energy. In order to evaluate these metrics, two laparoscopic
   tasks consisting of suturing and knot-tying are investigated, involving
   expert and novice subjects. This study shows that measures based on
   energy expenditure can be used for skills assessment: all three metrics
   can discriminate between experts and novices for the two tasks
   investigated here. These measures can also reflect the efficiency of
   subjects when performing MIS tasks. Further modification and
   investigation of these metrics can extend their use to different tasks
   and for discriminating between various levels of experience.}},

Abstract = {{The design of a tremor estimator is an important part of designing
   mechanical tremor suppression orthoses. A number of tremor estimators
   have been developed and applied with the assumption that tremor is a
   mono-frequency signal. However, recent experimental studies have shown
   that Parkinsonian tremor consists of multiple frequencies, and that the
   second and third harmonics make a large contribution to the tremor.
   Thus, the current estimators may have limited performance on estimation
   of the tremor harmonics. In this paper, a high-order tremor estimation
   algorithm is proposed and compared with its lower-order counterpart and
   a widely used estimator, the Weighted-frequency Fourier Linear Combiner
   (WFLC), using 18 Parkinsonian tremor data sets. The results show that
   the proposed estimator has better performance than its lower-order
   counterpart and the WFLC. The percentage estimation accuracy of the
   proposed estimator is 85 +/- 2.9\%, an average improvement of 13\% over
   the lower-order counterpart. The proposed algorithm holds promise for
   use in wearable tremor suppression devices.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive surgery prevents surgeons from manually palpating
   organs to locate subsurface tumors and other structures. One solution is
   to use ultrasound; however, it is not always reliable. Various minimally
   invasive surgery instruments that provide tactile feedback have been
   proposed to augment ultrasound sensing for tumor localization; however,
   current designs have limitations such as cumbersome wiring, difficulty
   in manipulation, lack of sterilizability and high cost. This paper
   presents a novel, autoclavable, wireless, hand-held palpation instrument
   that uses a custom, low-cost, disposable tactile sensor to provide
   tactile and kinesthetic force feedback. The use of a replaceable,
   disposable tactile sensor avoids deterioration in sensor performance due
   to repeated autoclaving. The instrument features a passive joint in the
   end effector that allows the sensor to self-align to the palpation
   surface in a wide range of orientations. All of the electronics are
   packaged in a removable module that allows the rest of the instrument to
   be easily cleaned and autoclaved. Two versions of the tactile sensor,
   using piezoresistive sensing and capacitive sensing respectively, have
   been designed for use with this instrument. The instrument is shown to
   be able to detect 6 mm diameter spherical tumors at a depth of 9-10 mm
   in ex vivo tissue samples.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit the gradient based nonlinear attitude complementary filters
   (observers) on the Special Orthogonal group SO(3) and provide
   time-explicit solutions of the norm of the attitude estimation error
   dynamics. One constant-gain and two state-dependent-gain attitude
   observers are considered. The stability and performance properties of
   these attitude observers can be easily deduced from the obtained
   closed-form solutions. We show that the traditional (constant-gain)
   complementary attitude filter, previously proposed in the literature, is
   not Input-to-State-Stable (ISS) with respect to bounded measurement
   disturbances, while the state-dependent-gain versions are. We also show
   that the state-dependent-gain versions of the attitude complementary
   filter exhibit better convergence rates. Simulation results are provided
   to illustrate our results.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US) images are taken in 3-dimensional (3D) space to monitor
   the changes in the ventricular volume of neonates. Due to the small
   field of view of US imaging, the head image is taken as two parts. To
   properly monitor and analyze the images, the two parts need to be
   stitched together in 3D space. In this paper, we propose a technique
   based on rigid registration for this purpose. User provided
   corresponding landmarks of the two images are used for coarse alignment.
   Then mutual information based rigid transformation is performed for fine
   alignment of moving image on to the fixed image. Finally, the fixed and
   moving images are stitched together to produce the final output.
   Furthermore, we have analyzed the optimal parameter settings for the
   registration procedure to minimize the registration error. We achieved a
   mean registration accuracy of 2.71mm for four data sets of neonatal 3D
   US head images using the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Star-convexity prior is popular for interactive single object
   segmentation due to its simplicity and amenability to binary graph cut
   optimization. We propose a more general multi-object segmentation
   approach. Moreover, each object can be constrained by a more descriptive
   shape prior,{''}hedgehog{''}. Each hedgehog shape has its surface
   normals locally constrained by an arbitrary given vector field, e.g.
   gradient of the user-scribble distance transform. In contrast to
   star-convexity, the tightness of our normal constraint can be changed
   giving better control over allowed shapes. For example, looser
   constraints, i.e. wider cones of allowed normals, give more relaxed
   hedgehog shapes. On the other hand, the tightest constraint enforces
   skeleton consistency with the scribbles. In general, hedgehog shapes are
   more descriptive than a star, which is only a special case corresponding
   to a radial vector field and weakest tightness. Our approach has
   significantly more applications than standard single star-convex
   segmentation, e.g. in medical data we can separate multiple non-star
   organs with similar appearances and weak edges. Optimization is done by
   our modified alpha-expansion moves shown to be submodular for
   multi-hedgehog shapes.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel type of porous crystalline
   materials, have attracted increasing attention in clean energy
   applications due to their high surface area, permanent porosity, and
   controllable structures. MOFs are excellent precursors for the design
   and fabrication of nanostructured porous carbons and metal oxides,
   especially for hierarchical nanostructures. In this review, the recent
   development and understanding of MOFs and MOF-derived nanomaterials in
   the applications of fuel cells, batteries (e.g. lithium-ion,
   lithium-sulfur, and lithium-air batteries), and supercapacitors are
   summarized in detail. In particular, we focus on the design and
   fabrication of the morphology of nanomaterials derived from MOFs and the
   significant impact of structure on the electrochemical performance in
   clean energy applications. Finally, we also present the future trends,
   prospects, and possible obstacles of the development of advanced MOFs
   and MOF-derived nanomaterials for more promising and large-scale
   commercial applications of clean energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an on-line diagnostic function for temperature
   sensors using a noise analysis approach. The deviation of temperature
   measurements from their average value is treated as the noise input
   data, then the noise data is filtered through the Butterworth filter.
   The power spectrum density estimation of the noise data is obtained by
   using the Welch method. The first-order characteristic of the
   temperature sensor is used to obtain the characteristic frequency of the
   sensor, which can then be used to determine the working status of the
   sensor. Finally, through a large number of experiments, the results have
   shown that the sensor's characteristic frequency in a failure condition
   is significantly higher than that in the normal state. So it verifies
   the feasibility of on-line diagnosis by using the noise analysis
   approach for the temperature sensor.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the crucial human aspects, individual decision-making behavior
   may affect the quality of a software project, and it is adaptive to the
   environment in which an individual is practicing. However, no
   comprehensive reference framework of the environmental factors
   influencing individual decision-making behavior in software projects is
   presently available. This paper undertakes a systematic literature
   review (SLR) to gain insight into existing studies on this topic. After
   a careful SLR process, 40 studies were targeted to solve this question.
   Based on these extracted studies, we first provided a taxonomy of
   environmental factors comprising eight categories. Then a total of 237
   factors are identified and classified using these eight categories, and
   major environmental factors of each category are listed in the paper.
   The environmental factors listing and the taxonomy can help researchers
   and practitioners to better understand and predict the behavior of
   individuals during decision making and to design more effective
   solutions to improve people management in software projects.}},

Abstract = {{The intractable nature of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICP) leads
   to practical limitations in the fabrication of ICP-based transducers

   fabrication processes have focused primarily on thin-film deposition

   processes specifically developed for ICP with the ultimate goal of
   increasing the functionality of ICP sensors and actuators. Herein we
   employ automated polymer paste extrusion processes for the direct ink
   writing of 3D conductive polyaniline (PANI) structures. Realization of
   these structures is enabled through a modified fused filament
   fabrication delta robot equipped with an integrated polymer paste
   extruder. This unique robot-controlled additive manufacturing platform
   is capable of fabricating high-resolution 3D conductive PANI and has
   been utilized to produce structures with a minimum feature size of 1.5
   mm. The required processability of PANI is achieved by means of a
   counter-ion induced thermal doping method. Using this method, a viscous
   paste is formulated as the extrudate and a thermo-chemical treatment is
   applied post extrusion to finalize the complexation.}},

Abstract = {{The intrinsically conductive polymer polypyrrole is conventionally
   synthesized as monolithic films that exhibit significant actuation
   strains when subjected to an applied electric potential. Though numerous
   linear and bending actuators based on polypyrrole films have been
   investigated, the limitations inherent to planar film geometries inhibit
   the realization of more complex behaviours. Hence, three-dimensional
   polypyrrole structures are sought to greatly expand the potential
   applications for conductive polymer actuators. This research aims to
   develop a novel additive manufacturing method for the fabrication of
   three-dimensional structures of conductive polypyrrole.
   In this investigation, radiation-curing techniques are employed by means
   of digital light processing (DLP) technology. DLP is an additive
   manufacturing technique where programmed light patterns emitted from a
   dedicated source are used to selectively cure a specially formulated
   polymer resin. Successive curing operations lead to a layered 3D
   structure into which fine features may be incorporated. Energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) is subsequently employed to examine the
   unique microstructural features of the resultant 3D printed polymer
   morphology in order to elucidate the nature of the conductivity. These
   polymer microstructures are highly desirable since actuation response
   times are highly dependent on ion transport distances, and hence the
   ability to fabricate fine features offers a potential mechanism to
   improve actuator performance.}},

Abstract = {{The Gemini Planet Imager has been successfully obtaining images and
   spectra of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and debris and protoplanetary
   circumstellar disks using its integral field spectrograph and
   polarimeter. GPI observations are transformed from raw data into
   high-quality astrometrically and photometrically calibrated datacubes
   using the GPI Data Reduction Pipeline, an open-source software framework
   continuously developed by our team and available to the community. It
   uses a flexible system of reduction recipes composed of individual
   primitive steps, allowing substantial customization of processing
   depending upon science goals. This paper provides a broad overview of
   the GPI pipeline, summarizes key lessons learned, and describes improved
   calibration methods and new capabilities available in the latest
   version. Enhanced automation better supports observations at the
   telescope with streamlined and rapid data processing, for instance
   through real-time assessments of contrast performance and more automated
   calibration file processing. We have also incorporated the GPI Data
   Reduction Pipeline as one component in a larger automated data system to
   support the GPI Exoplanet Survey campaign, while retaining its
   flexibility and stand-alone capabilities to support the broader GPI
   observer community. Several accompanying papers describe in more detail
   specific aspects of the calibration of GPI data in both spectral and
   polarimetric modes.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal energy storage (TES) systems using phase change materials (PCMs)
   are used in various engineering applications. TES is a means by which
   heat is `hold' for a certain period of time for use at a later time. We
   report an experimental study which was conducted to investigate the
   melting process and associated heat transfer in a rectangular chamber
   with a cylindrical u-shaped heat source imbedded inside the PCM. The
   results showed that geometry and orientation of the heat source
   immensely influenced the heat transfer behavior during solid liquid
   phase transition. The heat transfer behavior, interface movement and the
   heat transfer coefficients differed both axially and vertically inside
   the chamber as well as with the melting rate. The local convective heat
   transfer coefficient, h(local) in the inner region, enclosed by the
   U-tube, was observed to increase at a higher rate than the outer region.
   Stronger convective flow and a lower viscosity owing to higher
   temperature in the inner region is believed to have caused faster
   melting in this region. The melting rate was also found comparatively
   higher until approximately two-third of the PCM volume was melted before
   the rate declined}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a class of OFDM systems with Continuous Phase Modulation
   (CPM) mapper signals is discussed and theoretical predictions for symbol
   error probabilities are derived, where the memory is employed to improve
   system performance. Previously, results summarized that binary data of
   OFDM systems with CPM mapper is mapped with complex symbols using the
   concept of correlated phase states of CPM signal. The results presented
   in this paper show that M-ary OFDM systems with CPM mapper outperforms
   the conventionally used M-ary memory-less mapper in OFDM systems.
   Optimum and suboptimum multiple-symbol observation OFDM systems with CPM
   mapper receivers are derived. Multipath channel with Additive White
   Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is assumed. Also, symbol error rate performance in
   terms of high and low SNR bounds is analyzed and assessed in terms of
   the value of the deviation ratio h, time delay, and attenuation level.
   This paper provides a complete analysis of the performance of the OFDM
   systems with CPM mapper at high SNR as well as low SNR and as a result
   unifies and extends the previously available results.}},

   high voltage bushing. Considering different depths of 1 mm, 5 mm and 11
   mm, respectively, simulation results were obtained for void sizes with
   full, 50\% less and without oil insulations. The simulation results
   showed that the bushing failure occurred due to oil leakage and
   different sizes of voids. It was also summarized that the physical
   inspection could help in predicting and preventing high voltage bushing

Abstract = {{Future fifth generation (5G) wireless infrastructure tends to be highly
   heterogeneous, with dense small cells deployed overlay to cellular
   networks. Along with extremely high capacity and stringent latency
   requirements, security provisioning is becoming challenging in 5G
   Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). Security key management could be
   difficult in small cells where users join and leave frequently, not to
   mention the limited capability of simplified access points (APs). On the
   other hand, frequent handovers and authentications in small cells also
   introduce unnecessary latency. Therefore in this article, we propose a
   software defined networking (SDN) enabled fast authentication scheme
   using weighted secure-context-information (SCI) transfer in order to
   improve authentication efficiency during handover and meet 5G latency
   requirement. The proposed algorithm is then applied in Neyman Pearson
   (NP) hypothesis test to authenticate users, which shows enhanced
   authentication accuracy and reduced latency in MATLAB simulations.
   Furthermore, we first analyze the SDN structure using priority queuing
   theory, and prove the performance of SDN enabled authentication
   handover.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have already been pervasively utilized due to
   the rapid deployment of information and communication technology (ICT)
   in many industrial applications, which generate massive amount of sensor
   data. This development has brought several technical challenges in
   sensor data processing, e.g., data fault and data redundancy. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) has been used recently to process the massive
   but correlated sensor data. However, the conventional PCA method is
   difficult to be adapted in following the dynamic conditions of wireless
   sensor networks. In this paper, recursive principal component analysis
   (R-PCA) method is exploited to progressively update the transformation
   basis for extracting principal components. Furthermore, a novel R-PCA
   based algorithm is proposed to address data fault and data redundancy
   problems. Different from conventional PCA-based algorithms, the proposed
   algorithm is cluster-based so that the network efficiency can be further
   improved. Simulations based on a practical dataset have been conducted
   to evaluate the performance of algorithms. Simulation results show that
   the proposed algorithm improves the fault detection accuracy by about
   20\% and reduces the data restoration error by about 28\%.}},

Abstract = {{There are practical links between water resources management, climate
   change adaptation and sustainable development leading to reduction of
   water scarcity risk and re-enforcing resilience as a new development
   paradigm. Water scarcity, due to the global change (population growth,
   land use change and climate change), is of serious concern since it can
   cause loss of human lives and serious damage to the economy of a region.
   Unfortunately, in many regions of the world, water scarcity is, and will
   be unavoidable in the near future. As the scarcity is increasing, at the
   same time it erodes resilience, therefore global change has a magnifying
   effect on water scarcity risk. In the past, standard water resources
   management planning considered arrangements for prevention, mitigation,
   preparedness and recovery, as well as response. However, over the last
   ten years substantial progress has been made in establishing the role of
   resilience in sustainable development. Dynamic resilience is considered
   as a novel measure that provides for better understanding of temporal
   and spatial dynamics of water scarcity. In this context, a water
   scarcity is seen as a disturbance in a complex physical-socio-economic
   system. Resilience is commonly used as a measure to assess the ability
   of a system to respond and recover from a failure. However, the time
   independent static resilience without consideration of variability in
   space does not provide sufficient insight into system's ability to
   respond and recover from the failure state and was mostly used as a
   damage avoidance measure. This paper provides an original systems
   framework for quantification of resilience. The framework is based on
   the definition of resilience as the ability of physical and
   socio-economic systems to absorb disturbance while still being able to
   continue functioning. The disturbance depends on spatial and temporal
   perspectives and direct interaction between impacts of disturbance
   (social, health, economic, and other) and adaptive capacity of the
   system to absorb disturbance. Utility of the dynamic resilience is
   demonstrated through a single-purpose reservoir operation subject to
   different failure (water scarcity) scenarios. The reservoir operation is
   simulated using the system dynamics (SD) feedback-based object-oriented
   simulation approach.}},

Abstract = {{Energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) have become the key
   performance indicators for wireless communication systems. In this
   paper, EE and SE, efficiency metrics, of a digital communication system
   with M-QANI modulation technique are introduced. The upper bounds on the
   efficiency metrics over generalized-K fading channel are derived in
   closed form. These efficiency metrics are analyzed for several
   generalized-K channel parameters and constellation size M. The effect of
   roll-off bandwidth factor on the efficiency metrics is also
   investigated. It is observed that the efficiency metrics are degraded by
   the nature of the fading channel. Thus, enhancing technique for SE and
   EE is proposed which is based on employing a higher/lower modulation
   level NI to achieve a maximum EE in specific regions of signal to noise
   ratio (SNR) while maintaining a certain QoS. The proposed technique
   improves the efficiency metrics for a wide operating range of SNR;
   however, results in increased system complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Spoofing that emulates authentic signals to coerce target receivers into
   false navigation solutions is a severe threat to many applications based
   on Global Positioning System (GPS). In order to forge a reasonable
   navigation solution, a spoofer generally has to mimic signals of several
   GPS satellites simultaneously. In view of the fact that GPS signals
   originated from a single transmitter would essentially experience an
   identical wireless channel to a receiver, a GPS spoofing detection
   scheme is proposed based on comparing the multipath signature of
   received signals. More specifically, the delay and gain ratio between
   multiple paths of a wireless channel that cannot be masked by spooling
   signals are exploited. The delays between the strongest and other
   correlation peaks associated with each satellite are first evaluated. A
   correlation peak with the same delay for different satellites and
   closest to the strongest peak is then selected and its ratio to the
   strongest peak is calculated. With an identical wireless channel, the
   ratios corresponding to different satellites would be highly correlated.
   In contrast, ratios of authentic satellite signals that experience
   independent channels would be independent of each other. GPS spoofing
   can therefore be detected. The proposed design has been validated by
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In smart grids, the critical packets generated by an Electrical Device
   (ED) at the customer site must be communicated to a control station with
   minimal delay so that corrective measures, if required, can be initiated
   quickly at the site. This paper presents the modelling of Wireless Mesh
   Backbone Network (WMBN) to which customer sites are connected in a smart
   grid. The WMBN is comprised of Mesh Routers (MRs) that are connected
   wirelessly to provide an end to-end path within the network. An
   analytical model is presented that takes into account Voronoi
   tessellation for selecting the shortest path for transmissions in this
   network. Each MR is equipped with a Straight-Line Path Routing (SLPR)
   algorithm that provides MR traversing packets with a sequence of cells
   to reach the identified gateway within WMBN. The long link distances
   between routers are subject to attenuation and communication challenges.
   An optimum solution to transmit critical packets with minimal delay to
   the identified gateway is also given. Upper and lower bounds on
   achievable minimal delay are derived for a Distributed Coordination
   Function (DCF) mode in terms of: i) signal-to-noise ratio, ii) number of
   channels, iii) number of hops, iv) distance, v) channel interference,
   and vi) interference range. Results show that in the worst-case critical
   packets can be delivered to their destinations in less than 4 ms, which
   meets the standard requirement of a smart grid.}},

Abstract = {{Objective measures of speech quality are attractive because they
   facilitate performance assessment of hearing aids (HAs) without the need
   for human listeners. Objective speech quality predictions are usually
   performed intrusively, wherein the ``closeness{''} between the reference
   and HA output speech recordings is quantitied. In this paper, we focus
   on nonintrusive estimation of HA speech quality based on Perceptual
   Linear Prediction (PLP) modeling approach. In PLP, perceptual phenomena
   such as non-uniform filter bank analysis and nonlinear mapping between
   sound intensity and its perceived loudness are incorporated into the
   linear prediction feature extraction process. In this work, PLP and
   PLP-based cepstral coefficients were computed from HA speech recordings
   and their statistical properties were utilized as features for speech
   quality estimation. A custom database of HA speech recordings obtained
   in different noisy and reverberant environments was used to investigate
   the predictive performance of these individual features. In addition,
   regression functions that linearly combined the features and mapped to
   the predicted quality scores, were derived and validated. Experimental
   results show that the proposed nonintrusive speech quality estimates
   correlate well with subjective ratings of speech quality by heating
   impaired listeners.}},

Abstract = {{Extracting meaningful information from large number of video streams
   require designing specific algorithms to detect each type of object such
   as faces, people, vehicles, bags etc. The development of such specific
   algorithms requires a large amount of time from an expert in image
   analysis. Optimization based techniques have been increasingly used to
   automatically develop such algorithms, but they do not utilize any
   domain knowledge. Consequently, these automated approaches explore a
   large solution space and were only able to use a small number of
   primitive tools as building blocks in the generated algorithms. We
   proposes a novel method which integrates abstract knowledge about image
   processing tools into a genetic algorithm by exploiting the fact that
   there are classes of image processing algorithms that implement specific
   categories of algorithms such as noise reduction, sharpening, edge
   detection, binarization, classification etc. Using such knowledge, we
   were able to constrain the search performed by the genetic algorithm
   within a rich space of possibly successful processing sequences.
   Moreover, the use of abstract knowledge decouples the proposed method
   from implementation details of specific processing tools so that the
   system can be easily extended by incorporating additional tools.
   Experimental evaluations compare the our approach with a traditional
   genetic algorithm based implementation which does not utilize high-level
   knowledge. A case study shows that the proposed method could converge to
   the optimum solution six times faster than the traditional method.}},

Abstract = {{An OFDM system with CPM mappers is considered. Such a system in general
   is known to enhance bit error rate performance by virtue of the memory
   introduced by the CPM mapper compared to OFDM systems with conventional
   memoryless mappers such as BPSK and QPSK. In this paper, the ability of
   CPM mappers in an OFDM system to reduce Peak-to-Average Power Ratio
   (PAPR) is examined as a function of modulation parameters of mappers
   used in the system. Various subclasses of CPM mapper such as single-h
   CPFSK, multi-h CPFSK, and asymmetric multi-h CPFSK arc also considered.
   Next, these mappers in conjunction with Clipping and Filtering (CF)
   technique are considered and it is shown that repeated clipping and
   frequency domain filtering in OFDM systems can significantly reduce the
   PAPR of the transmitted signal. The technique causes no increase in
   out-of-band power and significant PAPR reduction can be achieved with
   only moderate levels of clipping. A comparison of PAPR reduction
   capability of CPM mappers relative to memoryless BPSK mappers in an OFDM
   system is presented. It is noted that, in general, CPM mappers offer
   superior PAPR performance compared to memoryless mappers in an OFDM

Abstract = {{Data networks are experiencing an unprecedented growth in traffic
   resulting in a multitude of challenges including high network
   congestion, latency, and packet loss rates. These challenges greatly
   affect the performance of the network and have a drastic impact on the
   Quality of Service (QoS) for various applications. In order to reduce
   network congestion and in turn, maintain the desired QoS, an adaptive
   and distributed compression/decompression scheme is proposed. The
   proposed scheme performs the compression and decompression processes
   within the queues of the intermediate routing nodes of a network. The
   payload of a packet is compressed based on the packet queuing time. The
   average expected queuing time of packets is determined instantaneously
   within the intermediate nodes of a network by employing the Pollaczek
   Khinchin (PK) equation. Using Network Simulator 3 (NS3), the proposed
   scheme was simulated under different network conditions and compared
   with non-compressed transmission sessions of different flow rates. The
   simulation results show a dramatic improvement in network performance.
   More specifically, the number of lost packets and one way latency are
   reduced by at least 22.50\% and 18\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The development of computer based systems expands the usage of computer
   based application in human life. It can be observed that illegal
   activities such as unauthorized data access, data theft, data
   modification and various other intrusion activities are rapidly growing
   during last decade. Hence, deployment and continuous improvement of
   Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are of paramount importance. Training,
   testing and evaluation of IDS with real network traffic is significant
   challenge, so most of IDS evaluation is based on intrusion datasets.
   Therefore, analysis of intrusion datasets are of paramount importance.
   In this paper, we evaluated Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) with
   different machine learning techniques. Feature reduction techniques such
   as Information Gain (IG) and Chi-Squared statistics (CII) were applied
   to evaluate dataset performance with feature reduction. Results of
   experiments show that feature reduction can lead to better analysis in
   terms of accuracy, processing time and complexity. It was observed that,
   the maximum increment of classification accuracy with feature reduction
   from 110 to 41 is 2.4\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we utilize the minimum mean squared error (MMSE)
   prediction to compensate imperfect channel reciprocity in achieving
   physical-layer confidentiality enhancement, particularly for our
   recently developed secure OFDM system with dynamic subcarrier coordinate
   interleaving {[}1]. In the proposed method, the transmitter first
   estimates the correlation coefficient between the forward and backward
   channel estimates based on historical observations and then uses this
   correlation coefficient to predict the channel estimate that would be
   observed by the legitimate receiver. Relying on this predicted channel,
   the transmitter interleaves the real and imaginary components of a
   subcarrier symbol when its associated channel phase is larger than a
   predefined threshold. Improved channel reciprocity is thus established
   and the frequently updated interleaving pattern can be shared between
   legitimate users. In contrast, adversaries at a third location are not
   able to de-interleave the OFDM signals so that communication
   confidentiality is achieved. Compared with existing imperfect channel
   reciprocity compensation solutions in physical-layer confidentiality
   enhancement, the proposed technique requires no additional resource and
   is not sensitive to the origin of the imperfect channel reciprocity.
   Simulations are carried out to validate the proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new concept for generating magnetic field in
   Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches intended for safe robotic
   applications. The main rationale behind this concept is to divide the
   magnetic field generation into two parts using an electromagnetic coil
   and a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet generates a bias magnetic
   field density at the optimum working point of the MR clutch while the
   energized coil can add or negate the magnetic field to a desired value.
   The results will show clear advantages of this concept in reducing the
   total weight of the MR clutch, improving the torque-to-mass ratio, and
   reducing electrical power consumption. The proposed concept is validated
   using computer model of an MR clutch and Finite Element Method (FEM) is
   hired to compare the characteristics of the proposed MR clutch with
   those from conventional coil based clutch. Experimental results will be
   provided to further validate the advantages of the proposed new concept.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, advances in sensor technologies and expansion of smart
   meters have resulted in massive growth of energy data sets. These Big
   Data have created new opportunities for energy prediction, but at the
   same time, they impose new challenges for traditional technologies. On
   the other hand, new approaches for handling and processing these Big
   Data have emerged, such as MapReduce, Spark, Storm, and Oxdata H2O. This
   paper explores how findings from machine learning with Big Data can
   benefit energy consumption prediction. An approach based on local
   learning with support vector regression (SVR) is presented. Although
   local learning itself is not a novel concept, it has great potential in
   the Big Data domain because it reduces computational complexity. The
   local SVR approach presented here is compared to traditional SVR and to
   deep neural networks with an H2O machine learning platform for Big Data.
   Local SVR outperformed both SVR and H2O deep learning in terms of
   prediction accuracy and computation time. Especially significant was the
   reduction in training time; local SVR training was an order of magnitude
   faster than SVR or H2O deep learning.}},

Abstract = {{Modern joint replacements provide an effective treatment for patients
   suffering from debilitating joint conditions; over 300,000 total hip
   replacement surgeries are performed each year in North America.
   Nonetheless, about 10\% of all hip implants need to be replaced within
   10 years of patients receiving a total hip replacement, typically due to
   component loosening or infection. The capabilities of state-of-the-art
   3D metal printing systems allow research groups and medical device
   manufacturers to explore entirely new designs for more intelligent and
   effective orthopedic implants, which may offer improved performance and
   more effective monitoring. This paper presents the development of a
   platform for a next generation ``smart{''} implant: an instrumented
   implant with electronic sensors and wireless telemetry. This implant
   utilizes an ultra-low power microcontroller and wireless radio frequency
   transceiver onboard. Additive manufacturing in medical grade alloy has
   been used to create a modified version of a commercial hip implant with
   allowance for an electronics cassette, including an instrumentation bay
   with a 2.4 cm(3) volume. This modular approach provides the capability
   of incorporating a range of sensors in the future (e.g., sensors

   breach threats that any healthcare organization might face when many
   internal users of different security levels have access to BI
   components.
   Data masking techniques are used to minimize the inadvertent disclosure
   risk of sensitive data as well as to preserve the basic quality of data
   analytics (data utility). However, the traditional masking methods fail
   to maintain the utility of data analysis for reporting and research
   purposes. In this paper a practical classification component for a
   built-in data masking framework (IMETU-Identify, Map, Execute, Test, and
   Utilize) is proposed and focuses on the first two modules. The analyzed
   health data attributes are based on the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD
   - Acute Inpatient in Canada). The proposed component is to identify the
   sensitive data, and select the best masking format to provide more data
   privacy and protection at rest (i.e., it can accurately be drilled down
   to a monthly aggregated level). This Module allows sensitive data
   attributes to be safely used and complies with the privacy regulatory
   requirements within the healthcare data warehouse by mapping them with
   the proper irreversible or reversible masking techniques. Native
   encryption techniques are avoided due to complex calculation and
   increase storage space.}},

Abstract = {{Big data based user authentication is a new approach that leverages the
   power of the Big Data analytics to develop a fertile field for the next
   generation authentication protocols. This new approach relies on
   ``something you do{''}-based verification methods, where the users'
   dynamic behaviors are analyzed in order to generate real-time uniquely
   identifiable information about them. Once the unique user's
   identification is generated ``authentication on demand{''} can be
   achieved through user challenging questions that are dynamic and user
   specific. In this paper, the 3Vs nature of Big Data (volume, variety and
   velocity) is utilized to propose an Innovative Data Authentication Model
   (IDA). IDA model is a new implementation for the Big Data based user
   authentication in finding out unique patterns of the users' dynamic
   behaviors to be used as a basis for the user challenging questions
   generation process. In other words, Big Data analytic techniques such as
   association learning and behavioral classification will be used to
   compile the human dynamics into flexible security user profiles. The
   term ``human dynamics{''} comprises the actions of human and their
   impacts on behavioral outcomes. The real-time analysis of these users'
   profiles helps generate a random set of challenging questions thereby
   ``authentication on demand{''} feature is obtained. A practical use case
   scenario has been given to illustrate how IDA works from creating user
   profiles, to studying and classifying human dynamics and generating
   questionnaire with security potentials to authenticate users.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional wireless localization techniques, the performance is
   generally constrained by the number of reference nodes available in the
   communication range. Recently, alternative localization schemes have
   been proposed to utilize the internal sensors embedded in wireless
   devices to acquire additional useful location dependent parameters. The
   accelerometer based localization has attracted much attention because of
   the widely usage of accelerometer sensors in today's smart phones.
   However, the accumulated error from the sensors can decrease the
   localization accuracy significantly as time goes by. In this paper, we
   propose a novel algorithm which combines the signal measurements from
   available reference nodes and the data output from accelerometer sensor
   to overcome the error accumulation. The simulation results shows that
   our proposed algorithm can achieve outstanding localization performance
   with only few reference nodes.}},

Abstract = {{The dramatic increase in the network traffic data has become a major
   concern in security systems. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs), as
   common widely used security systems for communication networks, are not
   an exception. An IDS monitors the network traffic to detect attacks
   through classifying the network traffic data into normal and abnormal
   classes. Due to the high dimensionality of the network traffic data, it
   is not always feasible for an IDS to detect intrusions quickly and
   accurately. Feature selection emerges as a necessary step in designing
   an IDS to overcome its shortcoming and enhance its performance through
   the reduction of its complexity and acceleration of the detection
   process. To this end, in this paper, we address the problem of
   dimensionality reduction by proposing an efficient feature selection
   algorithm that considers the correlation between a subset of features
   and the behavior class label. Correlation-based feature selection (CFS)
   and symmetrical uncertainty (SU) are the two correlation metrics used to
   measure the dependency level between features and class labels, and
   among features. Experimental results on NSL-KDD dataset shows that the
   proposed approach with fewer features, significantly outperforms the
   existing schemes in terms of the training time, time taken to build the
   model, while it preserves or increases the system accuracy. In addition,
   the efficiency of the proposed feature selection technique is tested on
   different classification algorithms and comparison results indicates
   that J48 classifier with the highest accuracy and precision values and
   lowest miss rate and false alarm rate values, performs better with the
   proposed feature selection technique.}},

Abstract = {{Human action recognition from still image has recently drawn increasing
   attention in human behavior analysis vision and also poses great
   challenges due to the huge inter ambiguity and intra variability. Vector
   of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) has achieved state-of-the-art
   performance in many image classification tasks based on local features.
   The great success of VLAD is largely due to its high descriptive ability
   and computational efficiency. In this paper, towards optimal VLAD
   representations for human action recognition from still images, we
   improve VLAD by tackling two important issues in VLAD including empty
   cavity and assignment ambiguity. The empty cavity issue severely
   compromises the performance of VLAD and has long been overlooked. We
   investigate the empty cavity and provide an effective solution to deal
   with it, which largely improves the performance of VLAD; we propose
   middle level assignments to conquer the assignment ambiguity, which are
   more reliable and can provide more useful information for realistic
   activity. We have conducted extensive experiments on two widely-used
   benchmarks to validate the proposed method for human action recognition
   from still images. Our method produces competitive performance with
   state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-increasing number of new customers joining the power grid is
   impacting the delay performance in smart grids, as packets generated by
   numerous Electrical Devices (EDs) are required to be transported through
   several interconnected networks. Thus, the high volume of traffic
   generated in Neighbourhood Area Networks (NANs) is causing delay due to
   link congestion. In order to minimize this, Wide Area Networks (WANs)
   combined with an efficient routing strategy is a possible solution. In
   this paper, a topological design model that adapts to the faster routes
   is proposed for achieving minimum end-to-end delay. Routers are modelled
   as G/G/b(l) queueing systems with First Input First Out (FIFO)
   discipline. A Dynamic Fastest Routing Strategy (DFRS) for such a network
   with n number of nodes and m number of links that enables the packets to
   choose the best routes from source to destination is presented. It takes
   into account the level of clogging over each link, based on: i) the
   average threshold time of transmitting a packet over a link, ii) the
   Quality of Service (QoS) expected from the WAN, and iii) the performance
   of forwarding packets over sprightly routes. Expressions for mean packet
   delay (including waiting, transmission, and propagation time) are
   derived as a function of maximum number of packets, traffic intensity,
   death rate, capacity, number of channels, and the latency of the link.
   The simulation results are compared with theoretical expressions and
   wire-line networks that employ classical G/G/1 queueing system for an
   Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing scheme. It is noted that the
   proposed model is simple to implement and minimizes the average packet
   delay in WANs, and meets smart-grid standards.}},

   unsupervised (clustering) activity detection scheme works in an
   incremental manner, which contains two stages. In the first stage,
   streamed sensor data will be processed. A single-pass clustering
   algorithm is used in order to generate pre-clustered results for the
   next stage. In the second stage, pre-clustered results will be refined
   to form the final clusters, which means the clusters are built
   incrementally adding one cluster at a time. Experiments on phone sensors
   data of five basic human activities show that the proposed scheme could
   get comparable results with traditional clustering algorithms but
   working in a streaming and incremental manner, which is promising for

   process. Thus, a cutting parameter optimization method based on dynamic
   machining features for complex structural parts is proposed to improve
   the machining efficiency and guarantee the product quality during the

Abstract = {{Cloud Manufacturing can provide mass manufacturing resources and
   capabilities as services via the Internet. Undoubtedly, multiple
   manufacturing clouds (MCs) will have extremely abundant services in
   terms of function, price, etc. The ability to leverage ample services
   hosted in MCs has direct relation to the success or failure of a
   manufacturer. Meanwhile, various uncertainties in today's highly-dynamic
   business environment can easily disrupt manufacturing activities,
   rendering original schedules ineffective or even obsolete. loT's
   real-time sensing ability can be used to detect those uncertainties.
   However, little work has been done to take advantage of abundant
   services from MCs and to effectively deal with uncertainties. In order
   to address this issue, we propose a mathematical formulation for
   loT-enabled dynamic Service Selection (SS) across multiple MCs. We
   consider three kinds of uncertainties (fluctuation of completion time,
   choices of manufacturing services, and runtime changes made by users)
   that come from both the user and market sides. The formulation can guide
   the dynamic SS and enable users to continuously adjust SS to be more
   effective and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{The Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is a recently adopted mode of operation
   for symmetric key cryptography to provide both data authenticity and

   of the GCM module, we propose a novel multiple-bit fault detection
   architecture for hardware implementation of the GCM module using cyclic
   redundancy check (CRC) codes. By changing the degree of the CRC
   generating polynomial, one can select the number of parity bits used in
   the fault detection scheme based on the available resources and required
   overheads. We derive new formulations for the corresponding
   fault-detection scheme for the entire GCM loop. Then, we provide FPGA
   implementation and fault coverage simulation results for different CRC
   generating polynomials. We show that using six parity bits, one can
   achieve high fault coverage of close to 100\% with the critical path
   delay overhead of 23\% and area overhead of 10.9\% while the false alarm
   is 0.12 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Thin-client computing is being adopted by many industries to bring
   services to users through a unique platform over wide area networks
   (WAN). To improve thin-client communication sessions, some authors have
   proposed using the thin-client protocol with enhanced image compression
   techniques while others have proposed using drawing commands instead. To
   take full advantage of the capabilities of thin-client systems, an
   advance communication protocol is needed. In this paper, a lightweight
   multicasting protocol for thin-client systems, Thin-Cast, is proposed
   where the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE)
   perceived by a user are maintained while meeting the latency
   constraints. ThinCast establishes a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network
   using the underlying Internet protocol (IP) infrastructure. A central
   server explicitly requests a peer to forward a payload to a list of
   defined neighboring peers. While using ThinCast, server costs are
   reduced since the required throughput to achieve the same quality of
   service is lowered. On average, the throughput decreased by 11\% under
   different simulation scenarios. The decrease in throughput values allows
   the server to temporarily increase the packet generation rate, thereby
   increasing the quality of the received video by the users.}},

Abstract = {{For several decades now wind engineering addressed the problem of the
   response of buildings and structures to straight, atmospheric boundary
   layer (ABL) wind loading. However, for the last two decades it has been
   demonstrated that in some regions of the globe thunderstorm,
   non-synoptic winds are responsible for a large portion of the damage
   produced by natural disasters. According to Munich Re, in USA these
   severe thunderstorms produced in 2015 60\% of the total insured damage.
   These wind storms are quintessentially different from the typical
   straight, ABL winds including hurricane winds. These high intensity wind
   storms are spatially complex and time varying and, as a result, most of
   the generated wind fields are three-dimensional and non-stationary. On
   the other hand, our well-established Boundary Layer Wind Tunnels produce
   straight and steady fluid flow movements and are somewhat limited to a
   certain range of Reynolds numbers.
   These realizations have generated an entire new body of work in Wind
   Engineering through which the traditional approach has evolved or
   changed and new techniques have emerged. This includes changes in
   methods of collecting full scale data, novel physical (and numerical)
   modeling techniques, new analysis techniques and wind structure
   interaction approaches. These methodologies allow us today to look at a
   more diverse and complex spectrum of wind events including
   non-stationary events such as these non-synoptic winds and their impact
   on our buildings and structures.
   The development of new, larger and multi-fan wind engineering facilities
   around the world such as the WindEEE Dome facility at Western University
   provided us, during the recent years, with the opportunity to look into
   the way we simulate these complex wind phenomena. Also, it invites new
   insight in data analysis and the way we treat the wind structure
   interaction problem in a non-stationary context.}},

Abstract = {{An important component in the wind load chain for the structural design
   is the extreme wind speed. The probabilistic prediction of the extreme
   wind speed is simple if accurate and abundant surface wind observations
   for a standard height and exposure condition are available. However, the
   period of available observations at a meteorological station is often
   short; the recorded winds may represent those in mixed climates with
   time-varying exposure. These increase the difficulties in mapping the
   wind hazard, updating design wind pressure in structural design codes,
   and estimating wind risk. Moreover, structures designed to sustain
   synoptic or typhoon winds can experience short duration strong winds
   from the high intensity wind (HIW) events such as tornados and
   downbursts and collapse.
   In this study, we first summarize techniques and statistics used to
   develop new wind hazard maps for mainland China by combining results
   obtained based on the surface wind observations and simulated typhoon
   winds. The results indicate that the mean, coefficient of variation and
   return period value of annual maximum wind speed are geographically
   varying. It is show that the use of a single return period to recommend
   the design wind load in the current design code cannot ensure
   reliability-consistency of the designed structures at different
   geographical locations. Reliability-based code calibration is carried
   out to select design wind load for improving reliability-consistency.
   Also, the required importance factor is calibrated for increased failure
   consequences. In addition, potential benefit of structural ductility
   capacity to sustain short duration HIW events is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Both the time history analysis procedure and the response spectrum
   method are frequently used to estimate the seismic response of the
   structures. One of the advantages of the time history analysis procedure
   is that it can be easily employed for actual or simulated ground motion
   records of identified scenario seismic events, although it can be
   computationally intensive. The response spectrum method is simple to
   use; its accuracy depends on dynamic characteristics of the considered
   structure.
   This study is focused on the seismic responses of single-layer
   cylindrical lattice shell. A comparison of the responses estimated by
   using the time-history analysis and the response spectrum method is
   presented. For the time-history analysis, 166 ground motion record
   components are employed, while the responses obtained by using the
   response spectrum method are estimated based on the design spectrum or
   the average spectral acceleration of scaled record components. The
   comparison indicates that the accuracy of the response spectrum method
   for such a structure depends on the type of response of interest and the
   intensity measure used to scale the record components. In general, it is
   suggested that the response spectrum method should not be employed to
   estimate the structural member forces of the cylindrical lattice shell.}},

Abstract = {{Valuable chemicals can be separated from agricultural residues by
   chemical or thermochemical processes. The application of pyrolysis has
   already been demonstrated as an efficient means to produce a liquid with
   a high concentration of desired product. The objective of this study was
   to apply an insect and microorganism bioassay-guided approach to
   separate and isolate pesticidal compounds from bio-oil produced through
   biomass pyrolysis. Tobacco leaf (Nicotianata bacum), tomato plant
   (Solanum lycopersicum), and spent coffee (Coffea arabica) grounds were
   pyrolyzed at 10 degrees C/min from ambient to 565 degrees C using the
   mechanically fluidized reactor (MFR). With one-dimensional (1D) MFR
   pyrolysis, the composition of the product vapors varied as the reactor
   temperature was raised allowing for the selection of the temperature
   range that corresponds to vapors with a high concentration of pesticidal
   properties. Further product separation was performed in a fractional
   condensation train, or 2D MFR pyrolysis, thus allowing for the
   separation of vapor components according to their condensation
   temperature. The 300-400 degrees C tobacco and tomato bio-oil cuts from
   the 1D MFR showed the highest insecticidal and anti-microbial activity
   compared to the other bio-oil cuts. The 300-350 and 350-400 degrees C
   bio-oil cuts produced by 2D MFR had the highest insecticidal activity
   when the bio-oil was collected from the 210 degrees C condenser. The
   tobacco and tomato bio-oil had similar insecticidal activity (LC50 of
   2.1 and 2.2 mg/mL) when the bio-oil was collected in the 210 degrees C
   condenser from the 300-350 degrees C reactor temperature gases. The 2D
   MFR does concentrate the pesticidal products compared to the 1D MFR and
   thus can reduce the need for further separation steps such as solvent
   extraction.}},

Abstract = {{Plane wave ultrasound imaging (PW) with coherent compounding can improve
   the image quality in terms of contrast, SNR, and lateral resolution
   compared to the conventional PW method. When the number of PW
   transmissions is small, the image quality still need improvement. In
   this paper, we proposed to first estimate the synthetic transmit
   aperture imaging (STA) data with regularized singular-value
   decomposition (RSVD) from the PW RF data, and then used the STA
   reconstruction method to reconstruct ultrasound images. Compared to the
   delay-and-sum, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values of the
   hypo-echoic inclusions in both simulation and experiment was improved
   approximately by 28\% and 19\%, respectively, while the spatial
   resolutions were similar in the proposed method. The objects at the
   central column in the field of view have image metrics comparable to
   those of the full data set (75 PW emissions)}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid MR clutch utilizes a permanent magnet and an electromagnetic
   coil to generate the magnetic field within the clutch pack. The
   existence of nonlinear hysteretic behavior between the input and output
   of the MR clutches needs to be fully investigated in order to perform
   high fidelity force/torque control. In this paper, a closed-loop torque
   control strategy is presented. The feedback signal used in the
   closed-loop control is estimated using an Artificial Neural Network
   (ANN) that uses magnetic field measurements from an embedded Hall sensor
   inside the clutch. The developed neural network is capable of accurately
   predicting the transmitted torque as well as modeling the hysteretic
   relationship between the applied current, internal magnetic field within
   the clutch, and the output torque of the actuator. This technique
   introduces a cost effective force/torque control by eliminating the need
   for conventional torque sensors for providing feedback. The performance
   of the trained neural network and the said control strategy are
   experimentally validated. The results clearly show the ability of a
   hybrid MR clutch in delivering torque tracking control with high
   fidelity required in many human-safe actuation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Wearble mechatronic systems, capable of tracking human motion and
   assisting as needed, are being developed with the goal of increasing the
   quality of life for individuals living with musculoskeletal conditions,
   such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Recently, a control system
   framework has been developed and implemented for EMG-driven control of
   wearable mechatronic elbow braces used for musculoskeletal
   rehabilitation. The intent of this research is to show that the
   framework can be extended to velocity-based control of wearable
   mechatronic systems used in non-rehabilitation applications. As a
   result, the framework was used to develop a control system for the
   actuation of a wearable assistive exoskeleton designed to assist arm
   motion of individuals suffering from DMD. EMG and accelerometer data
   were collected from healthy subjects and used as input to the control
   system during an elbow motion tracking task. The control system commands
   the elbow joint velocity of the assistive exoskeleton to replicate the
   elbow flexion-extension motions completed by the subjects. A root mean
   square error between the position of the subject and the position of the
   exoskeleton's elbow joint of 3.45 +/- 1.72 degrees and a mean standard
   deviation between exoskeleton motion trials of 0.68 degrees were found,
   corresponding to the accuracy and the repeatability of the system,
   respectively. The experimental results show that the framework is
   extensible to velocity-based control of wearable motion-assistance
   systems with an accuracy and repeatability comparable to similar
   systems.}},

   order to counterbalance the formulated task wrench/load of yielding. As
   different geometrical constraints are dictated by the manipulation
   circumstances (e.g. metallic sheet shaping or robotic harvesting), the
   yielding wrench optimization is developed to be not only sufficient for
   yielding the object but also effective in meeting all motion
   restrictions on manipulator. Maximum-shear-stress theory is used for
   yielding analysis of a grasped object. Finite Element Modeling (FEM)

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with design of an adaptive neural network
   (NN)-based controller for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
   nonlinear systems. Unlike most of the previous methods, the MIMO system
   under study is assumed to be in nonaffine form with unknown nonlinear
   functions in which the nonlinearities are completely coupled with system
   states and inputs. The system dynamics are first transformed into an
   affine form via mean value theorem. Then, a direct adaptive control
   strategy is developed by utilizing NNs universal approximation theory.
   In the proposed control scheme, the common assumption on fixing the NN
   hidden weights is removed. Hence, the suggested controller uses full
   approximation capabilities of NNs and is applicable to systems with
   higher degrees of nonlinearity. The tracking error and NN weights errors
   are ensured to be bounded via Lyapunov's direct method. Finally,
   experimental results are performed on a 6 degree of freedom (DoF)
   robotic system to illustrate performance of the proposed control scheme
   when applied to a completely unknown nonlinear system.}},

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive intervention for treating cardiac arrhythmia involves
   ablating sources causing chaotic electrical signals in the atria. In
   order to perform tissue ablation, flexible catheters are steered through
   the vasculature from the insertion point in the groin area to the
   atrium. The outcome of this procedure depends on a number of factors,
   among which is the correct placement of the catheter tip on the target
   tissue. The tip/tissue contact angle is adjusted by using a manual
   prismatic knob on the proximal handle to bend the deflectable distal
   shaft of the catheter. With the goal of developing a robotics-assisted
   catheter manipulation system, in this paper, we focus on the problem of
   controlling the bending of the distal shaft when the proximal handle is
   used within a robotic manipulator. To this end, we apply the black-box
   modeling technique and perform an extensive experimental study to
   characterize the behavior of the catheter. The relationship between
   proximal measurements and the distal tip angle is then determined by
   fitting a model to the experimental dataset. The proposed model is used
   in designing a control system that adjusts the bending of the distal
   shaft merely based on proximal measurements with no feedback from the
   distal end. The performance of the designed control scheme is evaluated
   through experimental implementation. The results show that the control
   system can achieve the desired tip angle with an error less than 2 deg.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a novel approach is proposed for interaction force
   estimation between a non-passive soft tissue in contact with end
   effector of a robot. It is necessary to understand the real behavior of
   living organs of the body in the robotic surgeries to do a better
   operation especially in cases of tele-operation surgery. In addition,
   this interaction force to the surgeon should be fed back in a successful
   surgery which is an important factor. In this paper, a model for a
   non-passive soft tissue is suggested. The model for the beating heart
   tissue that consists of a passive viscoelastic part as well as an active
   part that is considered as an unknown time-varying parameter. Afterward,
   the total interaction force between tissue and robot is estimated, using
   a similar approach to unknown input observers (UIO). The main difference
   between the proposed method and those in the literature is that unlike
   other UIO approaches, the proposed strategy does not use the derivative
   signal in estimating the active part of the interaction force. Finally,
   simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed force estimation approach.}},

Abstract = {{Steerable catheters are key tools in performing cardiac ablation for
   treating arrhythmia (heart rhythm disorder). The catheter is steered
   through the vasculature from the insertion point in the groin area to
   the atrium. Effective contact between the distal ablation tip and
   cardiac tissue is established by rotating the catheter and adjusting the
   flexion in the catheter's distal shaft. The manipulation system of
   unidirectional steerable catheters uses a pull-wire mechanism that
   connects the proximal handle to the distal ablation tip. The mechanical
   design of this tendon-based transmission system satisfies constraints on
   the size and diameter of an ablation catheter, but shows nonlinear
   effects that introduce difficulties in manipulating the flexible distal
   tip. In order to control such flexion, in this paper, the steerable
   catheter is considered as a tendon-sheath-driven mechanism. Since it is
   not possible to affix a force sensor to measure tendon tension at the
   distal tip, transmission characteristics are obtained using force
   measurements at the proximal side and visual cues from the distal end.
   The tendon transmission model is then used to design a control system
   that compensates for the nonlinear effects of the actuation mechanism
   and generates the desired flexion at the distal tip. Performance of the
   proposed controller is evaluated through simulation studies and
   implementation on an experimental setup. The results show that the
   proposed control method significantly improves the performance of the
   system in attaining and tracking the desired tip angle. The results
   presented in this study contribute towards developing position control
   schemes for robotics-assisted catheter manipulation systems.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption is an important design criteria for wireless
   networks, not least because it directly impacts the cost of network
   operation and maintenance. Already, the information and communication
   technology (ICT) industry is being labeled as a substantial contributor
   to the total CO2 emissions on the planet. Moreover, due to the slow
   improvement in battery technology, battery-operated wireless networks
   face a fundamental challenge, since there is an exponential increase in
   the gap between the demand for energy and the offered battery capacity.
   For these reasons, green ICT has become a critical issue world wide.
   This chapter adopts a cross-layer approach for enhancing the energy
   efficiency of wireless ad-hoc networks. Initially, the chapter discusses
   the importance of cross-layered designs for energy-efficient wireless
   networks. Following this, commonly used techniques for modeling energy
   consumption in wireless networks are outlined. Lastly, cross-layer
   designs based on cooperative physical layer network coding and hybrid
   automatic repeat request (HARQ) are presented. In this cross-layered
   design approach, energy-efficient transmission strategies are initially
   proposed for the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers.
   Then, these optimized strategies are utilized as basic building blocks
   for energy-efficient routing at the network layer. All of the
   theoretical results are verified through computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Retroreflectors (RR) represent optical elements whose primary
   functionality is to return to the incident light back to its originating
   source. While inverted cube-corner (ICC) geometry constitutes de facto
   standard in automotive lighting applications, other RR designs exist.
   Among them, right triangular prism (RTP) constitutes a viable
   alternative and therefore, the main intention of the present study was
   to demonstrate a fabrication means other than the ineffective
   conventional pin-bundling technology are possible.
   To address this, a new ultraprecise single point inverted cutting (SPIC)
   technology envisioned as a virtual combination between diamond turning
   and five-axis machining was introduced as a viable manufacturing option
   for the fabrication of the RTP RR arrays. While simulation results seem
   to suggest a slight optical superiority of the RTP RR arrays produced
   through conventional, rather than SPIC approaches, experimental results
   have demonstrated that fabricating RTP RR prototypes is not only
   possible, but it can yield better retroreflective efficiencies when
   compared to state-of-the-art ICC-based automotive retroreflectors.}},

Abstract = {{It is challenging for the base station (BS) to serve multiple cell-edge
   users concurrently with data rate guarantee due to limited power and
   spectrum resource. Using the relay enhances cell-edge user received
   signal strength by short-distance communication in low transmit power.
   Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), a promising spectral efficient
   technology for the 5-th generation network (5G), enables the relay to
   transmit multiple messages to cell-edge users concurrently. In this
   paper, a Collaborative NOMA Assisted Relaying (CNAR) system for 5G is
   proposed with the collaboration of the source-relay (S-R) and
   relay-destination (R-D) NOMA link. The relay decodes its own message
   from the S-R NOMA signal and transmits the remaining part with adjusted
   power to cell-edge users in the R-D link. Then the exact expression of
   system outage probability is derived by analyzing the outage behavior in
   S-R and R-D links separately. To guarantee the data rate, the optimal
   power allocation among NOMA users is provided by minimizing the outage
   probability. To further characterize the system performance, the ergodic
   sum capacity in high SNR regime is approximated from discussions on the
   interference at cell-edge users. Simulation results validate our
   mathematical analysis, and show that the relaying system assisted by
   NOMA achieves lower outage probability and higher sum capacity than
   orthogonal multiple access (OMA).}},

Abstract = {{Registration of longitudinally acquired 3D ultrasound (US) images plays
   an important role in monitoring and quantifying progression/regression
   of carotid atherosclerosis. We introduce an image-based non-rigid

   longitudinal images acquired over several follow-up time points. This
   algorithm minimizes the sum of absolute intensity differences (SAD)
   under a variational optical-flow perspective within a multi-scale
   optimization framework to capture local and global deformations. Outer
   wall and lumen were segmented manually on each image, and the
   performance of the registration algorithm was quantified by Dice
   similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean absolute distance (MAD) of the
   outer wall and lumen surfaces after registration. In this study, images
   for 5 subjects were registered initially by rigid registration, followed
   by the proposed algorithm. Mean DSC generated by the proposed algorithm
   was 79.3 +/- 3.8\% for lumen and 85.9 +/- 4.0\% for outer wall, compared
   to 73.9 +/- 3.4\% and 84.7 +/- 3.2\% generated by rigid registration.
   Mean MAD of 0.46 +/- 0.08mm and 0.52 +/- 0.13mm were generated for lumen
   and outer wall respectively by the proposed algorithm, compared to 0.55

Abstract = {{To achieve extremely high spectral efficiency in the 5-th generation
   (5G) communication network, the combination of massive multiple input
   multiple output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
   technologies becomes a promising solution. However, due to limited radio
   frequency (RF) chains and channel condition variation, it is important
   to develop efficient antenna selection and user scheduling algorithms in
   complex MIMO-NOMA system. In this paper, efficient antenna selection and
   user scheduling algorithms are investigated to maximize the sum rate in
   two MIMO-NOMA scenarios. In the first simple single-band two-user
   scenario, the proposed antenna selection algorithm achieves higher
   search efficiency by limiting the candidate antennas to those are
   beneficial to the relevant users. In the multi-band multi-user scenario,
   the proposed joint antenna and user (AU) contribution algorithm
   considers the contribution of each antenna's and user's channel gain to
   total channel gain jointly. Numerical results show that proposed antenna
   selection algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, and joint AU
   contribution algorithm achieves similar performance to existing methods
   with reduced complexity.}},

   system where communication takes place in the presence of multiple
   non-colluding eavesdroppers. The proposed scheme is based on a recent
   approach to generate artificial noise in which transmitter of each hop
   allocates a portion of its power for generating an intentional
   interference at the eavesdroppers. Under the assumption that the
   transmitters can only use limited transmit power, a power allocation
   strategy has been developed which maximizes the secrecy capacity by
   optimally distributing the power between the original signal and the
   artificial noise. Since the optimal solution depends on the channel
   state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers, which is difficult to
   obtain in practice, a sub-optimal solution is also presented in which
   the CSI of the eavesdroppers is not needed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper continues our computer studies using virtual systems to
   examine the behavior of subsystems in a system as a model of the
   behavior of social systems made up of individuals. The subsystems in our
   virtual system are global cellular automata (GCAs) as suggested by
   Wolfram {[}1], placed at the vertices of a GCA network (GCAN) as
   developed by Chandler {[}2]. The behavioral results are based on the
   four classes of cellular automata output patterns as identified by
   Wolfram {[}3] and are measured by the fraction of ordered GCAs in a
   GCAN.
   7Our objective has been to show how our theory of social dynamics
   explains this behavior. That theory states that the behavior of a social
   system and of our virtual systems model depends upon the external
   environment of the system defined as centrality and the internal
   structure of the system defined as the four parameters of
   differentiation, namely, diversity, connectedness, interdependence, and
   adaptability of the subsystems in the system. In previous papers we have
   shown the effect of diversity and connectedness. In this paper we show
   that behavior becomes more ordered and focused as interdependence and
   adaptability increase and as centrality decreases.}},

Abstract = {{Bandwidth and power are the major radio resources of a wireless
   communication system. Designing an efficient wireless communication
   system requires trade-off between these resources. In this context,
   definitions of radio resource efficiencies are given in terms of
   bandwidth efficiency, bit/s/Hz, and power efficiency, bit/Thermal Noise
   Energy Unit, for an arbitrary communication system. These efficiencies
   are analyzed and discussed over Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channels
   for M-QAM. Investigation shows that the efficiency metrics are degraded
   by the channel effects. Also, it is evident that each M-QAM level
   attains highest power efficiency in a specific range of signal to noise
   ratio (SNR). Thus, an adaptive transmission technique is proposed and
   analyzed for enhancing resource efficiencies based on number of levels
   in M-QAM to achieve maximum power efficiency in specific SNR regions. It
   is shown that efficiency metrics can be significantly improved by using
   the proposed technique for a broad range of signal to noise ratio, even
   when fading is severe.}},

   mmWave frequency bands are presented and then used in the evaluation of
   green efficiency metrics, maximum achievable capacity, bits/s, and power
   efficiency, bits/s/Thermal Noise Energy Unit. These efficiency indexes
   are investigated and illustrated using Monte Carlo simulation as a
   function of signal to noise ratio, channel model parameters and
   transmitter-receiver separation distance. The results show that the
   mmWave bands provide better channel capacity; however, less energy

Abstract = {{An easy, simple and selective colorimetric method for aluminum ions has
   been developed using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid functionalized gold
   nanoparticles (MUA-AuNPs). The MUA-AuNPs could be induced to aggregate
   in the presence of Al3+ ions according to the chelation effect between
   the carboxyl group and Al3+, and a color change from red to purple with
   increasing Al3+ ion concentration was observed. The plasmon absorbance
   of the MUA-AuNPs allows the quantitative detection of Al3+ ions. A
   sensitive linear correlation existed between the ratio of absorbance at
   650 nm to that at 520 nm and the Al3+ ion concentration ranging from
   10(-6) M to 10(-4) M. The detection limit was 5.7 x 10(-7) M, which is
   below the maximum recommended contamination level of the World Health
   Organization (WHO) for the aluminum content (7.4 mu M) in drinking
   water. The MUA-AuNPs chelated with Al3+ showed excellent selectivity in
   the presence of EDTA compared to other metal ions (Ag+, Ba2+, Ca2+,
   Cd2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+ and Zn2+). The
   proposed method can offer the additional advantage of the efficient
   determination of Al3+ ions in drinking water, and the recovery was in
   the range of 98.5-101.6\% with a relative standard deviation below 2\%.}},

Title = {{Synthesis, self-assembly, and immunological activity of
   alpha-galactose-functionalized dendron-lipid amphiphiles}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{40}},
Pages = {{17694-17704}},
Abstract = {{Nanoassemblies presenting multivalent displays of biologically active
   carbohydrates are of significant interest for a wide array of biomedical
   applications ranging from drug delivery to immunotherapy. In this study,
   glycodendron-lipid hybrids were developed as a new and tunable class of
   dendritic amphiphiles. A modular synthesis was used to prepare
   dendron-lipid hybrids comprising distearylglycerol and 0 through 4th
   generation polyester dendrons with peripheral protected amines.
   Following deprotection of the amines, an isothiocyanate derivative of
   C-linked alpha-galactose (alpha-Gal) was conjugated to the dendron
   peripheries, affording amphiphiles with 1 to 16 alpha-Gal moieties.
   Self-assembly in water through a solvent exchange process resulted in
   vesicles for the 0 through 2nd generation systems and micelles for the
   3rd and 4th generation systems. The critical aggregation concentrations
   decreased with increasing dendron generation, suggesting that the
   effects of increasing molar mass dominated over the effects of
   increasing the hydrophilic weight fraction. The binding of the
   assemblies to Griffonia simplicifolia Lectin I (GSL 1), a protein with
   specificity for alpha-Gal was studied by quantifying the binding of
   fluorescently labeled assemblies to GSL 1-coated beads. It was found
   that binding was enhanced for amphiphiles containing higher generation
   dendrons. Despite their substantial structural differences with the
   natural ligands for the CD1d receptor, the glycodendron-lipid hybrids
   were capable of stimulating invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a
   class of innate-like T cells that recognize lipid and glycolipid
   antigens presented by CD1d and that are implicated in a wide range of
   diseases and conditions including but not limited to infectious
   diseases, diabetes and cancer.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{113-129}},
Abstract = {{Scheduling problems have been thoroughly explored by the research
   community, but they acquire challenging characteristics in grid
   computing systems. In this context, it is important to have a scheduling
   strategy that can make efficient use of the available grid resources.
   This article focuses on the application of the particle swarm
   optimisation (PSO) meta-heuristic to the scheduling of independent
   users' jobs on grids. It is shown that the PSO method can achieve
   satisfactory results in simple problem instances, yet it has a tendency
   to stagnate around local minima in high-dimensional problems. Therefore,
   this research also proposes a novel hybrid particle swarm
   optimisation-genetic algorithm (H\_PSO) method that aims to increase
   swarm diversity when a stagnation condition is detected. This new method
   is evaluated and compared with other heuristics and PSO formulations;
   the comparison shows that H\_PSO can successfully improve the scheduling
   solution.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a non-aqueous sol-gel process was utilized to prepare
   novel class II hybrid biomaterials based on functionalized
   polycaprolactone (PCL) diol and borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) as
   potential scaffold material for bone tissue engineering applications.
   PCL diol was first functionalized by reacting with (3-glycidoxypropyl)
   trimethoxysilane. The functionalized PCL (PCL-Si) was condensed with
   trimethyl borate, tetraethyl orthosilicate and triethyl phosphate via
   non-aqueous sol-gel reactions to form covalently bonded
   organic-inorganic networks. FTIR, TGA, XRD, and solid state Si-29 CP-MAS
   NMR analyses revealed that the hybrid materials were successfully
   prepared. Furthermore, the hybrids were amorphous and transparent up to
   60 wt\% of PCL-Si content. Specifically, the organic-inorganic networks
   had a dominant T-3 network since Si-C bond from PCL-Si is covalently
   bonded with the inorganic glass network and resulted in a class II
   hybrid. EDX and XPS studies showed uniform distribution of the various
   elements making up the hybrid materials. When incubated with simulated
   body fluids (SBF), the present hybrid materials were able to stimulate
   the deposition of crystalline hydroxyapatite. This study demonstrated,
   for the first time, the chemical reactivity of calcium-free BPSG and
   PCL-BPSG hybrids and their ability to deposit hydroxyapatite when
   incubated in SBF. The present study is also the first to incorporate
   B2O3 as a glass component in class II organic-inorganic hybrid
   biomaterials.}},

   probed by Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{80}},
Abstract = {{Anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes synthesized via
   electrochemical anodization were studied under high pressure up to 31
   GPa. The structural transformations were characterized by in situ Raman
   spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Raman measurements
   suggest that anatase TiO2 nanotubes transform to an amorphous phase upon
   compression to 17.7 GPa and remain mostly amorphous upon recovery but
   with minor alpha-PbO2 and anatase phases as a mixture. In contrast,
   direct anatase to baddeleyite phase transition was unambiguously
   observed at similar to 14 GPa in the diffraction measurements.
   Structural refinement allows the quantitative analysis of the transition
   sequence and reveals that the recovered phase is mostly crystalline
   alpha-PbO2. This discrepancy can be attributed to the special surface
   and interfacial structure associated with the tube morphology. Moreover,
   the compression behavior such as the compressibility of both anatase and
   baddeleyite phases of TiO2 nanotubes was examined in parallel with other
   nanostructured TiO2 materials. Our analysis shows that morphology plays
   a more prominent role than size in affecting the high pressure behaviors
   of 1D TiO2 nanomaterials compared to nanoparticles, and that the
   interplay of multiple factors such as morphology, size, interfacial
   structures, as well as lattice defects can substantially influence the
   phase stability and thus the transformation sequence.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Engineered magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) possess unique
   properties and hold great potential in biomedicine and clinical
   applications. With their magnetic properties and their ability to work
   at cellular and molecular level, MNP have been applied both in-vitro and
   in-vivo in targeted drug delivery and imaging. Focusing on Iron Oxide
   Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs), this paper elaborates on the
   recent advances in development of hybrid polymeric-magnetic
   nanoparticles. Their main applications in drug delivery include
   Chemotherapeutics, Hyperthermia treatment, Radio-therapeutics, Gene
   delivary, and Biotheraputics. Physiochemical properties such as size,
   shape, surface and magnetic properties are key factors in determining
   their behavior. Additionally tailoring SPIONs surface is often vital for
   desired cell targetting and improved efficiency. Polymer coating is
   specifically reviewed with brief discussion of SPIONs administration
   routes. Commonly used drug release models for describing release
   mechanisms and the nanotoxicity aspects are also discussed. Methods:
   This review focus on superparamagnetic nanoparticles coated with
   different types of polymers starting with the key physiochemical
   features that dominate their behavior. The importance of surface
   modification is addressed. Subsequently, the major classes of polymer
   modified iron oxide nanoparticles is demonstrated according to their
   clinical use and application. Clinically approved nanoparticles are then
   addressed and the different routes of administration are mentioned.
   Lastly, mathematical models of drug release profile of the common used
   nanoparticles are addressed. Results: MNPs emerging in recent medicine
   are remarkable for both imaging and therapeutics, particularly, as drug
   carriers for their great potential in targeted delivery and cancer
   treatment. Targeting ability and biocompatibility can be improved though
   surface coating which provides a mean to alter the surface features
   including physical characteristics and chemical functionality. The use
   of biocompatible polymers can prevent aggregation, increase colloidal
   stability, evades nanoparticles uptake by RES, and can provide a surface
   for conjugation of targeting ligands such as peptide and biomolecules
   with high affinity to target cells. Conclusion: Great efforts to bring
   MNPs from lab testing stage to clinic are needed to understand their
   physicochemical properties and how they behave in vivo, which resulted
   in few of them to exist in the market today. Although magnetic
   nanoparticles have not yet fully reached their optimal safety and
   efficiency due to the challenges they face in vivo, their shortcomings
   can be overcome through improvement of magnetic-targeted carrier by
   pre-clinical trials and continuous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Modified natural chabazites functionalized with silver-copper were used
   as an additive to develop antimicrobial powder coated surfaces. Two
   chabazites (named as LBC and LBN) were modified to enhance the
   ion-exchange properties by conditioning with sodium salt. The
   cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of those zeolites was improved from 3.31
   meq. g(-1) and 3.46 meq. g(-1) to 3.77 meq. g(-1) and 4.09 meq. g(-1)
   respectively and they were used to produce silver-copper modified
   zeolites. In order to achieve durable and efficient antimicrobial
   additives, different combinations of these ions were used by varying the
   reaction time. These additives were used with a polyester resin system
   to produce ultrafine powder coated surfaces. Silver was utilized as an
   antimicrobial agent, whereas copper was used to prevent the reduction of
   silver during the coating process. All materials including the raw,
   modified and functionalized zeolites were characterized using XRD and
   TGA to observe the effect of treatment. ICP-OES was used for elemental
   analysis at every experimental stage. Color analysis proved that copper
   prevents silver from being reduced and maintains the color of the coated
   surface, which is comparable to the control surface. These coated
   surfaces have shown homogeneous antibacterial properties with excellent
   durability against E. coli for extended periods. Cell toxicity was
   evident from the LDH analysis of the fresh and used antimicrobial
   surfaces.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive dosimetric planning comparison for early-stage, non-small
   cell lung cancer with SABR: fixed-beam IMRT versus VMAT versus
   TomoTherapy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is emerging as a leading
   technology in treating early-stage, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
   with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). However, two other
   modalities capable of delivering intensity-modulated radiation therapy
   (IMRT) include fixed-beam and helical TomoTherapy (HT). This study aims
   to provide an extensive dosimetric comparison among these various IMRT
   techniques for treating early-stage NSCLC with SABR. Ten early-stage
   NSCLC patients were retrospectively optimized using three fixed-beam
   techniques via nine to eleven beams (high and low modulation
   step-and-shoot (SS), and sliding window (SW)), two VMAT techniques via
   two partial arcs (SmartArc (SA) and RapidArc (RA)), and three HT
   techniques via three different fan beam widths (1 cm, 2.5 cm, and 5 cm)
   for 80 plans total. Fixed-beam and VMAT plans were generated using
   flattening filter-free beams. SS and SA, HT treatment plans, and SW and
   RA were optimized using Pinnacle v9.1, Tomoplan v.3.1.1, and Eclipse
   (Acuros XB v11.3 algorithm), respectively. Dose-volume histogram
   statistics, dose conformality, and treatment delivery efficiency were
   analyzed. VMAT treatment plans achieved significantly lower values for
   contralateral lung V-5Gy (p <= 0.05) compared to the HT plans, and
   significantly lower mean lung dose (p < 0.006) compared to HT 5 cm
   treatment plans. In the comparison between the VMAT techniques, a
   significant reduction in the total monitor units (p = 0.05) was found in
   the SA plans, while a significant decrease was observed in the dose
   falloff parameter, D-2cm, (p = 0.05), for the RA treatments. The maximum
   cord dose was significantly reduced (p = 0.017) in grouped RA\&SA plans
   compared to SS. Estimated treatment time was significantly higher for HT
   and fixed-beam plans compared to RA\&SA (p < 0.001). Although, a
   significant difference was not observed in the RA vs. SA (p = 0.393).
   RA\&SA outperformed HT in all parameters measured. Despite an increase
   in dose to the heart and bronchus, this study demonstrates that VMAT is
   dosimetrically advantageous in treating early-stage NSCLC with SABR
   compared to fixed-beam, while providing significantly shorter treatment
   times.}},

Abstract = {{Indoleamine dioxygenase 2 (IDO2) is a newly discovered enzyme that
   contributes to tumor immune escape. Our previous studies demonstrated
   that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated IDO2 knock-down induces

   (GNRs) are excellent siRNA nanocarriers as well as photothermal therapy
   agents, with potential to augment siRNA efficacy and target specificity.
   In this study, we developed a novel nanostructure of
   GNRs-MUA-PEI/siIDO2-FA for targeted therapy of melanoma. Firstly, we
   demonstrated that these new nanostructures possess excellent
   biocompatibility, as well as efficiently and specifically deliver RNA to
   melanoma cells. Secondly, IDO2 knockdown significantly enhanced the
   photothermal therapeutic efficacy of GNRs as evidenced by inducing
   increased tumor cell apoptosis in vitro as well as inhibiting the growth
   of tumors in vivo under low laser power density. Finally, we firstly
   demonstrated that GNRs-MUA-PEI/siIDO2-FA exerts synergistic effects on

Abstract = {{The study of the mechanical characteristics of tremor for patients
   suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) is an important first step to
   the design of mechanical tremor suppression orthoses. So far,
   researchers have interpreted tremor characteristics in both the time and
   the frequency domains. A number of tremor suppression devices have been
   developed on the basis of these interpretations of tremor. However, most
   of the studies and devices have only focused on tremor at the wrist and
   elbow, and have neglected finger tremor despite the huge impact that it
   has on a patient's daily life. The aim of the present study was to
   determine the characteristics of finger tremor and wrist tremor, which
   may be used to provide a reference for the design of tremor suppression
   devices for the hand. Tremor magnitudes were represented in the forms of
   linear acceleration, angular velocity and angular displacement. The
   results show that PD tremors from all joints have a common
   multiple-frequency pattern and that the second harmonic (6.9-11.5 Hz)
   makes a large contribution to the tremor that cannot be neglected.}},

   subjects, has been quantified to support improvement of future devices
   and control systems. The mean accuracy, represented by the root mean
   square error in position between the subject and brace, and the
   repeatability, represented by the mean standard deviation between brace
   trials, was found to be 1.22 +/- 0.28 degrees and 0.10 degrees,
   respectively. As no targets exist in the literature for these
   quantities, this research provides a baseline measurement of the
   accuracy and repeatability of controlling a wearable mechatronic elbow
   brace during an elbow tracking task.}},

Abstract = {{Soft-lithography techniques can be used to fabricate mechanically
   flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical waveguide sheets that act
   as large area light collectors (concentrators) and illuminators
   (diffusers). The performance and efficiency of these optical sheets is
   determined by the position and geometry of micro-optical features
   embedded in the sheet or imprinted on its surface, thickness and shape
   of the waveguide, core and cladding refractive indices, and wavelength
   of the incident light source. The critical design-for-manufacturability
   parameters are discussed and a scalable method of fabricating
   multi-layered PDMS optical waveguides is introduced. To illustrate the
   concepts a prototype waveguide sheet that acts a combined light
   collector and illumination panel is fabricated and tested. The region of
   the waveguide sheet that acts as the light collector consists of two
   superimposed PDMS layers with slightly different indices of refraction.
   The top layer is patterned with micro-lenses that focus the incident
   light rays onto the micro-wedge features that act as reflectors on the
   bottom of the second layer and, due to total internal reflection,
   redirect the light rays to the light diffuser region of the waveguide
   sheet. The bottom face of the diffuser PDMS layer is patterned with
   angled triangular wedge micro-features that project the light out of the
   waveguide sheet forming an illuminating pattern. The proposed
   fabrication technique utilizes precision machined polymethylmethacrylate
   (PMMA) moulds with negative patterned PDMS inserts that transfer the
   desired micro-optical features onto the moulded waveguide.}},

Abstract = {{The controlled guidance of light rays through a mechanically flexible
   large area polymer optical waveguide sheet is investigated using Zemax
   OpticStudio software. The geometry and spatial distribution of
   micro-optical features patterned on the waveguide sheet determines
   whether the surface acts as a light concentrator or diffuser. To
   illustrate the concept, incident light is collected over a large center
   area and then transmitted to the border where it is emitted through an
   illumination window covered by an array of photo-cells. The efficiencies
   of the collector and illuminating regions of the hybrid PDMS
   collector-diffuser waveguide sheet are discussed. Initial analysis of
   the waveguide design demonstrates an ideal efficiency of over 90\% for
   the concentrating region of the waveguide and over 80\% efficiency for
   the diffusing region of the waveguide. The Zemax simulation of the ideal
   design of the hybrid concentrator-diffuser waveguide exhibited an
   efficiency of up to 75\%. However this efficiency significantly
   decreased when examining the waveguide's performance as a flexible
   sheet. The necessary design modifications, to mitigate these losses in
   efficiency, are discussed, and future work will focus on analyzing and
   optimizing the waveguide design for performance as a fully flexible
   concentrator-diffuser membrane.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new, lighter, version of the highly accurate Moleko,
   Allnatt and Allnatt formalism for describing both tracer (self) and
   collective diffusion kinetics in multicomponent random alloys is
   presented. Verification of the resulting expressions is performed by
   means of kinetic Monte Carlo simulation. The accuracy of the new
   formalism is much higher than that of the combined Manning and
   Holdsworth and Elliott formalism discussed recently. Using this
   formalism the possible range of the tracer diffusion ratio of the
   highest to the lowest atomic component is examined for equiatomic (or
   near equiatomic) binary, ternary, quaternary and quinary alloys. It is
   shown that in the random alloy model, the correlation effect is the
   highest with a reduction of the fastest tracer diffusion by 40-55\%,
   when moving from two pure metals to their equiatomic binary alloy. By
   adding the third component (with an intermediate mobility) this effect
   can be further increased with a possible total reduction of the fastest
   tracer diffusion by up to 70\% (depending on the combinations of
   mobilities), while adding the fourth component brings this reduction up
   to 80\% and with a possible maximum of up to 85\% reduction for the
   5-component alloy (again depending on the combinations of mobilities).
   But the slowest diffusing components are not affected by this. This
   suggests that kinetics arguments alone are not enough for explaining the
   sluggish diffusion observed of all atomic components in (equiatomic)
   high-entropy alloys.}},

Abstract = {{Layered-Division-Multiplexing (LDM) technology has been shown to provide
   significant performance improvent for digital TV (DTV) broadcasting
   systems to simultaneously deliver a robust mobile TV service and one or
   more high-throughput fixed services in the same 6 MHz TV channel. So
   far, the focus of LDM for future DTV systems has been put on delivering
   mixed mobile and fixed services since this is one of the most
   interesting scenarios for broadcasters. However, the potential of using
   LDM to deliver multiple mobile services in the different layers has not
   been investigated and compared to their Time-Division-Multiplexing and
   Frequency-Division-Multiplexing (TDM/FDM) counterparts. In addition, for
   the typical mixed-service delivery mode, the fixed services delivered in
   the lower-layer (LL) are also available to mobile receivers having
   favorable reception conditions. It would be interesting to identify the
   actual availability of these services to different type of mobile
   receivers. In this paper, we first investigate the performance of using
   both layers of an LDM system to deliver multiple mobile services. Next,
   we investigate the availability of the high-throughput fixed services
   delivered in the LDM-LL to mobile receivers, and a potential technology
   to make these services more accessible.}},

   Large interfacial polarizations, nanostructure, and dopant levels are

Abstract = {{The remarkable growth in digital data is changing what and how the
   defense against the unknown will take place. Big data is a technical
   term used today to represent this massive growth of digital data that's
   being created from many sources. Organizations have turned their
   attentions to the deployment of Big Data analytics to gain valuable
   insights that benefit their businesses within protected and secure
   environments. Hence, network security protocols, especially
   authentication protocols, are being re-designed to protect and to
   deliver the real benefits of this data growth. Contrary to the
   traditional perspective, in which researchers are focusing on
   identifying users' identity to protect Big Data-based environments, we
   have an opposite perspective that the Big Data itself would be the fuel
   for the next generation authentication. In other word, the main goal of
   this work is to propose a new framework for user authentication that
   leverages Big Data analytics. The core idea of this framework is to find
   out unique patterns of the users' dynamic behaviors. The proposed
   framework comprised of three main components. Data Security-based
   Analytics (DSA); describing the best utilization of the high velocity
   data streams, which is capable for distinguishing data that has
   security/identification potentials. Human dynamics measure engine; that
   develops an ambitious transformation from the Big Data characteristics
   into the relevant human dynamics measures. Big data-driven
   authentication service; describes the required engines to design
   software as a service-based authentication model. Our investigation
   shows that this new approach will help create a highly distributed
   authentication model, minimizing the storage of secrets, and lesser
   secret management overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Pulmonary ventilation may be visualized and measured using
   hyperpolarized He-3 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while emphysema and
   its distribution can be quantified using thoracic computed tomography
   (CT). Our objective was to phenotype ex-smokers with COPD based on the
   apical-to-basal distribution of ventilation abnormalities and emphysema
   to better understand how these phenotypes change regionally as COPD
   progresses. We evaluated 100 COPD ex-smokers who provided written
   informed consent and underwent spirometry, CT and He-3 MRI. He-3 MRI
   ventilation imaging was used to quantify the ventilation defect percent
   (VDP) for whole-lung and individual lung lobes. Regional VDP was used to
   generate the apical-lung (AL)-to-basal-lung (BL) difference (Delta VDP);
   a positive Delta VDP indicated AL-predominant and negative Delta VDP
   indicated BL-predominant ventilation defects. Emphysema was quantified
   using the relative-area-of-the-lung <=-950HU (RA(950)) of the CT density
   histogram for whole-lung and individual lung lobes. The AL-to-BL RA(950)
   difference (Delta RA(950)) was generated with a positive Delta RA(950)
   indicating AL-predominant emphysema and a negative Delta RA(950)
   indicating BL-predominant emphysema. Seventy-two exsmokers reported
   BL-predominant MRI ventilation defects and 71 reported AL-predominant CT
   emphysema. BL-predominant ventilation defects (AL/BL: GOLD I =
   18\%/82\%, GOLD II = 24\%/76\%) and AL-predominant emphysema (AL/BL:
   GOLD I = 84\%/16\%, GOLD II = 72\%/28\%) were the major phenotypes in
   mild-moderate COPD. In severe COPD there was a more uniform distribution
   for ventilation defects (AL/BL: GOLD III = 40\%/60\%, GOLD IV =
   43\%/57\%) and emphysema (AL/BL: GOLD III = 64\%/36\%, GOLD IV =
   43\%/57\%). Basal-lung ventilation defects predominated in mild-moderate
   GOLD grades, and a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation defects
   was observed in more advanced grade COPD; these differences suggest that
   over time, regional ventilation abnormalities become more homogenously
   distributed during disease progression.}},

Title = {{Multifunctional microbeads for drug delivery in TACE}},
Journal = {{EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1289-1300}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard
   treatment for unresectable intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma
   (HCC). Microbeads used to embolize tumor vasculature have recently been
   designed to deliver a therapeutic drug to the tumor site. Increasing the
   functionality of microbeads for TACE has the potential to improve
   therapy by accomplishing multiple, beneficial tasks with one system.
   Areas covered: Microbead functions beyond embolization and drug delivery
   that could be highly advantageous include detection and tracking with
   imaging, targeting, degradation, and the delivery of multiple
   therapeutics or combination therapies. This review covers the concepts
   of TACE for treatment of HCC, the need for controlled delivery systems
   and the use of drug-eluting beads. Shortcomings of the current
   technology and the current approaches to improve materials used as
   embolic microbeads are discussed. Relevant studies aimed to enhance
   microbead visibility, targetability, degradability, and the use of
   multiple therapeutics or combination therapies are reviewed.
   Expert opinion: The incorporation of nanoparticles that possess
   desirable properties into the microbead matrix is a suitable method of
   creating multifunctional microbeads. The development of these
   `nano-on-micro' systems is a promising approach to improve TACE therapy
   and may lead to improved treatment.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{773-794}},
Abstract = {{Structures and infrastructure are subject to spatial varying seismic
   ground motions. The commonly available empirical lagged coherency models
   are for the record components along the same orientation at spatially
   distributed recording stations; the lagged coherency for record
   components in two orthogonal horizontal directions was reported
   recently. It appears that the lagged coherency between a vertical and a
   horizontal record component has not been systematically investigated.
   The assessment of the lagged coherency among tri-directional ground
   motion components at a single or multiple recording stations is
   presented in this study using ground motion records from dense arrays
   (i.e., LSST and SMART-1 arrays) in Taiwan. The results indicate that the
   lagged coherency between vertical record components at different
   recording stations is systematically lower than that between horizontal
   record components in the same direction; and as a first-order
   approximation the lagged coherency between any two orthogonal record
   component components can be modeled as a linear function of frequency
   and is insensitive to separation between the recording stations. A
   simple-to-use lagged coherency model is suggested and illustrated for
   simulating array of tri-directional ground motions.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional reconstruction of ultrasound volumes from tracked 2D
   images is a cost effective intraoperative 3D imaging strategy. The
   reconstructed volumes can be visualized in-situ if the probe is tracked
   with respect to the laparoscopic camera during laparoscopic
   thoraco-abdominal interventions. To this end, efficient, image-based
   intrinsic pose tracking methods are preferred over well-established
   extrinsic tracking methods primarily due to cost effectiveness and
   reduced work-flow overheads. However, the potential of these intrinsic
   tracking methods as means of tracking in freehand 3D ultrasound
   reconstruction has not been investigated to-date. In this paper, we
   demonstrate that a recently proposed image-based, robust pose tracking
   method can be used to achieve high quality reconstructions. By imaging a
   tissue-mimicking phantom with structures resembling anatomical targets,
   we demonstrate that the 3D US volumes resulted from this method are
   geometrically accurate. Both qualitative and quantitative results of the
   experiments are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent advances in image-guided interventions, lung cancer
   External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) is still very challenging due to
   respiration induced tumor motion. Among various proposed methods of
   tumor motion compensation, real-time tumor tracking is known to be one
   of the most effective solutions as it allows for maximum normal tissue
   sparing, less overall radiation exposure and a shorter treatment
   session. As such, we propose a biomechanics-based real-time tumor
   tracking method for effective lung cancer radiotherapy. In the proposed
   algorithm, the required boundary conditions for the lung Finite Element
   model, including diaphragm motion, are obtained using the chest surface
   motion as a surrogate signal. The primary objective of this paper is to
   demonstrate the feasibility of developing a function which is capable of
   inputting the chest surface motion data and outputting the diaphragm
   motion in real-time. For this purpose, after quantifying the diaphragm
   motion with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model, correlation
   coefficient between the model parameters of diaphragm motion and chest
   motion data was obtained through Partial Least Squares Regression
   (PLSR). Preliminary results obtained in this study indicate that the PCA
   coefficients representing the diaphragm motion can be obtained through
   chest surface motion tracking with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel method for estimating target registration error (TRE)
   in point-to-line registration. We develop a spatial stiffness model of
   the registration problem and derive the stiffness matrix of the model
   which leads to an analytic expression for predicting the
   root-mean-square (RMS) TRE. Under the assumption of isotropic
   localization noise, we show that the stiffness matrix for line-based
   registration is equal to the difference of the stiffness matrices for
   fiducial registration and surface-based registration. The expression for
   TRE is validated in the context of freehand ultrasound calibration
   performed using a tracked line fiducial as a calibration phantom.
   Measurements taken during calibration of a tracked linear ultrasound
   probe were used in simulations to assess TRE of point-to-line
   registration and the results were compared to the values predicted by
   the analytic expression. The difference between predicted and simulated
   RMS TRE magnitude for targets near the centroid of the registration
   points was less than 5 \% of the simulated magnitude when using more
   than 6 registration points. The difference between predicted and
   simulated RMS TRE magnitude for targets over the entire ultrasound image
   was almost always less than 10 \% of the simulated magnitude when using
   more than 10 registration points. TRE magnitude was minimized near the
   centroid of the registration points and the isocontours of TRE were
   elliptic in shape.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional surgical methods are effective for treating lung tumors;
   however, they impose high trauma and pain to patients. Minimally
   invasive surgery is a safer alternative as smaller incisions are
   required to reach the lung; however, it is challenging due to inadequate
   intraoperative tumor localization. To address this issue, a mechatronic
   palpation device was developed that incorporates tactile and ultrasound
   sensors capable of acquiring surface and cross-sectional images of
   palpated tissue. Initial work focused on tactile image segmentation and
   fusion of position-tracked tactile images, resulting in a reconstruction
   of the palpated surface to compute the spatial locations of underlying
   tumors. This paper presents a computational model capable of analyzing
   orthogonally-paired tactile and ultrasound images to compute the surface
   circumference and depth margins of a tumor. The framework also
   integrates an error compensation technique and an algebraic model to
   align all of the image pairs and to estimate the tumor depths within the
   tracked thickness of a palpated tissue. For validation, an ex vivo
   experimental study was conducted involving the complete palpation of 11
   porcine liver tissues injected with iodine-agar tumors of varying sizes
   and shapes. The resulting tactile and ultrasound images were then
   processed using the proposed model to compute the tumor margins and
   compare them to fluoroscopy based physical measurements. The results
   show a good negative correlation (r = -0.783, p = 0.004) between the
   tumor surface margins and a good positive correlation (r = 0.743, p =
   0.009) between the tumor depth margins.}},

Abstract = {{To prevent contact lens from biofouling and to minimize UV exposure to
   human eyes, a nanocomposite-based coating made of silver (Ag)
   nanoparticles and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is deposited on synthetic
   silicone hydrogels through matrix assisted pulsed laser evaporation
   (MAPLE) with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm. The average diameter of Ag
   NPs that have undergone the MAPLE process for 60 min is 11.61 +/- 3.58
   nm. The thickness of the Ag-PVP nanocomposite coating with a deposition
   time of 60 min is around 930 +/- 15 nm. Our results demonstrate that the
   oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogel with a nanocomposite coating is
   similar to that of commercialized contact lenses; over 60\% of UV light
   in the range of 300-450 nm can be blocked. Moreover, the silicone
   hydrogel with the nanocomposite coating can reduce over 65.4 +/- 1.6\%
   of protein (human lysozyme) absorption as compared to silicone
   hydrogel-based contact lens, and kill all cultured bacteria in 8 hours.
   This research work demonstrates a new way to deposit biocompatible
   nanocomposite coatings on silicone hydrogels used as contact lens to

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{4872-4883}},
Abstract = {{The development of new approaches to antibacterial surfaces is of
   growing interest to combat the spread of harmful bacterial infections.
   Relative to polyammoniums, polyphosphoniums can exhibit enhanced
   chemical and thermal stability, but have not yet been widely explored
   for the preparation of antibacterial surfaces. In this work,
   polyphosphoniums of varying chain lengths were synthesized by reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization of 4-vinylbenzyl
   derivatives of triethyl, tributyl, and trioctylphosphonium. These
   polyphosphoniums were then incorporated into semi-interpenetrating
   networks (SIPNs) based on tetra(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (TEGDA) via
   a UV light-initiated curing process. Measurements of cure percentage,
   gel content, water contact angle, and surface charge density suggested
   that all polyphosphoniums were well integrated into the network with the
   exception of one formulation. The results also suggested that the
   triethylphosphonium system tended to undergo surface reversion. Even at
   relatively low loadings of 0.1 to 10 wt\% of polyphosphonium, the
   surfaces exhibited high accessible surface charge. Antibacterial testing
   revealed high activity against S. aureus for the triethyl and
   tributylphosphonium SIPNs and lower activity for the trioctyl systems.
   On the other hand, antibacterial activity against E. coli increased with
   increasing alkyl chain length. This can likely be attributed to
   differences in the compositions of the membranes of Gram-positive versus
   Gram-negative bacteria. The results also indicated that while killed
   bacteria tended to adsorb to the surface of the triethylphosphonium
   system, the more hydrophobic surfaces were more effective at preventing
   bacterial adsorption.}},

Abstract = {{With nanotechnology becoming an increasingly important field in
   contemporary science, there is a growing demand for a better
   understanding of energy exchange on the nanoscale. Techniques, such as
   time-resolved laser-induced incandescence, for example, require accurate
   models of gas-surface interaction to correctly predict nanoparticle
   characteristics. The present work uses molecular dynamics to define the
   thermal accommodation coefficient of various gases on iron surfaces. A
   more in depth analysis examines the scattering distributions from the
   surfaces and examines how well existing scattering kernels and classical
   theories can represent these distributions. The molecular
   dynamics-derived values are also compared to recent experimental
   time-resolved laser-induced incandescence studies aimed at evaluating
   the thermal accommodation coefficient across a range of surface-gas

Pages = {{639-670}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to determine the
   thermo-gravitational convective state of a non-Fourier fluid layer of
   the single-phase-lagging type, heated from below. Unlike existing
   methodologies, the spectral modes are not imposed arbitrarily. They are
   systematically identified by expanding the spectral coefficients in
   terms of the relative departure in the post-critical Rayleigh number
   (perturbation parameter). The number and type of modes is determined to
   each order in the expansion. Non-Fourier effects become important
   whenever the relaxation time (delay in the response of the heat flux
   with respect to the temperature gradient) is of the same order of
   magnitude as process time.
   Design/methodology/approach - In the spectral method the flow and
   temperature fields are expanded periodically along the layer and
   orthonormal shape functions are used in the transverse direction. A
   perturbation approach is developed to solve the nonlinear spectral
   system in the post-critical range.
   Findings - The Nusselt number increases with non-Fourier effect as
   suggested in experiments in microscale and nanofluid convection.
   Originality/value - Unlike existing nonlinear formulations for RB
   thermal convection, the present combined spectral-perturbation approach
   provides a systematic method for mode selection.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Abstract = {{A two-step strategy combining in situ polymerization and a hydrothermal
   process has been developed for coupling polyaniline (PANI) with porous
   TiO2 anchored on magnetic graphene. The microstructure and morphology of
   magnetic graphene@PANI@porous TiO2 were characterized by FETEM, FESEM,
   XRD, XPS and VSM in detail. The results indicated that magnetic
   graphene@PANI was completely covered by porous TiO2 with random
   orientations and the saturation magnetization value of the composite was
   19.2 emu g (-1). PANI was used to decrease the absorber thickness, while
   the porous TiO2 with a large surface area was designed to enhance the
   interaction between the electromagnetic (EM) wave and the absorber
   through multiple reflections, thus enhancing EM wave absorption
   properties. As an EM wave absorber, the maximum reflection loss of the
   composite was up to -45.4 dB due to the better normalized characteristic
   impedance (close to 1) at a thickness of only 1.5 mm and the absorption
   bandwidths exceeding -10 dB were 11.5 GHz when the thickness ranged from
   1 to 3.5 mm. The excellent EM wave absorption performance was ascribed
   to the combined contribution from the enhanced dielectric relaxation
   processes, the unique porous nanostructures, the quarter-wave length
   matching model and the well-matched normalized characteristic impedance.
   Consequently, it is believed that the composite could be used as an
   excellent EM wave absorption material and the two-step strategy offered
   an effective way to design a high-performance EM wave absorber with a
   relatively thin thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a preferred technique for
   noninvasively monitoring the fate of implanted cells, such as stem cells
   and immune cells in vivo. Cellular MRI requires contrast agents (CAs) to
   label the cells of interest. Despite promising progress made in this
   emerging field, highly sensitive, stable and biocompatible T-1 CAs with
   high cell permeability and specificity remains an unmet challenge. To
   address this need, a novel Mn-III-porphyrin, MnAMP was designed and
   synthesized based on the modification of Mn(III)tetra(carboxy-porphyrin)
   (MnTCP), a small and highly stable non-Gd extracellular CA with good
   biocompatibility and high T-1 relaxivity (r1 = 7.9 mM (1) s (1)) at
   clinical field of 3 Tesla (T). Cell permeability was achieved by masking
   the polar carboxylates of MnTCP with acetoxymethyl-ester (AM) groups,
   which are susceptible to hydrolysis by intracellular esterases. The
   enzymatic cleavage of AM groups led to disaggregation of the hydrophobic
   MnAMP, releasing activated MnTCP with significant increase in T1
   relaxivity. Cell uptake of MnAMP is highly efficient as tested on two
   non-phagocytic human cell lines with no side effects observed on cell
   viability. MRI of labeled cells exhibited significant contrast
   enhancement with a short T-1 of 161 ms at 3 T, even though a relatively
   low concentration of MnAMP and short incubation time was applied for
   cell labeling. Overall, MnAMP is among the most efficient T1 cell
   labeling agents developed for cellular MRI.}},

Abstract = {{Plane wave imaging is desirable for its ability to achieve high frame
   rates, allowing the capture of fast dynamic events, and continuous
   Doppler data. In most implementations of plane-wave imaging, multiple
   low resolution image (LRI) frames from different plane wave tilt angles
   are compounded to form a single high resolution image (HRI) frame,
   thereby reducing the frame rate. Compounding is a low-pass mean filter
   that causes attenuation and aliasing to signals with high Doppler
   shifts. On the other hand, the lateral beam profile and hence the
   quality of the HRI frames is improved by increasing the number of
   compounded frames. Therefore, a tradeoff exists between the Doppler
   limits and beam profile. In this paper, we present a method that
   eliminates this tradeoff and produces high resolution images without the
   use of compounding. The method suppresses the off-focus (clutter) signal
   by spreading its spectrum, while keeping the spectrum of the in-focus
   signal intact. The spreading is achieved by using a random sequence of
   tilt angles, as opposed to a linear sweep. Experiments performed using a
   carotid vessel phantom with constant flow demonstrate that the
   spread-spectrum method more accurately measures the parabolic flow
   profile of the vessel and in particular outperforms conventional
   plane-wave Doppler at higher flow velocities. The spread-spectrum method
   is expected to be valuable for Doppler applications that require
   measurement of high velocities at high frame rates.}},

Abstract = {{High-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy is often included in
   standard-of-care for gynaecological cancers. Needles are currently
   inserted through a perineal template without any standard real-time
   imaging modality to assist needle guidance, causing physicians to rely
   on pre-operative imaging, clinical examination, and experience. While
   two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) is sometimes used for real-time
   guidance, visualization of needle placement and depth is difficult and
   subject to variability and inaccuracy in 2D images. The close proximity
   to critical organs, in particular the rectum and bladder, can lead to
   serious complications. We have developed a three-dimensional (3D)
   transrectal US system and are investigating its use for intra-operative
   visualization of needle positions used in HDR gynaecological
   brachytherapy. As a proof-of-concept, four patients were imaged with
   post-insertion 3D US and x-ray CT. Using software developed in our
   laboratory, manual rigid registration of the two modalities was
   performed based on the perineal template's vaginal cylinder. The needle
   tip and a second point along the needle path were identified for each
   needle visible in US. The difference between modalities in the needle
   trajectory and needle tip position was calculated for each identified
   needle. For the 60 needles placed, the mean trajectory difference was
   3.23 +/- 1.65 degrees across the 53 visible needle paths and the mean
   difference in needle tip position was 3.89 +/- 1.92 mm across the 48
   visible needles tips. Based on the preliminary results, 3D transrectal
   US shows potential for the development of a 3D US-based needle guidance
   system for interstitial gynaecological brachytherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The Bayanbulak Grassland, Tianshan, P. R. China, is located in an
   intramontane sedimentary basin where meandering and braided gravel-bed
   rivers coexist under the same climatic and geological settings. We
   report and compare measurements of the discharge, width, depth, slope
   and grain size of individual threads from these braided and meandering
   rivers. Both types of threads share statistically indistinguishable
   regime relations. Their depths and slopes compare well with the
   threshold theory, but they are wider than predicted by this theory.
   These findings are reminiscent of previous observations from similar
   gravel-bed rivers. Using the scaling laws of the threshold theory, we
   detrend our data with respect to discharge to produce a homogeneous
   statistical ensemble of width, depth and slope measurements. The
   statistical distributions of these dimensionless quantities are similar
   for braided and meandering threads. This suggests that a braided river
   is a collection of intertwined threads, which individually resemble
   those of meandering rivers. Given the environmental conditions in
   Bayanbulak, we furthermore hypothesize that bedload transport causes the
   threads to be wider than predicted by the threshold theory.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new design of a stacked three-layer flat-panel x-ray
   detector for dual-energy (DE) imaging. Each layer consists of its own
   scintillator of individual thickness and an underlying
   thin-film-transistor-based flat-panel. Three images are obtained
   simultaneously in the detector during the same x-ray exposure, thereby
   eliminating any motion artifacts. The detector operation is two-fold: a
   conventional radiography image can be obtained by combining all three
   layers' images, while a DE subtraction image can be obtained from the
   front and back layers' images, where the middle layer acts as a
   mid-filter that helps achieve spectral separation. We proceed to
   optimize the detector parameters for two sample imaging tasks that could
   particularly benefit from this new detector by obtaining the best
   possible signal to noise ratio per root entrance exposure using
   well-established theoretical models adapted to fit our new design. These
   results are compared to a conventional DE temporal subtraction detector
   and a single-shot DE subtraction detector with a copper mid-filter, both
   of which underwent the same theoretical optimization. The findings are
   then validated using advanced Monte Carlo simulations for all optimized
   detector setups. Given the performance expected from initial results and
   the recent decrease in price for digital x-ray detectors, the simplicity
   of the three-layer stacked imager approach appears promising to usher in
   a new generation of multi-spectral digital x-ray diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to improve visualization of structural information in
   digital radiography without increasing radiation exposures requires
   improved image quality across all spatial frequencies, especially at
   high frequencies. The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) as a function
   of spatial frequency quantifies image quality given by a x-ray detector.
   We present a method of increasing DQE at high spatial frequencies by
   improving the modulation transfer function (MTF) and reducing noise
   aliasing. The Apodized Aperature Pixel (AAP) design uses a detector with
   micro-elements to synthesize desired pixels and provide higher DQE than
   conventional detector designs. A cascaded system analysis (CSA) that
   incorporates x-ray interactions is used for comparison of the
   theoretical MTF, noise power spectrum (NPS), and DQE. Signal and noise
   transfer through the converter material is shown to consist of
   correlated an uncorrelated terms. The AAP design was shown to improve
   the DQE of both material types that have predominantly correlated
   transfer (such as CsI) and predominantly uncorrelated transfer (such as
   Se). Improvement in the MTF by 50\% and the DQE by 100\% at the sampling
   cut-off frequency is obtained when uncorrelated transfer is prevalent
   through the converter material. Optimizing high-frequency DQE results in
   improved image contrast and visualization of small structures and
   fine-detail.}},

   attached to the shaft of a da Vinci surgical instrument. The two
   cross-section layout is insensitive to error caused by combined force
   and torque loads, and the orientation of the sensors minimizes the
   condition number of the instrument's compliance matrix. To evaluate the
   instrument's sensing capabilities, its performance was tested using a
   commercially available force-torque sensor, and showed a resolution of
   0.05N at 1 kHz sampling rate. The performance of the sensorized
   instrument was evaluated by performing three surgical tasks on phantom
   tissue using the da Vinci system with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK):
   tissue palpation, knot tightening during suturing and Hem-O-Lok
   tightening during knotless suturing. The tasks were designed to
   demonstrate the robustness of the sensorized force measurement approach.
   The paper reports the results of further evaluation by a group of expert
   and novice surgeons performing the three tasks mentioned above.}},

Abstract = {{Concentric-tube robots (CTR) consist of a series of pre-curved flexible
   tubes that make up the robot structure and provide the high dexterity
   required for performing surgical tasks in constrained environments. This
   special design introduces new challenges in shape sensing as large
   twisting is experienced by the torsionally compliant structure. In the
   literature, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are attached to
   needle-sized continuum robots for curvature sensing, but they are
   limited to obtaining bending curvatures since a straight sensor layout
   is utilized. For a CTR, in addition to bending curvatures, the torsion
   along the robots shaft should be determined to calculate the shape and
   pose of the robot accurately. To solve this problem, in our earlier
   work, we proposed embedding FBG sensors in a helical pattern into the
   tube wall. The strain readings are converted to bending curvatures and
   torsion by a strain-curvature model. In this paper, a modified
   strain-curvature model is proposed that can be used in conjunction with
   standard shape reconstruction algorithms for shape and pose calculation.
   This sensing technology is evaluated for its accuracy and resolution
   using three FBG sensors with 1 mm sensing segments that are bonded into
   the helical grooves of a pre-curved Nitinol tube. The results show that
   this sensorized robot can obtain accurate measurements: resolutions of
   0.02 rad/m with a 100 Hz sampling rate. Further, the repeatability of
   the obtained measurements during loading and unloading conditions are
   presented and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Optically transparent electrodes are a key component in variety of
   products including bioelectronics, touch screens, flexible displays, low
   emissivity windows, and photovoltaic cells. Although highly conductive
   indium tin oxide (ITO) films are often used in these electrode
   applications, the raw material is very expensive and the electrodes
   often fracture when mechanically stressed. An alternative low-cost
   material for inkjet printing transparent electrodes on glass and
   flexible polymer substrates is described in this paper. The water based
   ink is created by using a hydrophilic cellulose derivative,
   carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), to help suspend the naturally hydrophobic
   graphene (G) sheets in a solvent composed of 70\% DI water and 30\%
   2-butoxyethanol. The CMC chain has hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   functional sites which allow adsorption on G sheets and, therefore,
   permit the graphene to be stabilized in water by electrostatic and
   steric forces. Once deposited on the functionalized substrate the
   electrical conductivity of the printed films can be ``tuned{''} by
   decomposing the cellulose stabilizer using thermal reduction. The entire
   electrode can be thermally reduced in an oven or portions of the
   electrode thermally modified using a laser annealing process. The
   thermal process can reduce the sheet resistance of G-CMC films to < 100
   Omega/sq. Experimental studies show that the optical transmittance and
   sheet resistance of the G-CMC conductive electrode is a dependent on the
   film thickness (ie. superimposed printed layers). The printed electrodes
   have also been doped with AuCl3 to increase electrical conductivity
   without significantly increasing film thickness and, thereby, maintain
   high optical transparency.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) relies on
   fluoroscopy and nephrotoxic contrast medium for valve deployment. We
   propose an alternative guidance system using augmented reality (AR) and
   transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to guide TAVI deployment. The
   goals of this study were to determine how consistently the aortic valve
   annulus is defined from TEE using different aortic valve landmarks and
   to compare AR guidance with fluoroscopic guidance of TAVI deployment in
   an aortic root model.
   Methods: Magnetic tracking sensors were integrated into the TAVI
   catheter and TEE probe, allowing these tools to be displayed in an AR
   environment. Variability in identifying aortic valve commissures and
   cuspal nadirs was assessed using TEE aortic root images. To compare AR
   guidance of TAVI deployment with fluoroscopic guidance, a TAVI stent was
   deployed 10 times in the aortic root model using each of the two
   guidance systems.
   Results: Commissures and nadirs were both investigated as features for
   defining the valve annulus in the AR guidance system. The commissures
   were identified more consistently than the nadirs, with intraobserver
   variability of 2.2 and 3.8 mm, respectively, and interobserver
   variability of 3.3 and 4.7mm, respectively. The precision of TAVI
   deployment using fluoroscopic guidance was 3.4 mm, whereas the precision
   of AR guidance was 2.9 mm, and its overall accuracy was 3.4 mm. This
   indicates that both have similar performance.
   Conclusions: Aortic valve commissures can be identified more reliably
   than cuspal nadirs from TEE. The AR guidance system achieved similar
   deployment accuracy to that of fluoroscopy while eliminating the use and
   consequences of nephrotoxic contrast and radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Force sensing minimally invasive instruments have gained increasing
   attention in recent years. Integrating these instruments within
   currently available surgical simulators can enhance the learning
   experience by measuring the forces applied by trainees and supplementing
   objective performance assessment. Recently, an arthroscopic grasper was
   designed and sensorized with Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors at Canadian
   Surgical Technologies and Advanced Robotics (CSTAR). Moreover, a custom
   low-cost (LC) interrogation system was developed to accompany the
   proposed sensorized tool. In this study, the custom LC interrogator was
   used and compared to the commercially available Micron Optics sm130 (MO)
   interrogator. The hypothesis is that both of these systems can be used
   to measure forces within +/- 0.5 N as the acceptable margin for
   accuracy. Experimental results showed that the MO system meets the
   required accuracy for certain force directions. The LC system
   demonstrated 49\% of the accuracy of the MO interrogator The main
   advantage of the LC interrogator is its cost, which is 18\% of the
   commercial interrogation system. For certain force directions, the
   performance was comparable to the defined criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Poor sanitation results in increased spread of diseases and
   environmental pollution. In many parts of the globe, treatment of feces
   needs an urgent solution that ensures elimination of pathogens using
   minimal resources. Self-sustaining smoldering combustion of feces mixed
   with sand has been has been recently studied as a potential technology.
   A combination of different experimental parameters is essential to
   ensure robust operation, where oxidation coexists with pyrolysis and
   water evaporation. This work presents the results of a series of
   thirty-two experiments conducted in order to study the sensitivity of
   the process to the following experimental parameters: moisture content,
   sand-to-feces ratio, airflow, sand grain size and ignition temperature.
   It was found that smoldering temperature and velocity are independent on
   the moisture content and ignition temperature; while are strongly
   dependent on other parameters, specially the airflow. The information
   presented is crucial to control the process, allowing its implementation
   to a real scenario.}},

Title = {{A review of gauge-radar merging methods for quantitative precipitation
   estimation in hydrology}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{186-203}},
Abstract = {{In the case of a significant precipitation event, hydrological models
   play a key role in flood mitigation. To develop a hydrological model
   that produces results with a high degree of confidence, it is imperative
   that the model be provided with accurate quantitative precipitation
   estimates as input. For flood forecasting purposes, quantitative
   precipitation estimates at high spatial and temporal resolutions are
   preferable. Rain gauges and weather radar are the most widely used
   instruments for near real-time collection of precipitation estimates.
   While rain gauges and radar demonstrate certain strengths, both
   instruments suffer from a wide variety of well-known errors which
   inhibit their ability to provide optimal precipitation estimates for
   hydrological models. Considering this, several methods have been
   developed to merge the estimates of these two instruments in order to
   minimize their individual weaknesses and take advantage of their
   respective strengths. The goal of this paper is to provide a
   comprehensive review of gauge-radar merging methods and assess the
   opportunity for near real-time application of gauge-radar merging
   methods in hydrology. Methods presented include: mean field bias
   correction, Brandes spatial adjustment, local bias correction with
   ordinary kriging, range-dependent bias correction, Bayesian data
   combination, conditional merging, kriging with external drift and
   statistical objective analysis. While comparison of gauge-radar merging
   methods is difficult, several factors, including gauge network design,
   storm type and the temporal resolution of adjustment, have demonstrated
   a large effect on the overall accuracy of a particular merging method.
   The majority of research carried out on near real-time application of
   gauge-radar merging methods has been conducted outside of Canada.
   Further research is recommended to assess the capability of using
   gauge-radar merging schemes with Canadian radar products for
   precipitation estimation in hydrological applications, including
   operational hydrological modelling for flood forecasting.}},

Title = {{Effect of posture on forces and moments measured in a Hybrid III ATD
   lower leg}},
Journal = {{TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{381-385}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) are used to assess real
   injury risk to occupants of vehicles during injurious events. In the
   lower leg, values from load cells are compared to injury criteria
   developed in cadaveric studies. These criteria are typically developed
   with the leg in a neutral posture, whereas the ATD may assume a wide
   range of postures during safety evaluation tests. The degree to which
   the initial posture of an ATD has an effect on the measured forces and
   moments in the lower leg is unknown.
   Methods: A Hybrid III ATD lower leg was impacted in a range of postures
   under conditions representing a crash test, and peak axial force and
   adjusted tibia index injury measures were evaluated. Ankle posture was
   varied in 5 increments using a custom-made footplate, and
   dorsi/plantarflexion (20 degrees DF to 20 degrees PF) and in/eversion
   (20 degrees IV to 5 degrees EV) were evaluated. Tibia angle was also
   varied (representing knee flexion/extension) by +/-10 degrees from
   neutral.
   Results: Peak axial force was not affected by ankle flexion or tibia
   angulation. Adjusted tibia index was lowest for plantarflexion, as well
   as for tibia angles representative of knee extension. Both peak axial
   force and adjusted tibia index were lowest for postures of great
   inversion and were highest in neutral or near neutral postures.
   Conclusions: The range of postures tested herein spanned published
   injury criteria and thus would have made the difference between pass and
   fail in a safety evaluation. In/eversion had the largest influence on
   injury metrics, likely due to the change in axial stiffness and altered
   impact durations in these postures. Results suggest increased injury
   risk at neutral or near-neutral postures, whereas previous cadaveric
   studies have suggested that in/eversion does not influence injury risk.
   It is unclear whether the ATD appropriately represents the natural lower
   leg for impacts in out-of-position testing. Great care must be taken
   when initially positioning ATDs for safety evaluations, because small
   perturbations in posture were shown herein to have large effects on the
   measured injury risk using this tool.}},

Title = {{Capacity of a transmission tower under downburst wind loading}},
Journal = {{WIND AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{65-87}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The wind velocity profile over the height of a structure in high
   intensity wind (HIW) events, such as downbursts, differs from that
   associated with atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) winds. Current design
   codes for lattice transmission structures contain only limited advice on
   the treatment of HIW effects, and structural design is carried out using
   wind load profiles and response factors derived for ABL winds. The
   present study assesses the load-deformation curve (capacity curve) of a
   transmission tower under modeled downburst wind loading, and compares it
   with that obtained for an ABL wind loading profile. The analysis
   considers nonlinear inelastic response under simulated downburst wind
   fields. The capacity curve is represented using the relationship between
   the base shear and the maximum tip displacement. The results indicate
   that the capacity curve remains relatively consistent between different
   downburst scenarios and an ABL loading profile. The use of the capacity
   curve avoids the difficulty associated with defming a reference wind
   speed and corresponding wind profile that are adequate and applicable
   for downburst and ABL winds, thereby allowing a direct comparison of
   response under synoptic and downburst events. Uncertainty propagation
   analysis is carried out to evaluate the tower capacity by considering
   the uncertainty in material properties and geometric variables. The
   results indicated the coefficient of variation of the tower capacity is
   small compared to those associated with extreme wind speeds.}},

Abstract = {{A SnOx/Au/SnOx transparent conductive oxide (TCO) multilayered film was
   fabricated with a total thickness of 75 nm using both e-beam and thermal
   evaporation techniques. X-ray diffraction confirms the amorphous nature
   of SnOx with a crystalline peak attributed to the presence of
   diffraction from the Au (111) plane. The morphological studies using
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   revealed a smooth top layer of the sandwich structure. A Rutherford
   backscattering spectrum has been used to probe the thickness of
   individual TCO layers, and reveals an oxygen deficient structure in the
   SnOx layer. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission
   spectroscopy (XES) measurements confirm the formation an SnO-rich phase
   and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The specimen exhibited resistivity
   and sheet resistance of 3.9 x 10(-4) Omega cm and 52 U sq. (-1),
   respectively, with an optical transparency of 83\% beyond 475 nm. The
   superior parameters exhibited by this stacked multilayer are due to
   relatively lower oxygen concentration in the tin oxide layer, and it is
   therefore proposed as a necessary ingredient to increase the overall
   conductivity in metal oxide multilayer thin films.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DIABETES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Indices of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in experimental
   models of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are often contrary to clinical
   data. Here, we investigated whether a relatable insulin-treated model of
   T1DM would induce deficits in cardiovascular (CV) autonomic function
   more reflective of clinical results and if exercise training could
   prevent those deficits. Sixty-four rats were divided into four groups:
   sedentary control (C), sedentary T1DM(D), control exercise (CX), or T1DM
   exercise (DX). Diabetes was induced via multiple low-dose injections of
   streptozotocin and blood glucose was maintained at moderate
   hyperglycemia (9-17mM) through insulin supplementation. Exercise
   training consisted of daily treadmill running for 10 weeks. Compared to
   C, D had blunted baroreflex sensitivity, increased vascular sympathetic
   tone, increased serum neuropeptide Y (NPY), and decreased intrinsic
   heart rate. In contrast, DX differed from D in all measures of CAN
   (except NPY), including heart rate variability. These findings
   demonstrate that this T1DM model elicits deficits and exercise-mediated
   improvements to CV autonomic function which are reflective of clinical
   T1DM.}},

Title = {{Standardized Assessment of Biodiversity Trends in Tropical Forest
   Protected Areas: The End Is Not in Sight}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Extinction rates in the Anthropocene are three orders of magnitude
   higher than background and disproportionately occur in the tropics, home
   of half the world's species. Despite global efforts to combat tropical
   species extinctions, lack of high-quality, objective information on
   tropical biodiversity has hampered quantitative evaluation of
   conservation strategies. In particular, the scarcity of population-level
   monitoring in tropical forests has stymied assessment of biodiversity
   outcomes, such as the status and trends of animal populations in
   protected areas. Here, we evaluate occupancy trends for 511 populations
   of terrestrial mammals and birds, representing 244 species from 15
   tropical forest protected areas on three continents. For the first time
   to our knowledge, we use annual surveys from tropical forests worldwide
   that employ a standardized camera trapping protocol, and we compute data
   analytics that correct for imperfect detection. We found that occupancy
   declined in 22\%, increased in 17\%, and exhibited no change in 22\% of
   populations during the last 3-8 years, while 39\% of populations were
   detected too infrequently to assess occupancy changes. Despite extensive
   variability in occupancy trends, these 15 tropical protected areas have
   not exhibited systematic declines in biodiversity (i.e., occupancy,
   richness, or evenness) at the community level. Our results differ from
   reports of widespread biodiversity declines based on aggregated
   secondary data and expert opinion and suggest less extreme deterioration
   in tropical forest protected areas. We simultaneously fill an important
   conservation data gap and demonstrate the value of large-scale
   monitoring infrastructure and powerful analytics, which can be scaled to
   incorporate additional sites, ecosystems, and monitoring methods. In an
   era of catastrophic biodiversity loss, robust indicators produced from
   standardized monitoring infrastructure are critical to accurately assess
   population outcomes and identify conservation strategies that can avert
   biodiversity collapse.}},

   The hollow Si-Ni-Sn nanosphere anode with a unique architecture exhibits
   high initial discharge capacity and excellent cycling stability. The
   reversible capacity of hollow Si-Ni-Sn nanospheres is 1065mA h g(-1) and
   ismaintained at 402 mA h g(-1) after 50 cycles, which is much higher
   than that of hollow SiO2@Ni@SnO2 nanospheres. The unique configuration
   of the Sn-based intermetallic compound presents a beneficial approach to
   create efficient and practical electrodes for energy storage

Title = {{Poly(ester amide)s with pendant azobenzenes: multi-responsive
   self-immolative moieties for modulating polymer assemblies}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1871-1881}},
Abstract = {{Azobenzenes are well-known for their trans-cis photoisomerization, but
   it was recently demonstrated that azobenzene derivatives could also
   undergo reduction to trigger a 1,6-elimination and initiate
   depolymerization of a self-immolative polymer. Herein we explore the
   optimization of azobenzenes as reduction-sensitive moieties, and their
   incorporation into functional materials. A library of azobenzenes with
   electron-withdrawing groups was synthesized, and their rates of
   reduction by hydrazine were determined. Unexpectedly, a 2-Cl substituent
   increased the rate of reduction more than other electronegative or
   sterically-demanding substituents. Next, a new diester monomer
   containing the 2-Cl-azobenzene was synthesized and incorporated into a
   poly(ester amide) (PEA) backbone, which was then functionalized with PEO
   to afford an amphiphilic multi-responsive material. The photo-and
   reduction-sensitivity of the azobenzenes was then exploited to produce
   reversible and irreversible changes to the polymer nano-assemblies in
   water. Their responsiveness to light and/or hydrazine was studied by
   ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering
   (DLS), and fluorescence spectroscopy of encapsulated nile red.
   Alternating irradiation with UV and visible light resulted in reversible
   trans-cis isomerization, which changed the polarity of the micelle core
   without disrupting the assemblies. Reduction by hydrazine resulted in
   the release of nile red from the micelle core, while residual assemblies
   were still detected by DLS, likely due to the presence of remaining
   hydrophobes. A combination of UV light and hydrazine resulted in the
   release of nile red and breakdown of the assemblies. These results
   suggest that the intrinsic responsiveness of azobenzene to both light
   and reductive stimuli can provide polymer assemblies that respond to one
   or more stimuli in unique and synergistic ways through a single
   multi-responsive unit.}},

Title = {{Design and evaluation of an MRI-compatible linear motion stage}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-71}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and evaluate a tool for accurate, reproducible, and
   programmable motion control of imaging phantoms for use in motion
   sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications.
   Methods: In this paper, the authors introduce a compact linear motion
   stage that is made of nonmagnetic material and is actuated with an
   ultrasonic motor. The stage can be positioned at arbitrary positions and
   orientations inside the scanner bore to move, push, or pull arbitrary
   phantoms. Using optical trackers, measuring microscopes, and navigators,
   the accuracy of the stage in motion control was evaluated. Also, the
   effect of the stage on image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), artifacts, and
   B-0 field homogeneity was evaluated.
   Results: The error of the stage in reaching fixed positions was 0.025
   +/- 0.021 mm. In execution of dynamic motion profiles, the worst-case
   normalized root mean squared error was below 7\% (for frequencies below
   0.33 Hz). Experiments demonstrated that the stage did not introduce
   artifacts nor did it degrade the image SNR. The effect of the stage on
   the B-0 field was less than 2 ppm.
   Conclusions: The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed
   system is MRI-compatible and can create reliable and reproducible motion
   that may be used for validation and assessment of motion related MRI
   applications. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in the area of conductive textiles, also
   called e-textiles, in both the scientific and industrial fields. Herein,
   we have successfully prepared a conductive textile via electroless
   deposition onto cotton textiles by using a three-step treatment process.
   The cotton textiles are first dipped in P4VP-SU8 solution to form a
   uniform layer for the subsequent absorption of silver ions. Then, the
   cotton textiles are immersed in silver nitrate solution in preparation
   for the next step electroless deposition. The parameters like P4VP
   concentration and ELD conditions are studied to optimize the whole
   process. Compared to other methods, the whole fabrication process is
   efficient, facile and time-saving. The as-made cotton fabric sample
   showed sheet resistance as low as 0.05 Omega sq(-1), which makes this
   method a promising candidate for applications in the fabrication of
   functional textile-based wearable devices.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{461-478}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this review paper, some novel energy options for clean rail
   applications are discussed and evaluated. Rail transportation is of
   strategic importance and therefore a reliable, clean, sufficiently
   abundant and cost expensive fuel is required. It has been found that
   integration of selective catalytic reducer and increase of bio-diesel
   used (including blending with petrochemical diesel) may be an immediate
   solution which bring some benefits such as up to 50\% reduction on
   environmental impact. However, accounting for the technical feasibility
   of the solution, the worldwide existence of a well-established
   infrastructure, high efficiency and lower emissions, the natural gas
   appears as a key potential option for the railway. Other reviewed
   technologies include the CNG, LNG-LPG, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen as
   fuels. Electrical railways represent a solution where large investment
   is available. Hydrogen, is most likely a solution for the far future,
   when an infrastructure could be set-up. The life cycle assessment shows
   high ecological advantages of NG with respect to the baseline diesel
   with average 15\% decrease of environmental impact categories. A novel
   criterion has been used here to assess the environmental impact which is
   suitable for pollutant emitting applications such as railway
   transportation. This criterion is denoted as environmental impingement
   work of the polluting effluent which is calculated based on the chemical
   exergy of the polluting species. Chemical exergy is a true measure of
   the impingement (change, modification) produced by the pollutant on the
   environment. It is shown that the well-to-wheel environmental
   impingement of natural gas fuelled locomotive is inferior with at least
   15\% to diesel-electric locomotive equipped with a selective catalytic
   reducer. The environmental impact in terms of work impingement on the
   environment and environmental pollution cost are slightly similar for
   natural gas, ammonia, methanol and biodiesel fuels. The life cycle
   environmental impact categories of natural gas locomotive are overall
   15\% lower than for the conventional diesel-electric locomotive.
   According to our conclusion, liquefied natural gas is indicated as a
   prime potential option for clean rail transportation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) has been shown to be an alternative
   separation technology for some specific substances from their solutions.
   In this study, the extraction of L-phenylalanine from sodium chloride
   solutions by ELM was selected as a model system in which sulfonated
   kerosene was newly employed as the diluent of membrane phase. Meanwhile,
   a back propagation neural network (BPNN) improved by genetic algorithm
   (GA) was first established to simulate the concentration of
   L-phenylalanine in external phase and extraction efficiency with the
   time under various operational conditions. The results show that, a
   stable ELM with an extraction efficiency of 94.4\% and a concentration
   ratio of 106.1 can be acquired. The back propagation neural network
   improved by genetic algorithm (GABP) is also demonstrated as an
   effective tool to simulate an ELM process in real-time with average
   residual errors of 0.0722 g/L and 1.6563\% in terms of the concentration
   of L-phenylalanine in external phase and extraction efficiency,

Abstract = {{A new cogeneration system consisting of a hydrogen-fed SOFC (solid oxide
   fuel cell), a GT (gas turbine) and a GAX (generator-absorber-heat
   exchange) absorption refrigeration cycle is proposed and analyzed in
   detail. The electrochemical equations for the fuel cell and
   thermodynamic and exergoeconomic relations for the system components are
   solved simultaneously with EES (Engineering Equation Solver) software.
   Through a parametric study, the influences of such decision parameters
   as current density, fuel utilization factor, pressure ratio and air
   utilization factor on the performance of the system are studied. In
   addition, using a genetic algorithm, the system performance is optimized
   for maximum exergy efficiency or minimum SUCP (sum of the unit costs of
   products). The results show that, the exergy efficiency of the proposed
   system is 6.5\% higher than that of the stand-alone SOFC. It is also
   observed that the fuel cell stack contributes most to the total
   irreversibility. The exergoeconomic factor, the capital cost rate and
   the exergy destruction cost rate for the overall system are observed to
   be 27.3\%, 10.63 \$/h and 28.3 \$/h, respectively. It is observed that
   for each 6 \$/GJ increase in the hydrogen unit cost, the optimum sum of
   the unit costs of products is increased by around 62.5 \$/GJ. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{North American (NA) ginseng root (Panax quinquefolium) has become of
   increasing scientific interest because of its immune-enhancing
   properties. Herein, we have developed a novel approach to synthesize
   ginseng polysaccharide nanoparticles (NPs) from NA ginseng for enhancing
   their immunostimulation. Nanoparticles of ginseng polysaccharide were
   prepared using a microfluidic device and compared to other conventional
   wet chemical processes including nano precipitation and reverse
   microemulsion. The morphology and size of the NPs were characterized by
   SEM, TEM, DLS and FTIR. Depending on the experimental conditions,
   microfluidics was found to provide unimodal polysaccharide spheres down
   to 20 nm (+/- 4 nm) with very narrow particle size distributions. In
   addition, the immunostimulating effect of the polysaccharide NPs was
   investigated on Murine macrophage cell lines, with the results revealing
   an enhanced production of all proinflammatory mediators in a
   concentration dependent manner. The proposed microfluidic system has the
   advantages of ease of fabrication, simplicity, and a fast and low-cost
   process that is capable of producing ginseng polysaccharide NPs with
   demonstrated enhancement of immunostimulation of macrophage cell lines.}},

Abstract = {{In the last several decades, circulating fluidized bed reactors have
   been studied in many aspects including hydrodynamics, heat and mass
   transfer and gas-solid two phase contacting. However, despite the
   abundance of review papers on hydrodynamics, there is no summary paper
   on gas-solid contact efficiency to date, especially on high density
   circulating fluidized beds (CFBs). This paper gives an introduction to,
   and a review of the measurement of contact efficiency in circulating
   fluidized bed riser. Firstly, the popular testing method of contact
   efficiency including the method of heating transfer experiment and hot
   model reaction are discussed, then previous published papers are
   reviewed based on the discussed methods. Some key results of the
   experimental work are described and discussed. Gas-solid contact
   efficiency is affected by the operating conditions as well as the
   particle size distribution. The result of the contact efficiency shows
   that the CFB riser is far away from an ideal plug flow reactor due to
   the characteristics of hydrodynamics in the riser. Lacunae in the
   available literature have been delineated and recommendations have been
   made for further work. (C) 2015 The Chemical Industry and Engineering

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{396-404}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we describe a writable particle-free ink for fast
   fabrication of highly conductive stretchable circuits. The composite ink
   mainly consists of soluble silver salt and adhesive rubber. Low toxic
   ketone was employed as the main solvent. Attributed to ultrahigh
   solubility of silver salt in short-chain ketone and salt-assisted
   dissolution of rubber, the ink can be prepared into particle-free
   transparent solution. As-prepared ink has a good chemical stability and
   can be directly filled into ballpoint pens and use to write on different
   substrates to form well adhesive silver salt-based composite written
   traces as needed. As a result of high silver salt loading, the trace can
   be converted into highly conductive silver nanoparticle-based composites
   after in situ reduction. Because of the introduction of adhesive
   elastomeric rubber, the as-formed conductive composite written trace can
   not only maintain good adhesion to various substrates but also show good
   conductivity under various deformations. The conductivity of written
   traces can be enhanced by repeated writing-reduction cycles. Different
   patterns can be fabricated by either direct handwriting or hand-copying.
   As proof-of-concept demonstrations, a typical handwriting heart-like
   circuit was fabricated to show its capability to work under different
   deformations, and a pressure-sensitive switch was also manufactured to
   present pressure-dependent change of resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostructured Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as a promising anode material in
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has shown excellent yet
   morphology-dependent performance in LIB operations. However, the
   structural origin that influences the material performance at the
   microscopic level remains unclear. Here, using combined in situ Raman
   spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we comparatively
   investigated the structural stability of two nanostructured LTO
   materials with different morphologies by application of external
   pressure up to 27 GPa. In particular, nanoflower-like Li4Ti5O12 spheres
   (LTO-1) and Li4Ti5O12 nanoparticles (LTO-2) were subjected to high
   pressures using diamond anvil cells and their structural evolutions were
   characterized upon compression and decompression. Raman measurements
   show that both LTO materials undergo pressure-induced structural
   disorder but with different reversibilities upon decompression. X-ray
   results further confirmed the Raman measurements, and also allowed the
   quantitative analysis of pressure dependence of the crystal structures.
   Structural refinements of the diffraction patterns yield
   morphology-dependent bulk moduli of the two LTO materials, which reveal
   critical information about the intrinsic lattice strain and vacancies.
   These different structural characteristics, when compared with another
   spinel structure of lithiated titanium dioxide, allow the interpretation
   of the different performance between LTO-1 and LTO-2 for LIB operations.
   This study thus contributes to the understanding of the important
   factors that may influence the electrochemical performance and help with

Abstract = {{The solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients in various solvents
   is crucial to their industrial production and the development to final
   formulations. In this work, the solubility of rivaroxaban (form I) in
   the binary solvent mixtures of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone with water,
   methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol from 273.15 to 323.15 K has been
   experimentally measured. Meanwhile, the dependence of the measured
   solubility on the temperature as well as on the composition of solvent
   mixtures has been simulated by Jouyban-Acree (JA) and nonrandom two
   liquid (NRTL) equations, respectively. The results show that as to the
   solubility simulation of the studied system JA and NRTL give average
   relative deviations of 0.1081 and 0.1064, respectively, suggesting that
   both JA and NRTL can act as an efficient simulation tool for the
   solubility of rivaroxaban (form I) in pure and mixture solvents at

Abstract = {{MRI-based diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can be challenging
   when pathology is not visually evident due to low image contrast or
   small lesion size. Computer-assisted analyses are able to detect lesions
   common in a specific patient population, but most techniques do not
   address clinically relevant individual pathologies resulting from the
   heterogeneous etiology of the disease. We propose a novel method to
   supplement the radiological inspection of TLE patients () providing
   patient-specific quantitative assessment.
   Regions of interest are defined across the brain and volume,
   relaxometry, and diffusion features are extracted from them. Statistical
   comparisons between individual patients and a healthy control group ()
   are performed on these features, identifying and visualizing significant
   differences through individual feature maps. Four maps are created per
   patient showing differences in intensity, asymmetry, and volume.
   Detailed reports were generated per patient. Abnormal hippocampal
   intensity and volume differences were detected in all patients diagnosed
   with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Abnormal intensities in the
   temporal cortex were identified in patients with no MTS. A laterality
   score correctly distinguished left from right TLE in 12 out of 15
   patients.
   The proposed focus on subject-specific quantitative changes has the
   potential of improving the assessment of TLE patients using MRI
   techniques, possibly even redefining current imaging protocols for TLE.}},

Abstract = {{Photocatalytic efficiency is evaluated using quantum yields (QYs) and
   the photochemical thermodynamic efficiency factor (PTEF). The PTEF
   allows establishing reactor efficiency as the ratio of utilized enthalpy
   for the formation of consumed OH. free radicals over the absorbed photon
   energy. A key consideration for the evaluation of efficiency factors is
   the establishment of macroscopic energy balances together with an
   accurate assessment of evolved and absorbed photons. Of considerable
   help are the experimental devices developed at the Chemical Reactor
   Engineering Centre (CREC)/University of Western Ontario (UWO)
   laboratories. Photoconversion kinetics is required for calculation of
   the OH. consumption rates and establishment of the related kinetic
   parameters. PTEFs and QYs have been applied by CREC-UWO researchers for
   efficiency calculations in photocatalytic reactors for the

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-34}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{A modified version of the MODFLOW/MT3DMS-based reactive transport model
   PHT3D was developed to extend current reactive transport capabilities to
   the variably-saturated component of the subsurface system and
   incorporate diffusive reactive transport of gaseous species. Referred to
   as PHT3D-UZF, this code incorporates flux terms calculated by MODFLOW's
   unsaturated-zone flow (UZF1) package. A volume-averaged approach similar
   to the method used in UZF-MT3DMS was adopted. The PHREEQC-based
   computation of chemical processes within PHT3D-UZF in combination with
   the analytical solution method of UZF1 allows for comprehensive reactive
   transport investigations (i.e., biogeochemical transformations) that
   jointly involve saturated and unsaturated zone processes. Intended for
   regional-scale applications, UZF1 simulates downward-only flux within
   the unsaturated zone. The model was tested by comparing simulation
   results with those of existing numerical models. The comparison was
   performed for several benchmark problems that cover a range of important
   hydrological and reactive transport processes. A 2D simulation scenario
   was defined to illustrate the geochemical evolution following dewatering
   in a sandy acid sulfate soil environment. Other potential applications
   include the simulation of biogeochemical processes in variably-saturated
   systems that track the transport and fate of agricultural pollutants,
   nutrients, natural and xenobiotic organic compounds and micropollutants
   such as pharmaceuticals, as well as the evolution of isotope patterns.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a bio-based novolac resin,
   bio-phenol-hydroxymethylfurfural (BPHMF) resin, was prepared using a
   hydrolysis lignin (HL) as bio-phenol to partially substitute phenol and
   using glucose as a precursor for HMF. To enhance the chemical reactivity
   of the hydrolysis lignin with very high molecular weight, the HL was
   first degraded to de-polymerized hydrolysis lignin (DHL) followed by
   phenolation. BPHMF resin was then synthesized by resinification reaction
   between the phenolated DHL and HMF in-situ derived from glucose under
   pressure in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts, at an 85\% yield. The
   resin was curable with 15 wt.\% hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and the
   crosslinkage of the resin could also be strengthened by the functional
   groups in the DHL structure. Thermal/curing behaviors of the BPHMF-HMTA
   systems were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),
   peaking at 152 degrees C. The cured BPHMF resin demonstrated excellent
   thermal/thermomechanical properties, owing to the addition of HL, e.g.,
   thermally stable up to 315 degrees C. The BPHMF-fiberglass thermoset
   composite demonstrated a high glass transition temperature (272 degrees
   C), and tensile strength (89 MPa) comparable to other phenolic
   composites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Pages = {{249-254}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biochar is a fine powder that is difficult to handle and would be blown
   away if applied to soils without modifications. Wet drum granulation of
   biochar using binder solutions of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was
   investigated to create a form that would be easier to handle and apply
   effectively to the soil. The biochar granules were free flowing and
   approximately spherical with a significant yield between a size range of
   1 to 4 mm. The binder concentration, total binder solution volume and
   drum rotational speed all affected the yield of granules within this
   size range. The drum rotational speed and binder concentration affected
   the granule strength; biochar granules were resistant to attrition and
   showed a crushing strength of 0.15 to 0.50 MPa. The results demonstrated
   that biochar can be granulated using wet drum granulation. Further
   research is required to further refine the granulation parameters to
   produce granules with comparable characteristics to fertilizers to
   ensure that the granules could be effectively applied to soils using
   existing infrastructure and techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Calpain plays a critical role in cardiomyopathic changes in type 1
   diabetes (T1D). This study investigated how calpain regulates
   mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the
   development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. T1D was induced in transgenic
   mice overexpressing calpastatin, in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific
   capn4 deletion, or in their wild-type littermates by injection of
   streptozotocin. Calpain-1 protein and activity in mitochondria were
   elevated in diabetic mouse hearts. The increased mitochondrial calpain-1
   was associated with an increase in mitochondrial ROS generation and
   oxidative damage and a reduction in ATP synthase-alpha (ATP5A1) protein
   and ATP synthase activity. Genetic inhibition of calpain or upregulation
   of ATP5A1 increased ATP5A1 and ATP synthase activity, prevented
   mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative damage, and reduced
   cardiomyopathic changes in diabetic mice. High glucose concentration
   induced ATP synthase disruption, mitochondrial superoxide generation,
   and cell death in cardiomyocytes, all of which were prevented by
   overexpression of mitochondria-targeted calpastatin or ATP5A1. Moreover,
   upregulation of calpain-1 specifically in mitochondria induced the
   cleavage of ATP5A1, superoxide generation, and apoptosis in
   cardiomyocytes. In summary, calpain-1 accumulation in mitochondria
   disrupts ATP synthase and induces ROS generation, which promotes
   diabetic cardiomyopathy. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for
   and may have significant implications in diabetic cardiac complications.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The mitochondria are important sources of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) in the heart. Mitochondrial ROS production has been implicated in
   the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy, suggesting that therapeutic
   strategies specifically targeting mitochondrial ROS may have benefit in
   this disease. We investigated the therapeutic effects of
   mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-TEMPO on diabetic cardiomyopathy.
   Methods: The mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-TEMPO was
   administrated after diabetes onset in a mouse model of
   streptozotocin-induced type-1 diabetes and type-2 diabetic db/db mice.
   Cardiac adverse changes were analyzed and myocardial function assessed.
   Cultured adult cardiomyocytes were stimulated with high glucose, and
   mitochondrial superoxide generation and cell death were measured.
   Results: Incubation with high glucose increased mitochondria superoxide
   generation in cultured cardiomyocytes, which was prevented by
   mito-TEMPO. Co-incubation with mito-TEMPO abrogated high glucose-induced
   cell death. Mitochondrial ROS generation, and intracellular oxidative
   stress levels were induced in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic mouse
   hearts. Daily injection of mito-TEMPO for 30 days inhibited
   mitochondrial ROS generation, prevented intracellular oxidative stress
   levels, decreased apoptosis and reduced myocardial hypertrophy in
   diabetic hearts, leading to improvement of myocardial function in both
   type-1 and type-2 diabetic mice. Incubation with mito-TEMPO or
   inhibition of Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase prevented oxidative stress
   levels and cell death in high glucose-stimulated cardiomyocytes.
   Mechanistic study revealed that the protective effects of mito-TEMPO
   were associated with down-regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
   Conclusions: Therapeutic inhibition of mitochondrial ROS by mito-TEMPO
   reduced adverse cardiac changes and mitigated myocardial dysfunction in
   diabetic mice. Thus, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants may be an
   effective therapy for diabetic cardiac complications. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A numerical study for laminar natural convection inside a square
   enclosure with a single horizontal fin attached to its hot wall has been
   carried out. The enclosure horizontal surfaces are adiabatic, the left
   wall is hot while the right one is cold. The Prandtl number for the flow
   inside the enclosure is 0.71. A parametric study has been carried out to
   investigate the effect of Rayleigh number, fin length, conductivity
   ratio, thickness and position on heat transfer. The fin thickness showed
   negligible effect on the average Nusselt number for all values of fin
   conductivity ratios. The fin efficiency and temperature distribution
   were examined. The fin effectiveness was also studied and it was found
   that the fin effectiveness enhanced in general with the increase of fin
   length. Also, the maximum fin effectiveness was found at the lowest
   Rayleigh number for a given fin conductivity ratio. A correlation has
   been proposed for the relation between Nusselt number and the parameters
   of study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{80}},

Pages = {{639-655}},

Abstract = {{Seismic hazard evaluation for a site can be carried out based on direct
   observations such as ground motion records at the site or based on an
   adopted seismic hazard model, including the distribution of earthquake
   intensity, the spatio-temporal occurrence model of earthquakes in a
   region, and the ground motion prediction equations. The former is
   adequate if sufficient records at the site are available, while the
   latter is capable to incorporate information from similar tectonic
   regions. This study compares the seismic hazard estimated using these
   two approaches for a recording site in Mexico City. The comparison is
   carried out in terms of uniform hazard spectra by considering interplate
   earthquakes alone, inslab earthquakes alone, and both interplate and
   inslab earthquakes. Up to date ground motion records obtained at the
   site are employed for the analysis. The results showed quantitatively
   the differences between the uniform hazard spectrum (UHS) obtained by
   the two approaches and the differences between the estimated UHS and the
   design spectrum, which is important for seismic risk assessment and
   design code making. The results are also used to identify the
   differences between the standard deviation of the residuals for GMPEs
   developed using records from a single station and that obtained
   considering a broad network of stations.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was developed to describe the
   process performance of a semi-batch annular TiO2-UV photoreactor in an
   Eulerian framework. The model accounted for the optical behaviour of
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) suspensions, the flow distribution and the
   oxalic acid degradation in the reactor. The scattering component of the
   optical model, explicitly included in the CFD simulations using a
   TiO2-specific scattering phase function integrated in the radiative
   transfer equation, was calibrated using an optical goniometer by
   comparing simulated scattering light profiles against irradiance
   measurements collected for various TiO2 concentrations and UV
   wavelengths and subsequently solved by the discrete ordinate (DO)
   radiation model. Several scattering phase functions were tested against
   the goniometric measurements confirming that the Henyey-Greenstein (HG)
   equation was the most appropriate angular distribution function at 254
   and 355 nm, irrespective of the TiO2 concentration. Using the calibrated
   HG function, a new approach for quantifying the absolute values of
   absorption and scattering coefficients in TiO2 suspensions was proposed.
   It consists of iteratively solving, using the DO model, the radiative
   transfer equation for various combinations of absorption and scattering
   coefficients until the error between observed and predicted angular
   irradiance measurements is minimized. The accuracy of the optical
   parameters was verified with independent CFD simulations carried out for
   an annular photoreactor and already available in the literature.
   Predicted and simulated irradiance and oxalic acid degradation data were
   found to be in excellent agreement, confirming the considerable
   potential of the integrated modelling approach presented in this paper
   for the design, optimization and scale-up of photocatalytic technologies
   for water and wastewater treatment applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The rise of molecular plasmonics and its application to ultrasensitive
   spectroscopic measurements has been enabled by the rational design and
   fabrication of a variety of metallic nanostructures. Advanced nano and
   microfabrication methods are key to the development of such structures,
   allowing one to tailor optical fields at the sub-wavelength scale,
   thereby optimizing excitation conditions for ultrasensitive detection.
   In this work, the control of both analyte and cell positioning on a
   plasmonic platform is enabled using nanofabrication methods involving
   patterning of fluorocarbon (FC) polymer (C4F8) thin films on a plasmonic
   platform fabricated by nanosphere lithography (NSL). This provides the
   possibility to probe biomolecules of interest in the vicinity of cells
   using plasmon-mediated surface enhanced spectroscopies. In this context,
   we demonstrate the surface enhanced biosensing of glycan expression in
   different cell lines by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) on
   these plasmonic platforms functionalized with 4-mercaptophenylboronic
   acid (4-MPBA) as the Raman reporter. These cell lines include human
   embryonic kidney (HEK 293), C2C12 mouse myoblasts, and HeLa (Henrietta
   Lacks) cervical cancer cells. A distinct glycan expression is observed
   for cancer cells compared to other cell lines by confocal SERS mapping.
   This suggests the potential application of these versatile SERS
   platforms for differentiating cancerous from non-cancerous cells.}},

Title = {{F2 tornado velocity profiles critical for transmission line structures}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{436-449}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In several locations around the globe, many failures of transmission
   line structures have been observed during high intensity wind events in
   the form of tornadoes and downbursts. There is a lack of procedures in
   the design codes and manuals of practice related to the estimation of
   tornado forces on transmission line systems. As such, the purpose of
   this paper is to present load cases that simulate the critical effect of
   F2 tornadoes on tangent lattice transmission line structures. The
   current study builds on extensive research previously conducted at the
   University of Western Ontario, Canada on this subject. A main challenge
   in this application of localized wind events is that the forces acting
   on the structure vary significantly based on the location of the tornado
   and a large parametric study involving varying the tornado location has
   to be conducted for each system to determine critical cases. Critical
   load cases are determined in this study based on parametric studies
   carried out in previous investigations as well as others conducted in
   the current study. The vertical profile of three velocity components
   associated with each critical load case as well as the horizontal
   profile of the associated transverse velocity along the lines are
   provided in this paper. A procedure that will allow practicing engineers
   to use those profiles for analyzing lattice transmission lines under F2
   tornadoes is described. Validation of the developed procedure is
   conducted by considering two independent transmission line systems. The
   results indicate that the developed load cases estimates peak internal
   forces that are either slightly higher or 5\% less than the values
   predicted by the detailed parametric studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles incorporating with polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) were deposited together on the surface of silicone hydrogel
   through matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE). In this
   process, frozen nanocomposites (ZnO-PEG) in isopropanol were irradiated
   under a pulsed Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm for 1 h. Our results indicate that
   the MAPLE process is able to maintain the chemical backbone of polymer
   and prevent the nanocomposite coating from contamination. The ZnO-PEG
   nanocomposited coating reduces over 50\% protein absorption on silicone
   hydrogel. The cytotoxicity study shows that the ZnO-PEG nanocomposites
   deposited on silicone hydrogels do not impose the toxic effect on mouse
   NIH/3T3 cells. In addition, MAPLE-deposited ZnO-PEG nanocomposites can
   inhibit the bacterial growth significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The incorporation of intensity, spatial, and topological information
   into large-scale multi-region segmentation has been a topic of ongoing
   research in medical image analysis. Multi-region segmentation problems,
   such as segmentation of brain structures, pose unique challenges in
   image segmentation in which regions may not have a defined intensity,
   spatial, or topological distinction, but rely on a combination of the
   three. We propose a novel framework within the Advanced segmentation
   tools (ASETS)(2), which combines large-scale Gaussian mixture models
   trained via Kohonen self-organizing maps, with deformable registration,
   and a convex max-flow optimization algorithm incorporating region
   topology as a hierarchy or tree. Our framework is validated on two
   publicly available neuroimaging datasets, the OASIS and
   MRBrainSlIdatabases, against the more conventional Potts model,
   achieving more accurate segmentations. Each component is accelerated
   using general-purpose programming on graphics processing Units to ensure
   computational feasibility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main limitation of visible light communication (VLC) is the narrow
   modulation bandwidth, which reduces the achievable data rates. In this
   letter, we apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to
   enhance the achievable throughput in high-rate VLC downlink networks. We
   first propose a novel gain ratio power allocation (GRPA) strategy that
   considers the users' channel conditions to ensure efficient and fair
   power allocation. Our results indicate that the GRPA significantly
   enhances the system performance compared with the static power
   allocation. We also study the effect of tuning the transmission angles
   of the light emitting diodes and the field of views of the receivers,
   and demonstrate that these parameters can offer new degrees of freedom
   to boost the NOMA performance. The simulation results reveal that NOMA
   is a promising multiple access scheme for the downlink of VLC networks.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{40-51}},
Abstract = {{The maximum expected monetary benefit or minimum expected cost rule are
   often adopted to assess the optimum structural design levels under
   infrequent large earthquakes. In the assessment, the monetary benefit or
   cost functions are frequently established by considering the overall
   benefit or lifecycle cost at present value for a given structural design
   life. The selection of the structural design life is somewhat arbitrary,
   and in many cases one is interested in maximizing the structural service
   time or the benefit per unit service time. The consideration of the
   benefit (or cost) at present value per lifecycle or per unit service
   time may lead to different optimum design levels for a given planning
   time horizon. Moreover, it is unknown if the recommended importance
   factor in design codes to increase the seismic design load for classes
   of buildings is optimum. These two issues are investigated through
   numerical analyses by placing a structure at several different locations
   in Mexico and considering assembled detailed seismic hazard model. The
   implication of the results for the codified designs and for selecting
   the importance factor is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Effervescent atomization technique is used in many industrial
   applications such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, furnaces

   configurations (size and number of holes) of the new bubble breaker were
   considered over a range of gas to liquid flow rates ratios (GLRs) from
   0.001 to 0.022. High-speed imaging was used to visualize and quantify
   bubble and spray characteristics. The results showed that the two-phase
   flow regime and bubbles' size inside the effervescent atomizer, and the
   spray droplets' size and velocity outside the atomizer are strongly
   influenced by the bubble breaker. The results demonstrated that the
   bubble breaker effectively fragments large bubbles into smaller ones.
   Furthermore, the results illustrate that the diameter and numbers of
   holes of the bubble breaker affect the bubble size inside the mixing

Abstract = {{The present work uses a popular discrete-scale Monte-Carlo method to

   using a digital generation method, and the surface-area-to-volume ratios
   were identified directly from the digital models. The extinction
   coefficients were identified using the aforementioned method and a
   correlation is fitted to the data. It was found that the extinction
   coefficient is very large, suggesting that, for mean pore diameters and
   porosities in the given ranges, graphitic foam may nearly always be
   treated as a black body. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alterations in brain structures, including progressive
   neurodegeneration, are a hallmark in patients with Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). However, pathological mechanisms, such as the accumulation of
   amyloid and the proliferation of tau, are thought to begin years, even
   decades, before the initial clinical manifestations of AD. In this
   study, we compare the brain anatomy of amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment patients (aMCI, n= 16) to healthy subjects (CS, n = 22) using
   cortical thickness, subcortical volume, and shape analysis, which we
   believe to be complimentary to volumetric measures. We were able to
   replicate ``classical{''} cortical thickness alterations in aMCI in the
   hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, insula, and inferior temporal regions.
   Additionally, aMCI showed significant thalamic and striatal shape
   differences. We observed higher global amyloid deposition in aMCI, a
   significant correlation between striatal displacement and global
   amyloid, and an inverse correlation between executive function and
   right-hemispheric thalamic displacement. In contrast, no volumetric
   differences were detected in thalamic, striatal, and hippocampal
   regions. Our results provide new evidence for early subcortical
   neuroanatomical changes in patients with aMCI, which are linked to
   cognitive abilities and amyloid deposition. Hence, shape analysis may
   aid in the identification of structural biomarkers for identifying
   individuals at highest risk of conversion to AD.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{47-53}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of ultrasound (UTS) energy at
   different temperatures on the zeolitization of aluminosilicate
   constituents of coal fly ash. UTS energy irradiated directly into the
   reaction mixture utilizing a probe immersed into the reaction mixture,
   unlike previously reported works that have used UTS baths. Controlled
   synthesis was also conducted at constant stirring and at the same
   temperatures using conventional heating. The precursor reaction solution
   was obtained by first fusing the coal fly ash with sodium hydroxide at
   550 C followed by dissolution in water and filtration. The synthesized
   samples were characterized by XRF, XRD, SEM and TGA. The crystallinity
   of crystals produced with UTS assisted conversion compared to
   conventional conversion at 85 degrees C was twice as high. UTS energy
   also reduced the induction time from 60 mm to 40 min and from 80 min to
   60 min for reaction temperatures of 95 C and 85 degrees C, respectively.
   Prolonging the UTS irradiation at 95 degrees C resulted in the
   conversion of zeolite-A crystals to hydroxysodalite, which is a more
   stable zeolitic phase. It was found that at 85 degrees C coupled with
   ultrasound energy produced the best crystalline structure with a pure
   single phase of zeolite-A. It has been shown that crystallization using
   UTS energy can produce zeolitic crystals at lower temperatures and
   within 1 h, dramatically cutting the synthesis time of zeolite. (C) 2015

Journal = {{ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{400-408}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, natural clinoptilolite was converted to zeolite NaP
   using ultrasonic energy, in which the transformation time shortened
   remarkably. The effect of post-synthesis treatment using conventional
   hydrothermal was also investigated. The synthesized powders were
   characterized by XRD, TGA/DTA, SEM, and PSD analysis. The results showed
   that, increasing the sonication time (energy) has no significant effect
   on the product's morphology. The crystallinity of the synthesized
   samples increased slightly with increasing sonication time, but their
   yield remained relatively unchanged. Furthermore, post-synthesis
   hydrothermal treatment showed very little influence on properties of the
   final product. Because the ultrasonic irradiation creates acoustic
   cavitation cracks on the surface structure of clinoptilolite
   particulates and increases the concentration of soluble alumino-silicate
   species, which favors the prevailing super-saturation, crystallization
   and crystal growth of zeolite NaP happen faster. The particles of
   zeolite NaP synthesized by ultrasonic irradiation consist of small
   crystallites of uniform size. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recently protein refolding on size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
   operated in multi-column continuous simulated moving bed (SMB)
   configurations (hereinafter SMB-SEC) has been investigated for future
   industrial applications. This is due to several advantages offered by
   SMB configurations particularly when process parameters are thoroughly
   screened and optimized. A robust mathematical model is essential for
   high-throughput process screening and optimization. In this work, a
   previously investigated single-column mathematical model was modified to
   extend its applicability for protein oxidative refolding/aggregation
   predictions in SMB-SEC. The model considers a wide loading concentration
   range of the model protein (lysozyme) on SEC. The potential influences
   of high concentrations of chaotropic reagents on kinetic and
   thermodynamic model parameters have been discussed based on previous
   experimental results and their predicted local concentrations through
   the SMB-SEC columns and at the product stream. It was observed that
   aggregation occurs when local protein concentration exceeds a critical
   concentration. No urea recovery at the product stream indicated that the
   refolding reaction will continue off-column to recover the
   native-protein product. Therefore, it is suggested that the developed
   model is tested against experimental results for total soluble protein
   (early intermediates and native conformations) in the presence of
   L-arginine additive and process performance indicators are defined based
   on this criterion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Thermosensitive polymer-grafted iron oxide nanoparticles studied by in

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Thermometry at the nanoscale is an emerging area fostered by intensive
   research on nanoparticles (NPs) that are capable of converting
   electromagnetic waves into heat. Recent results suggest that stationary
   gradients can be maintained between the surface of NPs and the bulk
   solvent, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ` cold hyperthermia'.
   However, the measurement of such highly localized temperatures is
   particularly challenging. We describe here a new approach to probing the
   temperature at the surface of iron oxide NPs and enhancing the
   understanding of this phenomenon. This approach involves the grafting of
   thermosensitive polymer chains to the NP surface followed by the
   measurement of macroscopic properties of the resulting NP suspension and
   comparison to a calibration curve built up by macroscopic heating.
   Superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs were prepared by the coprecipitation of
   ferrous and ferric salts and functionalized with amines, then azides
   using a sol-gel route followed by a dehydrative coupling reaction.
   Thermosensitive poly{[}2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDMAEMA)
   with an alkyne end-group was synthesized by controlled radical
   polymerization and was grafted using a copper assisted azide-alkyne
   cycloaddition reaction. Measurement of the colloidal properties by
   dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that the thermosensitive NPs
   exhibited changes in their Zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter as a
   function of pH and temperature due to the grafted PDMAEMA chains. These
   changes were accompanied by changes in the relaxivities of the NPs,
   suggesting application as thermosensitive contrast agents for magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, a new fibre-based backscattering
   setup enabled positioning of the DLS remote-head as close as possible to
   the coil of a magnetic heating inductor to afford in situ probing of the
   backscattered light intensity, hydrodynamic diameter, and temperature.
   This approach provides a promising platform for estimating the response
   of magnetic NPs to application of a radiofrequency magnetic field or for
   understanding the behaviour of other thermogenic NPs.}},

   compared to BDDA, and BDTA inhibited BDDA biodegradation. The benzyl
   ring of {[}U-C-14-benzyl] BDDA was readily and completely mineralized.
   The detection of the transformation products benzyl methyl amine and
   dodecyl dimethyl amine in spent culture liquid was consistent with
   literature. Overall, this study demonstrates the antagonistic effect of
   interactions on biodegradation of two widely used QACs suggesting
   further investigation on the degradation of mixture of QACs in
   wastewater effluents and biosolids (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Self-sustaining treatment for active remediation (STAR) is an emerging,
   smoldering-based technology for nonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL)
   remediation. This work presents the first in situ field evaluation of
   STAR. Pilot field tests were performed at 3.0 m (shallow test) and 7.9 m
   (deep test) below ground surface within distinct lithological units
   contaminated with coal tar at a former industrial facility.
   Self-sustained smoldering (i.e., after the in-well ignition heater was
   terminated) was demonstrated below the water table for the first time.
   The outward propagation of a NAPL smoldering front was mapped, and the
   NAPL destruction rate was quantified in real time. A total of 3700 kg of
   coal tar over 12 days in the shallow test and 860 kg over 11 days in the
   deep test was destroyed; less than 2\% of total mass removed was
   volatilized. Self-sustaining propagation was relatively uniform radially
   outward in the deep test, achieving a radius of influence of 3.7 m;
   strong permeability contrasts and installed barriers influenced the
   front propagation geometry in the shallow test. Reductions in soil
   hydrocarbon concentrations of 99.3\% and 97.3\% were achieved in the
   shallow and deep tests, respectively. Overall, this provides the first
   field evaluation of STAR and demonstrates that it is effective in situ
   and under a variety of conditions and provides the information necessary
   for designing the full-scale site treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The present study considers a scale-up methodology for photocatalytic
   slurry reactors. The Photo-CREC Water units used include: (a) a 2.65 L
   internally irradiated annular photoreactor, (b) a 9.8 L externally
   irradiated scaled-up unit. The LVREA (Local Volumetric Rate of Energy
   Adsorption Field) calculations for the bench-scale and the scaled-up
   reactors at different operation conditions are determined by using
   approaches established by Valades-Pelayo et al. {[}40] and
   Valades-Pelayo et al. {[}41]. In the bench-scale photoreactor,
   degradations of oxalic acid are carried out at different photocatalyst
   concentrations and lamp emissions. Residence time distributions are
   determined for both the Photo-CREC Water II and the Photo-CREC Water III
   by using glucose as a tracer. An efficiency factor is calculated in both
   cases including mixing mechanisms and charge! recombination phenomena
   using a simplified kinetic model. To avoid cross-correlation issues, all
   relevant parameters are determined by independent experiments. Model
   validation is also accomplished by comparing model predictions to
   experimental degradation rates at different photocatalyst concentrations
   in the larger Photo-CREC Water III. The proposed methodology confirms
   the applicability of reaction engineering principles for scale-up, from
   bench to pilot-plant photoreactors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal liquefaction of woody biomass (birchwood sawdust) with and
   without catalyst was investigated at 300 degrees C for 30 min. The
   activities of KOH, FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O, K2CO3, MgO, synthetic
   hydrotalcite (HT), and ground colemanite (calcium borate mineral) as
   catalysts were compared. The alkaline catalysts (KOH, K2CO3 and
   colemanite) showed the best performance considering the oil yield and
   solid residue yield. The bio-crude oil yield with KOH was increased to
   around 40 wt\%, more than double the yield of the uncatalyzed operation
   (similar to 18 wt\%). It also reduced the solid residue yield from
   approx. 33 to 12 wt\%. Among all catalysts tested, the least active
   catalysts for bio-crude oil production are FeSO4 and MgO. The bio-crude
   oil products were comprehensively characterized using an elemental
   analyzer, GC-MS, FT-IR, GPC and TGA. Occurrence of phenol derivatives
   (mainly 2-methoxy-phenol) and aliphatic compounds increased
   significantly in presence of catalysts, especially the alkaline ones
   such as HT and KOH. The GPC results indicate that the oils produced in
   the presence of catalysts have very similar molecular weights and
   distribution, which are slightly greater than the oil produced in
   absence of any catalyst, suggesting that the presence of a catalyst
   promoted certain condensation/polymerization of the reaction
   intermediates during the HTL process. The TGA results show that all
   bio-crude oils are similar with respect to thermal stability,
   irrespective of the presence or type of catalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Comparative study to understand the intrinsic properties of Pt and Pd

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},

Volume = {{185}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of the intrinsic properties of Pt and Pd is important
   for the rational design of catalysts for methanol and ethanol oxidation
   in alkaline media. In this paper, Pd catalysts, Pt catalysts and
   bimetallic PtPd catalysts supported on nitrogen-doped graphene are
   investigated. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for the bimetallic
   catalysts in 1 M KOH solution demonstrate the increasing surface
   composition of Pt versus Pd. The linear sweep voltammetry results show
   that the onset potential for OH formation on Pt is lower than on Pd,
   indicating that Pt has a higher affinity for OH than Pd. The CVs
   recorded for methanol and ethanol oxidation show that ethanol oxidation
   occurs at lower potentials, suggesting that ethanol is a more active
   fuel than methanol. Ethanol and methanol oxidation occurs at lower
   potentials on Pt than on Pd, revealing that Pt is intrinsically more
   active than Pd. Chronoamperometry results show that the rate of
   catalysts deactivation during ethanol oxidation is more severe compared
   with methanol oxidation, especially for catalysts with higher Pt
   content. The possible reason for the deactivation behaviors is presented
   and recommendations are given for future catalysts development. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor study
   2013 (GBD 2013) is the first of a series of annual updates of the GBD.
   Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can
   help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities
   for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the
   comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks,
   and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution.
   Methods Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with
   disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been
   estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods.
   Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for
   188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three
   inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk
   exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks
   of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at
   the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy
   includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with
   more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with
   GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices,
   occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood
   stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most
   risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian
   meta-regression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian
   process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of
   published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for
   clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on
   the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through
   other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol.
   Findings All risks combined account for 57.2\% (95\% uncertainty
   interval {[}UI] 55.8-58.5) of deaths and 41.6\% (40.1-43.0) of DALYs.
   Risks quantified account for 87.9\% (86.5-89.3) of cardiovascular
   disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0\% for neonatal disorders and
   neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in
   2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5\% of DALYs:
   dietary risks accounting for 11.3 million deaths and 241.4 million
   DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10.4 million deaths and 208.1
   million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1.7 million deaths
   and 176.9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6.1 million deaths and 143.5
   million DALYs, air pollution for 5.5 million deaths and 141.5 million
   DALYs, and high BMI for 4.4 million deaths and 134.0 million DALYs. Risk
   factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In
   sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal
   malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing.
   In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the
   Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the
   leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading
   risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For
   men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks
   in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle
   East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading
   risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa.
   Interpretation Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and
   metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than
   one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention.
   Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased
   in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk
   factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for
   these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care
   policy options are available now to act on key risks.}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged life expectancy also results in an increased need for
   high-performance orthopedic implants. It has been shown that a
   compromised tissue-implant interface could lead to adverse
   immune-responses and even the dislodging of the implant. To overcome
   these obstacles, our research team has been seeking ways to decrease the
   risk of faulty tissue-implant interfaces by improving the
   biocompatibility and the osteo-inductivity of conventional orthopedic
   implants using ultrafine particle coatings. These particles were
   enriched with various bioactive additives prior to coating, and the
   coated biomaterial surfaces exhibited significantly increased
   biocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Physical assessments firstly
   confirmed the proper incorporation of the bioactive additives after
   examining their surface chemical composition. Then, in vitro assays
   demonstrated the biocompatibility and osteo-inductivity of the coated
   surfaces by studying the morphology of attached cells and their
   mineralization abilities. In addition, by quantifying the responses,
   activities and gene expressions, cellular evaluations confirmed the
   positive effects of these polymer based bioactive coatings.
   Consequently, the bioactive ultrafine polymer particles demonstrated
   their ability in improving the biocompatibility and osteo-inductivity of
   conventional orthopedic implants. As a result, our research team hope to
   apply this technology to the field of orthopedic implants by making them
   more effective medical devices through decreasing the risk of
   implant-induced immune responses and the loosening of the implant.}},

Abstract = {{Drug-induced gingival enlargement (DIGE) is a fibrotic condition that
   can be caused by the antihypertensive drug nifedipine and the
   anti-seizure drug phenytoin, but the molecular etiology of this type of
   fibrosis is not well understood and the role of confounding factors such
   as inflammation remains to be fully investigated. The aim of this study
   was to develop an ex vivo gingival explant system to allow investigation
   of the effects of nifedipine and phenytoin alone on human gingival
   tissue. Comparisons were made to the histology of human DIGE tissue
   retrieved from individuals with DIGE. Increased collagen, fibronectin,
   and proliferating fibroblasts were evident, but myofibroblasts were not
   detected in DIGE samples caused by nifedipine and phenytoin. In healthy
   gingiva cultured in nifedipine or phenytoin-containing media, the number
   of cells positive for p-SMAD2/3 increased, concomitant with increased
   CCN2 and periostin immunoreactivity compared to untreated explants.
   Collagen content assessed through hydroxyproline assays was
   significantly higher in tissues cultured with either drug compared to
   control tissues, which was confirmed histologically. Matrix fibronectin
   levels were also qualitatively greater in tissues treated with either
   drug. No significant differences in proliferating cells were observed
   between any of the conditions. Our study demonstrates that nifedipine
   and phenytoin activate canonical transforming growth factor-beta
   signaling, CCN2 and periostin expression, as well as increase collagen
   density, but do not influence cell proliferation or induce myofibroblast
   differentiation. We conclude that in the absence of confounding
   variables, nifedipine and phenytoin alter matrix homeostasis in gingival
   tissue explants ex vivo, and drug administration is a significant factor
   influencing ECM accumulation in gingival enlargement.}},

Abstract = {{We describe energy-dependent incomplete signal generation in
   semiconductor detectors with a simple planar geometry using deep charge
   trapping and depth-of-interaction models. Based on this formalism, we
   have characterized mercuric iodide (HgI2) photoconductors by extracting
   performance parameters from x-ray-induced signals under mammographic
   imaging conditions. The HgI2, sample photoconductors were prepared using
   a simple screen-printing method. For an x-ray tube output from tungsten
   target and 30-kV setting, the quantum absorption efficiency of samples
   with a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm was measured to be similar to
   70\%. X-ray sensitivity was measured to be 0.4 nC cm(-2)mR(-1).
   Mobility-lifetime products for electrons and holes were measured as
   similar to 2 x 10-6 cm(2) V-1 and similar to 0.9 x 10-6 cm(2) V-1,
   respectively. Considering incomplete charge collection, the W-value (or
   w) was estimated to be rsd similar to 27 eV. Since the characterization
   method described in this study is simple and does not require
   sophisticated equipment, it can be useful for the characterization of
   photoconductor materials.}},

Abstract = {{Three strains (DMKU-RE28, DMKU-RE43(T) and DMKU-RE123) of a novel
   anamorphic yeast species were isolated from rice leaf tissue collected
   in Thailand. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the species forms a
   sister pair with Candida ranongensis CBS 10861(T) but differs by 24-30
   substitutions in the LSU rRNA gene D1/D2 domains and 30-35 substitutions
   in the ITS region. A phylogenetic analysis based on both the small and
   the large rRNA gene subunits confirmed this connection and demonstrated
   the presence of a Glade that also includes Candida catenulata, Candida
   mesorugosa, Candida neorugosa, Candida pseudorugosa, Candida rugosa and
   Candida scorzettiae. The Glade is not closely affiliated to any known
   teleomorphic genus, and forms a well-separated lineage from currently
   recognized genera of the Saccharomycetales. Hence, the genus Diutina
   gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate members of the Glade, including
   Diutina siamensis f.a. sp. nov. and the preceding seven Candida species.
   The type strain is DMKU-RE43(T). (=CBS 13388(T)=BCC 61183(T)= NBRC

Abstract = {{A blind comparison of independent invasive (downhole, standard
   penetration, bender element) and noninvasive microtremor shear-wave
   velocity (Vs) profiling is presented for 11 strong-motion stations in
   central and southern Chile that recorded the 2010 M-W 8.8 Maule
   earthquake. For the majority of stations, site classification based on
   average V-s in the upper 30 m (V-s30) is consistent irrespective of
   methodology. For a variety of geological conditions, excellent to good
   agreement is obtained between invasive and noninvasive V-s structure at
   five stations over the entire borehole length and in the uppermost layer
   at three stations. Site classification based on site period is evaluated
   using earthquake and microtremor recordings. Short site periods are
   observed at stiff coarse-grained stations whereas longer site periods
   are observed at soft fine-grained stations. The use of both V-s30 and
   site period criteria are recommended in future revisions of the Chilean
   building code for robust earthquake site response characterization. (c)

Abstract = {{The seismic response of soils consisting of uniform sandy soils with two
   different relative densities Dr (50\% and 90\%) was investigated using
   the RPI geotechnical centrifuge facility, with a one-dimensional
   earthquake simulator at 60 g. The seismic soil structure interaction
   between the sand, buried box culvert, and surface foundations was also
   studied. The models were subjected to three earthquakes with different
   amplitudes and frequencies. Model settlements were recorded from 1 g to
   60 g and during the seismic shakings; the ground response parameters
   were assessed. Rocking of structures was observed to be small for the
   box culverts compared to the surface foundation due to the soil
   confinement. The effect of kinematic soil structure interaction between
   the dry sand, box culverts and foundations was also explored. Kinematic
   soil culvert interaction was found to lead to a large reduction in the
   peak ground acceleration at the soil surface, which can reach up to
   50\%. Further numerical modeling was performed to investigate the effect
   of soil cover height on the kinematic soil culvert interaction and these
   results are also discussed in the paper. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The use of polymeric nanoparticles to encapsulate and deliver drug
   molecules is a promising approach for improving drug properties such as
   water dispersibility, pharmacokinetics, and selectivity for the in vivo
   target. Described here is the development of poly(ester amide) (PEA)
   nanoparticles prepared from PEAs with pendant functional groups that
   allow for covalent conjugation of the drugs in order to mitigate the
   undesirable burst release of drug, commonly observed for
   nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems. Parameters including the
   surfactant and PEA concentration in an emulsification-evaporation
   procedure were studied in order to determine conditions for preparing
   particles with diameters < 200 nm. A hydroxyl-functionalized rhodamine
   derivative, as a model drug, was then conjugated to a PEA having pendant
   carboxylic acid groups to afford a PEA-rhodamine conjugate with the dye
   covalently attached by ester linkages. The emulsification-evaporation
   procedure was used to prepare nanoparticles from this conjugate and
   these particles were found to release the dye much more slowly and
   without a burst effect, in comparison with analogous nanoparticles
   having the rhodamine physically encapsulated. The same approach was
   applied to the anti-cancer drug floxuridine and the resulting
   nanoparticles also afforded sustained drug release. This work suggests
   the promise of PEAs with pendant functional groups for providing
   nanoparticle-based drug delivery vehicles with slow and sustained drug

Title = {{Joint segmentation of lumen and outer wall from femoral artery MR
   images: Towards 3D imaging measurements of peripheral arterial disease}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) measurements of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
   plaque burden extracted from fast black-blood magnetic resonance (MR)
   images have shown to be more predictive of clinical outcomes than PAD
   stenosis measurements. To this end, accurate segmentation of the femoral
   artery lumen and outer wall is required for generating volumetric
   measurements of PAD plaque burden. Here, we propose a semi-automated
   algorithm to jointly segment the femoral artery lumen and outer wall
   surfaces from 3D black-blood MR images, which are reoriented and
   reconstructed along the medial axis of the femoral artery to obtain
   improved spatial coherence between slices of the long, thin femoral
   artery and to reduce computation time. The developed segmentation
   algorithm enforces two priors in a global optimization manner the
   spatial consistency between the adjacent 2D slices and the anatomical
   region order between the femoral artery lumen and outer wall surfaces.
   The formulated combinatorial optimization problem for segmentation is
   solved globally and exactly by means of convex relaxation using a
   coupled continuous max-flow (CCMF) model, which is a dual formulation to
   the convex relaxed optimization problem. In addition, the CCMF model
   directly derives an efficient duality-based algorithm based on the
   modern multiplier augmented optimization scheme, which has been
   implemented on a GPU for fast computation. The computed segmentations
   from the developed algorithm were compared to manual delineations from
   experts using 20 black-blood MR images. The developed algorithm yielded
   both high accuracy (Dice similarity coefficients >= 87\% for both the
   lumen and outer wall surfaces) and high reproducibility (intra-class
   correlation coefficient of 0.95 for generating vessel wall area), while
   outperforming the state-of-the-art method in terms of computational time
   by a factor of approximate to 20. (C)2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper develops hybrid analog-digital channel estimation and
   beamforming techniques for multiuser massive multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) systems with limited number of radio frequency
   (RF) chains. For these systems, first, we design novel
   minimum-mean-squared error (MMSE) hybrid analog-digital channel
   estimator by considering both cases with perfect and imperfect channel
   covariance matrix knowledge. Then, we utilize the estimated channels to
   enable beamforming for data transmission. When the channel covariance
   matrices of all user equipments (UEs) are known perfectly, we show that
   there is a tradeoff between the training duration and throughput.
   Specifically, we exploit the fact that the optimal training duration
   that maximizes the throughput depends on the covariance matrices of all
   UEs, number of RF chains, and channel coherence time (T-c). We also show
   that the training time optimization problem can be formulated as a
   concave maximization problem where its global optimal solution can be
   obtained efficiently using existing tools. The analytical expressions
   are validated by performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The role of groundwater in delivering nutrients (nitrogen and
   phosphorus) to the Great Lakes and their tributaries is not well
   understood. Consequently, this potentially important non-point source is
   poorly managed and often neglected. Evaluating nutrient inputs from
   groundwater requires knowledge of the (i) sources of groundwater
   nutrient contamination, (ii) physical groundwater discharge flow paths,
   and (iii) geochemical processes occurring along these flow paths that
   control the ultimate loading of nutrients to surface waters. Although
   groundwater quality in the Great Lakes Basin (GLB) is generally good,
   nutrient concentrations in aquifers can become elevated by a range of
   agricultural and non-agricultural activities. Nutrients can be delivered
   from groundwater to the Great Lakes by indirect discharge into
   tributaries or direct discharge into the lakes. The factors affecting
   these discharge pathways and their contributions to nutrient loading are
   distinct. The discharge of nutrients from groundwater to surface water
   is strongly regulated by zones of high reactivity that exist close to
   the sediment-water interface (i.e., riparian zone, hyporheic zone).
   Understanding the functioning of these zones for the landscape and
   hydrogeological conditions in the GLB is essential for evaluating
   nutrient loading to the Great Lakes and their tributaries as well as
   maximizing the benefits these zones can provide for water quality
   management. The paper concludes with a discussion of key knowledge gaps,
   challenges, and future research priorities that need to be addressed to
   evaluate and better manage this complex nutrient input to the Great
   Lakes and their tributaries. (C) 2015 International Association for

Abstract = {{With the advantages of a light weight and improved thermal insulation,
   recycled tire particles have been utilized as engineered fills either
   alone or mixed with other geomaterials. To better utilize recycled tire
   particles, the thermal conductivity of their mixtures with mine tailings
   is studied as affected by the water content, mixing ratio of tailings
   and tire crumbs, compactive effort, and size of tire crumbs. The results
   show a clear correlation between the thermal conductivity and bulk
   density of the mixtures. Furthermore, the horizontal thermal
   conductivity is slightly higher than the vertical thermal conductivity
   and the anisotropic effect is more pronounced for the mixtures with
   lower water contents. The experimental data are processed via an
   analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the results indicate that the factors
   included in the simulation are statistically significant at a confidence
   level of 95\%. A multiple linear regression model is proposed to relate
   the thermal conductivity with the composition of mixtures and compaction
   conditions. The interpretation methods developed in this study can be
   extended to enhance the understanding to the thermal characteristics of
   compacted geomaterials in engineering applications. (C) 2015 The

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{46-60}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The available methods to model ground roughness are not suitable for
   practical unsteady flow simulations in built-environment, or are limited
   to slightly rough terrains, or do not provide enough details on the flow
   structure close to the ground. In the current study, a robust model that
   simulates rough terrains and provides reasonable transient flow details
   close to the ground is proposed. The model can handle wide variety of
   rough exposure encountered in the built-environment. It is based on
   coupling two existing models in the literature; (i) surface gradient
   drag-based and (ii) canopy models. In this study the terrains are
   represented by equivalent fractal surfaces generated from random Fourier
   modes (RFM). Further, in a boundary layer wind tunnel testing, it is a
   common practice to use code-based prescribed aerodynamic roughness,
   z(0), to define the terrain exposure type and to select the inflow mean
   velocity profiles and turbulent intensity levels. For a similar
   numerical application, there is no guidance on how to simulate turbulent
   flow corresponding to a specific prescribed z(0). For such applications
   a new scaling technique is developed to scale arbitrary fractal surfaces
   in order to produce the prescribed z(0). ABL flow, over three types of
   terrain exposures, is investigated using LES employing the new model. It
   is observed that the resulting ABL flow characteristics in terms of mean
   and fluctuating velocity profiles as well as velocity spectra match very
   well with the target engineering data, which validates the proposed
   method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{By closely examining hue, saturation and value (HSV) images of the
   solids holdup distribution in a riser, it can be seen that a
   ``cluster{''} is the combination of a relatively stable core cluster of
   the highest solids holdups and constantly changing cluster clouds of
   solids holdups that are higher than the dilute phase. Based on this
   analysis, a threshold selection method maximizing the inter-class
   variance between the background and foreground classes is introduced. A
   systematic cluster identification process is therefore proposed that:
   (1) applies the threshold selection method to obtain the critical solids
   holdup threshold epsilon(sc) to discriminate dense and dilute phases and
   (2) applies the method again in the dense phase regions to obtain the
   cluster solids holdup threshold epsilon(sct) that identifies the core
   clusters. Using this systematic process, clusters of different shapes
   and sizes and a relatively clear boundary can be visualized clearly and
   identified accurately. Using epsilon(sct), the core cluster fraction is
   calculated by dividing the total number of pixels in the core cluster by
   the total number of image pixels. The variation of the core cluster
   fraction according to operating conditions is also discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This work evaluated the adsorption performance of a commercial granular
   activated carbon (GAC) for three naphthenic acids (NAs) model compounds.
   In single-compound adsorption, the saturation capacity (q(m)) at pH 4
   was 452.6 mg/g (1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid) > 357.9 mg/g
   (2-naphthoic acid) > 317.7 mg/g (diphenylacetic acid). Of all model NAs,
   adsorption of 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid was the most negatively
   affected in multi-component adsorption at pH 4. The q(m) decreased
   significantly with increasing pH due to its effect on both carbon
   surface charge and dissociation of the NAs. An important finding was
   that the total amount of NAs adsorbed in multi-component adsorption at
   pH 4 (326 mg/g) was almost the same as that adsorbed at pH 8 (324 mg/g),
   indicating the potential of activated carbon adsorption for removal of
   mixture of NAs from the real oil sand process water, which is basic (pH
   similar to 8) in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present a novel way to grow aluminum alkoxide films with tunable
   conductivity with molecular level accuracy with the use of molecular
   layer deposition (MLD). Alternating exposures of trimethylaluminum
   (TMA), ethylene glycol (EG), and terephthaloyl chloride (TC) are used to
   grow the aluminium alkoxide films. Control over film composition was
   accomplished by alternating cycles of EG and TC between cycles of TMA
   and EG. In this fashion the aluminum to carbon ratio can be accurately
   controlled. These films were then pyrolyzed under a reducing atmosphere
   to yield a conductive Al2O3/carbon composite. Raman spectroscopy
   determined that nanocrystalline sp2-graphitic carbon was formed
   following pyrolysis while sheet resistance measurements determined that
   conductivity of the film is directly related to aluminium-carbon ratio.
   To further elucidate the origin of conductivity within the film,
   synchrotron based XPS was performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Discriminating between bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive
   disorder (MDD) is a major clinical challenge due to the absence of known
   biomarkers; hence a better understanding of their pathophysiology and
   brain alterations is urgently needed. Given the complexity, feature
   selection is especially important in neuroimaging applications, however,
   feature dimension and model understanding present serious challenges. In
   this study, a novel feature selection approach based on linear support
   vector machine with a forward-backward search strategy (SVM-FoBa) was
   developed and applied to structural and resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging data collected from 21 BD, 25 MDD and 23
   healthy controls. Discriminative features were drawn from both data
   modalities, with which the classification of BD and MDD achieved an
   accuracy of 92.1\% (1000 bootstrap resamples). Weight analysis of the
   selected features further revealed that the inferior frontal gyrus may
   characterize a central role in BD-MDD differentiation, in addition to
   the default mode network and the cerebellum. A modality-wise comparison
   also suggested that functional information outweighs anatomical by a
   large margin when classifying the two clinical disorders. This work
   validated the advantages of multimodal joint analysis and the
   effectiveness of SVM-FoBa, which has potential for use in identifying
   possible biomarkers for several mental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Layered-division-multiplexing (LDM) technology is a non-orthogonal
   multiplexing technology to provide more efficient transmission of
   multiple services that have different requirements on the robustness and
   throughput in one TV channel. The core of LDM is to transmit
   multiple-layer signals, where each layer occupies the whole channel
   bandwidth and the whole time. To meet the different requirements on
   different layers, each layer is allocated a specific power level, and is
   configured to use a different channel coding and modulation scheme, as
   well as its own multiple-antenna technology. Delivering robust and
   high-quality mobile TV services is one of the top priorities for the
   next generation digital TV (NG-DTV) systems. In this paper, we first
   investigate the performance of the NG-DTV systems with LDM in various
   difficult propagation channels that are likely encountered by the large
   variety of mobile devices, including fast-fading channels, slow-fading
   channels, indoor channels, and single-frequency-network (SFN) channels.
   A new channel estimation technique is proposed to overcome the severe
   performance degradation caused by the SFN channels. We will further show
   that using LDM makes it possible to deliver mobile services using the
   efficient 32k transmission mode. Finally, receive antenna diversity is
   shown to provide different levels of performance improvement for
   different LDM configurations.}},

Title = {{nZVI injection into variably saturated soils: Field and modeling study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{16-28}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Nano-scale zero valent iron (nZVI) has been used at a number of
   contaminated sites over the last decade. At most of these sites,
   significant decreases in contaminant concentrations have resulted from
   the application of nZVI. However, limited work has been completed
   investigating nZVI field-scale mobility. In this study, a field test was
   combined with numerical modeling to examine nZVI reactivity along with
   transport properties in variably saturated soils. The field test
   consisted of 142 L of carboxymethyle cellulose (CMC) stabilized
   monometallic nZVI synthesized onsite and injected into a variably
   saturated zone. Periodic groundwater samples were collected from the
   injection well; as well as, from two monitoring wells to analyze for
   chlorinated solvents and other geochemistry indicators. This study
   showed that CMC stabilized monometallic nZVI was able to decrease
   tricholorethene (TCE) concentrations in groundwater by more than 99\%
   from the historical TCE concentrations. A three dimensional, three
   phase, finite difference numerical simulator, (CompSim) was used to
   further investigate nZVI and polymer transport at the variably saturated
   site. The model was able to accurately predict the field observed head
   data without parameter fitting. In addition, the numerical simulator
   estimated the mass of nZVI delivered to the saturated and unsaturated
   zones and distinguished the nZVI phase (i.e. aqueous or attached). The
   simulation results showed that the injected slurry migrated radially
   outward from the injection well, and therefore nZVI transport was
   governed by injection velocity and viscosity of the injected solution. A
   suite of sensitivity analyses was performed to investigate the impact of
   different injection scenarios (e.g. different volume and injection rate)
   on nZVI migration. Simulation results showed that injection of a higher
   nZVI volume delivered more iron particles at a given distance; however,
   the travel distance was not proportional to the increase in volume.
   Moreover, simulation results showed that using a 1D transport equation
   to simulate nZVI migration in the subsurface may overestimate the travel
   distance. This is because the 1D transport equation assumes a constant
   velocity while pore water velocity radially detreases from the well
   during injection. This study suggests that on-site synthesized nZVI
   particles are mobile in the subsurface and that a numerical simulator
   can be a valuable tool for optimal design of nZVI field applications.

Abstract = {{A common challenge when performing surface-based registration of images
   is ensuring that the surfaces accurately represent consistent anatomical
   boundaries. Image segmentation may be difficult in some regions due to
   either poor contrast, low slice resolution, or tissue ambiguities. To
   address this, we present a novel non-rigid surface registration method
   designed to register two partial surfaces, capable of ignoring regions
   where the anatomical boundary is unclear. Our probabilistic approach
   incorporates prior geometric information in the form of a statistical
   shape model (SSM), and physical knowledge in the form of a finite
   element model (FEM). We validate results in the context of prostate
   interventions by registering pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) to 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). We show that both the
   geometric and physical priors significantly decrease net target
   registration error (TRE), leading to TREs of 2.35 +/- 0.81 mm and 2.81
   +/- 0.66 mm when applied to full and partial surfaces, respectively. We
   investigate robustness in response to errors in segmentation, varying
   levels of missing data, and adjusting the tunable parameters. Results
   demonstrate that the proposed surface registration method is an
   efficient, robust, and effective solution for fusing data from multiple
   modalities.}},

Abstract = {{This article deals with reliability-based mitigation of metal-loss
   corrosion defects on steel natural gas transmission pipelines. The
   failure pressure ratios (FPRs) and probabilities of burst associated
   with corrosion defects with various sizes on representative gas
   pipelines are evaluated using the ASME B31G Modified model and
   first-order reliability method. The pipelines considered have different
   values of the maximum operating pressure, steel grade, wall thickness,
   outside diameter, and utilization factor. The analysis results suggest
   that FPR and the reliability index corresponding to the probability of
   burst follow a linear relationship for pipelines with the same
   utilization factor. Based on the analysis results, linear regression
   equations that relate FPR to the reliability index are developed for
   pipelines with different utilization factors. The equation can be
   employed to determine the threshold FPR corresponding to a target
   reliability index (or allowable probability of burst) for a given
   utilization factor to identify critical corrosion defects for
   mitigation. This study will facilitate the risk-and reliability-based
   corrosion management of gas transmission pipelines.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, we
   determine computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) thresholds associated
   with follow-up infarction at different stroke onset-to-CTP and
   CTP-to-reperfusion times.
   Methods-Acute ischemic stroke patients with occlusion on computed
   tomographic angiography were acutely imaged with CTP. Noncontrast
   computed tomography and magnectic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging
   between 24 and 48 hours were used to delineate follow-up infarction.
   Reperfusion was assessed on conventional angiogram or 4-hour repeat
   computed tomographic angiography. T-max, cerebral blood flow, and
   cerebral blood volume derived from delay-insensitive CTP postprocessing
   were analyzed using receiver-operator characteristic curves to derive
   optimal thresholds for combined patient data (pooled analysis) and
   individual patients (patient-level analysis) based on time from stroke
   onset-to-CTP and CTP-to-reperfusion. One-way ANOVA and locally weighted
   scatterplot smoothing regression was used to test whether the derived
   optimal CTP thresholds were different by time.
   Results-One hundred and thirty-two patients were included. T-max
   thresholds of >16.2 and >15.8 s and absolute cerebral blood flow
   thresholds of <8.9 and <7.4 mL.min(-1.)100 g(-1) were associated with
   infarct if reperfused <90 min from CTP with onset <180 min. The
   discriminative ability of cerebral blood volume was modest. No
   statistically significant relationship was noted between stroke
   onset-to-CTP time and the optimal CTP thresholds for all parameters
   based on discrete or continuous time analysis (P>0.05). A statistically
   significant relationship existed between CTP-to-reperfusion time and the
   optimal thresholds for cerebral blood flow (P<0.001; r=0.59 and 0.77 for
   gray and white matter, respectively) and T-max (P<0.001; r=-0.68 and
   -0.60 for gray and white matter, respectively) parameters.
   Conclusions-Optimal CTP thresholds associated with follow-up infarction
   depend on time from imaging to reperfusion.}},

Title = {{A new algorithm to improve assessment of cortical bone geometry in pQCT}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{721-730}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is
   now considered the leading imaging modality in bone research. However,
   access to HR-pQCT is limited and image acquisition is mainly constrained
   only for the distal third of appendicular bones. Hence, the conventional
   pQCT is still commonly used despite inaccurate threshold-based
   segmentation of cortical bone that can compromise the assessment of
   whole bone strength. Therefore, this study addressed whether the use of
   an advanced image processing algorithm, called OBS, can enhance the
   cortical bone analysis in pQCT images and provide similar information to
   HR-pQCT when the same volumes of interest are analyzed. Using pQCT
   images of European Forearm Phantom (EFP), and pQCT and HR-pQCT images of
   the distal tibia from 15 cadavers, we compared the results from the OBS
   algorithm with those obtained from common pQCT analyses, HR-pQCT manual
   analysis (considered as a gold standard) and common HR-pQCT analysis
   dual threshold technique. We found that the use of OBS segmentation
   method for pQCT image analysis of EFP data did not result in any
   improvement but reached similar performance in cortical bone delineation
   as did HR-pQCT image analyses. The assessments of cortical
   cross-sectional bone area and thickness by OBS algorithm were
   overestimated by less than 4\% while area moments of inertia were
   overestimated by similar to 5-10\%, depending on reference HR-pQCT
   analysis method. In conclusion, this study showed that the OBS algorithm
   performed reasonably well and it offers a promising practical tool to
   enhance the assessment of cortical bone geometry in pQCT. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The overall behavior of a micropiled raft foundation (MPR) system is
   similar to a piled raft foundation where the load is transferred by both
   the raft and micropiles. However, there is no guidance available
   regarding the design of MPRs or indication of their performance. In this
   study, geotechnical centrifuge testing was conducted to investigate the
   behavior of MPR foundations in clay and evaluate their performance
   characteristics. The study evaluated the performance of MPRs compared to
   the isolated raft in terms of raft total and differential settlements;
   raft contact pressure; raft bending moment; and load sharing between the
   raft and the micropiles. The results showed that for the MPR
   configuration considered in the study, the raft carried 48\% of the
   applied load. It was found that the Poulos-Davis-Randolph (PDR) method
   can be used to evaluate the performance of MPR for preliminarily design
   purposes with approximately 17\% error.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To study the potential utility of using near fiber (NF)
   jiggle as an assessment of neuromuscular transmission stability in
   healthy older subjects using decomposition-based quantitative
   electromyography (DQEMG).
   Methods: The tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles
   were tested in 9 older men (77 +/- 5 years) and 9 young male control
   subjects (23 +/- 0.3 years). Simultaneous surface and needle-detected
   electromyographic (EMG) signals were collected during voluntary
   contractions, and then analyzed using DQEMG. Motor unit potential (MUP)
   and NF MUP parameters were analyzed.
   Results: NF jiggle was significantly increased for both the TA and VM in
   the old age group relative to the younger controls (P < 0.05). NF jiggle
   was significantly higher in the TA compared to VM (P < 0.05). For TA, NF
   jiggle was negatively correlated with MUNE, and positively correlated
   with S-MUP amplitude, NF count, MUP duration, MUP peak-to-peak voltage,
   and MUP area (P < 0.05). For VM, NF jiggle was positively correlated
   with NF count and MUP area (P < 0.05), and no significant correlations
   were found between NF jiggle and S-MUP amplitude, MUP duration, or MUP
   peak-to-peak voltage (MUNE was not calculated for VM, so no correlation
   could be made).
   Conclusions: Healthy aging is associated with neuromuscular transmission
   instability (increased NF jiggle) and MU remodeling, which can be
   measured using DQEMG.
   Significance: NF jiggle derived from DQEMG can be a useful method of
   identifying neuromuscular dysfunction at various stages of MU remodeling
   and aging. (C) 2015 International Federation of Clinical

   association rule mining. Conventional approaches for mining frequent
   itemsets in big data era encounter significant challenges when computing
   power and memory space are limited. This paper proposes an efficient
   distributed frequent itemset mining algorithm (DFIMA) which can
   significantly reduce the amount of candidate itemsets by applying a
   matrix-based pruning approach. The proposed algorithm has been
   implemented using Spark to further improve the efficiency of iterative
   computation. Numeric experiment results using standard benchmark
   datasets by comparing the proposed algorithm with the existing
   algorithm, parallel FP-growth, show that DFIMA has better efficiency and
   scalability. In addition, a case study has been carried out to validate
   the feasibility of DFIMA.}},

Abstract = {{This work experimentally investigates the effects of oar-shaft stiffness
   and length on rowing biomechanics. Elite rowers were tested in
   instrumented single sculling boats over a set distance using oar-shafts
   of different stiffness and length. There were slight differences in the
   measured boat accelerations and oarlock forces between rowing with the
   different oar configurations. However, the rower's inter-stroke
   inconsistencies in the biomechanical parameters were on the same order
   of magnitude as the measured differences between rowing with the
   different oar configurations. The results are discussed in relation to
   oar-shaft deflection and lever theory.}},

Abstract = {{Training surgeons in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) requires surgical
   residents to operate under the direction of a consultant. The inability
   of the instructing surgeon to point at the laparoscopic monitor without
   releasing the instruments remains a barrier to effective instruction.
   The wireless hands-free surgical pointer (WHaSP) has been developed to
   aid instruction during MIS.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and
   likeability of the WHaSP as an instructional tool compared with the
   conventional methods. Data were successfully collected during 103
   laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures, which had been randomized to
   use or not use the WHaSP as a teaching tool. Audio and video from the
   surgeries were recorded and analyzed. Instructing surgeons, operating
   surgeons, and camera assistants provided feedback through a
   post-operative questionnaire that used a five-level Likert scale. The
   questionnaire results were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test.
   There were no negative effects on surgery completion time or instruction
   practice due to the use of the WHaSP. The number of times an instructor
   surgeon pointed to the laparoscopic screen with their hand was
   significantly reduced when the WHaSP was utilized (p < 0.001). The
   questionnaires showed that WHaSP users found it to be comfortable, easy
   to use, and easy to control. Compared to when the WHaSP was not used,
   users found that communication was more effective (p = 0.002), locations
   were easier to communicate (p < 0.001), and instructions were easier to
   follow (p = 0.005).
   The WHaSP system was successfully used in surgery. It integrated
   seamlessly into existing equipment within the operating room and did not
   affect flow. The positive outcomes of utilizing the WHaSP were improved
   communication in the OR, improved efficiency and safety of the surgery,
   easy to use, and comfortable to wear. The surgeons showed a preference
   for utilizing the WHaSP if given a choice.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assist in the identification of renal vasculature and tumour
   boundaries in robot-assisted partial nephrectomy, robust ultrasound
   probe calibration and tracking methods are introduced. Contemporaneous
   image guidance during these crucial stages of the procedure should
   ultimately lead to improved safety and quality of outcome for the
   patient, through reduced positive margin rates, segmental clamping,
   shorter ischaemic times and nephron-sparing resection.
   Small KeyDot markers with circular dot patterns are attached to a
   miniature pickup ultrasound probe. Generic probe calibration is
   superseded by a more robust scheme based on a sequence of physical
   transducer measurements. Motion prediction combined with a reduced
   region-of-interest in the endoscopic video feed facilitates real-time
   tracking and registration performance at full HD resolutions.
   Quantitative analysis confirms that circular dot patterns result in an
   improved translational and rotational working envelope, in comparison
   with the previous chessboard pattern implementation. Furthermore,
   increased robustness is observed with respect to prevailing illumination
   levels and out-of-focus images due to relatively small endoscopic depths
   of field.
   Circular dot patterns should be employed in this context as they result
   in improved performance and robustness. This facilitates clinical usage
   and interpretation of the combined video and ultrasound overlay. The
   efficacy of the overall system is demonstrated in the first human
   clinical case.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-human multi-robot interaction is a complex system in which robots,
   e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles, may share information with a group of
   human operators to perform geographically-dispersed priority-based tasks
   within a specified time. In this complex system, the key is to optimally
   allocate tasks comprising of high-risk and low-risk information at
   multiple-levels in order to maximize effectiveness of the entire system
   given the limited resources. A multi-level programming model is
   developed in which an agent allocates information received from multiple
   robots to multiple team leaders who in turn distribute information to
   operators within their teams. The objective of the agent is to optimally
   allocate tasks to multiple team leaders to maximize the overall system
   performance and to minimize the processing cost and time while
   considering human factors. The developed model is solved using backward
   induction and details are presented in reverse time sequence. If human
   factors are included along with the productivity metrics then the
   performance of the multi-human multi-robot interaction systems can be

Volume = {{286}},
Pages = {{172-180}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pharmaceutical pellets are often packed into capsules as a multiple unit
   dosage form. The small, spherical particles contain the active
   ingredient or drug and are film coated for modified drug release.
   Evaluation of pellet film coatings requires invasive sample acquisition
   and extensive off-line testing leading to inaccurate results
   nonrepresentative of the pellets, identifying the need for a more
   reliable monitoring and control method. Passive acoustic emissions have
   been proven as a useful non-invasive monitoring tool with the ability to
   provide on-line and real-time measurements. The goal of this study was
   to assess the potential of passive acoustic emissions to monitor the
   pellet coat thickness of sugar coated glass pellets in a fluidized bed.
   A microphone attached to the exterior of a fluidized bed reflected
   changes in the signal amplitude corresponding to increases in pellet
   film coat thickness. Additional experiments showed that an increase in
   pellet mass produced larger acoustic emission amplitudes. Simulated
   pellet wall collisions identified the sensitivity of the acoustic
   emission measurements to detect differences in pellet collisions,
   necessary for monitoring thin film coatings. Overall, changes in the
   acoustic emission amplitude were shown to reflect the film coating,
   provided the pellets were sufficiently fluidized, indicating the
   potential for applying passive acoustic emission monitoring for the
   determination of a desired coating end-point Additional research to
   continue the development of passive acoustic emission monitoring is
   necessary for industrial fluid bed coating applications, with the
   potential to improve overall product quality and process
   cost-effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{In-site characterization of bed fluidity in a large gas-solid fluidized
   bed via electric conductance method}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{286}},
Pages = {{697-705}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In various industrial applications in which a liquid is sprayed into a
   gas-fluidized bed such as Fluid Cokers (TM), fluid catalytic crackers
   and gas-phase polymerization reactors, parts of the bed or even the
   complete bed might become defluidized due to high liquid loading,
   agglomeration or sintering of particles. For instance, in Fluid Cokers,
   operating at lower temperatures increases the yield of liquid products
   and reduces sulphur emissions, but local defluidization may result in
   some bed regions with a disastrous impact on reactor operation. This
   loss of bed fluidity is called ``bogging{''}.
   This study examines a novel method employing electrical conductance to
   detect local bogging in a large scale pilot fluid bed of about 7 tonnes
   of silica sand. Bogging is induced by increasing the liquid load as well
   as by changing the atomization performance of a spray nozzle. Several
   other experimental methods, such as differential and static pressure
   measurements, image processing, and temperature measurements are
   evaluated.
   When liquid is injected into a fluidized bed, a fraction forms liquid
   solid agglomerates while the remainder forms free moisture, consisting
   of individual particles coated with a thin layer of liquid. Liquid
   present as free moisture can be beneficial as it increases the mass and
   heat transfer processes and increases yields of valuable products. The
   results indicated that conductance measurements could be used for
   detecting bogging phenomena online. Bogging is shown to be directly
   associated with the local free moisture rather than the total moisture
   level. Increasing the atomization gas flowrate and, consequently, the
   free moisture, increases the bogging risk. A measurable critical, local
   free moisture value above which localized bogging occurs is identified.

Title = {{Effect of triaxial specimen size on engineering design and analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Triaxial tests are often used to determine the behavior and
   strength characteristics of soils. Specimen size can have a significant
   impact on the measured shear strength. Accordingly, the selected
   parameters affect the related geotechnical engineering analysis and
   design.
   Methods: We tested three different specimen sizes of loose Ottawa sand
   in triaxial compression tests. The measured shear strength and friction
   angle are used to explain some of the observed scale effects in
   engineering design and analysis. Critical state parameter and shear
   strength from the laboratory tests are employed to assess the static and
   seismic slope stability of an embankment dam, to calibrate a critical
   state soil constitutive model, to study the soil behavior under shallow
   foundations, and to evaluate liquefaction triggering and failure of
   retaining structures.
   Results: We show that all of these analyses can be significantly
   affected by the choice of the specimen size used to determine shear
   strength parameters.
   Conclusion: While using small size samples for determining shear
   strength parameters might result in un-conservative design, a large
   sample size is consequently a more accurate representation of soil
   strength conditions and field deformations.}},

Title = {{Sorption of phenanthrene by kaolin and efficacy of hydraulic versus

Abstract = {{Petroleum hydrocarbons are hydrophobic and tend to adhere to soil when
   released into the environment. Desorption of the contaminant from soil
   is necessary for most remediation technologies. In subsurface and for
   in-situ remediation, the dominant desorption mechanism is back
   diffusion.
   In this study, three tests were conducted to establish sorption and
   desorption kinetics for phenanthrene as a contaminant and kaolinite as a
   soil matrix. Sorption isotherm tests were conducted at temperatures of
   14, 22, and 30 degrees C using six phenanthrene solution containing
   concentrations from 300 to 800 mu g/L. Freundlich equation constant,
   K-f, values of 0.147, 0.133, and 0.109 mu gL(n)/g((1+n)) were determined
   for the three temperatures. Desorption tests were conducted using
   phenanthrene-free solution to determine desorption parameters at room
   temperature (similar to 22 degrees C). In addition, two test series were
   performed to compare phenanthrene desorption by hydraulic and
   electroosmotic flows at room temperature. A fixed wall hydraulic
   permeability apparatus was used to generate a hydraulic flow rate of 1.4
   x 10(-3) mL/s at a pressure of 260 kPa, while a low level direct current
   density (0.3-0.43 mA/cm(2)) was applied to generate electroosmotic flow
   rate equivalent to the hydraulic flow. The phenanthrene concentration in
   effluent samples after desorption by electroosmotic flow was found to be
   three to four times the concentration after desorption by hydraulic
   flow. Moreover, the power required in the hydraulic flow test was three
   orders of magnitude higher than the consumed power in the electrokinetic
   flow test. These results show that phenanthrene desorption by
   electroosmotic flow is more efficient than by hydraulic flow. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, pure mode I, pure mode II and mixed mode fracture
   behavior of an epoxy were investigated. Specifically, the mixed mode
   values of fracture toughness and critical strain energy release rate
   (CSERR) were measured. Specimens were subjected to mixed mode loading
   using compact tension shear (CTS) test. Some experimental modifications
   were found to be necessary to eliminate rotation and ensure crack
   propagation at the notch when testing epoxy specimens at high mode II
   loading. A failure criterion for the mixed mode loading of polymer is
   developed and its predictions are compared with the experimental
   results. The crack propagation direction in epoxy was investigated in
   this research as well. A detailed study of failure mechanisms on the
   fracture surface was performed. The results indicate that the increase
   in the value of toughness can be directly related to the fracture
   morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Improvement of the Nile Red fluorescence assay for determination of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Rapid determination of the specific lipid content of microalgae can
   accelerate screening and development of algae fuel application. Until
   recently, lipid content was commonly measured using gravimetric solvent
   extraction. Such methodology is time consuming and requires relatively
   large sample volumes. The Nile Red lipid assay has recently gained
   acceptance as it requires minute sample sizes. However, the current
   methodology is highly biased through interference of chlorophyll.
   Chlorophyll content can vary significantly between species, cultivation
   conditions, and culture age, remaining a serious but accepted problem.
   The assay was improved in this study in two ways. The cell dry weight
   determination was generalized by chemical chlorophyll removal prior to
   optical cell density measurements. Algae samples with different
   chlorophyll content were used to correlate optical measurements to cell
   dry weight and the correlation was substantially improved compared to
   non-treated samples (97 \% decrease in sum of squared residuals).
   Degradation of chlorophyll was also found to increase the emission
   intensity of Nile Red, presumably by removing a source of molecular
   absorption of red light, potentially increasing the detection threshold.
   Secondly, milk fat was used as a standard for correlating lipid
   concentration to Nile Red fluorescence. It was cheaper, more precise,
   easier to accurately prepare, and linearly correlated to lipid
   concentration over a broader range than triolein, largely due to the
   fact that it forms a stable lipid/water micro-emulsion. The improved
   methodology for the Nile Red lipid assay was found to significantly
   increase the working range and accuracy of the assay.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) has shown promise as an adipogenic
   bioscaffold for soft tissue augmentation and reconstruction. The
   objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of
   allogeneic adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (ASCs) on in vivo fat
   regeneration in DAT bioscaffolds using an immunocompetent rat model. ASC
   seeding significantly enhanced angiogenesis and adipogenesis, with cell
   tracking studies indicating that the newly-forming tissues were
   host-derived. Incorporating ASCs also mediated the inflammatory response
   and promoted a more constructive macrophage phenotype. A fraction of the
   CD163(+) macrophages in the implants expressed adipogenic markers, with
   higher levels of this ``adipocyte-like{''} phenotype in proximity to the
   developing adipose tissues. Our results indicate that the combination of
   ASCs and adipose extracellular matrix (ECM) provides an inductive
   microenvironment for adipose regeneration mediated by infiltrating host
   cell populations. The DAT scaffolds are a useful tissue-specific model
   system for investigating the mechanisms of in vivo adipogenesis that may
   help to develop a better understanding of this complex process in the
   context of both regeneration and disease. Overall, combining
   adipose-derived matrices with ASCs is a highly promising approach for
   the in situ regeneration of host-derived adipose tissue. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Stochastic process-based models are developed to characterize the

   process (NHGP). The defect generation and growth models are formulated
   in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, whereby the parameters of the
   models are evaluated from the in-line inspection (ILI) data through the
   Bayesian updating by accounting for the probability of detection (POD)
   and measurement errors associated with the ILI data. The Markov Chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation in conjunction with the data augmentation
   (DA) technique is employed to carry out the Bayesian updating. Numerical

Abstract = {{In this paper, a control strategy is proposed to achieve decentralized
   power management of a PV/battery hybrid unit in a droop-controlled
   islanded microgrid. In contrast to the common approach of controlling
   the PV unit as a current source, in the proposed strategy, the PV unit
   is controlled as a voltage source that follows a multi-segment adaptive
   power/frequency characteristic curve. The proposed power/frequency
   characteristics, of the hybrid unit and of the whole microgrid, adapt
   autonomously to the microgrid operating conditions so that the hybrid
   unit may supply the maximum PV power, match the load, and/or charge the
   battery, while maintaining the power balance in the microgrid and
   respecting the battery state-of-charge limits. These features are
   achieved without relying on a central management system and
   communications, as most of the existing algorithms do. The control
   strategy is implemented using multi-loop controllers, which provide
   smooth and autonomous transitions between the operating scenarios.
   Small-signal stability of the proposed control loops is investigated,
   and the system performance is experimentally validated on a 3.5 kVA
   microgrid.}},

Abstract = {{Background The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to
   bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent
   measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent
   data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across
   causes, age-sex groups, and countries. The GBD can be used to generate
   summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and
   healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative
   assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time.
   These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of
   variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic
   development.
   Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality,
   years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived
   with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000,
   2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the
   Sullivan method; 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty
   in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age,
   sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the
   sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95\% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD
   rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a
   composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed
   from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years,
   and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied
   hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to
   decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable,
   country, and time.
   Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by
   6.2 years (95\% UI 5.6-6.6), from 65.3 years (65.0-65.6) in 1990 to 71.5
   years (71.0-71.9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5.4 years (4.9-5.8),
   from 56.9 years (54.5-59.1) to 62.3 years (59.7-64.8), total DALYs fell
   by 3.6\% (0.3-7.4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people
   fell by 26.7\% (24.6-29.1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and
   nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and
   age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas
   for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY
   rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates
   declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs
   increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including
   cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne
   trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other
   causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart
   disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back
   and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more
   than 50\% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea,
   lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases;
   maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other
   communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases;
   musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However,
   sociodemographic status explained less than 10\% of the variance in DALY
   rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases;
   cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases;
   unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence.
   Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a
   shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and
   increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological
   disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most
   country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater
   than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across
   countries.
   Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing
   have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained
   relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer
   demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological
   transition-in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured
   change in disease burden-is useful, but there is tremendous variation in
   burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status.
   This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of
   DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and
   attendant actions.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion of articular cartilage is a concern following distal humeral
   hemiarthroplasty, because native cartilage surfaces are placed in
   contact with stiff metallic implant components, which causes decreases
   in contact area and increases in contact stresses. Recently, reverse
   engineered implants have been proposed which are intended to promote
   more natural contact mechanics by reproducing the native bone or
   cartilage shape. In this study, finite element modeling is used in order
   to calculate changes in cartilage contact areas and stresses following
   distal humeral hemiarthroplasty with commercially available and reverse
   engineered implant designs. At the ulna, decreases in contact area were
   -34 +/- 3\% (p=0.002), -27 +/- 1\% (p < 0.001) and -14 +/- 2\% (p=0.008)
   using commercially available, bone reverse engineered and cartilage
   reverse engineered designs, respectively. Peak contact stresses
   increased by 461 +/- 57\% (p=0.008), 387 +/- 127\% (p=0.229) and 165 +/-
   16\% (p=0.003). At the radius, decreases in contact area were -21 +/-
   3\% (p=0.013), 13 +/- 2\% (p<0.006) and -6 +/- 1\% (p=0.020), and peak
   contact stresses increased by 75 +/- 52\% (p>0.999), 241 +/- 32\%
   (p=0.010) and 61 +/- 10\% (p=0.021). Between the three different implant
   designs, the cartilage reverse engineered design yielded the largest
   contact areas and lowest contact stresses, but was still unable to
   reproduce the contact mechanics of the native joint. These findings
   align with a growing body of evidence indicating that although reverse
   engineered hemiarthroplasty implants can provide small improvements in
   contact mechanics when compared with commercially available designs,
   further optimization of shape and material properties is required in
   order reproduce native joint contact mechanics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present the first scattered light detections of the HD 106906 debris
   disk using the Gemini/Gemini Planet Imager in the infrared and Hubble
   Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys in the optical. HD
   106906 is a 13 Myr old F5V star in the Sco-Cen association, with a
   previously detected planet-mass candidate HD 106906b projected 650 AU
   from the host star. Our observations reveal a near edge-on debris disk
   that has a central cleared region with radius similar to 50 AU, and an
   outer extent >500 AU. The HST data show that the outer regions are
   highly asymmetric, resembling the ``needle{''} morphology seen for the
   HD 15115 debris disk. The planet candidate is oriented similar to 21
   degrees away from the position angle of the primary's debris disk,
   strongly suggesting non-coplanarity with the system. We hypothesize that
   HD 106906b could be dynamically involved in the perturbation of the
   primary's disk, and investigate whether or not there is evidence for a
   circumplanetary dust disk or cloud that is either primordial or captured
   from the primary We show that both the existing optical properties and
   near-infrared colors of HD 106906b are weakly consistent with this
   possibility, motivating future work to test for the observational
   signatures of dust surrounding the planet.}},

Title = {{A framework for improving microRNA prediction in non-human genomes}},
Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{The prediction of novel pre-microRNA (miRNA) from genomic sequence has
   received considerable attention recently. However, the majority of
   studies have focused on the human genome. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that sensitivity (correctly detecting true miRNA) is
   sustained when human-trained methods are applied to other species,
   however they have failed to report the dramatic drop in specificity (the
   ability to correctly reject non-miRNA sequences) in non-human genomes.
   Considering the ratio of true miRNA sequences to pseudo-miRNA sequences
   is on the order of 1:1000, such low specificity prevents the application
   of most existing tools to non-human genomes, as the number of false
   positives overwhelms the true predictions. We here introduce a framework
   (SMIRP) for creating species-specific miRNA prediction systems,
   leveraging sequence conservation and phylogenetic distance information.
   Substantial improvements in specificity and precision are obtained for
   four non-human test species when our framework is applied to three
   different prediction systems representing two types of classifiers
   (support vector machine and Random Forest), based on three different
   feature sets, with both human-specific and taxon-wide training data. The
   SMIRP framework is potentially applicable to all miRNA prediction
   systems and we expect substantial improvement in precision and
   specificity, while sustaining sensitivity, independent of the machine
   learning technique chosen.}},

Abstract = {{A spectral algorithm based on the immersed boundary conditions (IBC)
   concept has been developed for the analysis of flows in channels bounded

   arbitrary profile. The algorithm uses a fixed computational domain with
   the flow domain immersed in its interior. Boundary conditions enter the
   algorithm in the form of constraints. The spatial discretization uses a
   Fourier expansion in the stream-wise direction and a Chebyshev expansion
   in the wall-normal direction. Use of the Galileo transformation converts
   the unsteady problem into a steady one. An efficient solver which takes
   advantage of the structure of the coefficient matrix has been used. It
   is demonstrated that the method can be extended to more extreme
   geometries using the overdetermined formulation. Various tests confirm
   the spectral accuracy of the algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In Alzheimer's disease, accumulation of soluble oligomers of
   beta-amyloid peptide is known to be highly toxic, causing disturbances
   in synaptic activity and neuronal death. Multiple studies relate these
   effects to increased oxidative stress and aberrant activity of
   calcium-permeable cation channels leading to calcium imbalance. The
   transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, a
   Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel activated by oxidative
   stress, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and more
   recently in amyloid-induced toxicity. Here we show that the function of
   TRPM2 is augmented by treatment of cultured neurons with beta-amyloid
   oligomers. Aged APP/PS1 Alzheimer's mouse model showed increased levels
   of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, protein disulfide isomerase and
   phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha, as well as
   decreased levels of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. Elimination of
   TRPM2 in APP/PS1 mice corrected these abnormal responses without
   affecting plaque burden. These effects of TRPM2 seem to be selective for
   beta-amyloid toxicity, as ER stress responses to thapsigargin or
   tunicamycin in TRPM2(-/-) neurons was identical to that of wild-type
   neurons. Moreover, reduced microglial activation was observed in
   TRPM2(-/-)/APP/PS1 hippocampus compared with APP/PS1 mice. In addition,
   age-dependent spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice were reversed in
   TRPM2(-/-)/APP/PS1 mice. These results reveal the importance of TRPM2
   for beta-amyloid neuronal toxicity, suggesting that TRPM2 activity could
   be potentially targeted to improve outcomes in Alzheimer's disease.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-induced changes in the solid-state structures and transport
   properties of three oxobenzene-bridged bisdithiazolyl radicals 2 (R = H,
   F, Ph) over the range 0-15 GPa are described. All three materials
   experience compression of their pi-stacked architecture, be it (i) 1D
   ABABAB pi-stack (R = Ph), (ii) quasi-1D slipped pi-stack (R = H), or
   (iii) 2D brick-wall pi-stack (R = F). R = H undergoes two structural
   phase transitions, neither of R = F, Ph display any phase change. All
   three radicals order as spin-canted antiferromagnets, but spin-canted
   ordering is lost at pressures <1.5 GPa. At room temperature, their
   electrical conductivity increases rapidly with pressure, and the thermal
   activation energy for conduction Ea, is eliminated at pressures ranging
   from similar to 3 GPa for R = F to similar to 12 GPa for R = Ph,
   heralding formation of a highly correlated (or bad) metallic state. For
   R = F, H the pressure-induced Mott insulator to metal conversion has
   been tracked by measurements of optical conductivity at ambient
   temperature and electrical resistivity at low temperature. For R = F
   compression to 6.2 GPa leads to a quasiquadratic temperature dependence
   of the resistivity over the range 5-300 K, consistent with formation of
   a 2D Fermi liquid state. DFT band structure calculations suggest that
   the ease of metallization of these radicals can be ascribed to their
   multiorbital character. Mixing and overlap of SOMO- and LUMO-based bands
   affords an increased kinetic energy stabilization of the metallic state
   relative to a single SOMO-based band system.}},

Abstract = {{We present Kepler, Spitzer Space Telescope, Gemini-North, MMT, and Kitt
   Peak observations of the L1 dwarf WISEP J190648.47+401106.8. We find
   that the Kepler optical light curve is consistent in phase and amplitude
   over nearly two years of monitoring, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of
   1.4\%. Spitzer Infrared Array Camera 3.6 mu m observations are in phase
   with Kepler, with similar light curve shapes and peak-to-peak amplitudes
   of 1.1\%, but at 4.5 mu m, the variability has an amplitude of <0.1\%.
   Chromospheric Ha emission is variable but not synced with the stable
   Kepler light curve. A single dark spot can reproduce the light curve but
   is not a unique solution. An inhomogeneous cloud deck, specifically a
   region of thick cloud cover, can explain the multi-wavelength data of
   this ultracool dwarf and need not be coupled with the asynchronous
   magnetic emission variations. The long life of the cloud is in contrast
   with weather changes seen in cooler brown dwarfs on the timescale of
   hours and days.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of flow hydrodynamic on particle-droplet stability in
   Pickering emulsions (PE) is investigated both theoretically and
   experimentally under oscillatory shear conditions. The emulsions are
   stabilized by two types of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) nanoparticles
   (NPs) with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature. The more
   hydrophobic NPs (Zeolite Imidazolate-ZIF-8) remained attached to the
   droplets surface, and resulted in droplet sizes consistent with those
   predicted by a torque balance (TB) model. On the other hand, emulsions
   stabilized by the more hydrophilic NPs (Amine Materials of Institute of
   Lavoisier-MIL-101) had smaller size droplets than TB model predictions
   and broader size distributions at high oscillatory shear stresses. This
   was attributed to the stripping of the stabilizing NPs of the droplet
   surface at high shear leading to possible droplets coalescence and
   subsequent fragmentation. The analysis showed that, in a drop-by-drop
   emulsification using membranes or microporous surfaces, forces due to
   fluid shear stress as well as flow eddies acting on a droplet during
   formation are the most significant contributor to particles detachment
   from a droplet surface. Forces due to an eddy viscous shear or post
   detachment fluid shear are orders of magnitude smaller than desorption
   energy and do not contribute to particles detachment. Although the
   analysis is done for an oscillatory shear flow, the approach and the
   stability concept can be applied to other types of flow fields. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Context: Regulatory agencies are recommending the development of process
   analytical technologies (PAT) to improve the efficiency and product
   quality during pharmaceutical manufacturing.
   Objective: The objective of the research was to investigate the
   potential application of passive acoustic emission monitoring of a
   V-blender.
   Materials and methods: Trials were conducted with sugar spheres, lactose
   or MCC in a V-blender. Vibrations from acoustic emissions were measured
   using PCB Piezotronics accelerometers with ICP signal conditioners.
   Results and discussion: A wavelet filter was applied to the measured
   acoustic emissions to remove vibrations from the tumbling motion of the
   V-shell, allowing a focus on information about particle motion and
   interactions within the V-shell. The ideal sensor location was
   determined to be the lid of one of the V-shell arms due to the impact of
   the tumbling particles on the lid and transmission of the vibrations
   from other particle motion within the V-shell. The amplitude of
   vibrations increased with particle size due to larger particle momentum
   before a collision. The fill level and the V-shell scale also influenced
   the measured vibrations as particle motion was affected which in turn
   affected momentum. Changes in particle flowability could be detected
   through variations in the measured acoustic emissions.
   Conclusion: The measured vibrations from passive acoustic emissions
   reflected particle motion and interactions within a V-blender
   demonstrating potential as a monitoring method.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents an experimental observation of luminescence flash
   at the collapse phase of an oscillating bubble produced by a pulsed

   around tens of microseconds, which is much longer than the lifetime of
   laser and ultrasound induced luminescence flashes in nanoseconds and
   picoseconds, respectively. The pulse width of temperature waveform and
   minimum radius calculated at the collapse phase also show that the
   thermodynamic and dynamic signatures of the bubbles in this work are
   much larger than those of ultrasound and laser induced bubbles both in
   time and space scales. However, the peak temperature at the point of
   collapse is close to the results of ultrasound and laser induced
   bubbles. This result provides another possibility for accurate emission
   spectrum measurement other than amplification of the emitted light, such
   as increasing laser energy or sound energy or substituting water with

   (XPS), Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. It was confirmed
   that the obtained nanomaterials via a facile reflux approach show
   smaller size than that of hydrothermal method. Using cyclic
   voltammograms, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and
   galvanostatical charge/discharge testing, the SnO2 anodes with different
   nanoparticle sizes exhibit various electrochemical performance with
   lithium, originating from the enormous volume changes associated with
   the alloying and de-alloying processes. It was demonstrated that the
   anode material with smaller nanoparticle size performs much better
   lithium storage performance. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle transport and retention within porous media is treated by
   conceptualizing the porous media as a series of independent collectors
   (e.g., Colloid Filtration Theory). This conceptualization assumes that
   flow phenomena near grain-grain contacts, such as immobile zones (areas
   of low flow), exert a negligible influence on nanoparticle transport and
   assumes that retention and release of particles depends only on surface
   chemistry. This study investigated the impact of immobile zones on
   nanoparticle transport and retention by employing synchrotron X-ray
   computed microtomography (SXCMT) to examine pore-scale silver
   nanoparticle distributions during transport through three sand columns:
   uniform iron oxide, uniform quartz, and well-graded quartz. Extended
   tailing was observed during the elution phase of all experiments
   suggesting that hydraulic retention in immobile zones, not detachment
   from grains, was the source of tailing. A numerical simulation of fluid
   flow through an SXCMT data set predicted the presence of immobile zones
   near grain-grain contacts. SXCMT-determined silver nanoparticle
   concentrations observed that significantly lower nanoparticle
   concentrations existed near grain-grain contacts throughout the duration
   of all experiments. In addition, the SXCMT-determined pore-scale
   concentration gradients were found to be independent of surface
   chemistry and grain size distribution, suggesting that immobile zones
   limit the diffusive transport of nanoparticles toward the collectors.
   These results suggest that the well-known overprediction of nanoparticle
   retention by traditional CFT may be due to ignoring the influences of
   grain-grain contacts and immobile zones. As such, accurate prediction of
   nanoparticle transport requires consideration of immobile zones and
   their influence on both hydraulic and surface retention.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of supplemental damping systems (e.g., the dynamic
   vibration absorbers (DVAs)) to mitigate excessive tall building
   vibrations induced by external dynamic loads (wind storms or
   earthquakes) has increased over the last several decades. A tuned liquid
   damper (TLD) is a specific type of the DVAs that consists of a rigid
   tank which is partially filled with a liquid, usually water. The
   sloshing liquid inside the tank provides inertia forces that counteract
   the forces acting on the structure, thus reducing the building motion. A
   single sway mode of vibration is usually targeted, however, for certain
   structures multiple modes may need to be suppressed. Moreover, the
   location of the TLD on the floor plate is important for certain modes,
   such as a torsionally dominate mode. In this paper, a three-dimensional
   (3D) finite element (FE) structure-TLD system model (3D-structure-TLD)
   is proposed where the TLDs can be positioned at any location on the
   structure allowing the most effective positions in reducing the
   structure's dynamic response to be determined. Therefore, the response
   of a 3D structure (tower, high-rise building, bridge, etc.) fitted with
   single or multiple TLD(s) and subjected to dynamic excitation can be
   predicted using the proposed FE model. For torsionally sensitive
   structure (eccentric/irregular structures), this type of 3D numerical
   analysis is highly recommended. Two nonlinear TLD models are employed to
   simulate the TLD and implemented in the FE model. The 3D-structure-TLD
   system model is validated for the cases of sinusoidal and random
   excitation forces using existing experimental test values. Results from
   the 3D-structure-TLD system model are found to be in excellent agreement
   with values obtained from experimental tests.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive motions in buildings cause occupants to become uncomfortable
   and nervous. This is particularly detrimental to the tenants and
   ultimately the owner of the building, with respect to financial
   considerations. Serviceability issues, such as excessive accelerations
   and inter-story drifts, are more prevalent today due to advancements in
   the structural systems, strength of materials, and design practices.
   These factors allow buildings to be taller, lighter, and more flexible,
   thereby exacerbating the impact of dynamic responses. There is a growing
   need for innovative and effective techniques to reduce the
   serviceability responses of these tall buildings. The current study
   considers a case study of a real building to show the effectiveness and
   robustness of the TLD in reducing the coupled lateral-torsional motion
   of this high-rise building under wind loading. Three unique multi-modal
   TLD systems are designed specifically to mitigate the torsional response
   of the building. A procedure is developed to analyze a structure-TLD
   system using High Frequency Force Balance (HFFB) test data from the
   Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Laboratory (BLWTL) at the University of
   Western Ontario. The effectiveness of the unique TLD systems is
   investigated. In addition, a parametric study is conducted to determine
   the robustness of the systems in reducing the serviceability responses.
   Three practical parameters are varied to investigate the robustness of
   the TLD system: the height of water inside the tanks, the amplitude
   modification factor, and the structural modal frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulus-specific adaptation refers to a neural response reduction to a
   repeated stimulus that does not generalize to other stimuli. However,
   stimulus-specific adaptation appears to be influenced by additional
   factors. For example, the statistical distribution of tone frequencies
   has recently been shown to dynamically alter stimulus-specific
   adaptation in human auditory cortex. The present study investigated
   whether statistical stimulus distributions also affect stimulus-specific
   adaptation at an earlier stage of the auditory hierarchy. Neural spiking
   activity and local field potentials were recorded from inferior
   colliculus neurons of rats while tones were presented in oddball
   sequences that formed two different statistical contexts. Each sequence
   consisted of a repeatedly presented tone (standard) and three rare
   deviants of different magnitudes (small, moderate, large spectral
   change). The critical manipulation was the relative probability with
   which large spectral changes occurred. In one context the probability
   was high (relative to all deviants), while it was low in the other
   context. We observed larger responses for deviants compared with
   standards, confirming previous reports of increased response adaptation
   for frequently presented tones. Importantly, the statistical context in
   which tones were presented strongly modulated stimulus-specific
   adaptation. Physically and probabilistically identical stimuli (moderate
   deviants) in the two statistical contexts elicited different response
   magnitudes consistent with neural gain changes and thus neural
   sensitivity adjustments induced by the spectral range of a stimulus
   distribution. The data show that already at the level of the inferior
   colliculus stimulus-specific adaptation is dynamically altered by the
   statistical context in which stimuli occur.}},

Abstract = {{This study extends the stochastic finite-fault model (SFFM) to simulate
   spatially correlated and coherent records for a scenario seismic event
   and estimates the seismic loss of spatially distributed buildings using
   the simulated records. The extension incorporates the spatial coherency
   and the spatially correlated disturbance. The simulated records are used
   to evaluate nonlinear inelastic responses of buildings modeled as
   nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom systems and to estimate their
   aggregate seismic loss. Use of the simulated records in such a manner is
   advantageous since it is applicable to buildings modeled as single- or
   multi-degree-of-freedom systems with different hysteretic behaviors. The
   procedure is used to investigate the sensitivity of the seismic loss of
   a portfolio of hypothetical buildings in downtown Vancouver subjected to
   a scenario event. The results show that the probability distribution and
   the quantile of the seismic loss are influenced significantly by the
   degree of spatial correlation and by nonlinear inelastic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to apply a novel dry powder technology to coat
   pellets with different coating materials grounded into fine powders.
   Piroxicam, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was used as the
   active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Eudragit (R) EPO, Eudragit (R)
   RS/RL and Acryl EZE were used as the coating materials to achieve
   immediate release, sustained release and delayed release, respectively.
   Three steps including preheating, powder adhesion and curing were
   carried out to form the coating film while liquid plasticizers were used
   to decrease the glass transition temperature of coating powders and also
   served to reduce the electrical resistance of pellets. Results of SEM
   indicated coating film could be better formed by increasing curing
   temperature or extending curing time. Dissolution tests showed that
   three different drug release profiles, including immediate release,
   sustained release and delayed release, were achieved by this coating
   technology with different coating formulations. And the dry powder
   coated pellets using this developed technology exhibited an excellent
   stability with I. month at 40 degrees C/75\% RH. The coating procedure
   could be shortened to within 120 min and the use of fluidized hot air
   was minimized, both cutting down the overall cost dramatically compared
   to organic solvent coating and aqueous coating. All results demonstrated
   that the novel electrostatic dry powder coating method is a promising
   technology in the pharmaceutical coating industry. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fire safety is a critical criterion for designing reinforced concrete

   structural engineers need design tools to assess the capacity of

   beams exposed to elevated temperatures. The proposed method extends the
   use of existing ambient temperature methods by accounting for the effect
   of elevated temperatures on material properties. It involves heat
   transfer analysis, evaluation of the material properties at elevated
   temperatures, and application of the modified compression field theory
   to estimate the shear capacity. The method is validated using
   experimental results by others. A parametric study is then conducted to
   investigate the effects of different parameters on the shear capacity of

Abstract = {{The performance of a dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying system

   the relay and the destination for maximizing the outage probability is
   analyzed. It is shown that for both fading environments when the jammer
   power is sufficiently large, jamming the relay and the destination with
   equal power allocation is optimal, whereas when the jamming power is
   low, more power should be allocated to jam any of the source-relay and
   relay-destination links having lower receiving signal power. In
   addition, the difference between the optimal and the equal power
   allocation performance is investigated. Analytical results are verified

Abstract = {{In this paper, we design an integrated protocol that jointly optimizes
   the performance of the physical, medium access control (MAC), and
   network layers. Our goal is to minimize total network energy consumption
   while delivering a minimum required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each
   intended receiver within the network. At the MAC layer, we develop a
   cooperative automatic repeat request (ARQ) system, in which the relay
   nodes assist the source with its retransmission attempts. A complete
   analytic framework for the cooperative system is developed. Using this
   framework, we find the optimum transmission energy at the physical
   layer. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in
   minimizing energy consumption, we propose two cooperative routing
   algorithms at the network layer. The proposed algorithms utilize the
   derived cooperative link cost as a basic building block. Through
   analysis and simulations, it is shown that over a single hop,
   cooperative transmission can achieve energy savings of up to 73\%, as
   compared with noncooperative transmission. The simulation results also
   demonstrate that the proposed routing algorithms can achieve significant
   energy savings while using fewer hops, as compared with the baseline
   cooperative and noncooperative routing algorithms.}},

   Testing}},
Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Cone penetration testing (CPT) has become the industry standard for in
   situ testing of cohesionless soils, and in particular, field
   liquefaction evaluation. The empirical methods for the interpretation of
   CPT data are either based on field data or the observation of CPT
   measurements in laboratory samples. In this study, a miniature cone
   penetrometer (with a diameter of 6mm) is developed for understanding the
   response of loose to medium-dense sands. A modified triaxial cell is
   used for sample preparation and containment of the sample during cone
   penetration. The miniature cone can measure cone tip resistance, sleeve
   friction, and excess pore water pressure developed at the cone tip.
   While cone tip resistance is measured by a separate load cell, sleeve
   friction is obtained by subtracting cone tip resistance from a combined
   measurement of tip resistance and sleeve frictional force. Due to the
   free-draining nature of the sand tested in this study, no excess pore
   water pressure is developed during cone penetration. The measured data
   from the miniature cone are verified by comparison with CPT resistances
   measured in several other calibration chamber experiments on similar
   sands. Compared to a large calibration chamber with a standard size
   cone, the miniature cone allows quicker and less expensive CPT
   experiments in a more uniform sample.}},

Abstract = {{Aim An exploratory study of the relationship between cumulative exposure
   to subcutaneous (sc) interferon (IFN) beta-1a treatment and other
   possible prognostic factors with long-term clinical outcomes in
   relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
   Methods Patients in the original PRISMS study were invited to a single
   follow-up visit 15 years after initial randomisation (PRISMS-15).
   Outcomes over 15 years were compared in the lowest and highest quartile
   of the cumulative sc IFN beta-1a dose groups, and according to total
   time receiving sc IFN beta-1a as a continuous variable per 5 years of
   treatment. Potential prognostic factors for outcomes were analysed.
   Results Of 560 patients randomised in PRISMS, 291 returned for PRISMS-15
   and 290 (51.8\%) were analysed. Higher cumulative dose exposure and
   longer treatment time appeared to be associated with better outcomes on:
   annualised relapse rate, number of relapses, time to Expanded Disability
   Status Scale (EDSS) progression, change in EDSS, proportions of patients
   with EDSS = 4 or = 6, = 5 relapses and EDSS < 4 or < 6, and time to
   conversion to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Higher dose exposure was
   associated with lower proportions of patients with EDSS progression and
   conversion to SPMS, and longer time on treatment with lower risk of
   first relapse. Change in EDSS from baseline to 24 months was a strong
   predictor of evaluated clinical outcomes over 15 years.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that higher cumulative exposure to sc
   IFN beta-1a may be associated with better clinical outcomes, and early
   change in EDSS score may have prognostic value, over many years, in
   RRMS.}},

Abstract = {{Polyisobutylene (PIB) and its copolymers are used in a wide range of
   commercial products owing to their high chemical stability,
   impermeability, elasticity, and biocompatibility. The development of
   arborescent PIB (arb-PIB) opens many new possibilities for tuning PIB's
   properties and for introducing new functionalities. In this work,
   arb-PIB with short isoprene-rich terminal sequences (arb-PIB-co-IP) was
   functionalized to provide arborescent epoxide, allylic alcohol, and
   carboxylic acid derivatives of PIB. The carboxylic acid derivative was
   used to conjugate the antiproliferative agent paclitaxel (PTX) for
   investigation as a potential vascular stent coating. The thermal,
   tensile, and rheological properties of all of the functionalized arb-PIB
   materials were studied and compared to their linear analogues in order
   to gain insight into the effects of polymer architecture on these
   properties as well as to determine their suitability as potential
   medical device coatings. A coating using the PTX conjugate was found to
   release PTX much more slowly than control formulations with physically
   encapsulated drug, yet was still able to prevent cell adhesion and
   proliferation on their surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a computer-aided intervention

   mean central frequency and wavelet features extracted from a group of
   patients can be used to build a nonlinear classifier which can be
   applied successfully to differentiate between cancerous and normal
   tissue regions of an unseen patient. Results: In a cross-validation
   strategy, we show an average area under receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 and classification accuracy of 80\%.
   To validate our results, we present a detailed ultrasound to histology

Abstract = {{In surface-based registration for image-guided interventions, the
   presence of missing data can be a significant issue. This often arises
   with real-time imaging modalities such as ultrasound, where poor
   contrast can make tissue boundaries difficult to distinguish from
   surrounding tissue. Missing data poses two challenges: ambiguity in
   establishing correspondences; and extrapolation of the deformation field
   to those missing regions. To address these, we present a novel non-rigid
   registration method. For establishing correspondences, we use a
   probabilistic framework based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that
   treats one surface as a potentially partial observation. To extrapolate
   and constrain the deformation field, we incorporate biomechanical prior
   knowledge in the form of a finite element model (FEM). We validate the
   algorithm, referred to as GMM-FEM, in the context of prostate
   interventions. Our method leads to a significant reduction in target
   registration error (TRE) compared to similar state-of-the-art
   registration algorithms in the case of missing data up to 30\%, with a
   mean TRE of 2.6 mm. The method also performs well when full
   segmentations are available, leading to TREs that are comparable to or
   better than other surface-based techniques. We also analyze robustness
   of our approach, showing that GMM-FEM is a practical and reliable
   solution for surface-based registration.}},

Title = {{A framework for quantification and visualization of segmentation
   accuracy and variability in 3D lateral ventricle ultrasound images of
   preterm neonates}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of brain
   injury in preterm neonates. Three dimensional ultrasound (US) imaging
   systems have been developed to visualize 3D anatomical structure of
   preterm neonatal intracranial ventricular system with IVH and
   ventricular dilation. To allow quantitative analysis, the ventricle
   system is required to be segmented accurately and efficiently from 3D US
   images. Although semiautomatic segmentation algorithms have been
   developed, local segmentation accuracy and variability associated with
   these algorithms should be evaluated statistically before they can be
   applied in clinical settings. This work proposes a statistical framework
   to quantify the local accuracy and variability and performs statistical
   tests to identify locations where the semiautomatically segmented
   surfaces are significantly different from manually segmented surfaces.
   Methods: Three dimensional lateral ventricle US images of preterm
   neonates were each segmented six times manually and using a
   semiautomated segmentation algorithm. The local difference between
   manually and algorithmically segmented surfaces as well as the
   segmentation variability for each method was computed and superimposed
   on the ventricular surface of each subject. To summarize the
   segmentation performance for a whole group of subjects, the
   subject-specific local difference and standard deviation maps were
   registered onto a 3D template ventricular surface using a nonrigid
   registration algorithm. Pointwise, intersubject average accuracy and
   pooled variability for the whole group of subjects can be computed and
   visualized on the template surface, providing a summary of performance
   of the segmentation algorithm for the whole group of ventricles with
   highly variable geometry. In addition to pointwise statistical analysis
   performed on the template surface, statistical conclusion regarding the
   accuracy of the segmentation algorithm was made for subregions and the
   whole ventricle with the spatial correlation of pointwise accuracy taken
   into account.
   Results: Ten 3D US images were involved in this study. Pointwise local
   difference,Delta S, its absolute value vertical bar Delta S vertical bar
   as well as the standard deviations of the manual and algorithm
   segmentations were computed and superimposed on the each ventricle
   surface. Regions with lower segmentation accuracy and higher
   segmentation variability can be identified from these maps, and the
   localized information was applied to improve the accuracy of the
   algorithm. Intersubject average Delta S and vertical bar Delta S
   vertical bar as well as pooled standard deviations was computed on the
   template surface. Intersubject average Delta S and vertical bar Delta S
   vertical bar indicated that the algorithm underestimated regions in the
   neighborhood of the tips of anterior, inferior, and posterior horns.
   Intersubject pooled standard deviations indicated that manual
   segmentation had a higher segmentation variability than algorithm
   segmentation over the whole ventricle. Statistical analysis on the
   template surface showed that there was significant difference between
   algorithm and manual methods for segmenting the right lateral ventricle
   but not for the left lateral ventricle.
   Conclusions: A framework was proposed for evaluating, visualizing, and
   summarizing the local accuracy and variability of a segmentation
   algorithm. This framework can be used for improving the accuracy of
   segmentation algorithms, as well as providing useful feedback to improve
   the manual segmentation performance. More importantly, this framework
   can be applied for longitudinal monitoring of local ventricular changes
   of neonates with IVH. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the heat transfer and X-ray diffraction patterns
   of solidified molten salt droplets in heat recovery processes of a
   thermochemical Cu-Cl cycle of hydrogen production. It is essential to
   recover the heat of the molten salt to enhance the overall thermal

   recovery within the cycle can be achieved by cooling and solidifying the
   molten salt exiting an oxygen reactor. Heat recovery from the molten
   salt is achieved by dispersing the molten stream into droplets. In this
   paper, an analytical study and experimental investigation of the thermal
   phenomena of a falling droplet quenched into water is presented,
   involving the droplet surface temperature during descent and resulting
   composition change in the quench process. The results show that it is
   feasible to quench the molten salt droplets for an efficient heat
   recovery process without introducing any material imbalance for the
   overall cycle integration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The response of buried box culverts is a complex soil-structure
   interaction problem, where the relative stiffness between the soil and
   structure is a critical factor. In addition, soil arching is an
   important aspect of the soil-culvert interaction problem. A series of
   static scaled physical model centrifuge tests were performed to
   investigate soil-culvert interaction. Two different box culvert
   thicknesses and Nevada sand specimens with different relative densities
   were used to explore the interaction between the sand and box culverts
   under different conditions. The static loading consisted of the
   self-weight from the soil body. The responses of the box culvert were
   recorded for all loading conditions. The results were evaluated in terms
   of bending moment, soil pressure, and soil-culvert interaction factors.
   Soil pressures were evaluated using different experimental methods,
   which provided comparable results. The soil pressure observed on the
   culvert top slab showed parabolic distribution, i.e., higher values at
   the edges and lower at the centre than the theoretical vertical soil
   (overburden) pressure. The horizontal soil pressure on the side wall
   increased with depth. The soil-culvert interaction factors decreased at
   the centre and increased at the edges of the top slab, as the thickness
   and relative stiffness of the culvert decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Box culverts may be constructed in active seismic areas, where ground
   shaking or ground failures can impose considerable earth pressures on
   them. In this study, the seismic response of box culverts was
   investigated experimentally and numerically. A series of scaled
   centrifuge tests was performed and subjected to three different
   earthquake signals, with different amplitudes and frequencies. Two
   values of culvert wall thickness and two values of sand relative density
   were considered in the experimental program. Experimental results are
   presented in terms of comparisons of seismic bending moments. These
   results were used to calibrate and verify two-dimensional numerical
   models developed using the computer program FLAC. The verified models
   were then used to investigate the effect of earthquake intensity and
   frequency, height of soil cover, and culvert thickness on the seismic
   bending moments for the different culvert sections. Based on the
   analysis results, charts are presented to aid in the seismic design of
   box culverts.}},

Abstract = {{In a number of recent publications, it has been shown that the vortex

Abstract = {{In this paper, a strategy that employs an adaptive voltage droop control
   to achieve accurate reactive power sharing is investigated. Instead of
   controlling the output voltage of the inverter directly, the voltage
   droop slope is tuned to compensate for the mismatch in the voltage drops
   across feeders by using communication links. If the communication
   channel is disrupted, the controller will operate with the last tuned
   droop coefficient, which is shown to still outperform the controller
   with the initial fixed droop coefficient. Also, the net control action
   of the adaptive droop terms is demonstrated to have a negligible effect
   on the microgrid bus voltage. Since communication is not used within the
   tuning control loop, the strategy is inherently immune to delays in
   communication links. A small-signal model of the proposed controller is
   presented, and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is
   demonstrated on a 1.2 kVA prototype microgrid.}},

Abstract = {{Pure monazite (m)- and zircon (t)-type LaVO4 and LaVO4:Eu3+ were
   successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The high pressure
   behavior of m- and t-LaVO4 nanoparticles has been investigated using
   Raman scattering techniques at room temperature. Raman measurements
   reveal a slight change for m-LaVO4 at 11.2 GPa because of an
   isostructural phase transition. However, striking changes in Raman
   spectra indicate a pressure-induced irreversible phase transition from
   the zircon to monazite structure for t-LaVO4 at around 5.9 GPa. The
   evolution of the luminescence spectra of t-LaVO4:Eu3+ has also been
   studied during the pressure-induced phase transition. It is observed
   that pressure has a great influence on the fluorescence intensity and
   the energy levels, which allows a more in-depth understanding of the
   nature of the pressure-induced phase transition for t-LaVO4. This result
   further confirms the conclusion that zircon-type RVO4 compounds with
   larger rare-earth cations will experience zircon to monazite phase
   transition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of experimental, theoretical, and imaging methodologies is
   used to examine the hierarchical structure and function of
   intramyocardial arteriolar trees in porcine hearts to provide a window
   onto a region of myocardial microvasculature which has been difficult to
   fully explore so far. A total of 66 microvascular trees from 6 isolated
   myocardial specimens were analyzed, with a cumulative number of 2438
   arteriolar branches greater than or equal to 40 mu m lumen diameter. The
   distribution of flow rates within each tree was derived from an assumed
   power law relationship for that tree between the diameter of vessel
   segments and flow rates that are consistent with that power law and
   subject to conservation of mass along hierarchical structure of the
   tree. The results indicate that the power law index increases at levels
   of arteriolar vasculature closer to the capillary level, consistent with
   a concomitant decrease in shear stress acting on endothelial tissue.
   These results resolve a long standing predicament which could not be
   resolved previously because of lack of data about the 3D,
   interconnected, arterioles. In the context of myocardial perfusion, the
   results indicate that the coefficient of variation of flow rate in
   pre-capillary distal arterioles is high, suggesting that heterogeneity
   of flow rate in these arterioles is not entirely random but may be due
   at least in part to active control.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated a novel approach, two anodes technique (TAT), to
   hinder the base front advancement during electrokinetics in order to
   enhance the removal of copper (Cu) from a contaminated soil. Four series
   of tests were carried out using energy consumptions of 500, 750,1000,
   and 1250 Whr. The tests were performed with continuous and intermittent
   currents. Three identical electrokinetic cells were used to carry out
   the TAT tests as well as tests with conventional anode-cathode (CAC)
   configuration for comparison. Copper was used to artificially
   contaminate the soil (355 mg copper per kg of dry soil) due to the
   abundance of copper pollution sites and its ease of handling. Solar cell
   panels were used to generate the electric field required for the
   electrokinetic remediation process. At the end of each test, the soil
   was extruded from the cell and divided into four equal sections. Soil
   from each section was tested for water content, pH, and copper
   concentration. Part of the soil was squeezed and the pore fluid was
   collected and analyzed for pH and copper concentration. The results show
   that solar cells can provide electric field sufficient for
   electrokinetic remediation of Cu-contaminated soil. Tests conducted
   using intermittent current showed lower pH values in the soil sections
   along with higher copper removal compared to tests performed with a
   continuous current for the same energy consumption. Higher copper
   removal was observed in TAT tests compared to CAC tests. It was found
   that the position of the secondary anode influenced the outcome of TAT
   test. Placing the secondary anode at 15 mm from the cathode was found to
   achieve higher copper removal than placing it at 50 mm from the cathode.
   The TAT technique was successful in removing the copper from 75\% of the
   soil with the highest removal of 92\% occurring near the anode. A
   comparison of copper removal from the TAT and CAC tests clearly showed
   that TAT was effective in combating the advancement of the base front
   and therefore minimizing premature copper precipitation. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Specified wind speeds or their corresponding wind velocity pressures
   tabulated in structural design codes are spatially interpolated from the
   extreme value analysis results of wind records at meteorological
   stations. Commonly used spatial interpolation methods are compared in
   this study to determine their suitability to interpolate the surfaces or
   contour maps of the statistics of the annual maximum wind speed. For the
   analysis, multiyear wind records from 235 meteorological stations in
   Canada are considered. The interpolation methods include several
   deterministic methods and geostatistical methods {[}kriging (KO) and
   cokriging (Co-KO)]. To compare the performance of the methods,
   cross-validation statistical analysis was carried out for two approaches
   to estimate the T-year return period value of the wind speed: (1)
   directly interpolate it from the T-year return period value of the wind
   speeds at the meteorological stations, and (2) calculate it using the
   mean and coefficient of variation of the extreme wind speed interpolated
   from those at meteorological stations. Analysis results indicate that
   among the considered interpolation methods, the completely regularized
   spline, spline with tension, KO and Co-KO are the preferred methods. The
   first two lead to interpolated surfaces with more details; the last two
   result in relatively smooth interpolated surfaces. (c) 2014 American

Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effects of relative density difference on the dilution and height of
   vertical negative buoyant jets were investigated experimentally. These
   effects, which are related to fluid density, occurred in addition to the
   buoyancy effects commonly parameterized by the densimetric Froude
   number. The density effects have generally been ignored in previous
   investigations and in practice on the basis of Boussinesq's
   approximation. The density effects could, however, be relevant in
   connection to hypersaline discharges from desalination plants and dense
   discharges from oil and potash mining industries. A series of seven
   upward fountain experiments were performed in the laboratory to carry
   out this investigation. The flow was turbulent, the relative density
   difference varied from 0.0014 to 0.064, and the densimetric Froude
   number varied from 2.13 to 15.7. The results showed that an increase in
   the relative density difference reduced both the minimum return dilution
   and maximum height of the fountains. The observed maximum reduction in
   dilution was 48\%, and the maximum reduction of height was 19\%. The
   results also demonstrated that upward fountains are dynamically similar
   to downward fountains. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography
   reconstruction of white matter pathways can help guide brain tumor
   resection. However, DTI tracts are complex mathematical objects and the
   validity of tractography-derived information in clinical settings has
   yet to be fully established. To address this issue, we initiated the DTI
   Challenge, an international working group of clinicians and scientists
   whose goal was to provide standardized evaluation of tractography
   methods for neurosurgery. The purpose of this empirical study was to
   evaluate different tractography techniques in the first DTI Challenge
   workshop.
   METHODSEight international teams from leading institutions reconstructed
   the pyramidal tract in four neurosurgical cases presenting with a glioma
   near the motor cortex. Tractography methods included deterministic,
   probabilistic, filtered, and global approaches. Standardized evaluation
   of the tracts consisted in the qualitative review of the pyramidal
   pathways by a panel of neurosurgeons and DTI experts and the
   quantitative evaluation of the degree of agreement among methods.
   RESULTSThe evaluation of tractography reconstructions showed a great
   interalgorithm variability. Although most methods found projections of
   the pyramidal tract from the medial portion of the motor strip, only a
   few algorithms could trace the lateral projections from the hand, face,
   and tongue area. In addition, the structure of disagreement among
   methods was similar across hemispheres despite the anatomical
   distortions caused by pathological tissues.
   CONCLUSIONSThe DTI Challenge provides a benchmark for the standardized
   evaluation of tractography methods on neurosurgical data. This study
   suggests that there are still limitations to the clinical use of
   tractography for neurosurgical decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication and characterization results of sealed cavities formed by
   adhesive wafer bonding with dry etched Cyclotene 3000 (TM) are
   presented. The cavities were formed by patterning partially cured
   Cyclotene 3000 (TM) on an SOI wafer. The cavities were sealed by bonding
   the patterned layer at low temperature (210 degrees C) to another
   partially cured thin Cyclotene 3000 (TM) layer on a bare silicon wafer.
   The parameters for the vacuum bonding process were determined through an
   iterative process that involved optical and SEM inspection of the
   Cyclotene (TM) layers at the bonding surfaces to ensure a void and
   wrinkle free strong bond. The fabricated cavities were 28 mu m wide and
   800 nm high with a 10 mu m wide supporting wall. Cavities of other
   dimensions can also be realized following the same procedure. The
   cavities can be used to realize MEMS microphones, MEMS pressure sensors,
   capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUT), resonant
   cavities, and also for protective encapsulation of MEMS and
   microelectronic dies.}},

Title = {{Implant Design Variations in Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty
   Influence the Required Deltoid Force and Resultant Joint Load}},

Abstract = {{Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is widely used; however, the
   effects of RTSA geometric parameters on joint and muscle loading, which
   strongly influence implant survivorship and long-term function, are not
   well understood. By investigating these parameters, it should be
   possible to objectively optimize RTSA design and implantation technique.
   The purposes of this study were to evaluate the effect of RTSA implant
   design parameters on (1) the deltoid muscle forces required to produce
   abduction, and (2) the magnitude of joint load and (3) the loading angle
   throughout this motion. We also sought to determine how these parameters
   interacted.
   Seven cadaveric shoulders were tested using a muscle load-driven in
   vitro simulator to achieve repeatable motions. The effects of three
   implant parameters-humeral lateralization (0, 5, 10 mm), polyethylene
   thickness (3, 6, 9 mm), and glenosphere lateralization (0, 5, 10
   mm)-were assessed for the three outcomes: deltoid muscle force required
   to produce abduction, magnitude of joint load, and joint loading angle
   throughout abduction.
   Increasing humeral lateralization decreased deltoid forces required for
   active abduction (0 mm: 68\% +/- 8\% {[}95\% CI, 60\%-76\% body weight
   (BW)]; 10 mm: 65\% +/- 8\% {[}95\% CI, 58\%-72 \% BW]; p = 0.022).
   Increasing glenosphere lateralization increased deltoid force (0 mm:
   61\% +/- 8\% {[}95\% CI, 55\%-68\% BW]; 10 mm: 70\% +/- 11\% {[}95\% CI,
   60\%-81\% BW]; p = 0.007) and joint loads (0 mm: 53\% +/- 8\% {[}95\%
   CI, 46\%-61\% BW]; 10 mm: 70\% +/- 10\% {[}95\% CI, 61\%-79\% BW]; p <
   0.001). Increasing polyethylene cup thickness increased deltoid force (3
   mm: 65\% +/- 8\% {[}95\% CI, 56\%-73\% BW]; 9 mm: 68\% +/- 8\% {[}95\%
   CI, 61\%-75\% BW]; p = 0.03) and joint load (3 mm: 60\% +/- 8\% {[}95\%
   CI, 53\%-67\% BW]; 9 mm: 64\% +/- 10\% {[}95\% CI, 56\%-72\% BW]; p =
   0.034).
   Humeral lateralization was the only parameter that improved joint and
   muscle loading, whereas glenosphere lateralization resulted in increased
   loads. Humeral lateralization may be a useful implant parameter in
   countering some of the negative effects of glenosphere lateralization,
   but this should not be considered the sole solution for the negative
   effects of glenosphere lateralization. Overstuffing the articulation
   with progressively thicker humeral polyethylene inserts produced some
   adverse effects on deltoid muscle and joint loading.
   This systematic evaluation has determined that glenosphere
   lateralization produces marked negative effects on loading outcomes;
   however, the importance of avoiding scapular notching may outweigh these
   effects. Humeral lateralization's ability to decrease the effects of
   glenosphere lateralization was promising but further investigations are
   required to determine the effects of combined lateralization on
   functional outcomes including range of motion.}},

Abstract = {{Agglomeration of bed materials at a high temperature is one of the most
   important and challenging problems for fluidized-bed biomass boilers for
   thermal/power generation. Inorganic alkali compounds derived from the
   biomass ash, mainly potassium (K) and sodium (Na) can be problematic as
   they form low-melting alkali compounds and may also react with the bed
   material (silica sand) forming low-melting alkali silicates. These
   low-melting alkali compounds, if surpassing a critical amount, could
   coat the sand particles to form agglomerates, eventually leading to
   partial or complete de-fluidization of the reactor. In the present
   study, the critical amount of liquid (molten ash in real biomass boiler
   operations) that would result in severe bed agglomeration and
   defluidization was studied a small pilot-scale cold bubbling fluidized
   bed (BFB) test rig filled with silica sand particles as bed materials
   equipped with non-invasive capacitance sensors and differential pressure
   transducers. In the cold BFB test rig, a solution of glycerol-water
   (30\% v/v), employed to simulate molten ash in real biomass boiler
   operations, was injected to the bed at different quantities during the
   tests. It was found that in the present fluidization system the critical
   liquid amount causing bed agglomeration is likely 0.2 wt\% (in relation
   to the weight of bed material loaded) and 0.7 wt\% would cause severe
   channeling and de-fluidization conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The butanol yield of the classic fermentative acetone-butanol-ethanol

   show the positive impact of butyric acid on butanol yield under pH
   controlled conditions and the metabolic stages were monitored via online
   measurement of carbon dioxide formation, pH value and redox potential.
   Butyric acid could significantly increase the butanol yield at low pH

Abstract = {{According to psychology, not everybody can excel at all kinds of tasks.
   Thus, chances of a successful outcome of software development increase
   if people with particular personality types are assigned to their
   preferred tasks in the project. Likewise, software development depends
   significantly on how software practitioners perform their tasks. This
   empirical study surveys 100 Cuban software developers, who also teach or
   study at the University of Informatics Sciences in Havana, Cuba. This
   work aims to find possible patterns that link personality types to role
   preferences in a software life cycle. Among the various roles, system
   analyst, software designer, and programmer are found to be the most
   preferred among the participants. In contrast, software tester and
   software maintainer happen to be the least popular roles among software
   engineers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in various
   solvents is extremely important for its manufacturing and development as
   a drug. In this work, the solubility of two polymorphs of clopidogrel
   hydrogen sulfate (CHS) in the solvents of isopropanol (IPA) and ethyl
   acetate (EA) has been experimentally measured and theoretically
   predicted. The nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) and universal quasichemical
   (UNIQUAC) models have been employed for the solubility prediction. The
   results show that, the solubility of both polymorphs generally increases
   with the temperature and the content of isopropanol in the mixed
   solvent, and meanwhile polymorph I has a higher solubility than
   polymorph II which demonstrates that polymorph I is a metastable form.
   Through taking into account that the binary interaction parameters a(ij)
   (i not equal j) are temperature-dependent, both NRTL and UNIQUAC can
   well predict the solubility of the polymorphs of clopidogrel hydrogen
   sulfate in organic solvents with the average relative deviation of
   0.0545 and 0.0417, respectively. Finally the free energy difference
   between two polymorphs, Delta G, indicating their transformation
   tendency, has been calculated as a function of temperature, and in this
   way the transition temperature between two polymorphs is obtained as T =
   384.4 K. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Mechanisms underlying the profound parental effects on cognitive,
   emotional and social development in humans remain poorly understood.
   Studies with nonhuman models suggest variations in parental care affect
   the limbic system, influential to learning, autobiography and emotional
   regulation. In some research, nonoptimal care relates to decreases in
   neurogenesis, although other work suggests early-postnatal social
   adversity accelerates the maturation of limbic structures associated
   with emotional learning. We explored whether maternal sensitivity
   predicts human limbic system development and functional connectivity
   patterns in a small sample of human infants. When infants were 6 months
   of age, 20 mother-infant dyads attended a laboratory-based observational
   session and the infants underwent neuroimaging at the same age. After
   considering age at imaging, household income and postnatal maternal
   anxiety, regression analyses demonstrated significant indirect
   associations between maternal sensitivity and bilateral hippocampal
   volume at six months, with the majority of associations between
   sensitivity and the amygdala demonstrating similar indirect, but not
   significant results. Moreover, functional analyses revealed direct
   associations between maternal sensitivity and connectivity between the
   hippocampus and areas important for emotional regulation and
   socio-emotional functioning. Sensitivity additionally predicted indirect
   associations between limbic structures and regions related to
   autobiographical memory. Our volumetric results are consistent with
   research indicating accelerated limbic development in response to early
   social adversity, and in combination with our functional results, if
   replicated in a larger sample, may suggest that subtle, but important,
   variations in maternal care influence neuroanatomical trajectories
   important to future cognitive and emotional functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Waste polyurethane foams are becoming a serious environmental issue due
   to their low degradation rates upon environmental exposure. In order to
   accelerate foam degradation, this work examined a ``grafting-from{''}
   method in which polyurethane (PU) chains were grown directly from
   functionalized TiO2 nanoparticle surfaces. Both anatase and P25 TiO2
   nanoparticles were reached with 2,2-dimethylolpropionic acid (DMPA) to
   produce functionalized monomers, which were subsequently used for PU
   foaming in a ``grafting-from{''} polymerization approach. The
   photodegradation rate and degradation mechanism of synthesized PU foams
   was examined by exposure of foams to a UV weathering chamber from 0 to
   250 h with timed water spraying. The results show that anatase TiO2
   nanoparticles promote an increase in the degradation rate of
   polyurethane foams 120\% over unmodified foam at an optimized loading of
   3wt\% DMPA-TiO2(A). The presence of DMPA functionalized P25
   nanoparticles produced an increase in the degradation rate of 66\% over
   the unmodified foam at an optimized 1wt\% loading. The results of this
   study suggest the potential for enhancing the degradation of
   polyurethane foams using a nano-TiO2 functional monomer approach. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical investigation of the formation of the
   Trichel pulses in negative dc corona discharge for a needle-plane
   configuration in atmospheric air. A 2D axisymmetric model of the problem
   considering three charged species and consisting of a hyperboloid needle
   with a tip radius of 35 mu m and needle-plane spacing of 6 mm over the
   voltage range of -3.5 kV to -12 kV has been studied. A commercial finite
   element package COMSOL was used for simultaneously solving three
   convection-diffusion equations along with Poisson's equation. In order
   to obtain a better understanding of the processes which lead to the
   pulse formation, a close look is taken at one of the pulses. The
   distributions of the major charged species and the timeline of
   peak-values of charged species densities and electric field are
   presented. Through tracing the evolution of the locations of the peak
   densities of the charged species some new insights have been provided.
   The configuration of the model was chosen so that the simulation results
   could be compared with the experimental data published by Lama and
   Gallo. The numerical results were in acceptable agreement with the
   experimental values. Some explanations are given for the discrepancies
   between experimental and simulation results. It is also shown, that as
   the frequency of the pulses increases with voltage, the transition from
   Trichel pulse discharge to glow discharge initiates and full glow
   discharge is reached at -12 kV.}},

Title = {{Face and content validity of a virtual-reality simulator for myringotomy
   with tube placement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD \& NECK SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Myringotomy with tube insertion can be challenging for
   junior Otolaryngology residents as it is one of the first microscopic
   procedures they encounter. The Western myringotomy simulator was
   developed to allow trainees to practice microscope positioning,
   myringotomy, and tube placement. This virtual-reality simulator is
   viewed in stereoscopic 3D, and a haptic device is used to manipulate the
   digital ear model and surgical tools.
   Objective: To assess the face and content validity of the Western
   myringotomy simulator.
   Methods: The myringotomy simulator was integrated with new modules to
   allow speculum placement, manipulation of an operative microscope, and
   insertion of the ventilation tube through a deformable tympanic
   membrane. A questionnaire was developed in consultation with instructing
   surgeons. Fourteen face validity questions focused on the anatomy of the
   ear, simulation of the operative microscope, appearance and movement of
   the surgical instruments, deformation and cutting of the eardrum, and
   myringotomy tube insertion. Six content validity questions focused on
   training potential on surgical tasks such as speculum placement,
   microscope positioning, tool navigation, ear anatomy, myringotomy
   creation and tube insertion. A total of 12 participants from the
   Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery were recruited for
   the study. Prior to completing the questionnaire, participants were
   oriented to the simulator and given unlimited time to practice until
   they were comfortable with all of its aspects.
   Results: Responses to 12 of the 14 questions on face validity were
   predominantly positive. One issue of concern was with contact modeling
   related to tube insertion into the eardrum, and the second was with the
   movement of the blade and forceps. The former could be resolved by using
   a higher resolution digital model for the eardrum to improve contact
   localization. The latter could be resolved by using a higher fidelity
   haptic device. With regard to content validity, 64\% of the responses
   were positive, 21\% were neutral, and 15\% were negative.
   Conclusions: The Western myringotomy simulator appears to have
   sufficient face and content validity. Further development with automated
   metrics and skills transference testing is planned.}},

Abstract = {{Lignin-based epoxy resins were synthesized by reacting de-polymerized
   organosolv lignin (DOL) or depolymerized Kraft lignin (DKL) with
   epichlorohydrin under an alkaline condition in the presence of a phase
   transfer catalyst. The synthesized lignin-based epoxy resins were cured
   with 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM, an aromatic amine) and
   diethylenetriamine (DETA, an aliphatic amine) to generate a
   3-dimentional cross-linked structure. The effects of curing agents on
   the curing process were investigated by non-isothermal differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC). The dependency of activation energy of the
   curing reaction on the extent of curing (conversion) was determined in
   this study by model-free kinetics based on the DSC results. In addition,
   it was found that the thermal stability of the cured lignin-based epoxy
   resins was also influenced by the type of curing agents and the types of
   lignin used in the synthesis of the bio-based epoxy resins. (C) 2015

   tunnel lining segments with varying steel fiber lengths and dosages}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{733-742}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Ultra-high performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is an emerging
   material exhibiting superior mechanical and durability properties.
   However, its application in precast concrete tunnel linings is lagging
   due to lack of experimental data and adequate design provisions. This
   study is a preliminary investigation of UHPFRC tunnel lining segments
   incorporating various steel fiber lengths and dosages. The mechanical
   performance of UHPFRC tunnel lining segments was investigated. Flexural
   and edge-point load tests were conducted on 1/3-scale UHPFRC tunnel
   lining segments to evaluate its bending and thrust load resistance. The
   main studied variables were the steel fiber lengths and dosages. Results
   showed that UHPFRC tunnel lining segments incorporating shorter steel
   fibers exhibited higher cracking and peak loads compared to that of
   similar segments made with longer fibers. Furthermore, the shorter
   fibers enhanced the strain hardening phase, leading to more stable
   multiple micro-cracks and higher resistance to growth of macro-cracks.
   Conversely, longer steel fibers better improved the post-peak strain
   softening of the lining segments, achieving more ductile failure. The
   load carrying capacity of UHPFRC lining segments linearly increased with
   higher fiber dosage and followed the rule of mixtures. Moreover, steel
   fibers enhanced the cracking behavior under both thrust load and
   concentrated load compared to that of segments without fibers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane is studied in a gas phase
   oxygen free conditions using a VOx-MoOx/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst which also
   acts as a carrier of lattice oxygen. The prepared catalyst and the
   support gamma-Al2O3 are characterized using various physicochemical
   techniques. XRD, Raman, and FTIR analysis show the availability of VOx
   and MoOx species on the alumina support. The TPR analysis gives two
   distinct peaks for the reduction of VOx and MoOx species, respectively.
   The cyclic TPR/TPO shows consistent reduction behavior of the catalyst
   over repeated reduction and oxidation cycles. Desorption kinetics
   analysis reveals low activation energy for ammonia desorption from
   VOx-MoOx/gamma-Al2O3 surface. This indicates a minimum interaction
   between VOx-MoOx and gamma-Al2O3 confirming easy availability of lattice
   oxygen for reaction. The ODH of ethane experiments are conducted in a
   fluidized CREC Riser Simulator at temperature range of 500-650 degrees
   C. The contact time is varied between 10 and 50s. Under the studied
   reaction conditions, ethylene, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and water
   are the major products. At fluidized condition, VOx-MoOx/gamma-Al2O3
   shows significant higher ethane conversion due to the intense mixing
   between the catalyst and the feed. High temperature and longer contact
   times lead to further oxidation of the desired product ethylene to give
   undesired products COx. In repeated ODH of ethane and re-oxidation
   cycles, VOx-MoOx/gamma-Al2O3 shows stable ethane conversion and product
   selectivity which is consistent to the TPR/TPO evaluation results. (C)

Abstract = {{Finding a diverse set of high-quality (HQ) topologies for a

   algorithm can be difficult without a reliable measure that adequately
   describes the dissimilarity between competing topologies. In this

   selects one HQ solution and then searches for alternative HQ solutions
   by performing an optimization of the original objective and its
   dissimilarity with respect to the previously found solution. The
   proposed multi-objective optimization approach interactively amalgamates
   user articulated preferences with an evolutionary search so as
   sequentially to produce a set of diverse HQ solutions to a
   single-objective problem. For enhancing diversity, a new measure is
   suggested and an approach to reducing its computational time is studied
   and implemented. To illustrate the technique, a series of studies
   involving different topologies represented as bitmaps is presented.}},

Abstract = {{A model is proposed for numerical simulation of the multiphase flow
   coupled with chemical reaction in gas-particle circulating fluidized bed
   (CFB) risers. The proposed model is based on the newly developed
   computational mass transfer (CMT) methodology (Yu and Yuan, 2014)
   featuring the use of Reynolds mass flux equation to close the turbulent
   mass transfer equation, so that the anisotropic turbulent mass diffusion
   in (TB riser can be realized in the simulation. The proposed model
   consists of the turbulent mass transfer equation for the species with
   its Reynolds mass flux closure and the relevant formulations of
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). With the proposed model, the species
   concentration and solid volume fraction as well as the velocity
   distributions along the CFB riser can be predicted. To validate the
   proposed model, simulation is carried out for the catalytic ozone
   decomposition in a gas-particle CFB riser. The simulated results are
   compared with the experimental data and satisfactory agreement is found
   in both axial/radial distributions of ozone concentration and solid
   volume fraction. Furthermore, the anisotropic turbulent mass
   diffusivities are also predicted and validated by the experimental data
   reported in literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Directly detecting thermal emission from young extrasolar planets allows
   measurement of their atmospheric compositions and luminosities, which
   are influenced by their formation mechanisms. Using the Gemini Planet
   Imager, we discovered a planet orbiting the similar to
   20-million-year-old star 51 Eridani at a projected separation of 13
   astronomical units. Near-infrared observations show a spectrum with
   strong methane and water-vapor absorption. Modeling of the spectra and
   photometry yields a luminosity (normalized by the luminosity of the Sun)
   of 1.6 to 4.0 x 10(-6) and an effective temperature of 600 to 750
   kelvin. For this age and luminosity, ``hot-start{''} formation models
   indicate a mass twice that of Jupiter. This planet also has a
   sufficiently low luminosity to be consistent with the ``cold-start{''}
   core-accretion process that may have formed Jupiter.}},

Abstract = {{A novel cryogenic air separation process with LNG (liquefied natural
   gas) cold energy utilization that produces liquid nitrogen and oxygen is
   proposed and analyzed. Air separation process problems such as process
   configuration complexity, extreme operating conditions and high
   operating costs are covered. In this process heat from the top vapor
   stream of the column is recovered and exchanged with heat in the bottom
   liquid and feed streams. It is noted that column operating pressure can
   be decreased compared with the high pressure portion of the air
   separation systems. In fact, the high and low pressure columns are
   combined here to exchange nitrogen latent heat with oxygen latent heat.
   This significantly reduces the energy input to the main compressor
   located before the column. Also, to completely utilize the cold energy
   of the LNG and to offset some of the consumed power, a power generation
   cycle is integrated with the process. This cycle utilizes pure oxygen
   from the air separation unit. The cryogenic air separation process is
   simulated and the main parameters are analyzed. It is shown that the
   energy consumption for the proposed air separation process with LNG cold
   recovery is about 38.5\% lower compared for a convectional cryogenic air
   separation process. The energy and exergy efficiencies increase by
   59.4\% and 67.1\%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper investigates power-efficient scheduling for the uplink of
   Long-Term Evolution (LTE) systems. The aim is to minimize the total
   transmit power while satisfying particular delay requirements. The
   scheduling process is formulated as a dynamic programming problem. We
   show that the global optimal solution requires knowledge of future
   arrival rates and future channel gains for all users. Alternatively, we
   propose two low-complexity heuristic schedulers. The first heuristic
   scheduler controls the maximum allowable transmit power (MATP) for each
   user based on the queue length. In particular, if the queue length of a
   user is relatively small, the scheduler reduces the user's transmission
   rate and the MATP to minimize the total transmit power. On the other
   hand, when the queue length is large, the scheduler increases both the
   transmission rate and the MATP to satisfy the delay requirements. The
   second heuristic scheduler controls the minimum acceptable bit-per-Watt
   ratio (BPWR) for each user. Users can only transmit if their BPWRs are
   greater than an acceptable level, which allows only high power-efficient
   transmission. The minimum acceptable BPWR is adaptively changed based on
   the queue length of each user. The performance of the heuristic
   schedulers is evaluated and compared with the optimal solution and other
   existing schedulers.}},

   (LTE)Advanced to meet International Mobile Telecommunications-Advanced
   targets. HetNet CoMP has received significant attention as a way of
   achieving spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Usually,
   in the literature, the total network power consumption is restricted to
   the sum of the power consumption of all BSs. The significance of the
   power consumption of the backhaul links in wireless networks is normally
   omitted for its trivial effect with respect to that of the radio BSs.
   For SE and EE analysis of HetNet CoMP, the energy and bandwidth
   consumption of the backhaul is considered, without which, the
   investigation remains incomplete. However, SE and EE are design criteria
   in conflict with each other, and a careful study of their tradeoff is
   mandatory for designing future wireless communication systems. The EE is
   measured as ``throughput (bits) per joule,{''} whereas the power
   consumption model includes RF transmit (radiated), circuit, and backhaul
   power. Furthermore, a nonideal backhaul model such as a microwave link
   is also investigated within intra-HetNet-CoMP (inside one cell), where
   an implementing fiber is not feasible. An intercell interference (ICI)
   coordination method is also studied to mitigate ICI. At the end, a novel
   resource allocation algorithm is proposed-modeled as an optimization
   problem-which takes into account the total power consumption, including
   radiated, circuit, and backhaul power, and the minimum required data
   rate to maximize EE. Given an SE requirement, the EE optimization
   problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. The
   considered optimization problem is transformed into a convex
   optimization problem by redefining the constraint using cubic
   inequality, which results in an efficient iterative resource allocation
   algorithm. In each iteration, the transformed problem is solved by using
   dual decomposition with a projected gradient method. Simulations results
   demonstrate how backhaul has a significant impact on total power
   consumption and the effectiveness of the studied schemes. In addition,
   the results demonstrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation
   algorithm converges within a small number of iterations and illustrate
   the fundamental tradeoffs between SE and EE. Our analytical results shed
   light on future `` green{''} network planning in advanced OFDMA wireless
   systems like those envisioned for a fifth-generation (5G) system.}},

Abstract = {{In multihop relay networks with a large number of hops, it is
   challenging to allocate the available resources optimally among the
   relay nodes due to the large number of required control signals between
   the controller and the relay nodes. In addition, the latency caused by
   this signaling can result in using outdated resource-allocation
   information as the channels are time varying. Hence, a distributed
   resource-allocation scheme is proposed for multihop decode-and-forward
   (DF) relay systems, with low complexity in analytical computation and
   practical implementation. Based on the type of division multiplexing in
   time or frequency, this scheme can be used to obtain the optimal per-hop
   time slot length or bandwidth, respectively. This distributed iterative
   scheme needs no additional resource for optimization. The required
   communication to fulfill this optimization is only with the adjacent
   nodes of each relay and can be performed through the forwarding and
   acknowledgment packets (ACKs). It is shown that this scheme converges to
   the global optimal solution with an exponential convergence rate. The
   performance of this scheme is also investigated for the time-variant
   transmission channels by computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) finite element analyses (FEA) of clamped
   single-edge tension (SE(T)) specimens are performed to investigate the
   impact of the crack front curvature on the elastic compliance,
   compliance rotation correction factor and average J-integral evaluated
   over the crack front. Specimens with six average crack lengths (i.e.
   a(ave)/W = 0.2-0.7) and three thickness-to-width ratios (i.e. B/W = 0.5,
   1 and 2) are analyzed. The curved crack front is assumed to be bowed
   symmetrically and characterized by a power-law expression with a wide
   range of curvatures. Several crack front straightness requirements for
   SE(B) and C(T) specimens specified in BS7448, ISO and ASTM E1820
   standards are reviewed. Based on results of the numerical investigation,
   new crack front straightness criteria for the SE(T) specimen are
   proposed in the context of the nine-point measurement by using as a
   criterion that the errors in the estimated compliance and average J
   values should be no more than five percent. The proposed criteria depend
   on both a(ave)/W and B/W, and are more advantageous than those specified
   in the BS, ISO and ASTM standards in terms of controlling the
   differences in J and compliance between the specimens with curved and
   straight crack fronts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A privacy preserving protocol for tracking participants in phase I

Abstract = {{Objective: Some phase 1 clinical trials offer strong financial
   incentives for healthy individuals to participate in their studies.
   There is evidence that some individuals enroll in multiple trials
   concurrently. This creates safety risks and introduces data quality
   problems into the trials. Our objective was to construct a privacy
   preserving protocol to track phase 1 participants to detect concurrent
   enrollment.
   Design: A protocol using secure probabilistic querying against a
   database of trial participants that allows for screening during
   telephone interviews and on-site enrollment was developed. The match
   variables consisted of demographic information.
   Measurement: The accuracy (sensitivity, precision, and negative
   predictive value) of the matching and its computational performance in
   seconds were measured under simulated environments. Accuracy was also
   compared to non-secure matching methods.
   Results: The protocol performance scales linearly with the database
   size. At the largest database size of 20,000 participants, a query takes
   under 20 s on a 64 cores machine. Sensitivity, precision, and negative
   predictive value of the queries were consistently at or above 0.9, and
   were very similar to non-secure versions of the protocol.
   Conclusion: The protocol provides a reasonable solution to the
   concurrent enrollment problems in phase 1 clinical trials, and is able
   to ensure that personal information about participants is kept secure.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an assessment of geo-environmental properties for
   the incorporation of recycled gypsum, produced from gypsum waste, as an
   additive material in earthwork projects. In this study, the solubility
   of Fluorine, Boron and hexavalent Chromium and the emission of hydrogen
   sulfide gas refer to geo-environmental properties. To achieve this
   objective, the tested soil was mixed with recycled gypsum in conjunction
   with lime and cement in different proportions to overcome the solubility
   of gypsum and to reduce the solubility of harmful substances. The
   results of the study show that the utilization of recycled gypsum alone,
   as an additive material for earthwork projects, has a negative effect on
   the emission of hydrogen sulfide, while the addition of a solidification
   agent, such as cement or lime, to the recycled gypsum reduced the
   emission of hydrogen sulfide gas. The suggested contents and ratios for
   the gypsum cement and gypsum lime admixtures used in this study are safe
   against the emission of hydrogen sulfide because their measurements were
   found to be below the standard limits. Increasing the proportion of
   cement or lime in a gypsum soil mixture has a significant effect on the
   reduction in Fluorine solubility. The content of the admixture has a
   significant effect on the reduction in Fluorine solubility in the case
   of gypsum cement, while there is not much difference in the measured
   values of Fluorine in the gypsum lime admixture. The intensity of
   ettringite increases with the increase in admixture content and the
   decrease in the admixture ratio, while the intensity of calcite
   increases with increases in both the content and the ratio of the
   admixture. The formation of ettringite has a significant effect on the
   capture of Fluorine, namely, the solubility of Fluorine decreases with
   the increase in ettringite intensity. The measured values for the
   solubility of harmful substances, including Fluorine, Boron and
   hexavalent Chromium and the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas, were found
   to lie within the standards for the investigated limits of the gypsum
   soil mixture treated with cement or lime in the present study. This
   proves that the utilization of recycled gypsum in conjunction with
   cement or lime, as a stabilizer material and within the investigated
   limits, is safe and meets the environmental standards. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Minimally invasive valvular intervention commonly requires
   intra-procedural navigation to provide spatial and temporal information
   of relevant cardiac structures and device components. Recently
   intra-procedural trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been
   exploited for this purpose due to its accessibility, low cost, ease of
   use, and real-time imaging capacity. However, the position and
   orientation of tissue targets relative to surgical tools can be
   challenging to perceive, particularly using 2D imaging planes. In this
   paper, we propose the use of CT images to provide a high-quality 3D
   context to enhance ultrasound images through image registration,
   providing an augmented guidance system with minimal impact on standard
   clinical workflow. We also describe an approach to generate synthetic 4D
   CT images through non-rigid registration of available ultrasound. This
   can be employed to avoid a requirement for higher radiation. Synthetic
   CT images were validated through direct comparison of synthetic and real
   multi-phase CT images. Validation of CT and ultrasound image
   registration was performed for both dynamic and synthetic CT image
   datasets. Our results demonstrated that the synthetically generated
   dynamic CT images provide similar anatomical representation for relevant
   cardiac anatomy relative to real dynamic CT images, and similar high
   registration accuracy that can be achieved for intra-procedural TEE to
   this versus real dynamic CT images.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tracking control methodology for a class of
   uncertain nonlinear systems subject to input saturation constraint and
   external disturbances. Unlike most previous approaches on saturated
   systems, which assumed affine nonlinear systems, in this paper, tracking
   control problem is solved for uncertain nonaffine nonlinear systems with
   input saturation. To deal with the saturation constraint, an auxiliary
   system is constructed and a modified tracking error is defined. Then, by
   employing implicit function theorem, mean value theorem, and modified
   tracking error, updating rules are derived based on the well-known
   back-propagation (BP) algorithm, which has been proven to be the most
   relevant updating rule to control problems. However, most of the
   previous approaches on BP algorithm suffer from lack of stability
   analysis. By injecting a damping term to the standard BP algorithm,
   uniformly ultimately boundedness of all the signals of the closed-loop
   system is ensured via Lyapunov's direct method. Furthermore, the
   presented approach employs nonlinear in parameter neural networks.
   Hence, the proposed scheme is applicable to systems with higher degrees
   of nonlinearity. Using a high-gain observer to reconstruct the states of
   the system, an output feedback controller is also presented. Finally,
   the simulation results performed on a Duffing-Holmes chaotic system, a
   generalized pendulum-type system, and a numerical system are presented
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested state and output
   feedback control schemes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROSTATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{58-68}},

Abstract = {{The edge effect and the Faraday cage effect are two major problems that
   occur when the target surface contains sharp corners and recessed areas.
   This can significantly affect the electric field and degrade the
   deposition uniformity of paint, which is important in electrostatic
   painting. A numerical study is presented in this paper to investigate
   the methods to minimize these problems. A 2D axisymmetric numerical
   model is proposed to analyze the electric field distribution in the
   electrostatic painting system, assuming a grounded target with a small
   surface perturbation at the center using COMSOL. Simulations have been
   performed for different configurations on the target, different values
   of the corner radius and the space charge. Also, simulations of paint
   particle trajectories and deposition have been obtained using ANSYS to
   examine the effect of the particle size and the charge-to-mass ratio on
   the coating buildup rate of a flat target and a target with an
   indentation or a protrusion. The injections of mono- and poly-dispersed
   uncharged and charged particles were considered. The results suggest
   that preliminary analysis of the electric field distribution on a target
   having a perturbation provides a simple design tool for predicting
   coating uniformity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The KnnCAD Version 4 weather generator algorithm for nonparametric,
   multisite simulations of temperature and precipitation data is
   presented. The K-nearest neighbor weather generator essentially
   reshuffles the historical data, with replacement. In KnnCAD Version 4, a
   block resampling scheme is introduced to preserve the temporal
   correlation structure in temperature data. Perturbation of the
   reshuffled variable data is also added to enhance the generation of
   extreme values. The Upper Thames River Basin in Ontario, Canada isused
   as a case study and the model is shown to simulate effectively the
   historical characteristics at the site. The KnnCAD Version 4 approach is
   shown to improve on the previous versions of the model and offers a
   major advantage over many parametric and semiparametric weather
   generators in that multisite use can be easily achieved without making
   statistical assumptions dealing with the spatial correlations and

   system, some basic properties, such as Lyapunov exponents, and the way
   of producing hidden hyperchaos are analyzed with numerical simulation.
   Moreover, it is proved that there exist four small-amplitude limit

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{To more closely mimic the native cellular microenvironment, 3D scaffolds
   derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) are being developed as
   alternatives to conventional 2D culture systems. In the present study,
   we established methods to fabricate nonchemically cross-linked 3D porous
   foams derived entirely from decellularized porcine left ventricle (DLV)
   for use as an in vitro cardiac cell culture platform. Furthermore, we
   explored the effects of physically preprocessing the DLV through
   mechanical mincing versus cryomilling, as well as varying the ECM
   concentration on the structure, composition, and physical properties of
   the foams. Our results indicate that the less highly processed minced
   foams had a more cohesive and complex network of ECM components,
   enhanced mechanical properties, and improved stability under simulated
   culturing conditions. To validate the DLV foams, a proof-of-concept
   study was conducted to explore the early cardiomyogenic differentiation
   of pericardial fat adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (pfASCs) on the
   minced DLV foams relative to purified collagen I gel controls.
   Differentiation was induced using a modified cardiomyogenic medium (MCM)
   or through stimulation with 5-azacytidine (5-aza), and cardiomyocyte
   marker expression was characterized by immunohistochemistry and
   real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Our results
   indicate that early markers of cardiomyogenic differentiation were
   significantly enhanced on the DLV foams cultured in MCM, suggesting a
   synergistic effect of the cardiac ECM-derived scaffolds and the culture
   medium on the induction of pfASC differentiation. Furthermore, in
   analyzing the response in the noninduced control groups, the foams were
   observed to provide a mildly inductive microenvironment for pfASC
   cardiomyogenesis, supporting the rationale for using tissue-specific ECM
   as a substrate for cardiac cell culture applications.}},

   Hurricane Wind Speed}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The hurricane hazard modeling requires a hurricane wind field model and
   a hurricane track model, that are generally developed based on
   historical wind speed and track records. Several hurricane hazard models
   have been proposed for engineering applications; the model used to map
   the hurricane wind hazard shown in several editions of a U.S. national
   standard is extensively documented in open literature. A term, which is
   expressed as the product of the hurricane translation velocity and
   gradient of the wind velocity relative to the moving center of the
   vortex in the governing equation (i.e., fluid momentum equation) to
   model hurricane wind field, is neglected in various publications.
   However, the effect of using this approximation on the calculated wind
   field has not been elaborated. In the research reported in this paper,
   the effect of this approximation on the wind field is investigated
   through numerical analysis. Also, a possible simplification of the track
   model used to estimate the extreme hurricane wind for the U.S. national
   standard is explored. The use of different wind field models and track
   models to estimate the extreme hurricane wind is carried out. Comparison
   of the estimated return period values of hurricane wind speeds is
   presented. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the interactions between the underlying
   turbulent features that together make up the complex flow behaviour
   observed in corrugated channel flows. Higher order analyses using proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD) and wavenumber spectra were conducted on
   the turbulent velocity data for heated and unheated air flow through the
   channel. Results showed that at a given flow rate, the turbulent flow
   energy was produced by the corrugation and transported into the bulk
   flow at both heated and unheated conditions. At low flow rates, the
   heated wall increased the total turbulent energy and affected its
   distribution across the modes. Strong energies were seen close to the
   corrugations, which contributed to sustaining structures at higher
   modes, while the flow energy was more evenly distributed for the
   unheated condition. At the highest flow rate, the energy strength and
   distribution was very similar at low modes (n <= 20) and heating effects
   were most prominent at high modes with higher energies associated with
   small-scale flow patterns. It is observed that the corrugation waveform
   has a larger impact on the turbulence generation compared to heating.
   The addition of heat primarily increased and maintained the strength of
   turbulent structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Coupled Self-Adaptive Multiobjective Differential Evolution and Network
   Flow Algorithm Approach for Optimal Reservoir Operation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a coupled self-adaptive multiobjective differential
   evolution and network flow algorithm for the optimal operation of
   complex multipurpose reservoir systems. The developed algorithm (i.e.,
   self-adaptive multiobjective differential evolution) is compared to
   nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II using a set of common test
   problems and a real-world case study. An out-of-kilter method for
   minimal-cost flow problems is used to optimize the water resource system
   from self-adaptive multiobjective differential evolution inputs driven
   by the evolutionary process. Self-adaptive multiobjective differential
   evolution is then used to evaluate objective functions based on the
   outputs from out-of-kilter algorithm and the process continues until the
   stop criterion is met. The advantages of the proposed approach include
   (1) flexible evolutionary algorithms for solving highly complex
   objective function, and (2) efficient network flow method for dealing
   with large and highly constrained problems. The case study includes one
   part of a complex water supply system located in southwestern Brazil
   that provides water for almost 20 million people in Sao Paulo
   metropolitan area. The objectives of the case study include minimization
   of demand shortage (the difference between demand for water and
   available water supply), maximization of water quality (or minimization
   of the deviation from the water quality standards), and minimization of
   pumping cost. The coupled model is applied to the case study using one
   inflow scenario representing a drought period with inflows below
   historical average. Multiobjective analyses are performed by comparing
   two pairs of objective functions, as follows: (1) minimization of demand
   shortage versus minimization of pumping cost, and (2) minimization of
   demand shortage versus minimization of the deviation from the water
   quality standards. The problem constraints include reservoir capacity,
   capacity of tunnels, channel flow limitations, and minimum downstream
   release for all reservoirs within the system. The proposed coupled model
   (self-adaptive multiobjective differential evolution and out-of-kilter)
   is outperforming both pure self-adaptive multiobjective differential
   evolution and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, as it requires
   significantly smaller number of generations to derive the Pareto front.
   In addition, the proposed approach is capable of handling larger
   problems without major computational burden. The coupled model and
   self-adaptive multiobjective differential evolution also converge closer
   to, and provide better coverage of the true Pareto front than,
   nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {{Pharmaceutical pellets are small spherical particles that contain the
   active ingredient or drug. They are often film coated and packed into
   capsules as a multiple unit dosage form to provide modified drug
   release. Conventional methods used to evaluate pharmaceutical film
   coatings require invasive sampling and off-line testing, which are time
   consuming, disruptive to the process and often non-representative of the
   pellet bed indicating the need for developing more reliable monitoring
   methods. Passive acoustic emissions measurements have shown potential as
   a monitoring tool due to the non-invasive nature and real-time means of
   collecting process information. The goal of this study was to assess
   passive acoustic emission monitoring of the coating of pellets in a
   fluidized bed. Microphones were attached to the exterior of a top spray
   fluidized bed reflecting local fluidization conditions and information
   on nozzle performance. Decreased fluidization conditions were identified
   from acoustic emissions acquired at the interface of the liquid spray
   and fluidized pellet bed, influencing the distribution of the coating
   spray throughout the bed and drying of the film coat around the pellet
   core. Acoustic emissions acquired from the exhaust of an air outlet at
   the top of the column showed potential application for the detection of
   nozzle clogging. Continued research regarding the development of passive
   acoustic emissions monitoring would provide important information about
   fluidized bed coating of pellets and potentially improve process control
   for the determination of an optimum coating end-point. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Contrary to the empirical Miedema and Hume-Rothery rules and a recent
   theoretical prediction, we report experimental evidence on the formation
   of Li-Cs alloys at very low pressure (> 0.1 GPa). We also succeeded in
   synthesizing a pure nonstoichiometric and ordered crystalline phase from
   an approximately equimolar mixture and resolved its structure using the
   maximum entropy method. The new alloy has a primitive cubic cell with
   the Li atom situated in the center and the Cs at the corners. This
   structure is stable to at least 10 GPa and has an anomalously high
   coefficient of thermal expansion at low pressure. Analysis of the
   valence charge density shows that electrons are donated from Cs to the
   Li ``p{''}-orbitals, resulting in a rare formal oxidation state of-1 for
   Li. The observation indicates the diversity in the bonding of the
   seeming simple group I Li element.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a compact high precision positioner which is
   designed specifically for vertical axis motion with centimeter range
   based on a piezoworm motor arranged in flexure frames. The piezoworm
   motor for providing motion in Z axis is developed in complementary clamp
   configuration, provided that no power is required to maintain a fixed
   vertical position, holding the payload against the force of gravity at
   any time to ensure the safe climbing. Two identical amplified
   piezoelectric actuators are used in parallel for the extender section to
   achieve longer and equal step motion in vertical direction. The design
   is extended to a prototype where the actuator is integrated into a stage
   body, maintaining a compact size. After assembly, buckling effect on the
   stationary clamp flexures is evident due to the applied compressive
   load. Hence the positioner is evaluated through several tests in open
   loop with the aid of counterweights, ranging from 2-3.3 kg. Experiments
   on the inertially counterbalanced stage show that it is capable of
   providing a speed of 5.4 mm/s, an output force of 8.8 N, a travel range

Abstract = {{The Messinian (Upper Miocene) sandstones of the Lower Abu Madi unit are
   the main reservoirs of the El-Wastani (EW) gas field, located in the
   onshore Nile Delta of Egypt. Reservoir quality is highly variable and
   represents the major risk in locating new delineation and development
   wells in the field. Four lithofacies (F1, F2, F3 and F4) are
   characterized based on textural attributes and sedimentary structures.
   Facies F4, which is a medium to coarse-grained fluvial channel
   sandstone, exhibits the best reservoir rock quality. Four hydraulic flow
   units (HFU 1 through HFU 4) were delineated in the studied wells with
   flow zone index (FZI) values indicative of a broad range of hydraulic
   properties. The cementation factor (in) value, was calculated from the
   inverse relationship between porosity and formation factor for EW-4 and
   EW-6 wells, agrees with the published values of clean sandstone
   reservoirs. The results of grain density analyses is close to the
   published value of grain density of quartz, and also supported by the
   results of petrographic study, where quartz is the dominant framework
   mineral. Generally, both the permeability and porosity can be linked to
   the two derived electrical properties (formation resistivity factor and
   electrical tortuosity) in the clastic reservoirs of the Lower Abu Madi
   unit. This correlation is particularly evident in the western and
   central parts of the study area at EW-4 and EW-6 wells, where facies F4
   is dominant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a finite-element (FE) analysis for simulating the
   dynamic performance of geosynthetics-reinforced pile foundation system.
   The (FE) models were constructed using commercial FE program Plaxis 3D
   Dynamic. The numerical models were verified against the results of a
   reduced scale model test of geosynthetics-reinforced pile foundation
   system. A numerical parametric study was carried out to investigate the
   effect of different design parameters on the effectiveness of the
   proposed geosynthetics-reinforced pile foundation system. The studied
   parameters include: the frequency and amplitude of ground motion; the
   stiffness and strength of the geosynthetic reinforcement, the location
   of the reinforcement within the backfill material and the thickness of
   the backfill material. The numerical results indicated that the
   geosynthetics-reinforcement greatly reduced the maximum lateral
   acceleration response of the pile cap. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   efficient sculptured surface machining}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67-68}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to generate efficient ball-end milling
   tool paths for three-axis sculptured surface machining, The fundamental
   principle of the presented method is to generate the tool paths
   according to a preferred feed direction (PFD) field derived from the
   surface to be machined. The PFD at any point on the surface is the feed
   direction that maximizes the machining strip width. Theoretically, tool
   paths that always follow the direction of maximum machining strip width
   at every cutter contact point on the surface would result in shorter
   overall tool path length. Unfortunately, overlaps of adjacent machining
   strips commonly exist for tool paths that follow the preferred
   directions exactly. Such redundant machining can be reduced by
   iso-scallop tool paths. Nonetheless, iso-scallop tool paths do not in
   general follow the preferred feed directions. To improve machining
   efficiency via generating short overall tool path length, the presented
   method analyzes the PFD field of the surface and segments the surface
   into distinct regions by identifying the degenerate points and forming
   their separatrices. The resulting segmented regions are characterized by
   similar PFD's and iso-scallop tool paths are then generated for each
   region to mitigate redundant machining. The developed method has been
   validated with numerous case studies. The results have shown that the
   generated tool paths consistently have shorter overall length than those
   generated by the existing methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigated the performance of microbial electrolysis cells
   (MECs) fed with three common fermentation products: acetate, butyrate,
   and propionate. Each substrate was fed to the reactor for three
   consecutive-batch cycles. The results showed high current densities for

   values were 6.0 +/- 0.28, 2.5 +/- 0.06, 1.6 +/- 0.14 A/m(2),
   respectively). Acetate also showed a higher coulombic efficiency of 87
   +/- 5.7\% compared to 72 +/- 2.0 and 51 +/- 6.4\% for butyrate and
   propionate, respectively. This paper also revealed that acetate could be
   easily oxidized by anode respiring bacteria in MEC, while butyrate and
   propionate could not be oxidized to the same degree. The utilization
   rate of the substrates in MEC followed the order: acetate > butyrate >
   propionate. The ratio of suspended biomass to attached biomass was
   approximately 1: 4 for all the three substrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   Mori-Tanaka scheme and the self-consistent method. Fiber orientation
   tensors based on measured micro computed tomography data of selected
   samples as well as on filling simulations are used for the determination
   of mechanical properties, as e.g. the storage modulus. The results have

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research is to enhance the photocatalytic
   activity of TiO2 nanotube aligned arrays (TNAs) for the visible light by
   multiple-doping with nitrogen, nickel and carbon for the first time.
   This has been achieved through anodization of titanium foils in ethylene
   glycol based electrolytes containing NH4F and various concentrations of
   K-2{[}Ni(CN)(4)]. The method proposed allows for a simple one-step
   multiple-doping of TNAs during its electrochemical formation. The
   surface morphology, structure and composition of undoped and
   Ni-N-C-doped TNAs were investigated by field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM), XRD, XPS and EDX. The characterization results
   indicate that Ni, N and C atoms have been incorporated into the lattice
   of the TiO2 nanotubes. UV-Vis DRS spectroscopy and photo-electrochemical
   measurements showed that multiple-doping results in the broadening of
   the absorption region of visible light and the reduction of bandgap
   energy. Accordingly, multiple-doping of TNAs improves photogenerated
   electron hole separation and increases transfer rate of surface charge
   carriers from the interior to the surface of semiconductors. Under the
   visible-light irradiation, the average photocurrent density of the
   optimal multiple-doped TNAs is 10 times greater than that of the undoped
   TNAs tested under the same conditions. Accordingly, Ni-C-N-doped TNAs
   may be considered as a promising photocatalytic material for various
   potential applications like water splitting under sunlight irradiation
   for hydrogen generation. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy

Abstract = {{Zwitterionic (ZI) membranes are well-known for their high resistance to
   protein fouling during ultrafiltration (UF). In this work, zwitterionic
   chitosan (ZICS) was firstly obtained by a Schiff-base formation and a
   sulfonation reaction. Then a series of zwitterionic organic-inorganic
   hybrid ultrafiltration membranes were prepared through linking ZICS with
   poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) using tetraethyl orthosilicate as a bridge,
   where the density of zwitterionic groups in the membranes was adjusted
   by varying the dosage of zwitterionic chitosan. The prepared membranes
   were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the measurements of water
   contact angle and zeta-potential of membrane surface. The
   ultrafiltration performance was examined using the separation of bovine
   serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (LYZ) as a model system. The results
   show that, zwitterionic chitosan-silica-PVA hybrid membranes can possess
   desirable porosity, hydrophilicity, permeability, antifouling capacity
   and selectivity which can be adjusted by the fraction of ZICS in
   membranes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the role of unsteady lift in the context of flapping wing bird
   flight. Both aerodynamicists and biologists have attempted to address
   this subject, yet it seems that the contribution of unsteady lift still
   holds many open questions. The current study deals with the estimation
   of unsteady aerodynamic forces on a freely flying bird through analysis
   of wingbeat kinematics and near wake flow measurements using time
   resolved particle image velocimetry. The aerodynamic forces are obtained
   through two approaches, the unsteady thin airfoil theory and using the
   momentum equation for viscous flows. The unsteady lift is comprised of
   circulatory and non-circulatory components. Both approaches are
   presented over the duration of wingbeat cycles. Using long-time sampling
   data, several wingbeat cycles have been analyzed in order to cover both
   the downstroke and upstroke phases. It appears that the unsteady lift
   varies over the wingbeat cycle emphasizing its contribution to the total
   lift and its role in power estimations. It is suggested that the
   circulatory lift component cannot assumed to be negligible and should be
   considered when estimating lift or power of birds in flapping motion.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrate how the static and dynamic properties of
   Ni80Fe20/Ru/Ni80Fe20 nanowires can be tuned by varying the Ru spacer
   layer thickness. Specifically, changing the Ru thickness we have tuned
   the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange interaction, and thus the
   antiferromagnetic (AFM) strength between the Ni80Fe20 layers. We show
   that there is a strong correlation between the interlayer coupling and
   features in ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modes. We found different
   mode-softening degree of the FMR curves as function of the strength of
   AFM coupling, together with a clear frequency gap at around zero field.
   These experimental results are in qualitative agreement with presented
   micromagnetic simulations that also include biquadratic interface
   exchange. Understanding these characteristics may offer insights for
   reconfigurable vertical magnetic logic devices and microwave filters.

Abstract = {{Ion-Exchange Chromatography (IEC) techniques have been extensively
   investigated in protein purification processes, due to the more
   selective and milder separation steps. To date, existing studies of
   minor whey proteins fractionation in IEC have primarily been conducted
   as batch uptake studies, which require more experimental search space,
   time and materials. In this work, the selected resin's (SP Sepharose FF)
   equilibrium and dynamic binding capacity were first investigated. Next,
   adsorption of the pure binary mixture of lactoperoxidase and lactoferrin
   was studied to calibrate steric mass action (SMA) model using a
   simplified approach with data from single column experiments. The
   calibrated model was then verified by performing factorial-design based
   experiments for various process operating conditions assessing process
   performance on a larger bed height column. The model predicted results
   demonstrated a realistic agreement with the experiments providing
   reproducible column elution profile and reduced experimental work.
   Finally, whey protein isolate was used to evaluate model parameters in
   real conditions. Results obtained herein are suitable for future large
   scale applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   conductors under downburst winds}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a closed form solution to calculate the reactions of
   transmission line conductors subjected to downburst loads is derived.
   The derivation is conducted using a simplified multi-spanned
   conductorinsulator system, where the insulators to the right and to the
   left of the tower of interest are modeled using a combination of roller
   supports and linear springs. The considered system allows for the
   interaction between the spans without the need of solving a set.of
   non-linear equations to avoid the complexity. The closed form solution
   is derived to be applicable for downbursts with arbitrary size and
   location relative to the line. The solution is then focused on a
   critical downburst case that is previously recommended for the line
   design. Accuracy of the derived solution is assessed under both
   downbursts with arbitrary size and location and downbursts corresponding
   to the critical case. The assessment is carried out by comparing the
   conductor reactions obtained using the proposed solution with those from
   the Finite Element Analyses (FEAs). It is found that the predicted
   reactions by the proposed solution are in a very good agreement with
   those from the FEA in both the transverse and the longitudinal
   directions. For example, the highest differences for the critical case
   are found equal to 2\% and 8\% for the reactions in the transverse and
   the longitudinal directions, respectively. This indicates that the
   solution is reasonably accurate given the complexity of both the
   downburst wind field and the structure behavior of the conductor system.
   The proposed solution represents a practical and useful tool for
   practitioner engineers involved in the design of transmission lines,
   particularly under downburst winds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper examines various potential methods of hydrogen production
   using renewable and non-renewable sources and comparatively assesses
   them for environmental impact, cost, energy efficiency and exergy
   efficiency. The social cost of carbon concept is also included to
   present the relations between environmental impacts and economic
   factors. Some of the potential primary energy sources considered in this
   study are: electrical, thermal, biochemical, photonic, electro-thermal,
   photo-electric, and photo-biochemical. The results show that when used
   as the primary energy source, photonic energy based hydrogen production
   (e.g., photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical method, and artificial
   photosynthesis) is more environmentally benign than the other selected
   methods in terms of emissions. Thermochemical water splitting and hybrid
   thermochemical Cycles (e.g. Cu-Cl, S-I, and Mg-Cl) also provide
   environmentally attractive results. Both photoelectrochemical method and
   PV electrolysis are found to be least attractive when production costs
   and efficiencies are considered. Therefore, increasing both energy and
   exergy efficiencies and decreasing the costs of hydrogen production from
   solar based hydrogen production have a potential to bring them forefront
   as potential options. The energy and exergy efficiency comparisons
   indicate the advantages of fossil fuel reforming and biomass
   gasification over other methods. Overall rankings show that hybrid
   thermochemical cycles are primarily promising candidates to produce
   hydrogen in an environmentally benign and cost-effective way. Copyright

Abstract = {{A solar based integrated system for hydrogen and methanol production is
   investigated. Energy and exergy analyses of a hydrogen production plant,
   thermodynamic assessment of a methanol synthesis plant, and exergy
   analysis of the integrated solar based system for hydrogen and methanol
   production, are performed. The analysis of hydrogen production is
   performed for the methanol synthesis procedure. The present analysis
   shows the effects of temperature and current density of the electrolyser
   on hydrogen production. The optimum temperature of methanol synthesis is
   obtained for the final design of the methanol plant. It is shown that
   increasing the pressure improves the methanol synthesis process.
   Methanol conversion takes place at 493 K. The energy and exergy
   efficiencies of the system are reduced by 30\% if the electrolyser
   operates at 300 K. The efficiencies of the system are also highly
   dependent on the solar intensity. The system efficiencies can be tripled
   if the intensity of solar radiation is increased to 600 W/m(2) instead
   of 250 W/m(2). Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Quantifying soft tissue motion following impact is important in human
   motion analysis as soft tissues attenuate potentially injurious forces
   resulting from activities such as running and jumping. This study
   determined the reliability of leg soft tissue position and velocity
   following heel impacts. A grid of black dots was applied to the skin of
   the right leg and foot (n=20). Dots were automatically detected
   (ProAnalyst((R))) from high-speed records of pendulum and drop impacts.
   Three trained measurers selected columns of dots on each participant for
   analysis; one measurer 6months later. Between- and within-measurer
   differences in kinematic variables were all relatively small (<0.8cm for
   position; <3.7cm/s for velocity) between-measurers and (<0.5cm for
   position; <2.6cm/s for velocity) within-measurer. Good (coefficients of
   variation (CV)<= 10\%) to acceptable (CV>10\% and <= 20\%) reliability
   was shown for 95\% of the position measures, with mean CVs of 10\% and
   11\% within-measurers and between-measures, respectively. Velocity
   measures were less reliable; 40\% of the measures showed good to
   marginal (CV>20\% and <= 30\%) reliability. This study established that
   leg soft tissue position data from skin markers could be obtained with
   good to acceptable reliability following heel impacts. Velocity data
   were less reliable but still acceptable in many cases.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate assessment of symmetry in the craniofacial skeleton is
   important for cosmetic and reconstructive craniofacial surgery. Although
   there have been several published attempts to develop an accurate system
   for determining the correct plane of symmetry, all are inaccurate and
   time consuming. Here, the authors applied a novel semi-automatic method
   for the calculation of craniofacial symmetry, based on principal
   component analysis and iterative corrective point computation, to a
   large sample of normal adult male facial computerized tomography scans
   obtained clinically (n=32). The authors hypothesized that this method
   would generate planes of symmetry that would result in less error when
   one side of the face was compared to the other than a symmetry plane
   generated using a plane defined by cephalometric landmarks. When a
   three-dimensional model of one side of the face was reflected across the
   semi-automatic plane of symmetry there was less error than when
   reflected across the cephalometric plane. The semi-automatic plane was
   also more accurate when the locations of bilateral cephalometric
   landmarks (eg, frontozygomatic sutures) were compared across the face.
   The authors conclude that this method allows for accurate and fast
   measurements of craniofacial symmetry. This has important implications
   for studying the development of the facial skeleton, and clinical
   application for reconstruction.}},

Title = {{Sustainable evaluation and verification in supply chains: Aligning and
   leveraging accountability to stakeholders}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Managers are being challenged by multiple (and diverse) stakeholders,
   which have variety of expectations and informational needs about their
   firm's supply chains. Collectively, these expectations and needs form a
   multi-faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to
   which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply
   chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management
   research has largely focused on monitoring as a self-managed set of
   narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide
   stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that
   firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to
   align with stakeholders' expectations and leverage accountability to
   stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a
   model that proposes how firms might address accountability for
   sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct
   of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three
   interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These
   dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key
   measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality,
   reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a
   result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also
   considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as
   metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is
   validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored.
   Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive
   advantage are investigated. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This communication presents the effects of Ce modification on
   NiO/Ce-gamma Al2O3 oxygen carrier for chemical-looping combustion (CLC).
   The NiO/Ce-gamma Al2O3 samples are prepared by an incipient wetness
   technique using successive metal loading. The reduction characteristics
   of the prepared oxygen carriers are evaluated in repeated
   temperature-programmed reduction/oxidation cycles. The results show that
   the presence of Ce minimizes metal/support interaction and improves the
   reducibility and oxygen carrying capacity of the oxygen carriers. As a
   result, almost 94 wt \% nickel oxides on Ce-gamma Al2O3 is reduced as
   opposed to only 77 wt \% of nickel oxides on bare gamma Al2O3. The
   presence of Ce also provides stable reduction performance over repeated
   oxidation/reduction cycles, which is essential for a CLC process. The
   sustained reducibility of the samples is mainly due to the absence of
   agglomeration and the formation of easily reducible nickel oxide species
   instead of nickel aluminate. The EDX mapping of the oxygen carrier shows
   a uniform nickel dispersion on the support. The NiO/Ce-gamma Al2O3
   oxygen carriers are further evaluated in a fluidized CREC Riser
   Simulator using methane as fuel and air for reoxidation. The Ce
   containing oxygen carrier shows excellent reactivity and stability over
   the repeated fluidized CLC cycles. The XRD analysis of fresh and used
   oxygen carrier samples shows unchanged crystal structures of the nickel
   particles, indicating stable properties of the NiO/Ce-gamma Al2O3 in the
   repeated CLC cycles.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing miniaturization, it is extremely important to maintain
   the magnetization stability at small scale. Herein, more efforts and
   interests focus on the interface of magnetic core and semiconductor
   shell to obtain desired magnetic and/or luminescent properties. Here,
   Fe3O4 nanocubes are synthesized via a thermal decomposition followed by
   coating ZnO nanocrystals. To create a large interface, large Fe3O4
   nanocubes with 78 +/- 3 nm average side-length are synthesized through
   adjusting the ratio of iron precursor to stabilizer. The average
   diameter of the particular ZnO nanostructures coated on the nanocubic
   Fe3O4 is around 10 +/- 2 nm. In addition to the photoluminescent
   properties of the ZnO-coated nanostructures, core-shell Fe3O4@ZnO
   nanostructures demonstrate enhanced UV absorption at 360 nm, which has a
   20 nm blueshift compared to bulk ZnO. The superparamagnetic properties
   of Fe3O4@ZnO core-shell hybrid nanocrystals at room temperature are
   dominated by the ferromagnetic properties when the temperature is lower
   than the Blocking temperature, 235.7 K. The observed exchange bias and
   temperature-dependent magnetization can result from the interfacial
   interphase between ZnO and Fe3O4. The anisotropy contributed by the
   interfacial interphase allows the nanostructures to maintain stable
   magnetization in miniaturized devices.}},

Title = {{Predicting colloid transport through saturated porous media: A critical
   review}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and predicting colloid transport and retention in
   water-saturated porous media is important for the protection of human
   and ecological health. Early applications of colloid transport research
   before the 1990s included the removal of pathogens in granular drinking
   water filters. Since then, interest has expanded significantly to
   include such areas as source zone protection of drinking water systems
   and injection of nanometals for contaminated site remediation. This
   review summarizes predictive tools for colloid transport from the pore
   to field scales. First, we review experimental breakthrough and
   retention of colloids under favorable and unfavorable colloid/collector
   interactions (i.e., no significant and significant colloid-surface
   repulsion, respectively). Second, we review the continuum-scale modeling
   strategies used to describe observed transport behavior. Third, we
   review the following two components of colloid filtration theory: (i)
   mechanistic force/torque balance models of pore-scale colloid
   trajectories and (ii) approximating correlation equations used to
   predict colloid retention. The successes and limitations of these
   approaches for favorable conditions are summarized, as are recent
   developments to predict colloid retention under the unfavorable
   conditions particularly relevant to environmental applications. Fourth,
   we summarize the influences of physical and chemical heterogeneities on
   colloid transport and avenues for their prediction. Fifth, we review the
   upscaling of mechanistic model results to rate constants for use in
   continuum models of colloid behavior at the column and field scales.
   Overall, this paper clarifies the foundation for existing knowledge of
   colloid transport and retention, features recent advances in the field,
   critically assesses where existing approaches are successful and the
   limits of their application, and highlights outstanding challenges and
   future research opportunities. These challenges and opportunities
   include improving mechanistic descriptions, and subsequent correlation
   equations, for nanoparticle (i.e., Brownian particle) transport through
   soil, developing mechanistic descriptions of colloid retention in
   so-called unfavorable conditions via methods such as the discrete
   heterogeneity approach, and employing imaging techniques such as X-ray
   tomography to develop realistic expressions for grain topology and
   mineral distribution that can aid the development of these mechanistic
   approaches.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents three-dimensional (3D) finite element analyses of
   plane-sided single-edge bend specimens to investigate the effect of the
   crack front curvature on the accuracy of the average J-integral (J)
   evaluated over the crack front using the plastic eta-factor-based
   approach specified in ASTM E1820-11. Specimens with average crack
   lengths of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 and thickness-to-width ratios of 1, 0.5,
   and 0.25 were analyzed. The analysis was based on the J(2) deformation
   theory of plasticity and assumed stationary cracks with sharp crack
   tips. The curved crack front was characterized by a power-law expression
   proposed by Nikishikov et al. that was validated using crack front data
   collected in this study. The plastic eta factors specified in ASTM
   E1820-11 and proposed by Zhu et al. were employed. The analysis results
   indicate that the errors in the plastic eta-factor-based J were
   generally between -7 \% (i.e., underestimation) and 6 \% (i.e.,
   overestimation) for the specimens that had curved crack fronts with
   crack front curvature equal to the maximum allowable value specified in
   ASTM E1820-11. Based on the analysis results, crack front straightness
   criteria that are in most cases less stringent than those specified in
   ASTM E1820-11 are recommended. The suggested criteria could potentially
   lead to reduced specimen rejection rates and cost savings.}},

Abstract = {{Generalist arthropod herbivores rapidly adapt to a broad range of host
   plants. However, the extent of transcriptional reprogramming in the
   herbivore and its hosts associated with adaptation remains poorly
   understood. Using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae and tomato as
   models with available genomic resources, we investigated the reciprocal
   genomewide transcriptional changes in both spider mite and tomato as a
   consequence of mite's adaptation to tomato. We transferred a genetically
   diverse mite population from bean to tomato where triplicated
   populations were allowed to propagate for 30 generations. Evolving
   populations greatly increased their reproductive performance on tomato
   relative to their progenitors when reared under identical conditions,
   indicative of genetic adaptation. Analysis of transcriptional changes
   associated with mite adaptation to tomato revealed two main components.
   First, adaptation resulted in a set of mite genes that were
   constitutively downregulated, independently of the host. These genes
   were mostly of an unknown function. Second, adapted mites mounted an
   altered transcriptional response that had greater amplitude of changes
   when re-exposed to tomato, relative to nonadapted mites. This gene set
   was enriched in genes encoding detoxifying enzymes and xenobiotic
   transporters. Besides the direct effects on mite gene expression,
   adaptation also indirectly affected the tomato transcriptional
   responses, which were attenuated upon feeding of adapted mites, relative
   to the induced responses by nonadapted mite feeding. Thus, constitutive
   downregulation and increased transcriptional plasticity of genes in a
   herbivore may play a central role in adaptation to host plants, leading
   to both a higher detoxification potential and reduced production of
   plant defence compounds.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a central composite design and response surface
   methodology were used to study the effect of various hydrolysis
   variables (temperature, pH, and time) on the acid hydrolysis of
   Jerusalem artichoke-derived inulin using three different mineral acids
   (HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4). Numerical optimization was used to maximize the
   sugar yield of Jerusalem artichoke powder within the experimental range
   for each of the mentioned acid. The influence of each acid on the
   formation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF; a known by-product and
   inhibitor for fermentative organisms) was also investigated. H2SO4 was
   found to have a better potential for sugar yields compared to two other
   acids (HCl and H3PO4) since it can hydrolyze the highest amount of
   inulin (98.5 \%) under optimal conditions (temperature of 97 A degrees
   C, pH of 2.0, and time period of 35 min) without producing inhibiting
   HMF concentrations. The sulfuric hydrolysate of Jerusalem artichoke was
   fermented via solventogenic clostridia to acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE).
   An ABE yield of 0.31 g g(-1) and an overall fermentation productivity of
   0.25 g l(-1) h(-1) were obtained, indicating the suitability of this

   the properties of the soil around it. Box culverts are typically
   designed using formulae that assume simplified behaviors and in some
   cases rely on considerable empiricism. In the present study, small scale
   centrifuge physical model tests were conducted to investigate SCI
   considering the height and density of soil above the culvert and the
   geometry of the culvert. The results of these centrifuge tests were used
   to calibrate and verify a numerical model that was used to further
   investigate the response of box culverts to static loads. The results
   have been evaluated for bending moment and soil culvert interaction
   factors. The results demonstrated that the soil culvert interaction
   factors are not only a function of the height of soil column above the
   culvert, but also a function of the culvert thickness, soil elastic
   modulus and Poisson's ratio. Therefore, the results were used to
   establish charts and equations that can be employed to assess the design
   values of the static soil pressure and static bending moment for box
   culverts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Y Biomechanical Analysis of Simulated Clinical Testing and
   Reconstruction of the Anterolateral Ligament of the Knee}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anatomic anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction has
   been proposed to assist anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction
   in controlling anterolateral rotational laxity of the knee. However, the
   biomechanical effects have not been reported.
   Purpose: (1) To investigate the effect of ALL transection on rotational
   knee kinematics and (2) to determine the effect on knee biomechanics of
   ALL reconstruction procedures compared with lateral extra-articular
   tenodesis (LET).
   Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
   Methods: A total of 12 cadaveric knee specimens were tested in the
   following sequence: (1) ACL(intact), (2) anteromedial bundle of ACL
   sectioned (ACL(amb)), (3) complete ACL sectioned (ACL(full)), (4) ALL
   sectioned (ALL(sec)), (5) anatomic ALL reconstruction (ALL(anat)), and
   (6) LET. Biomechanical anterior drawer and Lachman tests were performed
   in which a 90-N load was applied to the posterior tibia, and anterior
   translation was measured. A combined load to simulate the early phase of
   the pivot-shift test was executed in which a 5-Nm internal rotation
   moment was applied to a fully extended knee; anterior translation and
   internal rotation were measured.
   Results: Anterior translation increased across conditions for the
   biomechanical tests. Internal rotation during the simulated early-phase
   pivot-shift test was significantly different between ACL(full) and
   ALL(sec). Anatomic ALL reconstruction did not significantly reduce
   internal rotation or anterior translation during the simulated
   early-phase pivot-shift test. After LET, a significant decrease in
   anterior translation was found. There was no evidence of overconstraint
   of the knee with either anatomic ALL reconstruction or LET.
   Conclusion: The ALL demonstrated a role in controlling anterolateral
   laxity. LET had a composite effect in governing both anterior and
   rotational laxity. Anatomic ALL reconstruction did not reduce
   anterolateral rotational laxity.
   Clinical Relevance: Profiling the biomechanical characteristics of
   anterolateral reconstruction is integral to understanding the
   implications and potential benefit of such an additional procedure to
   ACL reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to examine whether the response of
   cerebral blood flow to an acute change in perfusion pressure is modified
   by an acute increase in central blood volume. Nine young, healthy
   subjects voluntarily participated in this study. To measure dynamic
   cerebral autoregulation during normocapnic and hypercapnic (5\%)
   conditions, the change in middle cerebral artery mean blood flow
   velocity was analyzed during acute hypotension caused by two methods: 1)
   thigh-cuff occlusion release (without change in central blood volume);
   and 2) during the recovery phase immediately following release of lower
   body negative pressure (LBNP; -50 mmHg) that initiated an acute increase
   in central blood volume. In the thigh-cuff occlusion release protocol,
   as expected, hypercapnia decreased the rate of regulation, as an index
   of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (0.236 +/- 0.018 and 0.167 +/- 0.025
   s(-1), P = 0.024). Compared with the cuff-occlusion release, the acute
   increase in central blood volume (relative to the LBNP condition) with
   LBNP release attenuated dynamic cerebral autoregulation (P = 0.009).
   Therefore, the hypercapnia-induced attenuation of dynamic cerebral
   autoregulation was not observed in the LBNP release protocol (P =
   0.574). These findings suggest that an acute change in systemic blood
   distribution modifies dynamic cerebral autoregulation during acute
   hypotension.}},

Title = {{A novel shape-similarity-based elastography technique for prostate

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Association between tissue stiffness alteration and pathology
   is well known. This has formed the basis for prostate elastography
   imaging techniques where images of prostate tissue mechanical properties
   are reconstructed. In this paper, the authors present a novel prostate
   elastography technique which, unlike other techniques, relies on
   magnitude image data only.
   Methods: This proposed technique works in conjunction with ultrasound or
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging modalities and it requires the
   prostate's pre- and postdeformation images as input. It uses a
   constrained reconstruction method where the elastic moduli of the
   prostate's normal and pathological tissues are determined based on an
   essential subset of the tissue deformation provided by the images data.
   The elasticity reconstruction technique uses optimization where
   similarity between calculated and observed shape features of the
   postcompression prostate image is maximized. The method was validated
   with an in silico phantom study followed by studies using ultrasound and
   MR with tissue-mimicking phantoms.
   Results: Using the proposed methods, it was observed that the maximum
   uncertainties of the reconstructed Young's modulus ratios of tumor to
   normal tissue were 15.6\% and 9.7\%, which were obtained from the
   transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and MR tissue-mimicking phantom studies,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: This novel prostate elastography technique relies on
   prostate TRUS or MRI images that can be routinely acquired without
   additional imaging hardware. The phantom studies provided evidence that
   the proposed technique has a good potential to reconstruct prostate
   stiffness maps noninvasively particularly when applied in conjunction
   with MRI. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the technique's
   merits for clinical use. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or bleed within the cerebral
   ventricles is a common condition among very low birth weight pre-term
   neonates. The prognosis for these patients is worsened should they
   develop progressive ventricular dilatation, i.e., post-hemorrhagic
   ventricle dilatation (PHVD), which occurs in 10-30\% of IVH patients.
   Accurate measurement of ventricular volume would be valuable information
   and could be used to predict PHVD and determine whether that specific
   patient with ventricular dilatation requires treatment. While the
   monitoring of PHVD in infants is typically done by repeated
   transfontanell 2D ultrasound (US) and not MRI, once the patient's
   fontanels have closed around 12-18 months of life, the follow-up patient
   scans are done by MRI. Manual segmentation of ventricles from MR images
   is still seen as a gold standard. However, it is extremely time-and
   labor-consuming, and it also has observer variability. This paper
   proposes an accurate multiphase geodesic level-set segmentation
   algorithm for the extraction of the cerebral ventricle system of
   pre-term PHVD neonates from 3D T1 weighted MR images. The proposed
   segmentation algorithm makes use of multi-region segmentation technique
   associated with spatial priors built from a multi-atlas registration
   scheme. The leave-one- out cross validation with 19 patients with mild
   enlargement of ventricles and 7 hydrocephalus patients shows that the
   proposed method is accurate, suggesting that the proposed approach could
   be potentially used for volumetric and morphological analysis of the
   ventricle system of IVH neonatal brains in clinical practice. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The dip-coating process for liquid film deposition on cylindrical
   substrates is numerically simulated, and the effects of the coating bath
   walls proximity to the substrate are investigated for the deposited film
   thickness. In the present work, the hydrodynamics of non-Newtonian
   liquid films are studied, applying Carreau and power law models. The
   free surface position is determined by the volume of fluid technique in
   a three-dimensional system, while the impacts of density, viscosity, and
   surface tension are taken into account. The momentum and mass balance,
   alongside the constitutive equations, were solved for dip-coating
   process using numerical simulations in an open source CFD software
   package of OpenFOAM. Numerical outcomes are validated with experimental
   data over a large range of withdrawal velocities up to 6 m/s. Also good
   agreement is obtained for numerical simulation results with experimental
   data for coating thickness, considering the proximity effects of bath
   walls to the cylindrical substrate being withdrawn from a coating bath.}},

Abstract = {{Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is an acidic phosphoprotein with
   collagen-binding, cell attachment, and hydroxyapatite-nucleating
   properties. BSP expression in mineralized tissues is upregulated at
   onset of mineralization. Bsp-null (Bsp(-/-)) mice exhibit reductions in
   bone mineral density, bone turnover, osteoclast activation, and impaired
   bone healing. Furthermore, Bsp(-/-) mice have marked periodontal tissue
   breakdown, with a lack of acellular cementum leading to periodontal
   ligament detachment, extensive alveolar bone and tooth root resorption,
   and incisor malocclusion. We hypothesized that altered mechanical stress
   from mastication contributes to periodontal destruction observed in
   Bsp(-/-) mice. This hypothesis was tested by comparing Bsp(-/-) and
   wild-type mice fed with standard hard pellet diet or soft powder diet.
   Dentoalveolar tissues were analyzed using histology and micro-computed
   tomography. By 8 wk of age, Bsp(-/-) mice exhibited molar and incisor
   malocclusion regardless of diet. Bsp(-/-) mice with hard pellet diet
   exhibited high incidence (30\%) of severe incisor malocclusion, 10\%
   lower body weight, 3\% reduced femur length, and 30\% elevated serum
   alkaline phosphatase activity compared to wild type. Soft powder diet
   reduced severe incisor malocclusion incidence to 3\% in Bsp(-/-) mice,
   supporting the hypothesis that occlusal loading contributed to the
   malocclusion phenotype. Furthermore, Bsp(-/-) mice in the soft powder
   diet group featured normal body weight, long bone length, and serum
   alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that tooth dysfunction and
   malnutrition contribute to growth and skeletal defects reported in
   Bsp(-/-) mice. Bsp(-/-) incisors also erupt at a slower rate, which
   likely leads to the observed thickened dentin and enhanced
   mineralization of dentin and enamel toward the apical end. We propose
   that the decrease in eruption rate is due to a lack of acellular
   cementum and associated defective periodontal attachment. These data
   demonstrate the importance of BSP in maintaining proper periodontal
   function and alveolar bone remodeling and point to dental dysfunction as
   causative factor of skeletal defects observed in Bsp(-/-) mice.}},

Abstract = {{Since vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) display phenotypic plasticity
   in response to changing environmental cues, understanding the molecular
   mechanisms underlying the phenotypic modulation mediated by a
   three-dimensional (3D) scaffold is important to engineer functional
   vasculature. Following cell seeding into 3D scaffolds, the synthetic
   phenotype is desired to enable cells to expand rapidly and produce and
   assemble extracellular matrix components, but must revert to a quiescent
   contractile phenotype after tissue fabrication to impart the contractile
   properties found in native blood vessels. This study shows that 3D
   electrospun fibrous scaffolds regulate human coronary artery smooth
   muscle cells (HCASMCs) toward a more synthetic phenotype characterized
   by reduced contractile markers, such as smooth muscle alpha-actin and
   calponin. The reduction in contractile markers expression was mediated
   by endogenously expressed proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta
   (IL-1 beta). 3D topography transiently induces concomitant upregulation
   of IL-1 beta and MAPK ERK1/2 through nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent
   signaling pathway. An early burst of expression of IL-1 beta is
   essential for suppression of the homeobox transcription factor Gax and
   related cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1), which are key
   regulators for cells exiting from cell cycle. Our findings provide new
   insights for understanding signaling mechanisms of HCASMCs in
   electrospun 3D fibrous scaffolds, which have considerable value for
   application in vascular tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The Abductive Network (AN), a group method data handling (GMDH)
   algorithm-based self-organizing model, was applied to study the solids
   holdup distribution of a liquid-solid circulating fluidized bed (LSCFB)
   system. At first, the AN model was trained with experimental data sets
   obtained from a pilot scale LSCFB operated with spherical glass beads
   and irregularly shaped lava rock particles as solid phases, and water as
   liquid phase. In the model training the effects of various auxiliary and
   primary liquid velocities and superficial solids velocities on radial
   phase distribution at different axial positions were considered. The
   developed AN model was employed to predict the solids holdups at various
   locations of the LSCFB riser under different operating conditions. The
   competency of the developed AN model was confirmed by comparing the
   model-predicted and experimental solids holdups of the LSCFB system.
   Both the experimental and model-predicted outputs showed that under
   different superficial liquid velocities the solids holdup was higher for
   the glass beads than the lava rocks. The solids holdup decreased with
   increasing liquid velocity at all axial locations. The radial
   non-uniformity distributions of solids holdup in the central region
   decreased toward the wall. The higher drag force acting on the
   spherical-shaped particles was likely responsible for this variation of
   the solids holdups.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, autonomous control strategies are proposed for
   Photovoltaic (PV) and battery units operating in a droop-controlled
   islanded microgrid. Based on the proposed strategies, the PV and battery
   units can be deployed independently in any droop-controlled microgrid.
   Both the PV unit and the battery unit are controlled as voltage sources
   that follow multisegment adaptive power/frequency (P/f) characteristic
   curves. These P/f characteristic curves are adjusted locally in real
   time based on the available PV power, load demand, and the state of
   charge of the battery to autonomously coordinate the operation of these
   units and maintain the power balance in the microgrid. The strategy
   proposed for the battery unit enables it to autonomously supply power
   only during peak load periods, to support the droop-controlled units and
   maintain the power balance in the islanded microgrid. The control
   strategies are implemented in each unit using multi-loop controllers,
   without relying on communication, a central management algorithm, or
   switching logic. Small signal models of the proposed control loops are
   presented, and the performance of the proposed strategy is validated
   using simulation and also through experiments on a 3-kVA prototype
   microgrid.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{778}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is known that longitudinal grooves may stabilize or destabilize the
   travelling wave instability in a channel flow depending on the groove
   wavenumber. These waves reduce to the classical Tollmien-Schlichting
   waves in the absence of grooves. It is shown that another class of
   travelling wave instability exists if grooves with sufficiently high
   amplitude and proper wavelengths are used. It is demonstrated that the
   new instability mode is driven by the inviscid mechanism, with the
   disturbance motion having the form of a wave propagating in the
   streamwise direction with phase speed approximately four times larger
   than the Tollmien-Schlichting wave speed and with its streamwise
   wavelength being approximately twice the spanwise groove wavelength. The
   instability motion is concentrated mostly in the middle of the channel
   and has a planar character, i.e. the dominant velocity components are
   parallel to the walls. A significant reduction of the corresponding
   critical Reynolds number can be achieved by increasing the groove
   amplitude. Conditions that guarantee the flow stability in a grooved
   channel, i.e. the grooved surface behaves as a hydraulically smooth
   surface, have been identified.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the synchronization problem of second-order nonlinear
   multi-agent systems with intermittent communication in the presence of
   irregular communication delays and possible information losses. The
   control objective is to steer all agents' positions to a common position
   with a prescribed desired velocity available only to some leaders. Based
   on the small-gain framework, we propose a synchronization scheme relying
   on an intermittent information exchange protocol in the presence of time
   delays and possible packet dropouts. We show that our control objectives
   are achieved with a simple selection of the control gains provided that
   the directed graph, describing the interconnection between agents,
   contains a spanning tree. An example of Euler-Lagrange systems is
   considered to illustrate the application and effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Privacy-preserving data aggregation has been widely studied to meet the
   requirement of timely monitoring electricity consumption of users while
   protecting individual user's data privacy in smart grid communications.
   In this paper, we propose a new multifunctional data aggregation scheme,
   named MuDA, for privacy-preserving smart grid communications. With MuDA,
   the smart grid control center can compute multiple statistical functions
   of users' data in a privacy-preserving way to provide diversiform
   services. Moreover, MuDA is also designed to resist differential attacks
   that most secure data aggregation schemes may suffer. Through detailed
   security and utility analyses, we demonstrate that MuDA preserves users'
   data privacy with acceptable noise rate. In addition, extensive
   performance evaluations are conducted to illustrate that our MuDA scheme
   is more efficient than a popular aggregation scheme in terms of
   communication overhead.}},

Title = {{Place effects on noise annoyance: Cumulative exposures, odour annoyance
   and noise sensitivity as mediators of environmental context}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests there may be combined effects of outdoor air
   pollution and traffic noise on noise annoyance, but it is not known how
   environmental context can moderate these effects. Physical attributes of
   the environment can influence relative levels of exposure, while
   sociocultural contexts can moderate environmental perceptions. Noise
   sensitivity is an important factor in appraisal, but previous research
   has not linked levels of sensitivity to contextual factors. The
   objectives of this study were to understand how a high-volume traffic
   corridor and pollution hotspot could influence co-exposures to air
   pollution and traffic noise and consequent levels of noise annoyance.
   Data from a community survey (n = 610) along with modelled estimates of
   residential traffic noise and nitrogen dioxide exposure were utilized
   for the analyses. The effective loudness function for noise annoyance
   and an ordinal location-scale model showed that varying levels of
   co-exposure to traffic noise and air pollution along with odour
   annoyances in the corridor and a control area had strong effects on the
   noise annoyance dose-response. The results also indicated that there was
   a significantly higher level of error in predicting noise annoyance in
   the corridor area. There appeared to be neighbourhood-level differences
   in the effect of noise sensitivity on noise annoyance. The findings have
   important implications for our understanding of multiple exposures along
   with the influence of environmental context on noise annoyance. In
   particular, this study demonstrates that research on the effects of
   traffic noise across large urban areas may conceal important phenomena
   occurring at the neighbourhood level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The present work investigates the parallel channel density wave
   instability in the CANDU supercritical water reactor (SCWR) using a 1-D
   thermal-hydraulic model in the time domain. The model, which was used to
   analyze a single channel in-phase mode of instability in the SCWR, is
   extended for parallel channels in the reactor core to determine both
   in-phase and out-of-phase modes of oscillations considering the
   origination of the instabilities purely due to the thermal-hydraulic
   feedbacks without taking into account the influence of neutronic
   reactivity feedback effects. The capability of the proposed model to
   analyze the parallel channel instability is validated against the
   available experimental data. Extensive numerical investigations are
   carried out to determine the marginal stability boundary for each of the
   modes of oscillations in the working regime of the CANDU SCWR The effect
   of the asymmetric heating power on the instability thresholds is also
   studied. Finally, the relative dominance between the in-phase and
   out-of-phase modes of oscillations at the operating regime of the CANDU
   SCWR is determined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ionic liquid (ILs) pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass has attracted
   broad scientific interest, despite high costs, possible toxicity and
   energy intensive recycling. An alternative group of ionic solvents with
   similar physicochemical properties are deep eutectic solvents (DESs).
   Corncob residues were pretreated with three different DES systems:
   choline chloride and glycerol, choline chloride and imidazole, choline
   chloride and urea. The pretreated biomass was characterised in terms of
   lignin content, sugars concentration, enzymatic digestibility and
   crystallinity index. A reduction of lignin and hemicellulose content
   resulted in increased crystallinity of the pretreated biomass while the
   crystallinity of the cellulose fraction could be reduced, depending on
   DES system and operating conditions. The subsequent enzymatic
   saccharification was enhanced in terms of rate and extent. A total of 41
   g fermentable sugars (27 g glucose and 14 g xylose) could be recovered
   from 100 g corncob, representing 76\% (86\% and 63\%) of the initially
   available carbohydrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, batch tests were conducted to investigate the performance
   of mesophilic anaerobic digester sludge (ADS) at thermophilic conditions
   and estimate kinetic parameters for co-substrate fermentation. Starch
   and cellulose were used as mono-substrate and in combination as
   co-substrates (1: 1 mass ratio) to conduct a comparative assessment
   between mesophilic (37 degrees C) and thermophilic (60 degrees C)
   biohydrogen production. Unacclimatized mesophilic ADS responded well to
   the temperature change. The highest hydrogen yield of 1.13 mol H-2/mol
   hexose was observed in starch-only batches at thermophilic conditions.
   The thermophilic cellulose-only yield (0.42 mol H-2/mol hexose) was
   three times the mesophilic yield (0.13 mol H-2/mol hexose).
   Interestingly, co-fermentation of starch-cellulose at mesophilic
   conditions enhanced the hydrogen yield by 26\% with respect to estimated
   mono-substrate yields, while under thermophilic conditions no
   enhancement in the overall yield was observed. Interestingly, the
   estimated overall Monod kinetic parameters showed higher rates at

Title = {{Mineralization defects in cementum and craniofacial bone from loss of
   bone sialoprotein}},
Journal = {{BONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{150-164}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Bone sialoprotein (BSP) is a multifunctional extracellular matrix
   protein found in mineralized tissues, including bone, cartilage, tooth
   root cementum (both acellular and cellular types), and dentin. In order
   to define the role BSP plays in the process of biomineralization of
   these tissues, we analyzed cementogenesis, dentinogenesis, and
   osteogenesis (intramembranous and endochondral) in craniofacial bone in
   Bsp null mice and wild-type (WT) controls over a developmental period
   (1-60 days post natal; dpn) by histology, immunohistochemistry,
   undecalcified histochemistry, microcomputed tomography (microCT),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Regions of intramembranous
   ossification in the alveolus, mandible, and calvaria presented delayed
   mineralization and osteoid accumulation, assessed by von Kossa and
   Goldner's trichrome stains at 1 and 14 dpn. Moreover, Bsp(-/-) mice
   featured increased cranial suture size at the early time point, 1 dpn.
   Immunostaining and PCR demonstrated that osteoblast markers, osterix,
   alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin were unchanged in Bsp null
   mandibles compared to WT. Bsp(-/-) mouse molars featured a lack of
   functional acellular cementum formation by histology, SEM, and TEM, and
   subsequent loss of Sharpey's collagen fiber insertion into the tooth
   root structure. Bsp(-/-) mouse alveolar and mandibular bone featured
   equivalent or fewer osteoclasts at early ages (1 and 14 dpn), however,
   increased RANKL immunostaining and mRNA, and significantly increased
   number of osteodast-like cells (2-5 fold) were found at later ages (26
   and 60 dpn), corresponding to periodontal breakdown and severe alveolar
   bone resorption observed following molar teeth entering occlusion.
   Dentin formation was unperturbed in Bsp(-/-) mouse molars, with no delay
   in mineralization, no alteration in dentin dimensions, and no
   differences in odontoblast markers analyzed. No defects were identified
   in endochondral ossification in the cranial base, and craniofacial
   morphology was unaffected in Bsp(-/-) mice. These analyses confirm a
   critical role for BSP in processes of cementogenesis and intramembranous
   ossification of craniofacial bone, whereas endochondral ossification in
   the cranial base was minimally affected and dentinogenesis was normal in
   Bsp(-/-) molar teeth. Dissimilar effects of loss of BSP on
   mineralization of dental and craniofacial tissues suggest local
   differences in the role of BSP and/or yet to be defined interactions
   with site-specific factors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Personality disorder symptomatology (PD-Sx) can result in personal
   distress and impaired interpersonal functioning, even in the absence of
   a clinical diagnosis, and is frequently comorbid with psychiatric
   disorders such as substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders; however,
   they often remain untreated, and are not taken into account in clinical
   studies. To investigate brain morphological correlates of PD-Sx, we
   measured subcortical volume and shape, and cortical thickness/surface
   area, based on structural magnetic resonance images. We investigated 37
   subjects who reported PD-Sx exceeding DSM-IV Axis-II screening
   thresholds, and 35 age, sex, and smoking status-matched control
   subjects. Subjects reporting PD-Sx were then grouped into symptom-based
   clusters: N = 20 into Cluster B (reporting Antisocial, Borderline,
   Histrionic, or Narcissistic PD-Sx) and N = 28 into Cluster C (reporting
   Obsessive Compulsive, Avoidant, or Dependent PD-Sx); N = 11 subjects
   reported PDSx from both clusters, and none reported Cluster A (Paranoid,
   Schizoid, or Schizotypal) PD-Sx. Compared to control, Cluster C PD-Sx
   was associated with greater striatal surface area localized to the
   caudate tail, smaller ventral striatum volumes, and greater cortical
   thickness in right prefrontal cortex. Both Cluster B and C PD-Sx groups
   also showed trends toward greater posterior caudate volumes and
   orbitofrontal surface area anomalies, but these findings did not survive
   correction for multiple comparisons. The results point to morphological
   abnormalities that could contribute to Cluster C PDSx. In addition, the
   observations parallel those in substance use disorders, pointing to the
   importance of considering PD-Sx when interpreting findings in
   often-comorbid psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of CO2 removal from the headspace of
   a continuous flow biohydrogen production system on the H-2 yield and
   microbial community structure. A comparative study was conducted in the
   Integrated Biohydrogen Reactor Clarifier System (IBRCS) with and without
   potassium hydroxide in the reactor headspace to sequester CO2 using
   glucose. Headspace CO2 sequestration increased the H-2 yield by 22\% to
   2.96 +/- 0.14 mol/molhexose. The impact of headspace CO2 sequestration
   was not limited to the improvement in H-2 yield and gas quality, as it
   also influenced the metabolic pathway increasing acetate concentration,
   and decreasing butyrate and propionate concentrations. Detailed analyses
   of the microbial community structure in the IBRCS before and after CO2
   sequestration revealed that removal of CO2 from the headspace of the
   bioreactor had a significant impact on the microbial diversity and
   species distribution which rationalize the observed changes in the
   metabolic pathways. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications,

Abstract = {{Background Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and
   injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is
   an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies.
   In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated
   these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188
   countries between 1990 and 2013.
   Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence,
   prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important
   refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of
   chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements
   include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic
   reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian
   meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for
   various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data
   availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three
   periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620
   distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated
   estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The
   comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae,
   concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability
   weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey
   data from four countries.
   Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction
   of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age
   and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae
   were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with
   over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal
   disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due
   to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013.
   Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to
   non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic
   permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2.4 billion and 1.6
   billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in
   populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation
   between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from
   537.6 million in 1990 to 764.8 million in 2013 due to population growth
   and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from
   114.87 per 1000 people to 110.31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013.
   Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive
   disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates
   per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of
   increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use
   disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases;
   however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan
   Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to
   YLDs increased globally from 21.1\% in 1990 to 31.2\% in 2013.
   Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a
   substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of
   diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than
   mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will
   require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to
   non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is
   occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide
   future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends
   and a better understanding of variation across countries.}},

Abstract = {{Good stoichiometry of cadmium sulfide (CdS) film facilitates its
   application in photovoltaic devices; however, traditional thermal
   evaporation usually results in a Cd-deficient CdS film at a
   low-substrate temperature. In this study, Cd-rich CdS quantum dots (QDs)
   were synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method and used as the
   precursor to thermally evaporate CdS film on indium tin oxide-coated
   glass (ITO/glass). As a consequence, the stoichiometry of CdS film was
   greatly improved with atomic ratio of Cd to S restored to unity. More
   importantly, the newly developed CdS film, with its rod-like surface
   microstructure, acted as an efficient photoanode in a
   photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. Its properties, including surface
   morphology and roughness, crystal structure, chemical composition, film
   thickness, energy-level structure and photosensitivity, are studied in
   detail.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the possibility that leptin exerts an effect in NTS by
   inducing changes in the expression of pre- and/or post-synaptic
   proteins, experiments were done in Sprague-Dawley wild-type rats (WT)
   rats and leptin-deficient rats (Lep(Delta 151/Delta 151); KILO rat)
   exposed to 8 h of continuous intermittent hypoxia (IH) or normoxia.
   Protein was extracted from the caudal medial NTS and analyzed by western
   blot for the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
   tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), synaptophysin, synaptopodin and
   growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43). In WT rats, BDNF and GAP 43
   protein expression levels were not altered after IH or normoxia,
   although there was a trend towards an increase in BDNF expression. On
   the other hand, after IH, protein expression of both isoforms of the
   BDNF receptor TrkB (gp95 and gp145) was higher. Furthermore,
   synaptophysin protein expression was lower compared to normoxic WI rats.
   In the KILO rat, no changes were observed in the protein expression of
   BDNF, TrkB, or GAP 43 after IH when compared to KILO normoxic controls.
   However, synaptophysin was lower in the IH exposed KILO rat compared to
   normoxic controls, as found in the WT rat. Expression of synaptopodin
   was not detected in NTS in either IH or normoxic animals of all groups.
   These results suggest that leptin released during IH may contribute to
   neurotrophic changes occurring within NTS and that these changes may be
   associated with altered chemoreceptor reflex function. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Natural convection in a horizontal slot heated from above and from below
   has been considered. Each heating has a certain spatial distribution. It
   has been demonstrated that a wide variety of convection patterns can be
   generated by changing the relative position of both heating patterns. A
   significant intensification of convection, compared to convection
   resulting from heating applied at one wall only, results if there is no
   phase shift between both patterns, while a significant reduction of
   convection results from the phase shift corresponding to half of the
   heating wavelength. The system generates a nonzero mean shear stress at
   each wall for all phase shifts except shifts corresponding to half of
   and one full heating wavelength. This effect, which is generated within
   one convection cell, gives rise to a global force which may lead to a
   thermally induced drift of the walls if such a drift was allowed.}},

   core complex}},
Journal = {{TECTONOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{656}},

Abstract = {{The Yunmengshan metamorphic core complex (YMMCC) is situated in the
   northern part of the eastern North China Craton (NCC). The main
   structures in the YMMCC area include the arcuate Sihetang shear zone
   (SHTSZ) and the NE-striking Shuiyu shear zone (SYSZ). We present
   structural and geochronological evidence to show that the SHTSZ was a
   top-to-the-SSW thrusting zone formed between 140 and 137 Ma. The SYSZ is
   an extensional, top-to-the-SE shear zone developed between 131 and 114
   Ma, in association with intense magmatism and the development of the
   Huairou rifted basin in the hanging wall. Ductile shearing on the SYSZ
   was followed by isostatic rebound from 114 Ma to the end of the Early
   Cretaceous and then was replaced by brittle normal faulting. The normal
   displacement on the SYSZ and subsequent isostatic rebound led to the
   formation of the YMMCC The mechanism of formation is consistent with a
   rolling-hinge model of detachment faulting and core complex formation.
   The structural evolution of the Yunmengshan area, in common with the
   whole eastern NCC, thus records a rapid switch from a NNE-SSW shortening
   regime to a NW-SE extension one in the earliest Cretaceous. The intense
   NW-SE extension of the Early Cretaceous, as recorded by the YMMCC, was
   associated with peak lithospheric thinning in the eastern NCC. We
   attribute the shortening to the final closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk
   Ocean between the Siberian Craton and the North China-South Mongol
   block, and the extension to the back-arc deformation related to the
   subduction of the Izanagi Plate in the Pacific Ocean. We suggest that
   the Yunmengshan area illustrates how back-arc compression can be driven
   by the overriding plate motion, while connection of the overriding plate
   to a larger continent favors subduction-related back-arc extension. (C)

Abstract = {{Flow forming is an old, but still promising, sheet metal forming
   technique to produce thin-walled, high-precision cylindrical
   auto-components (i.e. carriers and clutch housings). In the present
   research, the flow forming process was carried out on some commonly used
   face centered cubic (FCC) metals to assess the effect of processing
   parameters on the mechanical responses of materials during flow forming.
   To this end, flow forming operation with thickness reduction of 70\% was
   performed on 5052 and 6061 aluminum alloys, 70/30 brass, and pure
   copper. Mechanical responses of starting (as received) materials and
   flow formed parts, i.e. tensile strength, yield strength, elongation,
   work hardening rate, and work hardening exponent were discussed for each
   material separately and the results were compared. Also, flow formed
   materials were compared in terms of stacking fault energies and
   twinnability and the effects of these were considered on flow
   formability of materials and their flow behavior in flow forming
   operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Myocardial fibrosis imaging using late gadolinium
   enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has been validated as
   a quantitative predictive marker for response to medical, surgical, and
   device therapy. To date, all such studies have examined conventional,
   non-phase corrected magnitude images. However, contemporary practice has
   rapdily adopted phase-corrected image reconstruction. We sought to
   investigate the existence of any systematic bias between threshold-based
   scar quantification performed on conventional magnitude inversion
   recovery (MIR) and matched phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR)
   images.
   Methods: In 80 patients with confirmed ischemic (N = 40), or
   non-ischemic (n = 40) myocardial fibrosis, and also in a healthy control
   cohort (N = 40) without fibrosis, myocardial late enhancement was
   quantified using a Signal Threshold Versus Reference Myocardium
   technique (STRM) at >= 2, >= 3, and >= 5 SD threshold, and also using
   the Full Width at Half Maximal (FWHM) technique. This was performed on
   both MIR and PSIR images and values compared using linear regression and
   Bland-Altman analyses.
   Results: Linear regression analysis demonstrated excellent correlation
   for scar volumes between MIR and PSIR images at all three STRM signal
   thresholds for the ischemic (N = 40, r = 0.96, 0.95, 0.88 at 2, 3, and 5
   SD, p < 0.0001 for all regressions), and non ischemic (N = 40, r = 0.86,
   0.89, 0.90 at 2, 3, and 5 SD, p < 0.0001 for all regressions) cohorts.
   FWHM analysis demonstrated good correlation in the ischemic population
   (N = 40, r = 0.83, p < 0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a
   systematic bias with MIR images showing higher values than PSIR for
   ischemic (3.3 \%, 3.9 \% and 4.9 \% at 2, 3, and 5 SD, respectively),
   and non-ischemic (9.7 \%, 7.4 \% and 4.1 \% at >= 2, >= 3, and >= 5 SD
   thresholds, respectively) cohorts. Background myocardial signal measured
   in the control population demonstrated a similar bias of 4.4 \%, 2.6 \%
   and 0.7 \% of the LV volume at 2, 3 and 5 SD thresholds, respectively.
   The bias observed using FWHM analysis was -6.9 \%.
   Conclusions: Scar quantification using phase corrected (PSIR) images
   achieves values highly correlated to those obtained on non-corrected
   (MIR) images. However, a systematic bias exists that appears exaggerated
   in non-ischemic cohorts. Such bias should be considered when comparing
   or translating knowledge between MIR- and PSIR-based imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersion of light-absorbing inorganic nanomaterials in transparent
   plastics such as poly (ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (PEVA) is of enormous
   current interest in emerging solar materials, including photovoltaic
   (PV) modules and commercial greenhouse films. Nanocrystalline
   semiconductor or quantum dots (QDs) have the potential to absorb UV
   light and selectively emit visible light, which can control plant growth
   in greenhouses or enhance PV panel efficiencies. This work provides a
   new and simple approach for loading mesoporous silica-encapsulated QDs
   into PEVA. Highly luminescent CdS and CdS-ZnS core-shell QDs with 5 nm
   size were synthesized using a modified facile approach based on
   pyrolysis of the single-molecule precursors and capping the CdS QDs with
   a thin layer of ZnS. To make both the bare and core-shell structure QDs
   more resistant against photochemical reactions, a mesoporous silica
   layer was grown on the QDs through a reverse microemulsion technique
   based on hydrophobic interactions. By careful experimental tuning, this
   encapsulation technique enhanced the quantum yield (similar to 65\%) and
   photostability compared to the bare QDs. Both the encapsulated bare and
   core-shell QDs were then melt-mixed with EVA pellets using a mini
   twin-screw extruder and pressed into thin films with controlled
   thickness. The results demonstrated for the first time that mesoporous
   silica not only enhanced the quantum yield and photostability of the QDs
   but also improved the compatibility and dispersibility of QDs throughout
   the PEVA films. The novel light selective films show high visible light
   transmission (similar to 90\%) and decreased UV transmission (similar to
   75\%).}},

Abstract = {{The optimum design solution of cable-stayed bridges is a complicated
   task. The large number of design parameters, strict design constraints
   imposed by design codes, highly geometrically nonlinear behaviour and
   robust effect of post-tensioning cable forces make traditional design
   methods not capable of achieving this task. In this study, an
   optimisation technique that integrates a finite element model, a genetic
   algorithm and polynomial functions for evaluating post-tensioning cable
   forces is adopted to develop a database for the optimum design of
   cable-stayed bridges. The database describes the variations of the
   optimum design parameters, including the main span length, height of the
   pylon, number of stay cables and cross-sectional dimensions of all
   elements with the total length of the bridge. The study concerns the
   optimisation of three-span composite cable-stayed bridges with semi-fan
   cable arrangements. The study covers bridge lengths ranging from 250 to
   700m. The database is presented in the form of simple design charts and
   tables. Such database is useful in the preliminary design and cost
   estimation for this type of bridges.}},

   using the stochastic finite-fault method (with multiple sub-events). The
   adopted techniques can capture a realistic source rupture process
   involving multiple strong motion generation areas in simulations.
   Statistical analysis of computed peak ductility demands for the three
   record sets is conducted via cloud and stripe analyses. Results indicate
   that for the 2011 Tohoku main shock, different record sets produce
   similar average trends of the inelastic seismic demand curves. This

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the results of a study on the characteristics
   of large-scale wave structure in the equatorial ionospheric F region
   that serve as precursor to postsunset development of the spread F/plasma
   bubble irregularities. The study is based on analysis of Digisonde data
   from three equatorial sites in Brazil (Fortaleza, Sao Luis, and
   Cachimbo) for a period of about 2months at a medium solar activity
   phase. Small-amplitude oscillations in the F layer heights, extracted at
   a number of plasma frequencies, present characteristics as them being
   generated from upward propagating gravity waves. They represent wave
   structures in polarization electric field having zonal scale of a few
   hundred kilometers. Their amplitudes in the afternoon hours undergo
   amplification toward evening, leading to postsunset development of
   equatorial spread F/plasma bubble irregularities, on a statistical
   basis. On the days of their larger amplitudes they appear to occur in
   phase coherence on all days, and correspondingly, the evening
   prereversal vertical drift velocities are larger than on days of the
   smaller amplitudes of the wave structure that appear at random phase on
   the different days. The sustenance of these precursor wave structures is
   supported by the relatively large ratio (approaching unity) of the F
   region-to-total field line-integrated Pedersen conductivities as
   calculated using the Sheffield University Plasmasphere-Ionosphere Model
   simulation of the low-latitude ionosphere. The significant amplification
   in the wave structure toward sunset and the phase coherent nature of
   their occurrences on different days are explained tentatively on the
   basis of the spatial resonance mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{An injectable composite scaffold incorporating decellularized adipose
   tissue (DAT) as a bioactive matrix within a hydrogel phase capable of in
   situ polymerization would be advantageous for adipose-derived stem cell
   (ASC) delivery in the filling of small or irregular soft tissue defects.
   Building on previous work, the current study investigates DAT milling
   methods and the effects of DAT particle size and cell seeding density on
   the response of human ASCs encapsulated in photo-cross-linkable
   methacrylated chondroitin sulphate (MCS)-DAT composite hydrogels. DAT
   particles were generated by milling lyophilized DAT and the particle
   size was controlled through the processing conditions with the goal of
   developing composite scaffolds with a tissue-specific 3D
   microenvironment tuned to enhance adipogenesis. ASC proliferation and
   adipogenic differentiation were assessed in vitro in scaffolds
   incorporating small (average diameter of 38 +/- 6 mu m) or large
   (average diameter of 278 +/- 3 mu m) DAT particles in comparison to MCS
   controls over a period of up to 21 d. Adipogenic differentiation was
   enhanced in the composites incorporating the smaller DAT particles and
   seeded at the higher density of 5 x 10(5) ASCs/scaffold, as measured by
   glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) enzyme activity,
   semi-quantitative analysis of perilipin expression and oil red O
   staining of intracellular lipid accumulation. Overall, this study
   demonstrates that decellularized tissue particle size can impact stem
   cell differentiation through cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions,
   providing relevant insight towards the rational design of composite
   biomaterial scaffolds for adipose tissue engineering.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, dynamic and quasi-static analyses were performed
   to investigate the response of multiple-spanned and single-spanned
   transmission line conductors under both downburst and synoptic winds
   considering different wind velocities and different length spans. Two
   critical downburst configurations, recommended in the literature and
   expected to cause maximum conductor reactions, were considered in the
   analyses. The objective of the study was to assess the importance of
   including the dynamic effect when predicting the conductor's reactions
   on the towers. This was achieved by calculating the mean, the background
   and the resonant reaction components, and evaluating the contribution of
   the resonant component to the peak reaction. The results show that the
   maximum contribution of the resonant component is generally low (in the
   order of 6\%) for the multiple-spanned system at different wind
   velocities for both downburst and synoptic winds. For the single-spanned
   system, the result show a relatively high maximum contribution (in the
   order of 16\%) at low wind velocity and a low maximum contribution (in
   the order of 6\%) at high wind velocity for both downburst and synoptic
   winds. Such contributions may justify the usage of the quasi-static
   approach for analyzing transmission line conductors subjected to the
   high wind velocities typically used for the line design.}},

Title = {{Prediction of local proximal tibial subchondral bone structural

Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative computed tomography based subject-specific
   finite element modeling has potential to clarify the role of subchondral
   bone alterations in knee osteoarthritis initiation, progression, and
   pain initiation. Calculation of bone elastic moduli from image data is a
   basic step when constructing finite element models. However, different
   relationships between elastic moduli and imaged density (known as
   density-modulus relationships) have been reported in the literature. The
   objective of this study was to apply seven different trabecular-specific
   and two cortical-specific density-modulus relationships from the
   literature to finite element models of proximal tibia subchondral bone,
   and identify the relationship(s) that best predicted experimentally
   measured local subchondral structural stiffness with highest explained
   variance and least error.
   Methods: Thirteen proximal tibial compartments were imaged via
   quantitative computed tomography. Imaged bone mineral density was
   converted to elastic moduli using published density-modulus
   relationships and mapped to corresponding finite element models.
   Proximal tibial structural stiffness values were compared to
   experimentally measured stiffness values from in-situ macro-indentation
   testing directly on the subchondral bone surface (47 indentation
   points).
   Findings: Regression lines between experimentally measured and finite
   element calculated stiffness had R-2 values ranging from 0.56 to 0.77.
   Normalized root mean squared error varied from 16.6\% to 337.6\%.
   Interpretation: Of the 21 evaluated density-modulus relationships in
   this study, Goulet combined with Snyder and Schneider or Rho appeared
   most appropriate for finite element modeling of local subchondral bone
   structural stiffness. Though, further studies are needed to optimize
   density-modulus relationships and improve finite element estimates of
   local subchondral bone structural stiffness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel multi-master/single-slave (MM/SS) teleoperated
   framework is proposed. The desired objectives for the MM/SS system are
   presented in such a way that both cooperative and training applications,
   e.g., surgical teleoperation and surgical training, can benefit.
   Passivity of the system is investigated, and it is shown that an ideal
   MM/SS system, depending on its structure, may not always be passive
   unlike a conventional SM/SS system. An impedance-based control
   methodology is developed to satisfy the desired objectives of the MM/SS
   system in the presence of communication delays. The small-gain theorem
   is used to analyze the closed-loop stability, deriving a sufficient
   condition to guarantee system stability in the presence of time delays.
   Experimental results conducted on an MM/SS system are presented to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Haptic information provides important cues in teleoperated systems. It
   enables the user to feel the interaction with a remote or virtual
   environment during teleoperation. The two main objectives in designing a
   haptic interface are stability and transparency. An actuator with poor
   dynamics, high inertia, large size, and heavy weight can significantly
   undermine these goals. In this article, the potential benefits of
   magnetorheological fluid (MRF)-based actuators to the field of haptics
   are discussed. Devices developed with such fluids are known to possess
   superior mechanical characteristics over conventional servo systems.
   These characteristics significantly contribute to improved stability and
   transparency of haptic devices. In this study, this idea is evaluated
   from both theoretical and experimental points of view. First, the
   properties of such actuators which motivated this research are
   discussed. Next, two single degree-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interfaces,
   one with an MRF-based clutch and the other with a brushless DC motor,
   are compared in a virtual wall experiment in order to show the
   superiority of the MRF-based clutch. In addition, the design of a
   small-scale MRF-based clutch, suitable for a multi-DOF haptic interface,
   is discussed and its torque capacity, inertia, and mass are compared
   with conventional servo systems. Conclusions drawn from this
   investigation indicate that MRF-based actuation approaches can indeed be
   developed to design haptic interfaces with improved stability and
   transparency.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a control methodology is proposed for guiding and
   stabilizing flexible bevel-tip needles to an arbitrary planar slice. The
   proposed controller is an adaptive version of the previously proposed
   nonlinear output feedback controller, which was built upon the
   well-known nonholonomic kinematic model of needle steering. On the
   grounds that such a model is subject to parametric uncertainty, an
   adaptive controller is necessary for adjusting the model parameters. In
   addition, a nonlinear observer is required due to the existence of some
   unmeasurable state variables. Although the original form of the studied
   system is linearly parameterized, its canonical form is not, preventing
   the application of conventional adaptive control schemes. In this paper,
   a nonlinear adaptive control methodology is proposed and applied to the
   guidance problem of steerable needles. Through simulation results, it is
   illustrated that the proposed methodology greatly outperforms the
   existing feedback linearization-based approach.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Hyperpolarized He-3 magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) ventilation abnormalities are visible in ex-smokers without
   airflow limitation, but the clinical relevance of this is not
   well-understood. Our objective was to phenotype healthy ex-smokers with
   normal and abnormally elevated ventilation defect percent (VDP).
   Materials and Methods: Sixty ex-smokers without airflow limitation
   provided written informed consent to He-3 MRI, computed tomography (CT),
   and pulmonary function tests in a single visit. He-3 MRI VDP and
   apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured for whole-lung and
   each lung lobe as were CT measurements of emphysema (relative area
   {[}RA] with attenuation <=-950 HU, RA(950)) and airway morphology (wall
   area percent {[}WA\%], lumen area {[}LA] and LA normalized to body
   surface area {[}LA/BSA]).
   Results: In 42 ex-smokers, there was abnormally elevated VDP and no
   significant differences for pulmonary function, RA950, or airway
   measurements compared to 18 ex-smokers with normal VDP. Ex-smokers with
   abnormally elevated VDP reported significantly greater He-3 ADC in the
   apical lung (right upper lobe {[}RUL], P = .02; right middle lobe
   {[}RML], P = .04; and left upper lobe {[}LUL], P = .009). Whole lung
   (r=0.40, P=.001) and lobar VDP (RUL, r = 0.32, P = .01; RML, r = 0.46,
   P=.002; right lower lobe {[}RLLI, r=0.38, P=.003; LUL, r=0.35, P=.006;
   and left lower lobe, r = 0.37, P = .004) correlated with regional He-3
   ADC. Although whole-lung VDP and CT airway morphology measurements were
   not correlated, regional VDP was correlated with RUL LA (r = 0.37, P =
   .004), LA/BSA (r = 0.42, P = .0008), RLL WA \% (r = 0.28, P = .03), LA
   (r = -0.28, P = .03), and LA/BSA (r = -0.37, P = .004).
   Conclusions: Abnormally elevated VDP in ex-smokers without airflow
   limitation was coincident with very mild emphysema detected using MRI
   and regional airway remodeling detected using CT representing a
   subclinical obstructive lung disease phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent publication it was proposed that rotational cooling is due
   to angular propulsion. While this fact is obscured in a traditional
   shrouded vortex tube, it is clearly visible when the vortex tube effect
   is demonstrated without confining walls. It is thus established that the
   shrouded vortex tube behaves as a rotorless turboexpander, cogenerating
   both cold and hot gas. The physics of the turboexpander, the shrouded
   vortex tube, and the vortex without walls is shown to be governed by
   Eulers turbine equation. It is also concluded that propulsion generating
   vortices can exist without supporting or confining structures.}},

Title = {{Silencing of miR-195 reduces diabetic cardiomyopathy in C57BL/6 mice}},
Journal = {{DIABETOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1949-1958}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis MicroRNAs (miRs) have been suggested as potential
   therapeutic targets for heart diseases. Inhibition of miR-195 prevents
   apoptosis in cardiomyocytes stimulated with palmitate and transgenic
   overexpression of miR-195 induces cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.
   We investigated whether silencing of miR-195 reduces diabetic
   cardiomyopathy in a mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1
   diabetes.
   Methods Type 1 diabetes was induced in C57BL/6 mice (male, 2 months old)
   by injections of STZ.
   Results MiR-195 expression was increased and levels of its target
   proteins (B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 and sirtuin 1) were decreased in
   STZ-induced type 1 and db/db type 2 diabetic mouse hearts. Systemically
   delivering an anti-miR-195 construct knocked down miR-195 expression in
   the heart, reduced caspase-3 activity, decreased oxidative stress,
   attenuated myocardial hypertrophy and improved myocardial function in
   STZ-induced mice with a concurrent upregulation of B cell
   leukaemia/lymphoma 2 and sirtuin 1. Diabetes reduced myocardial
   capillary density and decreased maximal coronary blood flow in mice.
   Knockdown of miR-195 increased myocardial capillary density and improved
   maximal coronary blood flow in diabetic mice. Upregulation of miR-195
   sufficiently induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and attenuated the
   angiogenesis of cardiac endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore,
   inhibition of miR-195 prevented apoptosis in cardiac endothelial cells
   in response to NEFA, an important feature of diabetes.
   Conclusions/interpretation Therapeutic silencing of miR-195 reduces
   myocardial hypertrophy and improves coronary blood flow and myocardial
   function in diabetes, at least in part by reducing oxidative damage,
   inhibiting apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis. Thus, miR-195 may
   represent an alternative therapeutic target for diabetic heart diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The authors apply two approaches to reduce the computation time of the
   residual complexity similarity metric employed in image registration
   applications aimed at hardware-based implementations with low-complexity
   transforms. First, the similarity metric is computed in image
   sub-blocks, which are subsequently combined into a global metric value.
   Second, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) needed in the computation of
   the similarity measure is replaced with multiplier-free low-complexity
   approximate transforms. The authors propose a new low-complexity
   transform requiring only 18 additions in an 8 x 8 block and compare it
   to: the round DCT, the signed DCT, the Hadamard transform and the
   Walsh-Hadamard transform. Detailed computational complexity analysis
   reveals that block-wise processing alone reduces computational cost by a
   factor of 8-9 for original DCT composed of multiplications and
   additions, and up to similar or equal to 4.90 when the proposed DCT is
   utilised; being the computation performed with additions only. Results
   obtained from computer simulated and realistic X-ray images demonstrate
   block-wise processing and approximate transforms result in successful
   image registration, making residual complexity similarity measure
   available to hardware-accelerated fast image registration applications.}},

Abstract = {{Computed tomography provides high contrast imaging of the joint anatomy
   and is used routinely to reconstruct 3D models of the osseous and
   cartilage geometry (CT arthrography) for use in the design of orthopedic
   implants, for computer assisted surgeries and computational dynamic and
   structural analysis. The objective of this study was to assess the
   accuracy of bone and cartilage surface model reconstructions by
   comparing reconstructed geometries with bone digitizations obtained
   using an optical tracking system. Bone surface digitizations obtained in
   this study determined the ground truth measure for the underlying
   geometry. We evaluated the use of a commercially available
   reconstruction technique using clinical CT scanning protocols using the
   elbow joint as an example of a surface with complex geometry. To assess
   the accuracies of the reconstructed models (8 fresh frozen cadaveric
   specimens) against the ground truth bony digitization as defined by this
   study proximity mapping was used to calculate residual error. The
   overall mean error was less than 0.4 mm in the cortical region and 0.3

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{19-33}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The exposure category for many meteorological stations in China is
   temporally varying because of the rapid urbanization and revitalization
   of cities in last few decades. This causes difficulty in correcting or
   adjusting the surface wind observations to a standard exposure
   condition, especially if the information on the temporal changes in the
   surrounding terrain of the stations is rarely available. This study is
   to investigate the feasibility of using the temporally varying exposure
   adjustment factors to process the surface wind observation for extreme
   value analysis; and to explore the spatial and temporal trends of the
   extreme wind speed using the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 2 data. Extreme value
   analysis of the annual maximum wind speed V is carried out using the
   adjusted surface wind observations from about 150 stations. The
   resulting 50-year return period values of V are employed to develop wind
   hazard maps of China and are compared with those inferred from the
   current Chinese design code. The comparison indicates that there is
   potential to develop new and update the existing wind maps by taking
   advantage of some of the up to date surface wind observations that are
   adjusted using temporally varying exposure adjustment factors. Also, the
   analysis results indicate that the reanalysis data is useful to explore
   temporal and spatial trends of the extreme wind speeds and to aid the
   process of developing and updating the wind hazard maps of China. (c)

Journal = {{ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{43-47}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Composites consisting of graphene nanosheets (GNSs) decorated with
   amorphous TiO2 thin films were synthesized by an atomic layer deposition
   (ALD) technique. It was revealed that the TiO2 thin films were uniformly
   deposited onto the worm-like GNSs. When used as anode materials in
   lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the TiO2-GNS composites deliver a stable
   capacity of similar to 140 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a specific
   current of 100 rnA g(-1) as well as superior rate capability, accounting
   for a sustainable 95 mAh g(-1) capacity at a specific current of 1200 mA
   g(-1). It is believed that the remarkable electrochemical performance
   lied in the unique features of the composites, i.e., the amorphous
   nature of the TiO2 films and the large surface area of GNSs. The former
   rendered short Li+ diffusion pathways in TiO2 thin film, while the
   latter offered excellent electronic conductivity as well as a large
   intimate contact area between the electrolyte and TiO2. This work laid a
   venue for designing new electrodes for high-performance LIBs. (C) 2015

Title = {{Augmented glenoid component designs for type B2 erosions: a
   computational comparison by volume of bone removal and quality of
   remaining bone}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1218-1226}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this computational modeling study was to
   compare the volume of glenoid bone removal required to implant 3
   augmented component designs for management of B2 erosions. In addition,
   we assessed bone quality of the supporting bone directly beneath the
   implants by measuring bone density and porosity.
   Methods: Three augmented component designs-full-wedge, posterior-wedge,
   and posterior-step-were studied by virtual implantation in a cohort of
   16 patients with B2 glenoids. B2 retroversion was corrected to 0 degrees
   and 10 degrees. The outcome variables were the volume of glenoid bone
   removal required for implantation and the density and porosity of the
   bone immediately beneath the implant.
   Results: Implant design had a significant effect on the volume of bone
   removal (P < .001). When correcting to 0 degrees, the posterior-wedge
   implant removed less bone than the posterior-step (P < .001) and the
   full-wedge (P = .004). At 10 degrees retroversion, the posterior-wedge
   removed less bone (P = .029) than the posterior-step but was no
   different than the full-wedge (P = .143). The residual glenoid bone
   density with the posterior-wedge was significantly greater than with the
   posterior-step (P = .048), with no other significant differences (P >
   .05). Residual glenoid bone porosity was not significantly different
   between implants (P > .262).
   Conclusions: Augmented components can provide a bone-preserving option
   for B2 glenoid management. Substantial variations in the volume of bone
   removal and the quality of the remaining glenoid bone were found between
   3 different designs of augmented implants. Simulations with the
   posterior-wedge implant resulted in substantially less glenoid bone
   removal, with the remaining supporting bone being of better quality. (C)

Abstract = {{A design methodology was developed for prilling towers based on
   simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum balances. Basic principles of the
   prilling process and related sub-models were considered for production
   of relatively mono-size prills. The method was employed in the design of
   a prilling tower for production of ammonium nitrate prills from a highly
   concentrated solution. A special showerhead spray, operating under
   laminar conditions in a Rayleigh jet break-up regime, was designed to
   enhance production of mono-size prills. Air was used at ambient
   conditions. The droplets leaving the showerhead fall through the air
   stream in a counter-current fashion. Heat transfer from particles to air
   includes cooling in the fully liquid state, solidification, and cooling
   in the fully solid state. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
   simulation revealed the formation of a quiescent zone around the nozzle
   discharge region, which had a significant effect on decreasing the
   secondary disintegration of the droplets, and hence narrowed down the
   size distribution towards the desired value. The size of the produced
   prills was larger than the predicted value due to the formation of
   ammonia bubbles inside the prills.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous increase of mobile data traffic has created a substantial
   demand for high data rate transmission over mobile networks. However,
   mobile devices are provided with small batteries that can be drained
   quickly by high data rate transmission. Motivated by the fundamental
   requirement of extending the battery utilization time per charge of
   mobile devices, this work presents two power-efficient schedulers for
   mixed streaming services in LTE uplink systems. Our objective is to
   minimize the total transmission power for all users. The proposed
   schedulers are subject to rate, delay, contiguous allocation, and
   maximum transmission power constraints. We first consider an optimal
   scheduler that uses binary integer programming (BIP). Then, we propose
   an iterative scheduler that performs a low-complexity greedy algorithm
   which solves the BIP problem. We compare the performance of the proposed
   schedulers to the state-of-the-art schedulers such as the energy-aware
   resource allocation (EARA) {[}1] and the proportional fair (PF) {[}2] in
   terms of rate, delay, average transmission power and complexity.
   Simulation results show that the proposed schedulers offer a remarkable
   transmission power reduction as compared to the PF and the EARA
   schedulers, and satisfy the QoS requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study on the hydrodynamics in the downcomer of a liquid
   solid circulating fluidized bed (LSCFB) is crucial in the control and
   optimization of the extraction process using an ion exchange LSCFB. A
   computational fluid dynamics model is proposed in this study to simulate
   the counter-current two-phase flow in the downcomer of the LSCFB. The
   model is based on the Eulerian Eulerian approach incorporating the
   kinetic theory of granular flow. The predicted results agree well with
   our earlier experimental data. Furthermore, it is shown that the bed
   expansion of the particles in the downcomer is directly affected by the
   superficial liquid velocity in downcomer and solids circulation rate.
   The model also predicts the residence time of solid particles in the
   downcomer using a pulse technique. It is demonstrated that the increase
   in the superficial liquid velocity decreases the solids dispersion in
   the downcomer of the LSCFB. (C) 2014 Chinese Society of Particuology and

Abstract = {{Hydrolytic depolymerization of hydrolysis lignin (HL) in water and

   polyurethane foams/resins un-catalyzed depolymerization of HL employing
   water-ethanol mixture appeared to be a viable route with high yield of
   DHL similar to 70.5 wt.\% (SR yield of similar to 9.8 wt.\%) and with
   M-w as low as similar to 1000 g/mole with suitable aliphatic (227.1 mg

   carbon recovery under the selected best route was similar to 87\%. Acid
   catalyzed depolymerization of HL in water and water-ethanol mixture lead

Abstract = {{Lignin pyrolysis was studied in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor

   Results how that a bed of activated lignin char is preferable to the

   activated lignin char not only provides a pure char product, but also a
   higher dry bio-oil yield (with a relative increase of 43\%), lower
   pyrolytic water production, and better bio-oil quality. The bio-oil
   obtained from Kraft lignin pyrolysis with a bed of activated lignin char
   has a lower average molecular weight, less tar, more phenolics, and less

Title = {{Bio-oil from pyrolysis of wood pellets using a microwave multimode oven
   and different microwave absorbers}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{464-482}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Wood pellets were pyrolyzed using a microwave oven and different
   microwave power, apparatus set-up and microwave absorbers (none, Fe, and
   carbon).
   Pyrolysis was realized in a short time in the presence of Fe or carbon
   while it was incomplete if the absorber was not present. Furthermore
   when the absorber was present the shape of the pellets remained
   unaltered while if the absorber was not employed pellets were
   disaggregated.
   Three fractions were collected from each pyrolysis: a gas, a liquid also
   called bio-oil and a solid called bio-char. The bio-oil contained two
   phases and they were quantitatively characterized through a GC/MSFID
   procedure using an internal standard according to a previously reported
   method. HPLC/MS, FTIR and H-1 NMR spectroscopy were also employed for
   characterization of these liquids. Cellulose pyrolysis products were
   present in the upper phase such as water, acetic acid, furans (such as
   furfural), carbohydrates and their derivatives. Compounds from pyrolysis
   of lignin such as phenols and veratric acid were present in the bottom
   phase.
   The microwave assisted pyrolysis showed the possibility to efficiently
   convert wood pellets in different products. The main economical
   important components may be separated and used as chemicals, natural
   drugs or pesticides, while the remaining components, the solid and the
   gas may be used for energy production (solid and bio-oil). Solid may be
   also used for carbon sequestration. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published

Title = {{Bubble breakup in co-current upward flowing liquid using honeycomb
   monolith breaker}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{131}},

Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Bubble column reactors are used in industrial practices due to their
   intrinsic advantages of good mixing ability, high heat transfer and
   operational versatility. Generation of small bubbles in bubble column is
   a crucial step to improve their performance. The present investigation
   introduces a new approach for bubble breakup in an upward co-flowing
   liquid using a honeycomb monolith breaker with square cell structure.
   The experimental measurements were conducted using high speed imaging at
   different superficial liquid velocities and gas flow rates ranging
   between 8 to 50 cm/s and 165 to 1000 ml/min, respectively. A comparison
   between the bubbles generated from the monolith breaker and those
   generated from the nozzle shows that the monolith breaker reduces the
   bubble size by approximately 60\% over the given range of liquid
   superficial velocities and gas Row rates. It is observed that at low
   superficial liquid velocities and low gas Row rates, the bubble size at
   the breaker exit follows log-normal distribution, which becomes more
   symmetric at higher superficial liquid velocities and gas Row rates. The
   main contributor of large bubbles formation at the monolith breaker exit
   is the bubbles' coalescence. Different mechanisms of bubbles coalescence
   at the breaker outlet are observed and classified into three types;
   multi- and successive `'accumulative{''} coalescence, multi- and
   non-successive coalescence, and bubbles coalescence in the vicinity of
   the breaker outlet. The efficiency of the breaker is quantified in terms
   of the fractional conversion of bubbles' kinetic energy into the surface
   energy. A strong dependency of the breaker efficiency on the superficial
   liquid velocity is observed. The results indicate that an optimal liquid
   velocity exists that corresponds to the minimal bubble coalescence at
   which the breaker efficiency is maximum. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The sympathetic nervous system increases skeletal muscle arteriolar
   resistance by activating adrenergic, peptidergic and purinergic
   receptors, which may depend on network topology.
   To date, there has been limited work conducted on
   topologically-dependent sympathetic nervous system control in
   continuously branching skeletal muscle microvascular networks.
   In the present study, we investigated how arterioles respond to
   activation of receptors for sympathetic neurotransmitters based on their
   location within continuously branching arteriolar trees in skeletal
   muscle.
   For the first time, we show differential order-dependent responses to
   adrenergic, peptidergic and purinergic agonists in continuously
   branching arteriolar trees.
   These results provide novel and detailed network data describing
   full-range sympathetic control in the skeletal muscle microcirculation.
   This work provides much needed experimental data, which can be applied
   to mathematical models of skeletal muscle blood flow and oxygen
   transport.
   The effect of the sympathetic nervous system on blood flow distribution
   within skeletal muscle microvasculature is conditional upon regional
   activation of receptors for sympathetic neurotransmitters. Previous
   studies have shown that proximal arterioles are largely governed by
   adrenergic activation, whereas it is speculated that distal branches are
   controlled by peptidergic and purinergic activation. However, no study
   has systematically evaluated the activation of adrenergic, peptidergic
   and purinergic receptors in continuously branching arteriolar trees of
   an individual skeletal muscle model. Therefore, in the present study,
   sympathetic agonists were used to evaluate the constriction responses
   along first to fifth order arterioles in continuously branching
   arteriolar trees of a in vivo rat gluteus maximus muscle preparation
   with respect to specific activation of receptors for sympathetic
   neurotransmitters (1R, 2R, NPY1R and P2X1R). Constriction responses were
   incorporated into a mathematical blood flow model to estimate the total
   flow, resistance and red blood cell flow heterogeneity within a
   computationally reconstructed gluteus maximus arteriolar network. For
   the first time, the effects of activating receptors for sympathetic
   neurotransmitters on vasoconstrictor responses and the ensuing
   haemodynamics in continuously branching arteriolar trees of skeletal
   muscle were characterized, where proximal arterioles responded most to
   1R and 2R adrenergic activation, whereas distal arterioles responded
   most to Y1R and P2X1R activation. Total flow and resistance changed with
   activation of all receptors, whereas red blood cell flow heterogeneity
   was largely affected by peptidergic and purinergic activation in distal
   arterioles. The reported data highlight the functional consequences of
   topologically-dependent sympathetic control and may serve as novel input
   parameters in computational modelling of network flow.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of attachment of nanocrystals (NCs) to curved carbonaceous
   species such as graphene nanoribbons and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is of
   current scientific interest. In addition, we have observed anisotropic
   growth patterns of titania NCs from carbonaceous materials, for which
   there is no theoretical explanation. In this work, we use density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations for calculating the energy of
   adsorption of titania nanostructures to both armchair metallic and
   zigzag semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in their
   pure and functionalized forms. Several adsorption sites are considered
   including top, bridge, and hollow sites for pure SWCNTs, while for
   functionalized SWCNTs epoxy, alcohol, and carboxylate are examined.
   Results from binding energy calculations were found to predict favorable
   adsorption of TiO2 NCs on the chemical adsorption sites of
   functionalized SWCNTs compared to the physical adsorption sites of pure
   SWCNTs. The rotation of anatase and rutile titania species on the
   physical adsorption sites showed interesting behavior particularly
   regarding binding strength and growth direction predictions. Partial
   density of states (PDOS) calculations examined the electronic structure
   of the assemblies. Charge density maps showed the importance of
   chemisorption sites for interactions between titania structures and
   SWCNTs. Electronic local potentials showed the difference in binding
   strengths for anatase titania on SWCNT physical adsorption sites. These
   results provide new theoretical evidence for controlled and oriented
   growth mechanisms on curved carbon-based substrates that have
   applications in various emerging applications from photovoltaic devices
   to nanomedicine.}},

Abstract = {{The development of covalent polyisobutylene (PIB)- paclitaxel (PTX)
   conjugates as a potential approach to controlling drug release from
   vascular stent coatings is described. PIB-PTX materials containing
   similar to 24 and similar to 48 wt \% PTX, conjugated via ester
   linkages, were prepared. The PTX release profiles were compared with
   those of physical mixtures of PTX with carboxylic acid-functionalized
   PIE and. with the triblock copolymer polystyrene-b-PIB-b-polystyrene
   (SIBS). Covalent conjugation led to significantly slower drug release.
   Atomic force microscopy imaging of coatings of the materials suggested
   that the physical mixtures exhibited multiple domains corresponding to
   phase separation, whereas the materials in which PTX was covalently
   conjugated appeared homogeneous. Coatings of the conjugated materials on
   stainless steel surfaces suffered less surface erosion than the
   physically mixed materials, remained intact, and adhered well to the
   surface throughout the thirty-five day study. Tensile testing and
   rheological studies suggested that the incorporation of PTX into the
   polymer introduces similar physical changes to the NB as the
   incorporation of a glassy polystyrene block does in SIBS. Cytotoxicity
   assays showed that the coatings did not release toxic levels of PTX or
   other species into a cell culture medium over a 24 h period, yet the
   levels of PTX in the materials were sufficient to prevent C2C12 cells
   from adhering to and proliferating on them. Overall, these results
   indicate that covalent PIB-PTX conjugates have promise as coatings for
   vascular stents.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-based modelling is indispensable to science. Be it in the field
   of social or environmental science, modelling is used to learn, to gain
   new insights into behaviours and to raise awareness. In addition to
   Cellular Automaton and Agent-Based Modelling, System Dynamics (SD) has
   evolved as an approach which opened up the field of mathematical
   modelling to non-mathematicians by establishing a simple Visual
   Modelling Language. Even though there have been recent developments in
   expanding SD to include space, Spatial System Dynamics (SSD) hasn't
   received much attention in geosciences. The typology of SSD introduced
   in this paper is intended to spur discussions on future possible uses.
   Models are categorised into three process groups: local processes,
   diffusion processes and processes that modify space itself. For the
   latter category spatial analysis may be incorporated into SSD
   applications. This has been illustrated by means of a model on the
   co-evolution of surface runoff and landform change.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Effects of grooving in a porous faced hydrostatic circular step thrust
   bearing are investigated using a mathematical model based on the narrow
   groove theory (NGT). It is shown that enhancement of load capacity by
   grooving the step is possible at moderate level of permeability of the
   porous facing. Load capacity drops sharply with the increase of porous
   facing thickness. However, this drop in load capacity occurs mostly
   within a small thickness of the porous facing. Considering the coupled
   effects of permeability and inertia, it is recommended that the
   dimensionless step location should be 0.5-0.8 and the dimensionless step
   height should be less than five to take advantage of grooving. The
   groove geometric parameters such as groove inclination angle, fraction
   of grooved area and groove depth corresponding to the maximum load
   capacity are found to be the same for both with and without porous
   facing. However, with porous facing, the sensitivity of the load
   capacity on the groove parameters reduces. At high level of
   permeability, the effects of grooves may become insignificant because of
   high seepage flow through the porous facing.}},

   Mathematical model of this mechanism has been constructed in the form of

   transformations. Though various conjectures have been proposed to
   explain the concept of boundary layer flow, we are presenting Adomian
   decomposition method (ADM) to simulate the solution of the present
   model. We used the diagonal pad, approximant to achieve the better
   convergence in the solution of ADM. For the sake of validation,
   Adomian's solution is compared with the two different techniques
   (Optimal HAM and Runge-KuttaFelburge method). The velocity profiles for
   various embedded parameters have been plotted and examined. Numerical
   values of skin-friction coefficient are calculated against various

Abstract = {{Thermally conductive high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composites with
   high loadings of flake graphite (FG) and expandable graphite (EG) were
   prepared by melt-blending process. Thermal conductivity of the
   composites was measured by hot disk method, and a very high value of
   13.41 W/mK was obtained for HDPE/EG composite with 60 wt\% EG, which is
   28.3 times and 60.4 \% higher than the values obtained for the HDPE and
   an HDPE/FG system with 60 wt\% FG, respectively. Two-point method was
   applied to evaluate the electrical conductivity of the composites with
   various graphite loadings, and thermal percolation was observed in the
   vicinity of the electrical percolation threshold concentration. Dynamic
   rheology analysis was employed to define the geometrical changes caused
   by the interconnection of the inorganic fillers. The results showed that
   the in situ exfoliation of EG during the blending process could form
   more effective conductive pathways than those of FG-filled composites at
   the same graphite loadings. Such kind of pathways was responsible for
   the substantial improvement of the overall thermal and electrical
   conductivity of HDPE/EG composites. The results of dynamic rheology also
   confirmed that the thermally conductive networks were primarily formed
   at approximately 20 and 40 wt\% of graphite concentrations for HDPE/EG
   and HDPE/FG composites, respectively.}},

Title = {{A simple procedure for chromatographic analysis of bio-oils from
   pyrolysis}},

Abstract = {{A simple procedure was suggested for the chromatographic analyses of
   bio-oils from pyrolysis of various feedstock employing different
   technologies. An acetonitrile solution of each bio-oil was prepared
   without any extraction or other sample pretreatments. Preliminary thin
   layer chromatography showed a large number of compounds having a broad
   range of retention factors (Rfs) among 0-1. Products having a retention
   factor over 0.9 were mainly detected by GC while some other compounds
   were only identified by HPLC. GC/MS-FID analysis was used to identify
   and quantify compounds using peak areas and relative response factors
   (RRFs). A new equation was proposed to estimate RRFs of compounds
   identified via their MS spectra when experimental RRFs were not readily
   available. The novel procedure was employed to characterize bio-oils
   from pyrolysis of wood of different source or obtained using different
   pyrolysis procedure. Using this RRF method guaiacol, furfural,
   butan-2-one, levoglucosan, acetic acid and many other compounds were
   quantified in bio-oil samples. Different amount of them were found as a
   function of the type of wood, and pyrolysis conditions adopted. For
   instance levoglucosan was the main compound using carbon as MW absorber
   however acetic acid was prevalent when a MW absorber was not employed
   and both of them were absent in bio-oils from classical heating. The
   HPLC/MS of bio-oils showed cyclohexan-carboxylic acid,
   1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene and 2,6-dimethylphenol among the main products
   present in all bio-oils. On the contrary 4-hydroxyacetophenone and
   (3,4,5-trimethoxy) acetophenone were present in bio-oil from pyrolysis
   of wood using MW oven and 2,5-furandiylmethanol when a MW oven without
   any absorber was employed. Cyclohexanone was present in bio-oils
   obtained with a thermal heating or a MW oven without any absorber. (C)

Volume = {{138}},

Abstract = {{Past studies have shown that speakers spontaneously adjust their speech
   acoustics in response to their auditory feedback perturbed in real time.
   In the case of formant perturbation, the majority of studies have
   examined speaker's compensatory production using the English vowel
   /epsilon/ as in the word ``head.{''} Consistent behavioral observations
   have been reported, and there is lively discussion as to how the
   production system integrates auditory versus somatosensory feedback to
   control vowel production. However, different vowels have different oral
   sensation and proprioceptive information due to differences in the
   degree of lingual contact or jaw openness. This may in turn influence
   the ways in which speakers compensate for auditory feedback. The aim of
   the current study was to examine speakers' compensatory behavior with
   six English monophthongs. Specifically, the current study tested to see
   if ``closed vowels{''} would show less compensatory production than
   ``open vowels{''} because closed vowels' strong lingual sensation may
   richly specify production via somatosensory feedback. Results showed
   that, indeed, speakers exhibited less compensatory production with the
   closed vowels. Thus sensorimotor control of vowels is not fixed across
   all vowels; instead it exerts different influences across different
   vowels. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy is a surgical procedure
   intended to redistribute loads on the knee in patients with medial
   compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA). The surgery may affect moments in
   multiple planes during ambulation, with potential beneficial or
   detrimental effects on joint loads. The objective of this study was to
   investigate three-dimensional external knee moments before and after
   medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy during level walking and
   during stair ascent. Fourteen patients with varus alignment and
   osteoarthritis primarily affecting the medial compartment of the
   tibiofemoral joint were assessed. Three-dimensional motion analyses
   during level walking and stair ascent was evaluated using inverse
   dynamics before, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Mean changes at 12
   months suggested decreases in the peak knee adduction, flexion and
   internal rotation moments, with standardized response means ranging from
   0.15 to 2.54. These decreases were observed despite increases in speed.
   Changes in alignment were associated with changes in the adduction and
   internal rotation moments, but not the flexion moment. Both pre- and
   postoperatively, the peak knee adduction moment was significantly lower
   (p = 0.001) during stair ascent than during level walking, while the
   flexion and internal rotation moments were significantly higher (p <
   0.01). There were no changes in the knee moments on the non-surgical
   limb. Medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy is associated with
   sustained (12 months) changes in knee moments in all three planes of
   motion during ambulation, suggesting substantial alterations of the
   loads on the knee during ambulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   In this study, we use regional ground motion and site response
   evaluations to generate scenario shakemaps for Montreal. The impact of
   event location on expected ground motions and intensities was tested by
   considering the occurrence of a scenario (a given magnitude event) at
   various locations, where the scenarios are defined based on an analysis
   of the most likely future event locations. Variability in near surface
   geology plays an important role in earthquake ground shaking; we use
   microzonation information from Montreal to assess the expected site
   amplification effects. The results of this study may be used as input to

Abstract = {{Research on discrepancies between the actual self and ideal self has
   examined self-discrepancies in knowledge, skills and stature but
   age-based self-discrepancies have only recently received attention and
   so we studied this phenomenon in young adolescents. In three studies we
   identified a product-category contextual cue that apparently caused
   adolescents to respond to an existing age-based self-discrepancy.
   Specifically we found that when the contextual cue was advertising for
   an age-restricted product, adolescents conformed to dissimilar young
   adult advertising models and diverged from similar adolescent models.
   This indicated that the contextual cue caused them to respond to an
   age-based self-discrepancy and use a product associated with the ideal
   self rather than the actual self. Importantly, this response was
   stronger among adolescents that were more dissatisfied with their age.
   With advertising for an age-unrestricted product, adolescents conformed
   to adolescent advertising models and diverged from young adult models.
   Industry policies for age-restricted products assume that similarity
   drives influence and therefore mandate that advertising models be young
   adults rather than adolescents. Our findings suggest this assumption is
   invalid for age-restricted products. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer

   and financial costs are minimized. The incorporation of smartphone'
   technology in research has increased exponentially, with a focus on the
   development of innovative research-based applications. We have developed
   a smartphone application designed to address the needs of modern
   researchers in the management of their colonies. Lennie' introduces a
   new method for the management of small to medium-sized animal colonies.
   Lennie allows users wireless access to their colonies with the ability
   to create and edit from virtually anywhere. Lennie also offers the
   ability to manage colonies based on experiments by assigning animals
   based on priority. Experimental time-points are also recorded with
   integrated scheduling options using the calendar function. Lennie
   represents an alternative to current large-scale software options, as
   the application design is simple, and requires no training or manuals.
   As the technological landscape is constantly evolving, we must continue
   to find ways to improve upon current practices to ensure that research
   is completed with efficiency and efficacy. With this new method of
   animal management, researchers are able to spend less time record
   keeping and can focus their efforts on continued innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Bio-based rigid polyurethane (BRPU) foams were successfully produced
   using hydrolytically depolymerized Kraft lignin (DKL, with M-w similar
   to 1700 g/mole, aliphatic hydroxyl number: 365 mgKOH/g) as bio-polyols
   at high percentage of bio-contents i.e., 50 wt.\%. BRPU foams were
   prepared via two routes, i.e., replacing PPG400 or sucrose polyol
   directly with DKL, and oxypropylation of DKL. The reference and BRPU
   foams were characterized in terms of their physical, mechanical and
   thermal properties. All BRPU foams exhibit good compressive strengths as
   well as compression modulus, compared with reference foams. The
   compression moduli of the foams decrease in the following order: BRPU
   foam with oxypropylated-DKL (10986.0 kPa) > BRPU foam with 50 wt.\%
   sucrose polyol and 50 wt.\% DKL (5152.0 kPa) > sucrose polyol reference
   foam (2086.0 kPa) > BRPU foam with 50 wt.\% PPG400 and 50 wt.\% DKL
   (1016.0 kPa) > PPG400 reference foam (789.1 kPa). Thermal conductivity
   of BRPU foams varied between 0.029 and 0.038 W/m K, with the lowest
   being of foam from oxypropylated-DKL, making it suitable for utilization
   as an insulation material. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) coatings were grown on an aluminium
   alloy substrate using different processing parameters which enabled
   samples to be coated to different stages of the PEO process.
   Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear polarization
   resistance (LPR) techniques were employed to investigate the impedance
   properties of the resulting oxide coatings which will determine the
   corrosion performance of the coated alloy. Scanning electron microscopy
   was used to relate the morphology of the coatings with their corrosion
   performance. A direct relationship was found between the stage of the
   PEO process, which affects the microstructure of the coatings, and the
   corrosion performance. Coating thickness and phase composition did not
   have any measurable influence on coating corrosion performance. To some
   degree corrosion performance could be tailored by the processing
   parameters. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{ObjectivePost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is considered a
   multidimensional disorder, with distinct symptom clusters including
   re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, and most recently
   depersonalization/derealization. However, the extent of differing
   intrinsic network connectivity underlying these symptoms has not been
   fully investigated. We therefore investigated the degree of association
   between resting connectivity of the salience (SN), default mode (DMN),
   and central executive (CEN) networks and PTSD symptom severity.
   MethodUsing resting-state functional MRI data from PTSD participants
   (n=21), we conducted multivariate analyses to test whether connectivity
   of extracted independent components varied as a function of
   re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing, hyperarousal, and
   depersonalization/derealization.
   ResultsHyperarousal symptoms were associated with reduced connectivity
   of posterior insula/superior temporal gyrus within SN {[}peak Montreal
   Neurological Institute (MNI): -44, -8, 0, t=-4.2512, k=40].
   Depersonalization/derealization severity was associated with decreased
   connectivity of perigenual anterior cingulate/ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex within ventral anterior DMN (peak MNI: 8, 40, -4; t=-3.8501;
   k=15) and altered synchrony between two DMN components and between DMN
   and CEN.
   ConclusionOur results are consistent with prior research showing
   intrinsic network disruptions in PTSD and imply heterogeneous
   connectivity patterns underlying PTSD symptom dimensions. These findings
   suggest possible biomarkers for PTSD and its dissociative subtype.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of haptic feedback in minimally invasive surgical
   teleoperator systems may lead to improved performance in many common
   surgical procedures; however, most of the currently available surgical
   teleoperators do not provide force feedback, mainly because of the
   associated stability issues. In this paper, we study the effect of a
   special type of the force reflection algorithms, called projection-based
   force reflection (PBFR) algorithms, on the stability and performance of
   a dual-arm haptic-enabled teleoperator system for minimally invasive
   surgical applications. The performance of different algorithms is
   experimentally compared in the presence of negligible as well as
   nonnegligible communication delays. In particular, the teleoperator
   system's performance is experimentally evaluated in three common
   surgical tasks, which are knot tightening, pegboard transfer, and object
   manipulation. The results obtained indicate that, in almost all cases,
   the PBFR algorithms demonstrate statistically significant improvement of
   performance in comparison with the conventional direct force feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper presents the results of a new approach for
   selection of RF time series features based on joint independent
   component analysis for in vivo characterization of prostate cancer.
   Methods: We project three sets of RF time series features extracted from
   the spectrum, fractal dimension, and the wavelet transform of the
   ultrasound RF data on a space spanned by five joint independent
   components. Then, we demonstrate that the obtained mixing coefficients
   from a group of patients can be used to train a classifier, which can be
   applied to characterize cancerous regions of a test patient. Results: In
   a leave-one-patient-out cross validation, an area under receiver
   operating characteristic curve of 0.93 and classification accuracy of
   84\% are achieved. Conclusion: Ultrasound RF time series can be used to
   accurately characterize prostate cancer, in vivo without the need for
   exhaustive search in the feature space. Significance: We use joint
   independent component analysis for systematic fusion of multiple sets of
   RF time series features, within a machine learning framework, to
   characterize PCa in an in vivo study.}},

Abstract = {{Support vector ordinal regression (SVOR) is a popular method to tackle
   ordinal regression problems. However, until now there were no effective
   algorithms proposed to address incremental SVOR learning due to the
   complicated formulations of SVOR. Recently, an interesting accurate
   on-line algorithm was proposed for training nu-support vector
   classification (nu-SVC), which can handle a quadratic formulation with a
   pair of equality constraints. In this paper, we first present a modified
   SVOR formulation based on a sum-of-margins strategy. The formulation has
   multiple constraints, and each constraint includes a mixture of an
   equality and an inequality. Then, we extend the accurate on-line nu-SVC
   algorithm to the modified formulation, and propose an effective
   incremental SVOR algorithm. The algorithm can handle a quadratic
   formulation with multiple constraints, where each constraint is
   constituted of an equality and an inequality. More importantly, it
   tackles the conflicts between the equality and inequality constraints.
   We also provide the finite convergence analysis for the algorithm.
   Numerical experiments on the several benchmark and real-world data sets
   show that the incremental algorithm can converge to the optimal solution
   in a finite number of steps, and is faster than the existing batch and
   incremental SVOR algorithms. Meanwhile, the modified formulation has
   better accuracy than the existing incremental SVOR algorithm, and is as
   accurate as the sum-of-margins based formulation of Shashua and Levin.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTo present our experiences in initial clinical evaluation of a
   novel mechatronic system for in-bore guidance of needles to the prostate
   for MRI-guided prostate interventions in 10 patients. We report accuracy
   of this device in the context of focal laser ablation therapy for
   localized prostate cancer.
   MethodsAn MRI-compatible needle guidance device was developed for
   transperineal prostate interventions. Ten patients underwent MRI-guided
   focal laser ablation therapy with device-mediated laser fiber delivery.
   We recorded needle guidance error and needle delivery time.
   ResultsA total of 37 needle insertions were evaluated. Median needle
   guidance error was 3.5 mm (interquartile range, 2.1-5.4 mm), and median
   needle delivery time was 9 min (interquartile range, 6.5-12 min).
   ConclusionThis system provides a reliable method of accurately aligning
   needle guides for in-bore transperineal needle delivery to the prostate.

Abstract = {{The WG stream ciphers are based on the WG (Welch-Gong) transformation
   and possess proved randomness properties. In this paper we propose nine
   new hardware designs for the two classes of WG(29,11) and WG-16. For
   each class, we design and implement three versions of standard,
   pipelined and serial. For the first time, we use the polynomial basis
   (PB) representation to design and implement the WG(29,11) and WG-16. We
   consider traditional PB multiplier for the WG(29,11), and, the
   traditional and Karatsuba multipliers for the WG-16. For efficient field
   operations, we propose an irreducible trinomial for the WG(29,11). For
   the WG-16, a new formulation of its permutation which requires only 8
   multipliers is introduced. In these designs, the multipliers in the
   transforms are further reduced by utilizing a novel computation for the
   trace of the multiplication of two field elements. We have implemented
   the proposed designs in ASIC using CMOS 65 nm technology. The results
   show that the proposed standard WG(29,11) consumes less area and
   slightly enhances the normalized throughput, compared to the existing
   counterparts. For the WG-16, throughput of the proposed pipelined
   instance outperforms the previous designs. Moreover, the speed of the
   proposed WG-16 designs meet the peak bit rates for the 4 G
   specifications.}},

Title = {{Incremental learning for nu-Support Vector Regression}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{140-150}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The nu-Support Vector Regression (nu-SVR) is an effective regression
   learning algorithm, which has the advantage of using a parameter nu on
   controlling the number of support vectors and adjusting the width of the
   tube automatically. However, compared to nu-Support Vector
   Classification (nu-SVC) (Scholkopf et al., 2000), nu-SVR introduces an
   additional linear term into its objective function. Thus, directly
   applying the accurate on-line nu-SVC algorithm (AONSVM) to nu-SVR will
   not generate an effective initial solution. It is the main challenge to
   design an incremental nu-SVR learning algorithm. To overcome this
   challenge, we propose a special procedure called initial adjustments in
   this paper. This procedure adjusts the weights of nu-SVC based on the
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to prepare an initial solution for
   the incremental learning. Combining the initial adjustments with the two
   steps of AONSVM produces an exact and effective incremental nu-SVR
   learning algorithm (INSVR). Theoretical analysis has proven the
   existence of the three key inverse matrices, which are the cornerstones
   of the three steps of INSVR (including the initial adjustments),
   respectively. The experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
   INSVR can avoid the infeasible updating paths as far as possible, and
   successfully converges to the optimal solution. The results also show
   that INSVR is faster than batch nu-SVR algorithms with both cold and
   warm starts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Meandering bed development time: Formulation and related experimental
   testing}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{152-160}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper concerns the prediction of the bed development time of
   alluvial meandering streams. It is assumed that the stream centreline
   follows a sine-generated curve; the banks are rigid; the flow is
   turbulent and subcritical; and the width-to-depth ratio is ``large''.
   The bed is flat at the beginning of an ``experiment''. The bed
   development consists of the formation of large-scale, laterally adjacent
   pool-bar complexes strictly induced by the stream curvature. The paper
   is to be viewed as an extension of previous work by the writers, who
   have introduced an equation for the aforementioned bed development time,
   albeit with a proportionality factor that remains a not yet known
   function of the stream initial deflection angle. The objective of this
   paper is to reveal this function, and thus bring the equation for the
   bed development time into a form suitable for practical applications.
   This is achieved on the basis of a series of experiments carried out by
   the writers in three sine-generated meandering streams of varying
   sinuosity, as well as data from the literature. The paper concludes with
   examples of application of the resulting equation to real rivers. (C)

   constant of rutile nanoparticles has been found to be 57 at 10 MHz AC

   micrographs and XRD data analysis imply that the rutile crystallites are

   with load balancing in 5G HetNet}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{The explosive growth of mobile data traffic and the shortage of the
   available spectral resources have created new challenges for future
   cellular networks. In particular, resource management in heterogeneous
   network environment has become a critical issue. In this paper, we
   propose software-defined networking (SDN)-based resource management
   algorithms for future cellular network. Specifically, in this work, we
   have a threefold objective: i) alleviate spectrum shortage concerns by
   efficiently offloading traffic over the Wi-Fi network, ii) address
   network congestion by optimally balancing loads across multiple cells
   and iii) achieve the aforementioned objectives while taking network
   conditions and the end user quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into
   consideration. To this end, we present SDN-based partial data offloading
   and load balancing algorithms. The proposed algorithms exploit an SDN
   controller's global view of the network and take optimized resource
   allocation decisions. We analyze the performance of the proposed
   algorithms under realistic network model. Moreover, we also present an
   analytical framework to quantify the delay incurred due to the SDN-based
   data processing and forwarding. Our analysis and system-level
   simulations show that the proposed load balancing algorithm
   significantly improves the equilibrium extent and network stability as
   compared to the baseline algorithms. On the other hand, the proposed
   partial data offloading algorithm is shown to satisfy end user's
   quality-of-service while saving a significant amount of cellular
   resources.}},

   as lithium-air batteries. Using ambient air instead of pure oxygen as
   oxygen source is challenging because the minor components in air could
   lead to various side reactions and influence the electrochemical
   reaction route. Although water is an innegligible component in air, its
   impact on Li- and Na-air batteries is often underestimated. In this
   study, the electrochemical behavior of Na-air batteries under different
   relative humidity (RH) has been systemically investigated by galvanic
   cycling and cyclic voltammetry tests, as well as the identification of
   corresponding discharge products by physical characterizations such as
   XRD, FT-IR, and SEM. The reaction mechanisms of Na-air batteries under
   humid conditions are revealed and discussed. Na-air batteries suffer
   from more severe impact from the water content in air than Li-air
   batteries. NaOH and its derivatives are found to form and are proven to
   be fatal to the cells under humid ambience. Understanding the reaction
   mechanisms occurred in sodium air batteries under dry and humid ambient
   is critical to design and develop sodium-air batteries of high
   performance and long durability.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater disinfection processes are typically designed according to
   heuristics derived from batch experiments in which the interaction among
   wastewater quality, reactor hydraulics, and inactivation kinetics is
   often neglected. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
   study was conducted in a nondeterministic (ND) modeling framework to
   predict the Escherichia coli inactivation by peracetic acid (PAA) in
   municipal contact tanks fed by secondary settled wastewater effluent.
   The extent and variability associated with the observed inactivation
   kinetics were both satisfactorily predicted by the stochastic
   inactivation model at a 95\% confidence level. Moreover, it was found
   that (a) the process variability induced by reactor hydraulics is
   negligible when compared to the one caused by inactivation kinetics, (b)
   the PAA dose required for meeting regulations is dictated equally by the
   fixed limit of the microbial concentration as well as its probability of
   occurrence, and (c) neglecting the probability of occurrence during
   process sizing could lead to an underestimation of the PAA dose required
   by as much as 100\%. Finally, the ND-CFD model was used to generate
   sizing information in the form of probabilistic disinfection curves
   relating E. coli inactivation and probability of occurrence with the
   average PAA dose and PAA residual concentration at the outlet of the
   contact tank.}},

Title = {{Efficient removal of low-arsenic concentrations from drinking water by
   combined coagulation and adsorption processes}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{284-291}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Combined separation and purification processes are gaining considerable
   attention in the water engineering community as they have the potential
   to integrate several treatment stages in a single, space-efficient and
   multifunctional process able to act as a multi-barrier against a wide
   spectrum of recalcitrant pollutants. In this paper, the efficiency of a
   combined physico-chemical process, previously validated as a tertiary
   treatment for municipal wastewater reclamation and successfully tested
   at pilot scale for the removal of total phenols, chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) and Escherichia coli, was tested for the precipitation of
   low-arsenic (V) concentration (<100 mu g/L) from drinking water.
   The combined process, consisting of simultaneously dosing, in various
   proportions and according to a Latin square design-of-experiment scheme,
   aluminum polychloride (AP), zeolite (Z), powder activated carbon (PAC)
   and sodium hypochlorite (SH) into dechlorinated tap water spiked with
   arsenic (V), was assessed at laboratory scale in order to elucidate the
   mechanism of arsenic (V) removal as well as to identify the optimal
   mixing conditions using variable-speed jar-test experiments.
   Results indicated that the combined process was very effective in
   removing low arsenic (V) concentration from drinking water in the range
   of 25-100 mu g/L. Moreover, it was found that, among the tested
   variables, high-velocity gradient conditions led to an improved removal
   efficiency which reached 89\% under optimized process conditions.
   Although all treating agents played a statistically significant role in
   terms of process performance, arsenic (V) co-precipitation by AP was
   found to be the dominating removal mechanism contributing up to an 85\%
   at 1400 rpm, with Z and PAC co-operating for the remaining 5\% and
   mostly functioning as enhancing agents for ballasted settling. Notably,
   the process investigated in this study was also found to be robust
   against variation in initial arsenic concentration, showing similar
   arsenic (V) removal efficiency (85.9\%) when the initial arsenic (V)
   concentration was further reduced from 100 to 25 mu g/L. In conclusion,
   it was demonstrated that the combined treatment process was able to
   efficiently and simultaneously remove not only organic micropollutants
   such as phenols, COD and E. coli (as demonstrated in previous studies)
   but also inorganic contamination by arsenic (V) from a typical drinking
   water matrix via co-precipitation on aluminum polychloride, a treating
   agent that is worldwide accessible and typically used in water treatment
   applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transparent inorganic-polymer nanocomposite films are of tremendous
   current interest inemerging solar coverings including photovoltaic
   encapsulants and commercial greenhouse plastics, but suffer from
   significant radiative heat loss. This work provides a new and simple
   approach for controlling this heat loss by using mesoporous
   silica/quantum dot nanoparticles in poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)
   (EVA) films. Mesoporous silica shells were grown on CdS-ZnS quantum dot
   (QDs) cores using a reverse microemulsion technique, controlling the
   shell thickness. These mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were then
   melt-mixed with EVA pellets using a mini twin-screw extruder and pressed
   into thin films of concentration variable controlled thickness. The
   results demonstrate that the experimental MSNs showed improved infrared
   and thermal wavebands retention in the EVA transparent films compared to
   commercial silica additives, even at lower concentrations. It was also
   found MSNs enhanced the quantum yield and photostability of the QDs,
   providing high visible light transmission and blocking of UV
   transmission of interest for next generation solar coatings. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{This study presents the development and validation of a computational
   model which simulates the propagation of a smouldering front through a
   porous medium against unique experiments in coal tar and sand. The model
   couples a multiphase flow solver in porous media with a perimeter
   expansion module based on Huygens principle to predict the spread. A
   suite of two-dimensional experiments using coal tar-contaminated sand
   were conducted to explore the time-dependent vertical and lateral
   smouldering front propagation rates and final extent of remediation as a
   function of air injection rate. A thermal severity analysis revealed,
   for the first time, the temperature-time relationship indicative of coal
   tar combustion. The model, calibrated to the base case experiment, then
   correctly predicts the remaining experiments. This work provides further
   confidence in a model for predicting smouldering, which eventually is
   expected to be useful for designing soil remediation schemes for a novel
   technology based upon smouldering destruction of organic contaminants in
   soil. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with design of an adaptive output feedback tracking
   controller for a class of non-linear systems with unknown fixed control
   direction. By using neural networks and deriving adaptive rules based on
   the steepest descent algorithm, the authors present a stable output
   feedback control scheme, which is applicable to a wide class of unknown
   complicated non-linear systems. Therefore an approach based on the
   dynamic back propagation algorithm is proposed to develop the adaption
   laws for systems with more general model structure. Using Lyapunov's
   direct method, uniformly ultimately boundedness of all signals of the
   closed-loop system is also ensured. Moreover, it is shown that the
   bounds on the tracking errors depend on the designing parameters. Hence,
   an arbitrarily small tracking error can be achieved by adjusting the
   parameters properly. Finally, simulation results performed on a
   non-affine uncertain non-linear system having internal dynamics are
   given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the
   theoretical discussions.}},

Title = {{Using natural zeolite for contamination reduction of agricultural soil

Abstract = {{Nowadays, due to the global water crisis, reusing treated wastewater is
   being considered as water resources for different purposes, particularly
   for agricultural applications. Irrigating soil using urban wastewaters
   which are not treated properly, however, has negative effect on the soil
   and its subsequent drained water. Because of that, selective adsorption
   properties of the natural zeolite were used to improve filtering
   properties of the soil irrigated with wastewater. The effects of
   application method, dosage, and particle size of natural zeolite were
   studied on the EC, pH, BOD5, Na+, Ca2++Mg2+, and nitrate concentration
   of an urban wastewater by passing it through zeolite-added soil columns.
   The result shows that by adding zeolite to the soil column, the value of
   pH, EC, and Na+ of the column outlet were increased, while its
   Ca2++Mg2+, nitrate concentration, as well as the BOD5 were decreased.
   BOD5 level of the column effluent in the control, mixed, and layered
   treated soil with zeolite were lower than BOD5 of used fresh wastewater
   by 38.42, 54.98, and 71.84\%, respectively. However, the nitrate
   concentration of the column effluent in the control, mixed, and layered
   treated soil with zeolite were lower than the nitrate content of the
   fresh wastewater by 12.18, 32.19, and 54.90\%, respectively. It can be
   concluded that application of the natural zeolite into the soil in a
   layered treatment does more effectively reduce the pollutant transferred
   to the soil-depth and consequently can improve the quality of drainage
   water.}},

Title = {{Engineering 3D Cellularized Collagen Gels for Vascular Tissue
   Regeneration}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{100}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic materials are known to initiate clinical complications such as
   inflammation, stenosis, and infections when implanted as vascular
   substitutes. Collagen has been extensively used for a wide range of
   biomedical applications and is considered a valid alternative to
   synthetic materials due to its inherent biocompatibility (i.e., low
   antigenicity, inflammation, and cytotoxic responses). However, the
   limited mechanical properties and the related low hand-ability of
   collagen gels have hampered their use as scaffold materials for vascular
   tissue engineering. Therefore, the rationale behind this work was first
   to engineer cellularized collagen gels into a tubular-shaped geometry
   and second to enhance smooth muscle cells driven reorganization of
   collagen matrix to obtain tissues stiff enough to be handled.
   The strategy described here is based on the direct assembling of
   collagen and smooth muscle cells (construct) in a 3D cylindrical
   geometry with the use of a molding technique. This process requires a
   maturation period, during which the constructs are cultured in a
   bioreactor under static conditions (without applied external dynamic
   mechanical constraints) for 1 or 2 weeks. The ``static bioreactor{''}
   provides a monitored and controlled sterile environment (pH,
   temperature, gas exchange, nutrient supply and waste removal) to the
   constructs. During culture period, thickness measurements were performed
   to evaluate the cells-driven remodeling of the collagen matrix, and
   glucose consumption and lactate production rates were measured to
   monitor the cells metabolic activity. Finally, mechanical and
   viscoelastic properties were assessed for the resulting tubular
   constructs. To this end, specific protocols and a focused know-how
   (manipulation, gripping, working in hydrated environment, and so on)
   were developed to characterize the engineered tissues.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of CT for the detection of glenoid bone graft resorption

Abstract = {{Introduction: Glenoid bone grafting is often used in cases of reverse
   shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) with glenoid deficiency. Additionally, bony
   increased-offset RSA (BIO-RSA) uses a cylindrical bonegraft harvested
   from the humeral head and is positioned beneath the glenoid baseplate to
   increase lateralization. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) has been
   used to detect glenoid bonegraft resorption, which is-typically
   identified by a gap between the bonegraft and baseplate; however, CT
   images are often degradedby implant metal artifact. The purpose of this
   CT imaging study was to determine if a simulated bonegraft resorption
   gap is detectable following RSA with glenoid bone grafting.
   Hypothesis: CT is unable to detect bone graft resorption following
   reverse shoulder arthroplasty conducted with bone grafting beneath the
   glenoid baseplate.
   Materials and methods: RSA with glenoid bone grafting was performed on
   four cadaver shoulders. Glenoid bonegraft resorption gaps were simulated
   by fixing the implant at six different gap widths (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8
   mm). Clinical CT scans were acquired for each gap resulting in 6 scans
   per specimen. Two experienced observers (blinded) analyzed DICOM images
   in the axial and coronal directions, and measured gap widths using
   Mimics (R) software. Each observer had access to approximately 200
   images per condition per specimen.
   Results: The sensitivity of CT imaging to positively identify bonegraft
   resorption was 38\%, with an accuracy of 46\%. Inter-observer agreement
   was 92\%. Observers tended to visualize no-gap for most conditions.
   Resorption gap width measurements were consistently underestimated.
   Discussion: Metal artifact prevented identification of simulated
   bonegraft resorption gaps and observers most often determined that there
   was bonegraft-to-implant ``healing{''} on CT, when in fact a gap was
   clinically present. This study illustrates the need for more effective
   imaging techniques to determine if bonegraft resorption has occurred
   following RSA. Level of evidence: Level IV. Basic Science; Cadaveric

Abstract = {{Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections represent an emerging health
   concern in clinical settings, and a lack of novel developments in the
   pharmaceutical pipeline is creating a ``perfect storm{''} for
   multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)
   have been suggested as future therapeutics for these drug-resistant
   bacteria, since they have potent broad-spectrum activity, with little
   development of resistance. Due to the unique structure of the lung,
   bacterial pneumonia has the additional problem of delivering
   antimicrobials to the site of infection. One potential solution is
   coadministration of AMPs with exogenous surfactant, allowing for
   distribution of the peptides to distal airways and opening of collapsed
   lung regions. The objective of this study was to test various
   surfactant-AMP mixtures with regard to maintaining pulmonary surfactant
   biophysical properties and bactericidal functions. We compared the
   properties of four AMPs (CATH-1, CATH-2, CRAMP, and LL-37) suspended in
   bovine lipid-extract surfactant (BLES) by assessing surfactant-AMP
   mixture biophysical and antimicrobial functions. Antimicrobial activity
   was tested against methillicin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All AMP/surfactant mixtures exhibited an
   increase of spreading compared to a BLES control. BLES+CATH-2 mixtures
   had no significantly different minimum surface tension versus the BLES
   control. Compared to the other cathelicidins, CATH-2 retained the most
   bactericidal activity in the presence of BLES. The BLES+CATH-2 mixture
   appears to be an optimal surfactant-AMP mixture based on in vitro
   assays. Future directions involve investigating the potential of this
   mixture in animal models of bacterial pneumonia.}},

Abstract = {{BRAHMA (BRM), a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPase, is essential for
   the transcriptional reprogramming associated with development and cell
   differentiation in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we show that
   loss-of-function mutations in BRM led to defective maintenance of the
   root stem cell niche, decreased meristematic activity, and stunted root
   growth. Mutations of BRM affected auxin distribution by reducing local
   expression of several PIN-FORMED (PIN) genes in the stem cells and
   impaired the expression of the stem cell transcription factor genes
   PLETHORA (PLT1) and PLT2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed
   that BRM could directly target to the chromatin of PIN1, PIN2, PIN3,
   PIN4, and PIN7. In addition, genetic interaction assays indicate that
   PLTs acted downstream of BRM, and overexpression of PLT2 partially
   rescued the stem cell niche defect of brm mutants. Taken together, these
   results support the idea that BRM acts in the PLT pathway to maintain
   the root stem cell niche by altering the expression of PINs.}},

Title = {{Assessing the carcinogenic potential of low-dose exposures to chemical

Abstract = {{Low-dose exposures to common environmental chemicals that are deemed
   safe individually may be combining to instigate carcinogenesis, thereby
   contributing to the incidence of cancer. This risk may be overlooked by
   current regulatory practices and needs to be vigorously
   investigated.Lifestyle factors are responsible for a considerable
   portion of cancer incidence worldwide, but credible estimates from the
   World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research on
   Cancer (IARC) suggest that the fraction of cancers attributable to toxic
   environmental exposures is between 7\% and 19\%. To explore the
   hypothesis that low-dose exposures to mixtures of chemicals in the
   environment may be combining to contribute to environmental
   carcinogenesis, we reviewed 11 hallmark phenotypes of cancer, multiple
   priority target sites for disruption in each area and prototypical
   chemical disruptors for all targets, this included dose-response
   characterizations, evidence of low-dose effects and cross-hallmark
   effects for all targets and chemicals. In total, 85 examples of
   chemicals were reviewed for actions on key pathways/mechanisms related
   to carcinogenesis. Only 15\% (13/85) were found to have evidence of a
   dose-response threshold, whereas 59\% (50/85) exerted low-dose effects.
   No dose-response information was found for the remaining 26\% (22/85).
   Our analysis suggests that the cumulative effects of individual
   (non-carcinogenic) chemicals acting on different pathways, and a variety
   of related systems, organs, tissues and cells could plausibly conspire
   to produce carcinogenic synergies. Additional basic research on
   carcinogenesis and research focused on low-dose effects of chemical
   mixtures needs to be rigorously pursued before the merits of this
   hypothesis can be further advanced. However, the structure of the World
   Health Organization International Programme on Chemical Safety `Mode of
   Action' framework should be revisited as it has inherent weaknesses that
   are not fully aligned with our current understanding of cancer biology.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic nanohole arrays (NHAs) with a high hole density have emerged
   with potential applications for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
   (SERS) including the detection of analytes at ultralow concentrations.
   However, these NHA structures generally yield weak localized surface
   plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is a prerequisite for SERS measurements.
   In this work, a compact three-dimensional (3D) tunable plasmonic cavity
   with extraordinary optical transmission properties serves as a molecular
   sensor with sub-femtomolar detection. The 3D nanosensor consists of a
   gold film containing an NHA with an underlying cavity and a gold
   nanocone array at the bottom of the cavity. These nanosensors provide
   remarkable surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and LSPR coupling, resulting
   in a significantly improved detection performance. The plasmonic
   tunability is evaluated both experimentally and theoretically. A SEAS
   limit of detection of 10(-16) M for 4-nitrothiophenol is obtained along
   with distribution mapping of the molecule on the 3D plasmonic
   nanosensor. This results in an improved SERS enhancement factor of 10(7)
   obtained from a femtoliter plasmonic cavity volume. The tunability of
   these sensors can give rise to a potential opportunity for use in
   optical trapping while providing SERS sensing of a molecule of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive small cell networks have been envisioned as a promising
   technique for meeting the exponentially increasing mobile traffic
   demand. Recently, many technological issues pertaining to cognitive
   small cell networks have been studied, including resource allocation and
   interference mitigation, but most studies assume non-cooperative schemes
   or perfect channel state information (CSI). Different from the existing
   works, we investigate the joint uplink subchannel and power allocation
   problem in cognitive small cells using cooperative Nash bargaining game
   theory, where the cross-tier interference mitigation, minimum outage
   probability requirement, imperfect CSI and fairness in terms of minimum
   rate requirement are considered. A unified analytical framework is
   proposed for the optimization problem, where the near optimal
   cooperative bargaining resource allocation strategy is derived based on
   Lagrangian dual decomposition by introducing time-sharing variables and
   recalling the Lambert-W function. The existence, uniqueness, and
   fairness of the solution to this game model are proved. A cooperative
   Nash bargaining resource allocation algorithm is developed, and is shown
   to converge to a Pareto-optimal equilibrium for the cooperative game.
   Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed cooperative game algorithm for efficient and fair resource
   allocation in cognitive small cell networks.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared the occurrence of Escherichia colt and the
   human-associated Bacteroidales marker (HF183) across the beach
   sand-water interface at two distinctively different beaches on Lake
   Ontario. E. coli concentrations were measured in both water and
   sand/sediment samples by culture methods and E. coli and HF183
   concentrations were measured by qPCR methods. Both beaches had the same
   general profile of culturable E. coli concentrations across the beach
   sand-water interface, with the highest concentrations associated with
   foreshore sand and with concentrations diminishing with depth offshore.
   E. coli concentrations were also highest at both beaches in foreshore
   unsaturated sands relative to upshore sand and sediment samples at
   ankle- or knee-depth. E. coli concentrations were below our qPCR limit
   of detection for 90\% of all water samples, rendering this particular E.
   coli qPCR protocol ineffective for monitoring these relatively clean
   beaches. The general profile of the HF183 marker across the beach
   sand-water interface was different from E. coli at both beaches. The
   frequency of occurrence and concentrations of HF183 did not exhibit the
   same gradient as E. coli with diminishing concentrations offshore.
   Instead, HF183 concentrations were similar across pore, ankle and chest
   water at Marie Curtis Beach, while they were significantly lower in
   foreshore pore water at Burlington Beach. It is possible that
   differential occurrence of culturable E coli and the HF183 marker across
   the beach sand-water interface may lead to different indications of
   health risks associated with sand and water exposure at beaches. 2015

Abstract = {{Here, the generalized inversion of S-wave amplitude spectra is employed
   for deriving the site response and S-wave attenuation (quality factor)
   in the northwest region of Iran. A total of 279 strong-motion
   accelerograms recorded at distances below 200 km from 41 earthquakes
   with moment magnitudes ranging from M-w 3.8 to 6.5 are used to determine
   the region-specific attenuation model. The site responses have been
   determined for all 54 stations individually. The bulk of strong-motion
   data (i.e., 184 records) comes from the 2012 Ahar-Varzaghan dual
   earthquakes in northwest Iran and their aftershocks. Also, the modified
   finite-fault method, which is able to model non-uniform stress
   distribution on the fault plane, is employed to investigate the
   coseismic stress parameter for the first and second Ahar-Varzaghan dual
   earthquakes by minimizing the difference between the synthesized and
   observed pseudospectral accelerations for 5\% damping. Results denote a
   concentration of stress drops on the northwestern part of the first
   event's fault and on the central and eastern part of the second fault.
   Stochastic simulations, using the calibrated stress distribution have
   been performed on a regular grid covering the study area for both rock-
   and soil-site conditions (in total, 651 points). The results show that
   the maximum of peak ground accelerations (PGAs) during the
   Ahar-Varzaghan dual earthquakes for the rock-site condition reached 557
   cm/s/s, and the largest peak ground velocities (PGVs) were estimated
   around 76 cm/s. In general, comparisons between simulated data and
   empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) show that the
   stochastic predictions (PGAs and PGVs) are higher than those predicted
   by the empirical GMPEs for distances less than 30 km and are smaller for
   distances more than 30 km. The simulated data are also consistent with
   the modified Mercalli intensity observations and show reasonable
   agreement. This can be considered as another validation of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Several neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with
   social processing deficits. The objective of this study was to compare
   patterns of social perception abilities across obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), and control participants.
   Method: A total of 265 children completed the Reading the Mind in the
   Eyes Test Child Version (RMET). Parents or caregivers completed
   established trait/symptom scales. The predicted percentage of accuracy
   on the RMET was compared across disorders and by item difficulty and
   item valence (i.e., positive/negative/neutral mental states), then
   analyzed for associations with trait/symptom scores.
   Results: The percentage of correct RMET scores varied significantly
   between diagnostic groups (p <.0001). On pairwise group comparisons
   controlling for age and sex, children with ADHD and ASD scored lower
   than the other groups (p <.0001). When IQ was also controlled for in the
   model, participants with OCD performed better than controls (p <.001),
   although differences between other groups were less pronounced.
   Participants with ASD scored lowest on easy items. Those with ASD and
   ADHD scored significantly lower than other groups on items with positive
   valence (p <.01). Greater social communication impairment and
   hyperactivity/impulsivity, but not OCD traits/symptoms, were associated
   with lower scores on the RMET, irrespective of diagnosis.
   Conclusion: Social perception abilities in neurodevelopmental disorders
   exist along a continuum. Children with ASD have the greatest deficits,
   whereas children with OCD may be hypersensitive to social information.
   Social communication deficits and hyperactive/impulsive traits are
   associated with impaired social perception abilities; these findings
   highlight overlapping cognitive and behavioral manifestations across
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Triaxial tests are often used to determine the behavior and strength
   characteristics of soils without due attention to the differences in
   specimen size. Several drained and undrained monotonic triaxial
   compression shear tests are performed in this study on three different
   specimen sizes of the same sand to investigate the influence of specimen
   size and scale effect on sand compression and shear behavior. The
   behavior of a sand specimen is strongly influenced by shear banding and
   specimen boundary conditions, which are manifested as specimen size
   effects in the test results of this study. The measured sand
   compressibility and shear strength parameters are employed to describe
   scale effects, and investigate specimen size effects in liquefaction
   triggering analysis. The results show that while larger specimens
   exhibit a less compressible behavior during isotropic compression,
   larger shear strengths and effective friction angles are mobilized in
   the smaller specimens during shearing. A number of geotechnical analyses
   can be significantly affected by variations in strength parameters of
   the same soil determined from different specimen sizes. While using
   small size specimens for determining shear strength parameters might
   result in an unconservative design, a large specimen size provides a
   more accurate representation of different soil strength conditions and

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Turbulent coherent structures generated in a channel flow at low
   Reynolds numbers during mixed convection have been experimentally
   studied using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The
   measurements are conducted in the channel cross-plane, the streamwise
   mid-vertical plane and two horizontal planes close to the bottom heated
   wall to capture the three-dimensional aspect. In the present study,
   Gr/Re-2 ranged between 9 and 206, implying that the natural convection
   was dominant over forced convection. An algorithm based on the velocity
   tensor second invariant (Q) is used to detect coherent structures. The
   location of each detected coherent structure is recorded, and vorticity
   and kinetic energy associated with each coherent structure are computed.
   The number and strength of the coherent structures are found to increase
   with an increase in the bottom wall temperature in all measurement
   planes. The strength and number of coherent structures show partial
   dependency on the flow rate. The number of coherent structures is found
   to be largest in the channel's lower half, where strong interactions
   between rising plumes, falling sheets and mean shear flow occur.
   However, on average, the most energetic coherent structures are present
   in the channel's upper region.}},

Abstract = {{Epidural and spinal anesthesia are common procedures that require a
   needle to be inserted into the patient's spine to deliver an anesthetic.
   Traditionally, these procedures were performed without image guidance,
   using only palpation to identify the correct vertebral interspace. More
   recently, ultrasound has seen widespread use in guiding spinal needle
   interventions. Dural pulsation is a valuable cue for finding a path
   through the vertebral interspace and for determining needle insertion
   depth. However, dural pulsation is challenging to detect and not
   perceptible in many cases. Here, a method for automatically detecting
   very subtle dural pulsation from live ultrasound video is presented.
   A periodic model is fit to the B-mode intenstity values through extended
   Kalman filtering. The fitted frequencies and amplitudes are used to
   detect and visualize dural pulsation. The method is validated
   retrospectively on synthetic and human video and used in real time on an
   interventional spinal phantom.
   This method was capable of quickly identifying subtle dural pulsation
   and was robust to background noise and motion. The pulsation
   visualization reduced both the normalized path length and number of
   attempts required in a mock epidural procedure.
   This technique is able to localize the dura and help find a clear needle
   trajectory to the epidural space. It can be run in real time on
   commercial ultrasound systems and has the potential to improve
   ultrasound guidance of spine needle interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Gingival connective tissue often has a composition resembling that of
   scar surrounding dental implant abutments. Increased cell adhesion,
   -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) expression and increased extracellular
   matrix deposition are a hallmark of fibrotic cells, but how topographic
   features influence gingival fibroblast adhesion and adoption of the -SMA
   positive myofibroblast phenotype associated with scarring is unknown.
   The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate whether implant
   topographies that limit adhesion formation would reduce myofibroblast
   differentiation and extracellular matrix deposition. Human gingival
   fibroblasts were cultured on PT (smooth) and SLA (roughened) titanium
   discs for varying time-points. At 1 and 2weeks after seeding,
   incorporation of -SMA into stress-fibre bundles and fibronectin
   deposition was significantly higher on PT than SLA surfaces indicating
   differentiation of the cells towards a myofibroblast phenotype. Analysis
   of adhesion formation demonstrated that cells formed larger adhesions
   and more stable adhesions on PT, with more nascent adhesions observed on
   SLA. Gene expression analysis identified up-regulation of 15 genes at
   24hrs on SLA versus PT associated with matrix remodelling.
   Pharmacological inhibition of Src/FAK signalling in gingival fibroblasts
   on PT reduced fibronectin deposition and CCN2 expression. We conclude
   that topographical features that reduce focal adhesion stability could
   be applied to inhibit myofibroblast differentiation in gingival
   fibroblasts.}},

Abstract = {{There have been significant improvements in ice hockey equipment
   technology within the last decade; however, little is known about how
   these improvements are affecting puck mechanics. The purpose of this
   study was to develop a testing protocol using three-dimensional motion
   capture to improve ice hockey shot analysis by providing additional
   information to traditional shot analysis techniques. Then, the
   feasibility of this protocol was tested by performing a pilot study that
   analyzes the effects of a new grip tape on slap shot performance. Four
   elite hockey players performed four slap shots in each of the four
   conditions: (1) bare hockey stick/normal hockey gloves, (2) traditional
   hockey tape stick/normal gloves, (3) Greptile tape stick/normal gloves
   and (4) Greptile tape stick/Greptile gloves. Reflective markers attached
   to the puck, stick and target were tracked by a three-dimensional
   optical motion capture system recording at 200Hz. Linear and angular
   velocities of the puck, accuracy and puck topple were not different
   between condition 1 and the remaining three grip conditions; however,
   there were accuracy differences between conditions 1 and 3. In addition,
   there were no correlations between angular velocity and shot accuracy,
   and puck topple and shot accuracy. Due to the small sample size, the
   effects of Greptile tape on slap shot performance must be further tested
   in order to compare the four conditions with more advanced statistics;
   however, the developed research strategy, using three-dimensional motion
   analysis, provides an approach to researchers and companies that are
   interested in identifying the effects of new hockey
   equipment/technologies on slap shot performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of single mode microwave irradiation
   on the synthesis of zeolite Na-A from sodium aluminate and sodium
   silicate gel at atmospheric pressure. Microwave irradiation has been
   shown to accelerate the zeolitization process from several hours to
   several minutes. The microwave irradiation employed was produced in a
   single mode lab scale microwave, which enabled control of irradiated
   power and temperature of the reaction mixture, while the pressure was
   controlled by affixing a condenser to a Teflon reactor vessel with a
   working volume of 20mL. Two sets of experiments were conducted, the
   first with three levels of temperature and reaction time, and the second
   with three levels of power and reaction time. The characteristics and
   physical properties of the synthesized samples were analyzed with
   different instrumental techniques including XRD, Rietveld refinement,
   SEM, BET, TGA, and by determination of cation exchange capacity (CEC).
   It was observed that the crystallinity of the product was influenced by
   both power and time of microwave irradiation; moreover power and time of
   microwave irradiation influenced the phase selection between Na-A and
   Na-X. Single phase zeolite Na-A was achieved with a crystallinity of
   80\% at 300 W using single mode microwave irradiation at atmospheric
   pressure after 30min of exposure to radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Weather generators are increasingly becoming viable alternate models to
   assess the effects of future climate change scenarios on water resources
   systems. In this study, a new multisite, multivariate maximum entropy
   bootstrap weather generator (MEBWG) is proposed for generating daily
   weather variables, which has the ability to mimic both, spatial and
   temporal dependence structure in addition to other historical
   statistics. The maximum entropy bootstrap (MEB) involves two main steps:
   (1) random sampling from the empirical cumulative distribution function
   with endpoints selected to allow limited extrapolation and (2)
   reordering of the random series to respect the rank ordering of the
   original time series (temporal dependence structure). To capture the
   multi-collinear structure between the weather variables and between the
   sites, we combine orthogonal linear transformation with MEB. Daily
   weather data, which include precipitation, maximum temperature and
   minimum temperature from 27 years of record from the Upper Thames River
   Basin in Ontario, Canada, are used to analyze the ability of MEBWG based
   weather generator. Results indicate that the statistics from the
   synthetic replicates were not significantly different from the observed
   data and the model is able to preserve the 27 CLIMDEX indices very well.
   The MEBWG model shows better performance in terms of extrapolation and
   computational efficiency when compared to multisite, multivariate
   K-nearest neighbour model.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Flexoelectricity, referring to a spontaneous electric polarization in
   response to non-uniform strains (or strain gradients), is a universal
   electromechanical coupling in all dielectrics. In this work, the
   influence of the flexoelectricity on the electroelastic fields of a
   hollow piezoelectric nanocylinder under applied mechanical and
   electrical loads is investigated. Meanwhile, the associated pure
   non-local elastic effect in response to the strain gradients is also
   incorporated. The governing equations and the associated boundary
   conditions for the cylinder are derived from the variational principle.
   The analytical/approximate solutions of the problem with the
   consideration of diverse flexocoupling effects are obtained,
   respectively. It is found from the simulation results that the
   flexoelectricity has a momentous influence on the electroelastic fields
   of the cylinder. The influence of the flexoelectricity upon the
   size-dependent electromechanical coupling properties of the
   piezoelectric nanocylinder is also investigated and it is found that the
   size effects are more manifest for nanocylinders with smaller size. It
   is expected that the current work could provide increased understanding

Abstract = {{High-performance and fast implementation of point multiplication is
   crucial for elliptic curve cryptographic systems. Recently, considerable
   research has investigated the implementation of point multiplication on
   different curves over binary extension fields. In this paper, we propose
   efficient and high speed architectures to implement point multiplication
   on binary Edwards and generalized Hessian curves. We perform a data-flow
   analysis and investigate maximum number of parallel multipliers to be
   employed to reduce the latency of point multiplication on these curves.
   Then, we modify the addition and doubling formulations and employ a
   newly proposed digit-level hybrid-double Gaussian normal basis
   multiplier to remove the data dependencies and hence reduce the latency
   of point multiplication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   time that one employs hybrid-double multiplication technique to reduce
   the computation time of point multiplication. Moreover, we have
   implemented our proposed architectures for point multiplication on FPGA
   and obtained the results of timing and area. Our results indicate that
   the proposed scheme is one step forward to improve the performance of
   point multiplication on binary Edward and generalized Hessian curves.}},

Abstract = {{An electrochemical system was developed to successively apply
   electrochemical oxidation (EO) and electrochemical adsorption (EA)
   treatments. This coupled EO-EA treatment system was used for remediating
   steepwater effluent samples obtained from a commercial corn wet milling
   plant. The effects of system operating parameters such as pH, supporting
   electrolyte, current density, treatment duration, repeating EO-EA cycle
   etc. were investigated based on the amount of chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) removed. The effluent was also characterized for 5-day biological
   oxygen demand (BOD5), reduced sugars (as dextrose), lactic acid,
   protein, and phosphorus at different stages during electrochemical
   remediation. The initial EO treatment improved the system effectiveness
   during the subsequent EA treatment by enhancing the oxidation process,
   partially decomposing and creating new functional groups on the
   pollutants. This increased the affinity of the pollutant adsorbates with
   activated carbon particles filled within the EA cell, which served as
   both bipolar microelectrodes and enhanced adsorbents. By operating at pH
   12, using NaCl as supporting electrolyte, the COD was reduced by 93.5\%
   after 4 h of EO followed by 16 h EA. Repeating the EO-EA treatment (4 h
   of EO followed by 4 h of EA) further reduced the total COD by 99.2\%,
   though with higher energy consumption. However, the total energy
   consumption for our process is much lower than that for other
   electrochemical treatments reported. The results show that our coupled
   EO-EA treatment process is very effective for remediating highly
   recalcitrant effluents such as corn wet milling steepwater. Furthermore,
   the treated water is very clear and is suitable for industrial reuse.

Abstract = {{The estimation of annual maximum snow load is important for designing
   light-weight structures experiencing severe winter climate. The
   specified (basic) snow load in the Chinese design code is based on
   statistics of the return period values of ground snow load. The code
   tabulates the values for a few locations in a region. For example,
   values are only available at 31 sites for Heilongjiang Province with an
   area of more than 470,000 km(2), China. The snow load needs to be
   spatially interpolated for sites far away from the tabulated locations.
   However, the statistical justification of the selected probability
   distribution to model snow depth or load hazard is unclear and the
   preferred spatial interpolation technique is unknown. This study focuses
   on the extreme value analysis and spatial interpolation of the annual
   maximum snow depth and ground snow load using the records at 83 stations
   in Heilongjiang Province from 1981 to 2010. The statistical analysis
   results show that the use of the lognormal distribution rather than the
   Gumbel distribution for the annual maximum snow depth suggested in the
   code is preferred for most sites, and the application of the ordinary
   co-kriging is adequate for spatial interpolation of extreme snow depth.
   The results also show that the uncertainty in snowpack bulk density
   should not be neglected in estimating the extreme (ground) snow load for
   updating the snow load in Chinese design code.}},

   gasification of biomass: Effect of catalyst preparation conditions}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{250-265}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study reports a new fluidizable La2O3 promoted Ni/gamma-Al2O3
   catalyst for biomass steam gasification. Catalysts are prepared using a
   specially designed incipient wetness multi-step impregnation technique
   with subsequent reduction of metal precursors in a fluidized bed.
   Catalyst characterization shows that addition of La2O3 up to 5 wt\%
   improves surface area, CO2 adsorption capacity, Ni reducibility and
   metal dispersion, as well as reduces support acidity. XRD shows
   undesirable LaAlO3 formation when catalysts with more than 10 wt\% La2O3
   are calcined above 1000 degrees C. This result points toward the
   increase of local catalyst bed temperature during exothermic reduction
   of metal nitrates. Higher reduction gas flow rates can control the rise
   of catalyst bed temperature by effectively removing the generated heat.
   This controlled reduction helps to minimize sintering/dehydroxylation of
   the metastable gamma-Al2O3, with octahedral and tetrahedral site ratio
   being used as an indicator of gamma-Al2O3 dehydroxylation. The
   octahedral and tetrahedral site ratios are estimated using H-2 TPR and
   NH3-TPD. Steam gasification experiments are performed in a CREC Riser
   Simulator under expected conditions of circulating fluidized bed
   gasifiers using glucose and 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol to represent
   cellulose and lignin, respectively. Gasification performance of the
   prepared catalyst is found to be a function of Ni dispersion and support
   basicity/acidity ratio. It is hypothesized that acid sites of
   gamma-Al2O3 are responsible for coke deposition via hydrocarbon
   cracking, whereas basic sites facilitate coke reforming. Based on these
   data, a 20\% Ni/5\% La2O3-gamma Al2O3 is developed, in this study,
   optimizing catalyst formulation and preparation conditions. This
   catalyst yields a 97\% carbon conversion of glucose to permanent gases
   with no tar formation at 650 degrees C. In the case of
   2-methoxy-4-methylphenol gasification, a 85.5\% carbon conversion with
   only 8.3\% tar formation is achieved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58-59}},
Pages = {{271-284}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with window design issues for modified S-transform
   (MST) to improve the performance of time-frequency analysis (TFA). After
   analyzing the drawbacks of existing window functions, a window design
   technique is proposed. The technique uses a sigmoid function to control
   the window width in frequency domain. By proper selection of certain
   tuning parameters of a sigmoid function, windows with different width
   profiles can be obtained for multi-component signals. It is also
   interesting to note that the MST algorithm can be considered as a
   special case of a generalized method that adds a tunable shaping
   function to the standard window in frequency domain to meet specific
   frequency localization needs. The proposed design technique has been
   validated on a physical vibration test system using signals with
   different characteristics. The results have demonstrated that the
   proposed MST algorithm has superior time-frequency localization
   capabilities over standard ST, as well as other classical TFA methods.
   Subsequently, the proposed MST algorithm is applied to vibration
   monitoring of pipes in a water supply process controlled by a diaphragm
   pump for fault detection purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The functional interaction between the brain's two hemispheres includes
   a unique set of connections between corresponding regions in opposite
   hemispheres (i.e., homotopic regions) that are consistently reported to
   be exceptionally strong compared with other interhemispheric (i.e.,
   heterotopic) connections. The strength of homotopic functional
   connectivity (FC) is thought to be mediated by the regions' shared
   functional roles and their structural connectivity. Recently, homotopic
   FC was reported to be stable over time despite the presence of dynamic
   FC across both intra-hemispheric and heterotopic connections. Here we
   build on this work by considering whether homotopic FC is also stable
   across conditions. We additionally test the hypothesis that strong and
   stable homotopic FC is supported by the underlying structural
   connectivity. Consistent with previous findings, interhemispheric FC
   between homotopic regions were significantly stronger in both humans and
   macaques. Across conditions, homotopic FC was most resistant to change
   and therefore was more stable than heterotopic or intrahemispheric
   connections. Across time, homotopic FC had significantly greater
   temporal stability than other types of connections. Temporal stability
   of homotopic FC was facilitated by direct anatomical projections.
   Importantly, temporal stability varied with the change in conductive
   properties of callosal axons along the anterior-posterior axis. Taken
   together, these findings suggest a notable role for the corpus callosum
   in maintaining stable functional communication between hemispheres.}},
