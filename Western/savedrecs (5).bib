Abstract = {{In this paper, adaptive compensation of the hysteresis in a
   Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid based actuators and its application for
   sensor-less high fidelity force/torque control is investigated. The MR
   actuator considered in this paper was originally described in {[}1] and
   {[}2]. This actuator offers high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia
   ratios. Yet, as an essential component of MR actuators, the magnetic
   circuit of the actuator shows hysteresis between its input
   current/voltage and output magnetic field. The hysteresis in the
   magnetic circuit results in a similar relationship between the input
   current and the output torque of the MR actuator. The control scheme
   used with actuators possessing hysteresis often requires compensating
   for the hysteresis. To this end, we propose an adaptive control method
   based on feedback linearization that estimates both hysteresis and
   uncertain parameters of the magnetic circuit. A set of experiments is
   performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{A novel non-linear chirp spread spectrum modulation (CSSM) is introduced
   for binary data transmission in a multi-user (MU) environment. Two
   subclasses of non-linear signals namely quadratic (Q-CSSM) and
   exponential (E-CSSM) modulations are described and their properties are
   given. The chirp rates in these modulations are varied as a function of
   user in an MU environment using the orthogonal structure inherent in
   non-linear chirp signals. A generic MU communication system model that
   employs non-linear chirp signals is presented and its bit error rate
   (BER) performance is analyzed in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
   channel, and Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading environments as a function
   of the number of users in the system, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and
   multiple access interference (MAI). An investigation of the trade off
   between bandwidth and the number of users in the system is provided for
   both Q- and E-CSSM. Numerical results demonstrate that these proposed
   modulations with proper chirp rate assignment are very effective in
   reducing MAI.}},

Abstract = {{A Decision Aided Receiver (DAR) for coherent detection of Continuous
   Phase Chirp Keying (CPCK) in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is
   presented. The structure of DAR is generic and applies to arbitrary
   Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM). The receiver complexity is a linear
   function of number of observed symbol intervals and uses repeated
   processing of received waveform at the receiver. Performance analysis of
   DAR is presented and easy-to-compute closed-form analytical expressions
   for Bit Error Rate (BER) have been obtained for CPCK. The DAR is
   attractive by virtue of its superior error performance and
   low-complexity relative to the Average Matched Filter (AMF) receiver for
   CPCK, especially for a wide range of CPCK modulation parameters and
   decision observation lengths. For example, it is shown that 2-bit DAR
   can outperform 2-bit AMF receiver for CPCK with modulation parameters

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that a significant drag reduction for pressure driven
   flows can be realized by creating separation bubbles through application
   of spatially distributed heating. These bubbles, whichare driven by the
   buoyancy force, reduce the direct contact between the main stream and
   the bounding walls resulting in the reduction of frictional drag. In
   addition, the movement in the interior of the bubbles driven by the
   gradients of the buoyancy force results in the creation of a propulsion
   force, which further reduces the pressure gradient required to drive the
   specified mass flux through the channel. The global effect, the
   Super-ThermoHydrophobic effect, is limited to small Reynolds numbers and
   thus is of potential interest to flows in micro-channels.}},

Abstract = {{Writer's cramp, a task specific dystonia is felt to be a disorder of
   sensorimotor integration involving the basal ganglia and cortex.
   Motivated by this fact, in the present study we investigated the effects
   of haptic and visual sensory inputs on cramp severity and frequency
   during a trial. For this goal seven subjects with writer's cramp disease
   were asked to perform the trial, which included writing, hovering, and
   spiral/sinusoidal drawing subtasks. The trial had three major steps
   namely: A) normal writing, when the patients write without sensory
   manipulation, B) robotics-assisted writing, when a haptic device
   supports the pen and provides a compliant writing surface with the goal
   of manipulating the kinesthetic haptic input, and C) blindfolded
   writing, when the patients were asked to write while being blindfolded,
   with the goal of analyzing the potential effects of vision feedback in
   sensorimotor integration pathway. The number of cramps that occurred and
   subjective measures of patient feedback about cramp severity were
   analyzed. The results show that reducing the writing surface rigidity,
   and blocking vision feedback while writing, changes the cramp pattern
   and decreases the overall cramp severity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a simple and effective eavesdropping-resilient
   OFDM system achieved by dynamic subcarrier allocation, exploiting the
   independent frequency selectivities of different wireless channels. The
   transmitter utilizes the channel state information (CSI) between the
   legitimate receiver and itself for the OFDM subcarrier allocation. The
   highly faded subcarriers are dropped for the data transmission and the
   constellation size of subcarriers with excellent channel conditions is
   increased in order to retain the overall throughput. Based on channel
   reciprocity, the channel behaves in the same manner at each pair of
   users. The subcarrier allocation scheme is thus shared by the
   transmitter and the legitimate receiver without additional signaling. In
   contrast, with an independent multipath channel, the eavesdropper at a
   separate location cannot derive an identical subcarrier allocation
   scheme. Consequently, mismatched demodulation is carried out at the
   eavesdropper so that disrupts the information recovery for

Abstract = {{In amplify-and-forward (AF) relay systems, multi-hop transmissions over
   multiple frequency selective fading channels result in an accumulation
   of delay spread, which could lead to strong intersymbol interference
   (ISI) at the destination since there is no proper channel compensation
   at the relay nodes. If orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   with fixed-length guard interval (GI) is used in these systems, then the
   length of the GI has to be extended to the longest possible channel
   delay spread to avoid ISI. However, using such a long GI lowers the
   effective data transmission throughput. To this end, we propose a novel
   OFDM system with adaptive GI for AF relay networks to reduce the overall
   transmission overhead by dynamically choosing the suitable GI length.
   More specifically, the GI is adaptively selected at the transmitter from
   a variable-length orthogonal code set, which provides a GI sequence with
   proper length, depending on the accumulated channel duration. By
   exploiting the orthogonal property between different GI sequences, the
   proposed adaptive GI scheme can be implemented without any extra control
   signal transmitted by the source to notify the destination about the GI
   used. This differs from existing adaptive GI studies which require such
   an additional control signal and thus introduce extra system overhead.
   Numerical results show that the proposed adaptive scheme (without
   additional control signal) can achieve the same symbol error rate (SER)
   performance as the conventional adaptive GI approaches (with control
   signal). This implies that the proposed scheme can further save the
   control signaling overhead without any SER performance loss.}},

   provide a close-form solution to our control optimization which renders

   events at different learning stages. We design a metric that measures
   the level of learning accuracy and use that as an indicator to adjust

Abstract = {{A non-intrusive objective speech quality and intelligibility measure
   tailored to hearing restoration instruments is proposed and evaluated in
   complex listening environments. The measure builds upon the
   previously-proposed ``speech-to-reverberation modulation energy
   ratio{''} (SRMR) by incorporating hearing impairment percepts, such as
   hearing loss thresholds and altered modulation frequency selectivity.
   Performance is assessed using speech data corrupted by additive noise,
   reverberation, and noise-plus-reverberation which were subjectively
   rated by cochlear implant and hearing aid users. Experimental results
   show that the developed measures outperform the original SRMR metric for
   hearing impaired listeners and achieve performance levels inline with
   existing intrusive quality and intelligibility metrics, but with the
   advantage of not requiring access to a clean reference signal. As such,
   the measure may be used to develop quality-or intelligibility-aware
   speech enhancement algorithms for advanced hearing restoration

   which EV battery degradation cost, EV charging/discharging inefficiency,
   EV energy gain/loss, the cost of external energy sources, and potential
   asynchronous communication between the aggregator and each EV are taken

Abstract = {{Purpose: Implant loosening is a common complication that compromises the
   stability of joint replacement systems. Stem geometry is particularly
   influential in the stability of cemented implants, both before and after
   debonding occurs at the stem-cement interface. There are few studies
   assessing the effect of stem longitudinal curvature as a geometric
   factor in cemented implant stability. The purpose of this study was to
   compare the torsional stability of four generalized cemented implant
   stems (i.e., non-specific to joint), with varying degrees of
   longitudinal curvatures -zero, two, four, and six degrees.
   Methods: Twelve specimens of each curvature angle were potted to a depth
   of 20 mm using bone cement, given 24 hours to cure, and then tested in a
   materials testing machine. Torque was applied to the stems under
   monotonic loading at a rate of 2.5 degrees/min, until five degrees of
   rotation had occurred.
   Results: There were no differences in torsional stability among the four
   stem curvature angles, when the magnitudes of peak torque (P=.72; 1-beta
   = 0.13), rotation of the stem at peak torque (P=0.23; 1-beta = 0.38) and
   work required for five degrees of stem rotation (P=.58; 1-beta = 0.07)
   were compared.
   Conclusions: The findings from this study demonstrate that for short
   stems, stem curvature angles up to six degrees does not improve
   torsional stability when compared to the straight stem design.}},

Abstract = {{The long anticipated deployment of nano-optics that can enable next
   generation computing has encountered several practical impediments that
   have delayed widespread adoption in commercial processes. However, the
   global market in nano-enabled products is expected to grow to over \$80B
   USD within the next 3 years. In response, the research community is
   creating solutions to overcome challenging issues such as reliability
   and cost-effective fabrication. New approaches in sensing, continuous
   uptime powering, and post silicon manufacturing will maximize overall
   performance and allow unprecedented commercial applications. This paper
   reviews present limitations of nano-optics and then considers the new
   generation of devices and their manufacturing that may turn promises
   into reality. We highlight several recent innovations: high
   sensitivity/selectivity nano-optical sensing devices; sustainable power
   from polymer energy harvesting and storage; optical variable devices for
   visual authentication of secure documents; and nano-template masters for
   high-volume manufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to collaborate has long been key to the successful
   completion of tasks. With the availability of current networking and
   computing power, the creation of Collaborative Working Environments
   (CWEs) has allowed for this process to occur over virtually any
   geographic distance. While the strength of a CWE is its ability to allow
   for the exchange of information freely between collaborators, this opens
   the participants up to a possible loss of privacy. In this paper, the
   issue of protecting privacy while collaborating is discussed. To address
   the privacy concerns that are raised, a generic privacy ontology is
   presented, along with a Collaborative Privacy Manager (CPM). The generic
   privacy ontology allows for the creation of privacy policies at several
   layers of granularity. The architecture of the CPM, consisting of
   several levels and modules, is introduced. The functions this CPM will
   play to ensure privacy in collaborative working environments are also
   detailed. How each module within the Collaborative Working Environment
   works towards accomplishing each goal is described.}},

Abstract = {{Each year, a number of natural disasters strike across the globe,
   killing hundreds and causing billions of dollars in property and
   infrastructure damage. Minimizing the impact of disasters is imperative
   in today's society. As the capabilities of software and hardware evolve,
   so does the role of information and communication technology in disaster
   mitigation, preparation, response, and recovery. A large quantity of
   disaster-related data is available, including response plans, records of
   previous incidents, simulation data, social media data, and Web sites.
   However, current data management solutions offer few or no integration
   capabilities. Moreover, recent advances in cloud computing, big data,
   and NoSQL open the door for new solutions in disaster data management.
   In this paper, a Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) framework is proposed for
   disaster cloud data management (Disaster-CDM), with the objectives of 1)
   storing large amounts of disaster-related data from diverse sources, 2)
   facilitating search, and 3) supporting their interoperability and
   integration. Data are stored in a cloud environment using a combination
   of relational and NoSQL databases. The case study presented in this
   paper illustrates the use of Disaster-CDM on an example of simulation
   models.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main important parts in the robot vision system of the
   mushroom harvesting robot is to detect mushroom damage either caused by
   microbial or mechanical origin. Mushrooms must be classified as healthy
   or unhealthy to ensure proper handling and maximize crop yield. To solve
   the problem of identification, a fast and non-destructive method,
   Support Vector Machine (SVM), is applied to improve the recognition
   accuracy and efficiency of the robot. Initially, a median filter is
   applied to remove the inherent noise in the colored image. SIFT features
   of the image are then extracted and computed forming a vector, which is
   then quantized into visual words. Finally, the histogram of the
   frequency of each element in the visual vocabulary is created and fed
   into an SVM classifier, which categorizes the mushrooms as either
   healthy or unhealthy. Our preliminary results for mushroom
   classification are promising and the experiments carried out on the data
   set highlight faster computation time and a higher rate of accuracy,
   reaching over 90\% using this method, which can be employed in real life
   scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging dynamics of the digital e-markets are creating many
   opportunities with the vast growth and potential of online services and
   mobile technology. However, the sustainability of e-markets is uncertain
   due to industry and operational risks. While industry threats extend to
   the rapidly shifting powers, fuzzy dynamics, and fierce rivalry, this
   work examines an overlooked operational risk that relates to the fact
   present e-markets often constrain e-traders from strategic conduct. Such
   denial incites adverse reactions that cause e-market failures. In
   contrast, Smith invisible hand realizes the efficiency of the flexible
   strategic choice in free markets. Conveying strategies as rules may,
   also, accelerate the bidding lifecycles due to the automatic preference
   deduction of rules by the smart exchange. This work presents the RBBL
   rule based bidding language that enables free expressions of strategic
   rules in the bid structure, while proposing the GSPM generalized second
   price truthful matching double auction that computes stable, efficient
   and tractable outcomes with market profitability. The introduced smart
   exchange deliberates on the RBBL rules for automatic preference
   deduction while using the GSPM for winner determination, hence, improves
   sustainability with the rapid and stable e-trades, social efficiency,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate security issues in a collaborative
   wireless network in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, where
   multiple amplify-and-forward (AF) relays are exploited to secure the
   message transmission between legitimate users. We first consider the
   multiple AF relays all participating in assisting the transmission from
   source to destination, which is called all-relay based collaborative
   transmission scheme as denoted by all-relay scheme for notational
   convenience. We also propose the best-relay transmission scheme in which
   only the single ``best{''} relay is selected to help the source transmit
   messages to destination. We then analyze the intercept behavior in
   wireless networks and evaluate intercept probabilities of the proposed
   all-relay and best-relay schemes as well as the conventional direct
   transmission without relay in a Rayleigh fading environment. Numerical
   results show that the best-relay transmission scheme always outperforms
   the all-relay and direct transmission schemes in terms of intercept
   probability. It is also shown that as the number of eavesdroppers
   increases, the intercept probabilities of both all-relay and best-relay
   schemes increase. Moreover, the intercept probability performance of
   all-relay and best-relay schemes significantly improves with an
   increasing number of relays, implying the advantage of exploiting
   multiple relays against eavesdropping attacks.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an increasingly popular computing paradigm, now
   proving a necessity for utility computing services. Each provider offers
   a unique service portfolio with a range of resources. Resource
   provisioning for cloud services in a comprehensive way is of crucial
   importance to any resource allocation model. Any model should consider
   both computational resources and network(data) resources to accurately
   represent and serve practical needs. We propose a new model to tackle
   the resource allocation problem for a group of cloud user requests. This
   includes provisioning for both data center computational resources and
   network resources. The model is implemented with the objective of
   minimizing the average tardiness of connection requests. Four combined
   scheduling algorithms are introduced and used to schedule virtual
   machines on data center servers and then schedule connection requests on
   the network paths available. Of the four methods, the method combining
   Resource Based Distribution technique and Duration Priority technique
   have shown the best performance getting the minimum tardiness while
   complying with the problem constraints.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of an empirically derived density-modulus equation for bone
   depends upon the loading conditions and anatomic site of bone specimens
   used for experimentation. A recent study used FE modeling to compare the
   ability of three density-modulus relationships to predict strain during
   bending in neutral forearm rotation in the distal ulna; however, due to
   the inhomogeneous nature of these FE models, the performance of each
   equation is not necessarily consistent throughout forearm rotation. This
   issue is addressed in the present study, which compares the performance
   of these equations in pronation and supination. Strain gauge data were
   collected at six discreet locations of six ulna specimens loaded in
   bending at 40 degrees of pronation and supination. Three FE models of
   each specimen were made, one for each density-modulus relation, and the
   strain output compared to the experimental data. The equation previously
   shown to be most accurate in predicting ulnar strain in neutral forearm
   rotation was also most accurate in pronation and supination. These
   results identify this one equation as the most appropriate for future FE
   analysis of the ulna (including adaptive remodeling, and further show
   that isotropic and inhomogeneous FE bone models may provide consistent
   results in different planes of bending.}},

Title = {{Bond Strength of Different Resin Cement and Ceramic Shades Bonded to
   Dentin}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADHESIVE DENTISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{461-466}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the microtensile bond strength (MTBS) of ceramic
   cemented to dentin varying the resin cement and ceramic shades.
   Materials and Methods: Two VITA VM7 ceramic shades (Base Dentine 0M1 and
   Base Dentine 5M3) were used. A spectrophotometer was used to determine
   the percentage translucency of ceramic (thickness: 2.5 mm). For the MTBS
   test, 80 molar dentin surfaces were etched and an adhesive was applied.
   Forty blocks (7.2 x 7.2 x 2.5 mm) of each ceramic shade were produced
   and the ceramic surface was etched (10\% hydrofluoric acid) for 60 s,
   followed by the application of silane and resin cement (A3 yellow and
   transparent). The blocks were cemented to dentin using either A3 or
   transparent cement. Specimens were photoactivated for 20 s or 40 s,
   stored in distilled water (37 degrees C/24 h), and sectioned. Eight
   experimental groups were obtained (n = 10). Specimens were tested for
   MTSB using a universal testing machine. Data were statistically analyzed
   using ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests (alpha <= 0.05).
   Results: The percentage translucency of 0M1 and 5M3 ceramics were 10.06
   (+/- 0.25)\% and 1.34 (+/- 0.02)\%, respectively. The lowest MTBS was
   observed for the ceramic shade 5M3. For the 0M1 ceramic, the A3 yellow
   cement that was photocured for 20 s exhibited the lowest MTBS, while the
   transparent cement that was photocured for 40 s presented the highest
   MTBS.
   Conclusions: For the 2.5-mm-thick 5M3 ceramic restorations, the MTBS of
   ceramic cemented to dentin significantly increased. The dual-curing
   cement Variolink II photocured for 40 s is not recommended for cementing
   the Base Dentine 5M3 feldspathic ceramic to dentin.}},

Abstract = {{3D printing technology is becoming a new attractive manufacturing
   approach in medical and biomedical fields. In this paper, 3D printed
   structures were ``painted{''} with functional polymer brushes via atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to achieve antimicrobial
   properties for biomedical applications. An ATRP initiator was added into
   3D printing ink without affecting the optical and polymerization
   properties. After the 3D printing process using the functionalized ink,
   the surface readily binds with the Br terminated initiator for the
   following surface modification. Moreover, since the initiator exists in
   the bulk material and thus the entire printed structure, if needed, any
   damaged surface can be easily re-painted with a single step of the ATRP
   polymerization process. To demonstrate the technique, 3-sulfopropyl
   methacrylate potassium salt (SPMA) was grafted onto the surface and the
   adhesion of bacteria was significantly reduced. In addition, the
   functionalized surface can also inhibit the growth of bacteria on the
   surface. Enabling new functions of the printed structures, the developed
   technique has significantly expanded the capability of 3D printing
   technology for biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{How to tune graphene nanosheets (GNSs) with various morphologies has
   been a significant challenge for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this
   study, three types of GNSs with varying size, edge sites, defects and

   controlling GNS morphology and microstructure has important effects on
   its cyclic performance and rate capability in LIBs. Diminished GNS layer
   number, decreased size, increased edge sites and increased defects in
   the GNS anode can be highly beneficial to lithium storage and result in
   increased electrochemical performance. Interestingly, GNSs treated with
   a hydrothermal approach delivered a high reversible discharge capacity
   of 1348 mA h g(-1). This study demonstrates that the controlled design
   of high performance GNS anodes is an important concept in LIB

   situations. Firstly, independent fadings with Rayleigh and Nakagami-m
   statistics are considered. Next, an exponentially correlated fading
   environment with Nakagami-m statistics is considered. The ABEP
   performance of the proposed system is illustrated using analytical
   expressions and using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical
   results show close agreement of analytical work with those of

Abstract = {{Endoscope based minimally invasive abdominal procedures provide
   potential advantages over conventional open surgery such as reduced
   trauma, shorter hospital stay, and quick recovery. One of the major
   limitations of the use of this technique is the small area that the
   endoscope covers resulting in the lack of proper 3D context of the
   surgical site. We propose a rapid and accurate approach to reconstruct
   the surface from intra-operative stereo endoscopic images of the
   surgical site which is projected with gridline light patterns. The
   reconstructed surface is then registered with the surface extracted from
   pre-operative MR images for fusion of endoscopic and MR images to guide
   these surgical procedures. We validate our proposed method on a liver
   phantom and achieve the surface registration error of 0.76 +/- 0.11 mm.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the physico-chemical treatment of municipal wastewater
   for the simultaneous removal of pollutant indicators (chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) and total coliforms) and organic contaminants (total
   phenols) was investigated and assessed. A secondary settled effluent was
   subjected to coagulation, disinfection and absorption in a
   multifunctional reactor by dosing, simultaneously, aluminum polychloride
   (dose range: 0-150 mu L/L), natural zeolites (dose range: 0-150 mg/L),
   sodium hypochlorite (dose range: 0-7.5 mg/L) and powder activated carbon
   (dose range: 0-30 mg/L). The treatment process was optimized using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and response surface methodology.
   Specifically, a Latin square technique was employed to generate 16
   combinations of treating agent types and concentrations which were pilot
   tested on an 8 m(3)/h multifunctional reactor fed by a secondary
   effluent with COD and total coliform concentrations ranging from
   approximate to 20 to 120 mg/L and from 10(5) to 10(6) CFU/100 mL,
   respectively. Results were promising, indicating that removal yields up
   to 71\% in COD and 5.4 log in total coliforms were obtained using an
   optimal combination of aluminum polychloride (dose range approximate to
   84-106 mu L/L), powder activated carbon approximate to 5 mg/L, natural
   zeolite (dose range approximate to 34-70 mg/L) and sodium hypochlorite
   (dose range approximate to 3.4-5.6 mg/L), with all treating agents
   playing a statistically significant role in determining the overall
   treatment performance. Remarkably, the combined process was also able to
   remove approximate to 50\% of total phenols, a micropollutant known to
   be recalcitrant to conventional wastewater treatments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports facile and cost effective methods for fabricating
   MoS2 nanosheets and for assembling layered MoS2-graphene nanocomposites.
   The MoS2 nanosheets were obtained by ultrasonicating commercial MoS2
   powder in N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP). The MoS2-graphene nanocomposites
   were assembled by the vacuum assisted filtration of a mixture of the
   MoS2 nanosheets and graphene nanosheets suspended in NMP and water,
   respectively. In the nanocomposites, the MoS2 nanosheets are dispersed
   between the graphene nanosheets, and vice versa. When used as anodes for
   LIBs, the MoS2 nanosheets greatly outperform the MoS2 powder; however,
   they still suffer severe capacity deterioration due to the poor electric
   conductivity and the obvious structural failure. Excellent performances
   were observed in the MoS2-graphene nanocomposites. For the 60Mo-80GN
   sample, the reversible capacities are held stably at similar to 650,
   similar to 550 and similar to 500 mAh g(-1) at 500, 1000 and 20000 mA
   g(-1), respectively. It is concluded that for the MoS2-graphene
   nanocomposites, MoS2 is the key component accommodating Li ions, and
   graphene improves the electric conductivity and maintains the structural
   stability for the MoS2 nanosheets. These findings prove that
   ultrasonication combined with the vacuum assisted filtration is a
   scale-up approach to fabricate MoS2-graphene based layered
   nanocomposites with excellent Li storage capacity. (C) 2013 The

   The proposed converter can operate with ZVS due to a simple auxiliary

   voltage switching (ZVS) capability with minimal electromagnetic noises.
   The number of components in the proposed circuit is reduced compared to
   previous proposed converters of the same type, resulting in lower cost
   and lower conduction losses. The paper presents the new converter then
   discusses its operation, steady-state characteristics and design.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to control a boost PFC AC/DC
   converter without using any current sensors. Due to the particular
   structure of the boost PFC AC/DC converter, sensorless control of the
   converter is very challenging. As illustrated in this paper, the
   converter loses its observability for some operating points. This is the
   reason that the sensorless control of the boost PFC entails special
   attentions. A very simple and practical senseless scheme is proposed in
   this paper, which is able to accurately estimate the inductor current
   for the entire operating range of the converter. In addition, a very
   simple and practical closed-loop control approach is proposed in order
   to improve the transient response of the single-phase boost PFC
   converter. This approach eliminates the need for filtering double
   frequency ripple from the output voltage, which allows increasing the
   bandwidth of the external voltage loop. Simulation and experimental
   results validate the feasibility of the proposed technique and confirm
   its superior performance compared to the conventional control system.}},

Abstract = {{A new zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) reduction method for
   multi-module VSIs (MVSIs) consisting of P three phase inverters that are
   connected in parallel is proposed in this paper. Four-switch inverter
   modules are used instead of conventional six-switch modules to reduce
   cost. In the paper, the effectiveness of the proposed ZSCC reduction
   method is studied using selective harmonic elimination PWM (SHE-PWM).
   The proposed ZSCC reduction method can remove about P times the number
   of harmonics using the same switching frequency as compared to more
   conventional methods, as explained later in this proposal. The concepts
   discussed in the paper are confirmed with results obtained from an MVSI
   experimental prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The wall-filter selection curve (WFSC) method was developed to
   automatically select cut-off velocities for high-frequency power Doppler
   imaging. Selection curves are constructed by plotting color pixel
   density (CPD) as a function of wall filter cut-off velocity. A new
   three-component mathematical model is developed to guide the design of
   an online implementation of the method for in vivo imaging. The model
   treats Doppler imaging as a signal detection task in which the scanner
   must distinguish intravascular pixels from perivascular and
   extravascular pixels and includes a cost function to identify the
   optimum cut-off velocity that provides accurate vascular quantification
   and minimizes the effect of color pixel artifacts on visualization of
   vascular structures. The goodness of fit of the three-component model to
   flow-phantom data is significantly improved compared to a previous
   two-component model (F test, p < 0.005). Simulations using the new model
   indicate that selection curves should be sampled using at least 100
   cut-off velocities to ensure robust performance of the automated WFSC
   method and determine an upper bound on CPD variability that ensures
   reliable vascular quantification accuracy, defined as CPD within 5\% of
   the reference vascular volume fraction. Results of the simulations also
   provide evidence that limiting the selection of the cut-off velocity to
   a binary choice between the middle and right end of the characteristic
   interval is sufficient to meet the quantification accuracy goal. The
   model provides an intuitive, empirical description of the relationship
   between system settings and blood-flow detection performance in power
   Doppler imaging.}},

Abstract = {{When a liquid spontaneously spreads over a solid surface, a progressive
   microscopic structure, conventionally known as a van der Waals driven
   precursor film, develops ahead of the moving contact line. Here, we
   report a new class of electrostatically assisted precursors containing
   microscopic charged particles. This precursor manifests itself at the
   late stage of forced-spreading of a macroscopic dielectric film
   subjected to a unipolar ionic discharge in a gas containing particulate.
   We put a model forward to predict dynamic behaviour of this
   electrostatic precursor. The spreading of the precursor film is
   predicted to be proportional to the square root of the exposure time,
   which is consistent with the ellipsometric measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of nanomaterials have demonstrated promise in medical
   applications such as drug delivery and imaging. In these applications,
   the surface chemistry of the materials is critical as it plays an
   important role in determining the toxicity and biodistribution behavior
   of the material. We review here the functionalization of nanomaterials
   with dendrons as an efficient method to alter the surface chemistry of
   the materials, introducing new properties and functions. Described here
   is the functionalization of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
   (SPIO) with dendritic guanidines to enhance their transport into cells
   for magnetic resonance imaging applications. The introduction of
   dendrons bearing peripheral hydroxyls, amines, guanidines, carbohydrates
   and Gd(III) chelates to polymer vesicles (polymersomes) is also
   described. These dendritic moieties allow for modulation of toxicity,
   cell uptake, protein binding, and contrast agent efficiency, while at
   the same time allowing the stabilities of the polymersomes to be
   maintained. Thus, this approach holds promise for the development of a
   wide range of multifunctional materials for pharmaceutical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a physics-based assessment of renewable energy
   potential in Europe, particularly solar and wind energy sources, using

   first done. Actual temperature, pressure, relative humidity, global
   radiation and wind speed data are employed to develop energy and exergy
   maps for Europe, based on iso-areas of land-use. These maps are compared
   with similar existing ones. A good agreement is obtained. A paradoxical
   result is found for wind exergy efficiency. The yearly average exergy
   efficiency where wind speed is less than 5 m/s is greater than that
   where wind speed is greater than 7 m/s. This can be explained by the
   `dome' shape of wind exergy efficiency. A solar efficiency map for
   Europe is also developed to serve as a useful guide for choosing a
   renewable energy form based on yearly energy production.}},

   Enhanced electric field intensity between each hole and disk was

   and/or a bi-functional cross-linking agent (glyoxal). Markedly improved
   auto-oxidation stability was observed in the xylenol orange and
   phenanthroline doped gel at the expense of increased background

Pages = {{4388-4395}},
Abstract = {{To improve the efficiency of topical ocular drug administration, we
   developed a nanocomposite contact lens to deliver hydrophilic protein
   drugs over a prolonged period of time. Here, an in situ route was used
   to encapsulate the hydrophilic protein drug bovine serum albumin (BSA)
   within gelatin nanoparticles (NPs), 180 +/- 20 nm in diameter, which
   were then grafted onto the lens material, a copolymer of 2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate p(HEMA-co-AEMA), through
   photopolymerization. The thickness of the nanocomposite lens was
   controlled at 150 mm. The release kinetics of BSA from plain
   p(HEMA-co-AEMA), gelatin NPs, and gelatin NP-grafted p(HEMA-co-AEMA) in
   phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 were studied. The release
   profile of BSA encapsulated within gelatin NPs could be monitored for 7
   days, three times longer than that of BSA soaked in p(HEMA-co-AEMA). Our
   findings indicate that use of the nanocomposite contact lens, i.e.
   BSA-loaded gelatin NPs incorporated into p(HEMA-co-AMEA), can prolong
   the release profile of BSA to 12 days. The swelling behavior and
   interior strain of p(HEMA-co-AEMA) with and without grafted NPs (1000 :
   1 w/w) were further investigated. The nanocomposite lens shows higher
   swelling behavior than the plain p(HEMA-co-AEMA) lens does. The addition
   of gelatin NPs to hydrogels leads to a relatively uniform interior
   strain with lower stiffness. Thus, the prolonged release might be due to
   a combination of effects. Internal diffusion of the nanocomposite lens
   materials may significantly contribute to the prolonged release of
   protein drugs. Furthermore, the nanocomposite lens materials had no
   cytotoxicity. This new biocompatible nanocomposite might be further
   developed as an alternative tool for continuous topical ocular drug
   delivery over a prolonged period of time.}},

   fiducial-constrained affine transformations T-F). Seven radical
   prostatectomy specimens were imaged with MR imaging, processed for
   whole-mount histology, and digitized as histology images. The algorithms
   were evaluated on the reconstruction error and the sensitivity of same
   to translational and rotational errors in initialization. Reconstruction
   error was quantified as the target registration error (TRE): the
   post-reconstruction distance between homologous point landmarks (7-15
   per histology section; 132 total) identified on histology and MR images.
   Sensitivity to initialization was quantified using a linear model
   relating TRE to varied levels of translational/rotational initialization
   errors. The algorithm using M-MI and T-A yielded a mean TRE of 1.2 +/-
   0.7 mm when initialized using an approach that assumes histology
   corresponds to the front faces of tissue blocks, but was sensitive to
   initialization error. The algorithm using M-FRE and T-A yielded a mean
   TRE of 0.8 +/- 0.4 mm with minimal sensitivity to initialization errors.
   Compared to the method used to initialize the algorithms (mean TRE 1.4
   +/- 0.7 mm), a study using an algorithm with a mean TRE of 0.8 mm would
   require 27\% fewer subjects for certain imaging validation study
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate pathology assessment of post-prostatectomy specimens is
   important to determine the need for and to guide potentially life-saving
   adjuvant therapy. Digital pathology imaging is enabling a transition to
   a more objective quantification of some surgical pathology assessments,
   such as tumour volume, that are currently visually estimated by
   pathologists and subject to inter-observer variability. One challenge
   for tumour volume quantification is the traditional 3-5 mm spacing of
   images acquired from sections of radical prostatectomy specimens. Tumour
   volume estimates may benefit from a well-motivated approach to
   inter-slide tumour boundary interpolation. We implemented and tested a
   level set-based interpolation method and found that it produced 3D
   tumour surfaces that may be more biologically plausible than those
   produced via a simpler nearest-slide interpolation. We found that the
   simpler method produced larger tumour volumes, compared to the level set
   method, by a median factor of 2.3. For contexts where only tumour volume
   is of interest, we determined that the volumes produced via the simpler
   method can be linearly adjusted to the level set-produced volumes. The
   smoother surfaces from level set interpolation yielded measurable
   differences in tumour boundary location; this may be important in
   several clinical/research contexts (e.g. pathology-based imaging
   validation for focal therapy planning).}},

Abstract = {{Cost and accessibility are major barriers to x-ray medical diagnostic
   screening in low- to mid-income countries. The cost of traditional
   medical-grade x-ray imaging systems is prohibitively large except to
   major hospitals in urban centers, preventing the early diagnosis of many
   curable diseases. Sputum, blood and urine tests are slower, and
   difficult to administer in remote locations, having high associated
   transportation and storage costs. A low-cost, tuberculosis-specific,
   teleradiology-enabled, digital x-ray imaging system is proposed that
   will make diagnosis fast, accessible and inexpensive. A system of this
   type would ideally cost below \$10,000 and is achievable today using a
   combination of commodity and industrial products, region-of-interest
   imaging, and an optimization of resolution and sensitivity requirements
   for the task of screening pulmonary tuberculosis.
   In this research, we report preliminary investigations we have carried
   out on the x-ray detector, a PerkinElmer (XRD 0820) industrial-grade,
   8{''}x8{''} flat-panel, amorphous silicon array with 200 micron pixels.
   Detective quantum efficiency (DQE), modulation transfer function (MTF)
   and noise power spectmm (NPS) measurements are taken at a typical chest
   radiography exposure that allow a direct comparison with high-end chest
   x-ray detectors and existing CR systems.}},

Abstract = {{Single-photon counting (SF C) x-ray imaging has the potential to improve
   image quality and enable new advanced energy-dependent methods.
   Recently, cascaded systems analysis (CSA) has been extended to the
   description of the detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of SPC detectors.
   In this article we apply the new CSA approach to the description of the
   DQE of hypothetical direct-conversion selenium (Se) and cadmium zinc
   telluride (CdZnTe) detectors including the effects of poly-energetic
   x-ray spectra, stochastic conversion of x-ray energy to electron-hole
   (e-h) pairs, depth-dependent collection of e-h pairs using the Hecht
   relation, additive electronic noise, and thresholding. Comparisons are
   made to an energy-integrating model. For this simple model, with the
   exception of thick (1 - 10 mm) Se-based convertors, we found that the
   SPC DQE was 5-20 \% greater than that of the energy-integrating model.
   This trend was true even when additive noise was included in the SPC
   model and excluded from the energy-integrating model. However, the DQE
   of SPC detectors with poor collection efficiency (such as thick (>1 mm)
   Se (letectors) and high levels of additive noise can be degraded by
   40-90 \% for all energies and x-ray spectra considered. While
   photon-counting approaches are not yet ready for routine diagnostic
   imaging, the available DQE is equal to or higher than that of
   conventional energy-integrating detectors under a wide range of x-ray
   energies and convertor thickness. However, like energy-integrating
   detectors, the DQE of SPC detectors will be degraded by the combination
   of poor collection efficiency and high levels of additive noise.}},

Abstract = {{Image quality in diagnostic x-ray detectors is limited by statistical
   properties governing how, and where, x-ray energy is deposited in a
   detector. This in turn depends on the physics of underlying x-ray
   interactions, and the development of theoretical models of x-ray
   interaction physics is therefore a critical step in optimal detector
   design and assessment. While cascaded-systems analyses are often used to
   describe image signal and noise in many systems, it has always been
   assumed there is only a single element (single Z) with which all x rays
   interact even though most commonly used and promising candidates are
   compound materials. In addition, coherent and incoherent scattering and
   their effects on image quality are usually ignored but may be important
   in some situation such as in low-Z atoms with high x-ray energies. We
   present a theoretical model of energy deposition within a double-Z x-ray
   detector material that addresses the nature of energy absorption
   following photoelectric and incoherent interactions and the effects of
   coherent scatter prior to energy deposition by photoelectric
   interactions. A cascaded systems approach is used to describe the
   transfer of signal and noise in terms of the modulation transfer
   function (MTF), Wiener noise power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum
   efficiency (DQE). The model is validated by comparing Monte Carlo
   simulation results with CsI and PbI2 double-Z materials. Excellent
   agreement is obtained for each metric over the entire diagnostic energy
   range up to 10 cycles/mm. It is shown that in all cases tested, a
   combination of two single-Z models weighted by the atomic density of
   each atom type gives equivalent results to the more comprehensive
   double-Z model within a few percent. This result suggests the simpler
   model is adequate and may be preferred for the optimal design of
   conventional radiography detectors and the estimation of x-ray imaging
   performance of novel photoconductor materials.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in materials engineering have enabled photovoltaic (PV)
   cells to be fabricated from solid state semiconductors, photosensitive
   organic dyes, and photoactive proteins. One type of organic PV cell is
   based on the natural light-harvesting protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR)
   found in the plasma membrane of a salt marsh archaebacteria. When
   exposed to sunlight, each bR molecule acts as a simple proton pump which
   transports hydrogen ions from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side
   through a transmembrane ion channel. Two types of bR-PV cells comprised
   of photosensitive dry and aqueous (wet) bR thin films are described in
   this paper. The self-assembled monolayer of oriented purple membrane
   (PM) patches from the bR protein is created on a bio-functionalized gold
   (Au) surface using a biotin molecular recognition technique. The dry bR
   monolayer is covered with an optically transparent Indium Tin Oxide
   (ITO) electrode to complete the dry bR-PV device. In contrast, the
   aqueous bR-PV cell is created by immobilizing the bR monolayer on an
   Au-coated porous substrate and then inserting the assembly between two
   micro-reservoirs filled with KCl solutions. Platinum wire probes are
   then inserted in the opposing liquid reserviors near the porous bR
   monolayer. The dry bR-PV cell generated a photo-electric response of
   9.73 mV/cm(2), while the aqueous bR-PV produced 41.7 mV/cm(2) and 33.3
   mu A/cm(2). Although the generated voltages appear small, it may be
   sufficient to power various microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and
   microfluidic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer detection at early stage is very critical for desirable
   treatment outcome. In fact prostate cancer can be cured, if it is
   detected at early stage. Among imaging modalities used for cancer
   assessment, ultrasound elastography is emerging as an effective clinical
   tool for prostate and breast cancer diagnosis. Current clinical
   ultrasound elastography systems utilize strain imaging where tissue
   strain images are generated to approximate the tissue elastic modulus
   distribution. While strain images can be generated in real-time fashion,
   they lack the accuracy necessary for having high sensitivity and
   specificity. To improve strain imaging, researchers have developed full
   inversion based elastography techniques. These techniques are not based
   on simplifying assumptions such as tissue stress uniformity leading to
   accurate elastic modulus reconstruction. The drawback of these
   techniques, however, is that they are computationally intensive, hence
   are not suitable for real-time imaging. Among these techniques, a
   constrained elastography technique was developed which showed promising
   results as long as the tumor geometry can be obtained accurately from
   the imaging modality used in conjunction with elastography. This
   requirement is not easy to fulfill, especially with ultrasound imaging.
   To address this issue, we present an unconstrained full inversion
   ultrasound elastography method for prostate cancer imaging where
   knowledge of tissue geometry is not necessary. Tissue elastic modulus
   reconstruction in the proposed elastography technique is iterative,
   where each iteration involves tissue stress computation using Finite
   Element Method (FEM) followed by Young's modulus updating using Hooke's
   law. The method was validated using in silico and tissue mimicking
   prostate phantom studies. Results obtained from these studies indicate
   that the technique is reasonably accurate and robust.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) imaging is commonly used for
   diagnostic and intraoperative guidance of interventional abdominal
   procedures including percutaneous thermal ablation of focal liver tumors
   with radiofrequency (RF) or microwave (MW) induced energy. However, in
   many situations 2D US may not provide enough anatomical detail and
   guidance information. Therefore, intra-procedural CT or MR imaging are
   used in many centers for guidance purposes. These modalities are costly
   and are mainly utilized to confirm tool placement rather than guiding
   the insertion. Three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) has been introduced
   to address these issues. In this paper, we present our integrated
   solution to provide 3D US images using a newly developed mechanical
   transducer with a large field-of-view and without the need for external
   tracking devices to combine diagnostic and planning information of
   different modalities for intraoperative guidance. The system provides
   tools to segment the target(s), plan the treatment, and detect the
   ablation applicators during the procedure for guiding purposes. We
   present experimental results used to ensure that our system generates
   accurate measurements and our early clinical evaluation results. The
   results suggest that 3D US used for focal liver ablation can provide a
   more reliable planning and guidance tool compared to 2D US only, and in
   many cases offers comparable measurements to other alternatives at
   significantly lower cost, faster time and with no harmful radiation.}},

Abstract = {{3D segmentation of the prostate in medical images is useful to prostate
   cancer diagnosis and therapy guidance, but is time-consuming to perform
   manually. Clinical translation of computer-assisted segmentation
   algorithms for this purpose requires a comprehensive and complementary
   set of evaluation metrics that are informative to the clinical end user.
   We have developed an interactive 3D prostate segmentation method for
   1.5T and 3.0T T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T2W MRI) acquired
   using an endorectal coil. We evaluated our method against manual
   segmentations of 36 3D images using complementary boundary-based (mean
   absolute distance; MAD), regional overlap (Dice similarity coefficient;
   DSC) and volume difference (Delta V) metrics. Our technique is based on
   inter-subject prostate shape and local boundary appearance similarity.
   In the training phase, we calculated a point distribution model (PDM)
   and a set of local mean intensity patches centered on the prostate
   border to capture shape and appearance variability. To segment an unseen
   image, we defined a set of rays - one corresponding to each of the mean
   intensity patches computed in training - emanating from the prostate
   centre. We used a radial-based search strategy and translated each mean
   intensity patch along its corresponding ray, selecting as a candidate
   the boundary point with the highest normalized cross correlation along
   each ray. These boundary points were then regularized using the PDM. For
   the whole gland, we measured a mean +/- std MAD of 2.5 +/- 0.7 mm, DSC
   of 80 +/- 4\%, and Delta V of 1.1 +/- 8.8 cc. We also provided an
   anatomic breakdown of these metrics within the prostatic base,
   mid-gland, and apex.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique is proposed to characterize lung tissue
   incompressibility variation during respiration. Lung tissue
   incompressibility variation stems from significant air content variation
   in the tissue throughout respiration. Estimating lung tissue
   incompressibility and its variation is critical for computer assisted
   tumor motion tracking. Continuous tumor motion during respiration is a
   major challenge in lung cancer treatment by external beam radiotherapy.
   If not accounted for, this motion leads to areas of radiation over
   dosage for the lung normal tissues. Since no effective imaging modality
   is available for real-time lung tumor tracking, computer based modeling
   which has the capability for accurate tissue deformation estimation can
   be a good alternative. Lung tissue deformation estimation can be made
   using the lung Finite Element (FE) model where its accuracy depends on
   input tissue biomechanical properties including incompressibility
   parameter. In this research, an optimization algorithm is proposed to
   estimate the incompressibility parameter function in terms of
   respiration cycle time. In this algorithm, the incompressibility
   parameter and lung pressure values are varied systematically until
   optimal values, which result in maximum similarity between acquired and
   simulated 4D CT images of the lung, are achieved for each respiration
   time point. The simulated images are constructed using a reference image
   in conjunction with the deformation field obtained from the lung's FE
   model in each respiration time increment. We demonstrated that utilizing
   the calculated function along with respiratory system FE modeling leads
   to accurate tumor targeting, hence potentially improving lung
   radiotherapy outcome.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a computational framework for patient-specific
   preoperative planning of robotics-assisted minimally invasive cardiac
   surgery (RAMICS) is presented. It is expected that the preoperative
   planning of RAMICS will improve the success rate by considering robot
   kinematics, patient-specific thoracic anatomy, and procedure-specific
   intraoperative conditions. Given the significant anatomical features
   localized in the preoperative computed tomography images of a patient's
   thorax, port locations, and robot orientations (with respect to the
   patient's body coordinate frame) are determined to optimize qualities
   such as dexterity, reachability, tool approach angles, and
   maneuverability. To address intraoperative geometric uncertainty, the
   problem is formulated as a generalized semi-infinite program (GSIP) with
   a convex lower-level problem to seek a plan that is less sensitive to
   geometric uncertainty in the neighborhood of surgical targets. It is
   demonstrated that with a proper formulation of the problem, the GSIP can
   be replaced by a tractable constrained nonlinear program that uses a
   multicriteria objective function to balance between the nominal task
   performance and robustness to collisions and joint limit violations.
   Finally, performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated by a
   comparison between the plans generated by the algorithm and those
   recommended by an experienced surgeon for several case studies.}},

Abstract = {{Three major hydrogenated castor oil crystal morphologies have been
   observed: fiber, rosette and irregular crystal. Due to the difficulty in
   obtaining samples with a single crystal morphology, rheological studies
   of suspensions containing mixtures of the three morphologies in an
   aqueous solution have been undertaken. The viscometry of dilute
   suspensions has shown that the magnitude of intrinsic viscosity is
   dominated by the fraction of a crystal morphology type, i.e. fiber >
   rosette > irregular crystal. A modified Farris model was fitted to the
   rheology data for mixtures of crystal morphology with interacting
   particles. A yield stress exists for concentrated suspensions followed
   by a shear thinning behavior with the increase of shear rate. A
   power-law relation has been found between yield stress and total
   particle volume fraction, and a constant exponent of 1.5 has been
   obtained regardless of crystal morphology.}},

Title = {{Reforming of Glycerol into Bio-Crude: A Parametric Study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Abstract = {{The reforming of glycerol was investigated using a micro-reactor in the
   presence of MoCoP/zeolite catalyst. The parameters which were
   investigated include initial hydrogen pressure, reaction temperature,
   residence time, and feedstock concentration. The liquid products were
   separated into water-soluble components and bio-oil by liquid-liquid
   extraction with water and ethyl acetate. The bio-oil, gaseous products,
   char, and unreacted glycerol were quantified relative to the initial
   mass of glycerol feed. The composition of the bio-oil was determined by
   GC/MS. The optimum conditions for the reforming of glycerol into
   bio-crude in the presence of MoCoP/zeolite catalyst were found to be:
   300 degrees C reaction temperature, 5 MPa initial hydrogen pressure, 60
   min reaction time, and 100\% glycerol feed. While dilution of the
   glycerol feedstock with water had a negative effect on bio-oil yield,
   reforming of pure glycerol produced the highest bio-oil yield (40 wt.\%
   at 300 degrees C, 1 h, and 5 MPa H-2). The amount of char deposited on
   the catalyst decreased with extended reaction time, increased reaction
   temperature, and elevated initial hydrogen pressure.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2634-2640}},
Abstract = {{Lab-on-a-CD, as a main branch of Lab-on-a-chip technology, has led to
   several very successful commercial products. Most of these existing
   Lab-on-a-CD systems present complex system designs and thus are
   relatively expensive. In this work, we have developed a simple but
   robust Lab-on-a-CD system for parallel whole blood analyses. This
   Lab-on-a-CD system incorporates electrochemical bioanalysis and a simple
   blood sample separation mechanism into the centrifugal platform, and
   thus reduces the system's complexity. To demonstrate the applicability,
   the system was applied to perform basic metabolic panel tests, for
   example, the concentrations of glucose, lactate and uric acids of whole
   blood samples. Using only 16 mu L of whole blood, within a few minutes,
   the Lab-on-a-CD system could produce results that agreed in general with
   the data by a conventional system. Therefore, this proof-of-concept
   Lab-on-a-CD system has demonstrated the potential to become a robust and
   simple-to-use device for parallel blood analyses.}},

Volume = {{176}},

Abstract = {{An ionic hydrogel microactuator driven by an organic photo-electric
   transducer is described in this paper. When exposed to visible light,
   the ultrathin layer of photosensitive bacteriorhodopsin (bR) purple
   membrane patches adsorbed on a biofunctionalized porous anodic alumina
   (PAA) gold coated surface acts as an array of proton pumps that
   transport H+ ions from the acidic gel to a separate ionic solution. The
   movement of ions across the porous membrane creates a pH gradient that
   causes the hydroxyethyl methacrylate-acrylic acid (HEMA-AA) gel to
   swell. Experimental studies show that a 13 nm self-assembled
   photoelectric layer can generate approximately 1.3 mV/(mW cm(2)) when
   exposed to an 18 mW, 568 nm light source. The photo-voltage produced by
   the monolayer is sufficient to change the pH of the surrounding ionic
   solution with 0.42. The small change in pH around the phase transition
   point pK(a) enabled the hydrogel microactuator to swell by more than
   80\% of its original volume in less than 85 min. The expansion increased
   the diameter and length of the gel microstructure by 23\% and 22\%,
   respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitization of semiconductor material is well recognized in the field
   of photography and photo-electrochemistry. Recently, dye sensitization
   technique has found its application in solar cells. Dye sensitization
   can further be applied for water treatment and sacrificial hydrogen
   generation using photocatalysis. Success of the process depends on the
   choice of suitable dye, semiconductor material, electron donor, and
   light sources. Attachment of dye molecule on photocatalyst surface leads
   to subsequent electron transfer into the conduction band of
   semiconductor, therefore strongly bound anchoring groups are preferred.
   Fixation of dye molecule on semiconductor surface also improves the
   electron transfer process. Incorporation of noble metals on
   semiconductor surface enhances their photocatalytic activity by reducing
   the electron/hole recombination rate. Dye-sensitized photocatalyst is
   applied for degradation of a wide range of compounds such as i)
   aliphatic compounds (carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, hydrazine,
   and pesticides), ii) aromatic compounds (non-sensitizing dye, phenol,
   chlorophenol, and benzyl alcohol) in aqueous medium. Hydrogen generation
   is also possible in visible light with dye-sensitized photocatalyst in
   presence of sacrificial reagents. Ruthenium based dyes in solar cells
   and dye-sensitized photocatalysis are the best reported so far, however,
   researchers are gradually switching towards inexpensive and
   environment-friendly organic dyes and/or natural dyes from vegetable
   sources. Eosin Y is an organic dye which has been widely used for
   hydrogen generation, reportedly providing quantum yields between 9-19
   \%.}},

Abstract = {{Geophysical data indicate that the 65.5 million years ago Chicxulub
   impact structure is a multi-ring basin, with three sets of
   semicontinuous, arcuate ring faults and a topographic peak ring (PR).
   Slump blocks define a terrace zone, which steps down from the inner rim
   into the annular trough. Fault blocks underlie the PR, which exhibits
   variable relief, due to target asymmetries. The central structural
   uplift is >10 km, and the Moho is displaced by 1-2 km. The working
   hypothesis for the formation of Chicxulub is: a 50 km radius transient
   cavity, lined with melt and impact breccia, formed within 10 s of the
   impact, and within minutes, weakened rebounding crust rose kilometers
   above the surface, the transient crater rim underwent localized
   deformation and collapsed into large slump blocks, resulting in a inner
   rim at 70-85 km radius, and outer ring faults at 70-130 km radius. The
   overheightened structural uplift collapsed outward, buried the inner
   slump blocks, and formed the PR. Most of the impact melt was ultimately
   emplaced as a coherent <3 km thick melt sheet within the central basin
   that shallows within the inner regions of the PR. Smaller pockets of
   melt flowed into the annular trough. Subsequently, slope collapse,
   ejecta, ground surge, and tsunami waves infilled the annular trough and
   annular basin with sediments up to 3 km and 900 m thick, respectively.
   Testing this working hypothesis requires direct observation of the
   impactites, within and adjacent to the PR and central basin.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we developed a method of analysis by which the average
   stress-plastic strain flow curve of mechanically anisotropic materials
   can be deduced from spherical indentation test data. Our analysis is
   based upon spherical indentation tests performed on the extruded and
   cold-drawn Zr-2.5\%Nb CANDU pressure tube material over the range of
   temperature from 25 degrees C to 300 degrees C. The indentation force
   and depth data were analyzed and sigma(avg) and epsilon(avg) were
   calculated using previously reported equations developed for spherical
   indentation of isotropic material which were then modified, by
   incorporating the appropriate Hill's anisotropy coefficients, to
   characterize the anisotropic yield stress of the indented material. The
   resulting flow curves were dependent on indentation direction and
   correspond closely with flow curves obtained from previously reported
   conventional uniaxial stress tests performed on the Zr-2.5\%Nb material.
   Indentation tests performed with large, 200 mu m, and small, 40 mu m,
   diameter spheres indicate that for small diameter indentations, when the
   indentation depth is less than several micrometers, the calculated
   sigma(avg) is heavily influenced by the depth dependence of the yield
   strength of the indented material. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Graphene-like BN nanosheets were synthesized via carbon-substitution
   reaction using graphene as a template in an attempt to produce C-doped
   BN. The carbon residue was removed by high-temperature oxidation in air.
   The role of the graphene template and oxygen with regard to the local
   structure of BN and its defect-related optical luminescence are
   investigated using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and
   X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL). The structure and bonding of
   B, N, C and O in different chemical environments before and after
   oxidation are revealed by XANES. It is found that B and N atoms tend to
   form large BN domains, whereas the formation of B-C or N-C bonding is
   not significant. Two types of O local structures are found under
   different oxidation temperatures, as revealed by XANES: moderate
   oxidation results in O substituting N, while B2O3-like local structure
   is formed under higher oxidation temperature. The two types of O-related
   defects exhibit different luminescence properties.}},

Abstract = {{This review focuses on the modeling of articular cartilage (at the
   tissue level), chondrocyte mechanobiology (at the cell level) and a
   combination of both in a multiscale computation scheme. The primary
   objective is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of
   conventional models implemented to study the mechanics of the articular
   cartilage tissue and chondrocytes. From monophasic material models as
   the simplest form to more complicated multiscale theories, these
   approaches have been frequently used to model articular cartilage and
   have contributed significantly to modeling joint mechanics, addressing
   and resolving numerous issues regarding cartilage mechanics and
   function. It should be noted that attentiveness is important when using
   different modeling approaches, as the choice of the model limits the
   applications available. In this review, we discuss the conventional
   models applicable to some of the mechanical aspects of articular
   cartilage such as lubrication, swelling pressure and chondrocyte
   mechanics and address some of the issues associated with the current
   modeling approaches. We then suggest future pathways for a more
   realistic modeling strategy as applied for the simulation of the
   mechanics of the cartilage tissue using multiscale and parallelized
   finite element method.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The perceived orientation of objects, gravity, and the body are biased
   to the left. Whether this leftward bias is attributable to biases in
   sensing or processing vestibular, visual, and body sense cues has never
   been assessed directly. The orientation in which characters are most
   easily recognized-the perceived upright (PU)-can be well predicted from
   a weighted vector sum of these sensory cues. A simple form of this model
   assumes that the directions of the contributing inputs are coded
   accurately and as a consequence participants tilted left- or
   right-side-down relative to gravity should exhibit mirror symmetric
   patterns of responses. If a left/right asymmetry were present then
   varying these sensory cues could be used to assess in which sensory
   modality or modalities a PU bias may have arisen. Participants completed
   the Oriented Character Recognition Test (OCHART) while manipulating body
   posture and visual orientation cues relative to gravity. The response
   patterns showed systematic differences depending on which side they were
   tilted. An asymmetry of the PU was found to be best modeled by adding a
   leftward bias of 5.6 degrees to the perceived orientation of the body
   relative to its actual orientation relative to the head. The asymmetry
   in the effect of body orientation is reminiscent of the body-defined
   left-leaning asymmetry in the perceived direction of light coming from
   above and reports that people tend to adopt a right-leaning posture.}},

Abstract = {{Droplet impact cooling has been shown to be a promising method for high
   heat flux removal applications. Recent experimental studies have
   revealed that even higher heat transfer at low mass fluxes and low Weber
   number can be achieved with only few degrees of superheat. In the
   present work, mono-dispersed droplet cooling of a horizontal upward
   facing heated surface was investigated at low Weber numbers. The impact
   velocity and frequency of free falling stream of droplets were varied
   through changing the gap between the heated surface and tip of different
   capillaries, and by variation of the volumetric flow rate (0.5-4.8
   cc/min). The impact velocity and droplet frequency were varied between
   0.28-1.3 m/s and 0.5-5 Hz, respectively, using four different
   capillaries sized between 17 g and 22g. The coolant was 25 degrees C
   deionized water and all the experiments were performed at atmospheric
   pressure. The time-averaged two-phase characteristic curves were
   obtained up to the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) regime. Through the
   extensive set of experiments, two separate correlations are proposed to
   predict the average CHFs based on the Weber in the range between 3-10
   and 10-100, and Strouhal number ranged in the range between 6.35 x
   10(-3) and 3.88 x 10(-2) and 1.81 x 10(-3) and 3.86 x 10(-2),
   respectively. The correlation predicts the average CHFs in both regions
   with absolute errors less than 20\% and 25\%, respectively. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Fast and high-performance computation of finite-field arithmetic is
   crucial for elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) over binary extension
   fields. In this brief, we propose a highly parallel scheme to speed up
   the point multiplication for high-speed hardware implementation of ECC
   cryptoprocessor on Koblitz curves. We slightly modify the addition
   formulation in order to employ four parallel finite-field multipliers in
   the data flow. This reduces the latency of performing point addition and
   speeds up the overall point multiplication. To the best of our
   knowledge, the proposed data flow of point addition has the lowest
   latency in comparison to the counterparts available in the literature.
   To make the cryptoprocessor more efficient, we employ a low-complexity
   and efficient digit-level Gaussian normal basis multiplier to perform
   lower level finite-field multiplications. Finally, we have implemented
   our proposed architecture for point multiplication on an Altera Stratix
   II field-programmable gate array and obtained the results of timing and

Title = {{Experimental characterization of contaminants in engine lubricants using
   surface plasmon resonance sensing}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL LUBRICATION AND TRIBOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-68}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop new knowledge in
   experimental characterization of contaminants in engine lubricants,
   using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing that can be applicable for
   on-line condition monitoring of lubricant quality and engine component
   performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - The effect of change in optical properties
   (e.g. transparency, absorption, and refractive index) of engine
   lubricants caused by the introduction of contaminants, such as gasoline,
   coolant, and water, on the surface plasmon resonance characteristics is
   analyzed experimentally. In SPR measurement, variations in both the
   refractive index and absorption cause changes in the SPR curve, which is
   the dependence of reflectivity vs incidence angle. The SPR
   characteristics (e.g. refractivity) of engine lubricant contaminated by
   gasoline, water and coolant at different concentration are measured as a
   function of resonance angle and analyzed with respect to different
   concentration (1\%-10\%) of contaminants. Also, pattern recognition
   analysis between fresh and used engine lubricants is performed, to show
   applicability of Bayesian classification methodology for on-line
   monitoring and predicting engine lubricant condition.
   Findings - It was shown experimentally that attenuation of surface
   plasmons due to introduction of contaminants to the engine lubricant
   leads to a noticeable change in resonance angle and reflectivity minimum
   of the SPR curve due to an increase in the dielectric permittivity. In
   addition, the changes in the SPR characteristics were observed between
   fresh and used engine lubricant, causing resonance angle and
   reflectivity minimum of the SPR curve to shift.
   Practical implications - The knowledge generated in this study lays the
   informational basis to further develop an on-line system for engine
   lubricant condition monitoring using miniaturized SPR sensors fully
   suitable for on board applications.
   Originality/value - SPR characterization is originally applied for
   analysis of optical properties of engine lubricants caused by the
   introduction of contaminants, such as gasoline, coolant, and water.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of wastewater and mixed liquor characteristics on membrane

   distribution were observed among the four types of wastewaters and mixed
   liquors. Differences in wastewater and mixed liquor characteristics were
   correlated to the changes in membrane filtration behavior in both
   systems. The colloidal content in feed and mixed liquor plays a dominant
   role and is more important than the quantity of total suspended solids
   in controlling membrane fouling. The ratio of proteins to
   polysaccharides is more important than the total quantity of soluble
   organic substances in controlling membrane fouling. A full

Abstract = {{This paper studies integrated simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal

   reactor (CFBBR) operated with an anoxic-aerobic bioparticle

   evaluate the aquatic Oligochaete worm effect. Long-term (200 days)
   performance showed that stable and high-rate chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) with sodium acetate as the carbon source and total nitrogen (NH4Cl
   as nitrogen source) conversions were achieved simultaneously, with low
   sludge production of 0.082 g VSS (volatile suspended solids) g COD-1 at
   pseudo-steady-state. Worm predation, which causes considerable sludge
   reduction of the bioparticle process, was studied. The results proved
   that the worm predation has a significant impact on the
   pseudo-steady-state performance of the CFBBR, decreasing biomass yield,
   decreasing oxygen concentration and increasing expanded bed height. (C)

   corresponding energy efficiencies. Thus, the energy efficiencies are
   found to be 21.33\%, 23.59\%, 24.28\% and 26.52\%; the exergy

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A one-step, easy to scale-up, continuous process was developed to
   catalytically convert bio-ethanol into 1-butanol and 1-hexanol as
   chemicals or fuels, as well as some other compounds that are also useful
   as biogasoline. The process is novel as it employs ethanol at its
   sub-and supercritical states. The reactions were performed in a
   continuous-flow fixed-bed tubular reactor with gamma-alumina supported
   Ni catalysts at 135-300 degrees C at a weight hourly space velocity of
   6.4-15.6 h(-1) using neat ethanol. The process at 250 degrees C and 176
   bar with an 8\% Ni/gamma-alumina catalyst led to ethanol conversion of
   35\%, with the highest selectivity of approximately 62\% and 21\%
   towards 1-butanol and 1-hexanol, respectively. In addition to 1-butanol
   and 1-hexanol, other minor biogasoline components such as butanal, and
   2-pentanone, etc. were also synthesized from this process. The catalyst
   was found active for 18 h on stream in this study, and the regenerated

Title = {{Triggered degradation of poly(ester amide)s via cyclization of pendant
   functional groups of amino acid monomers}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1969-1982}},
Abstract = {{Poly(ester amide)s (PEAs) are of interest for a diverse range of
   applications as their structures and properties can be readily tuned
   through the incorporation of a wide variety of monomers. In this work,
   the incorporation of the amino acids L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB) and
   homocysteine (HCY) was investigated with the aim of imparting
   stimuli-responsive degradation properties to PEAs. First, small molecule
   model compounds were prepared and studied to demonstrate that upon
   revealing the pendant g-amine or g-thiol of DAB and HCY esters,
   intramolecular cyclizations to 5-membered lactams and thiolactones
   respectively were much more rapid than background ester hydrolysis.
   Subsequently, monomers containing these DAB and HCY self-immolative
   spacers were prepared and incorporated into PEAs such that cleavage of
   protecting groups on the pendant moieties by stimuli including acid and
   the reducing agent DTT induced cyclization reactions that directly
   cleaved esters in the PEA backbone. The degradation of these polymers
   both in solution and in films was studied, demonstrating
   stimuli-triggered degradation was more rapid than background polymer
   degradation. In addition, to demonstrate that the approach could be
   readily extended to various stimuli, a photochemically responsive PEA
   was prepared by simply changing the protecting group on the pendant
   amine. This intramolecular cyclization strategy involving pendant
   functional groups should therefore be useful for the development of a
   wide range of PEAs and other polymers for which it is desirable to
   initiate degradation under specified conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Biofuels are often presented as a contribution toward the solution of
   the problems related to the world's strong dependency on fossil fuels,
   such as greenhouse gas effects and urban pollution, in addition to being
   a way to support rural development. Biomass is the most important
   renewable energy source and the state of Amazon in Brazil, which is
   completely covered by the Amazon rainforest, has great potential as a
   source of biomass. The aim of this research was to study the conversion
   process of the seed residue of Amazon-tucuma (Astrocaryum aculeatum)
   into bio-oil by fast pyrolysis. The seed residue was ground and samples
   with a diameter smaller than 2 mm were pyrolyzed in a bubbling fluidized
   bed of inert silica sand. The residence time of gases was maintained at
   1.4s with the reactor temperatures ranging from 400 to 600 degrees C.
   All liquid and solid products generated during the process were weighed,
   analyzed, and characterized (HHV, GC-MS, ultimate analysis and ash
   mineral analysis). The produced bio-oil was a homogeneous fuel, with a
   maximum liquid yield of 60 wt\% at 500 degrees C, with a water-free high
   heating value (HHV) of 20.2 MJ/kg. The highest water-free HHV (30.5
   MJ/kg) was found at 550 degrees C, for which the liquid yield was around
   55 wt\%. The results demonstrated that there is a great potential for
   using the bio-oil from Amazon-tucuma for bio-fuel production in addition
   to the production of some high-value compounds, such as levoglucosan and
   guaiacol. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a standard replication approach for preparing
   transparent elastomeric conductors with single-walled carbon nanotubes

   liquid elastomers like polydimethylsiloxane on the SWCNT film, curing
   and peeling off the substrate. The replication strategy can produce
   elastic conductors with a flat or a desirable patterned surface. The
   resultant elastic conductors had excellent stability under repeated
   mechanical loading and stretchability up to 300\%. It retained
   conductance even after 10 tape tests. Using the SWCNT-inlaid stretchable
   conductors as electrodes, elastic capacitors were fabricated using a

Abstract = {{Hierarchical carbon encapsulated tin (Sn@C) embedded graphene nanosheet
   (GN) composites (Sn@C-GNs) have been successfully fabricated via a
   simple and scalable one-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) procedure.
   The GN supported Sn@C core-shell structures consist of a crystalline tin
   core, which is thoroughly covered by a carbon shell and more
   interestingly, extra voids are present between the carbon shell and the
   tin core. Synchrotron spectroscopy confirms that the metallic tin core
   is free of oxidation and the existence of charge redistribution transfer
   from tin to the carbonaceous materials of the shell, facilitating their
   intimate contact by chemical bonding and resultant lattice variation.
   The hybrid electrodes of this material exhibit a highly stable and
   reversible capacity together with an excellent rate capability, which
   benefits from the improved electrochemical properties of tin provided by
   the protective carbon matrix, voids and the flexible GN matrices.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), energy efficiency through passive building
   design strategies and sustainable construction practices have been
   highly prioritized in recent years. This paper presents a Boundary Layer
   Wind Tunnel study on wind-driven natural ventilation for a low-rise
   building at a model-testing scale of 1:20. The experiment consists of
   testing various size openings in a single wall, opposite side walls and
   adjacent side walls with and without portioning walls, with and without
   opening cover screens, with and without internal volume correction for
   36 different wind angles of attacks (unless symmetrical). For the size
   of the building and openings considered, the experimental analyses
   indicated that internal volume correction using velocity scaling was
   important, although this criterion could be relaxed for
   cross-ventilation with openings in opposite walls. The internal pressure
   due to cross-ventilation was 1.5-2.5 times higher for A(inlet)/A(outlet)
   > 1 compared with ratios A(inlet)/A(outlet) < 1. In general, the lower
   the opening ratio (or inlet to outlet ratio), the higher the pressure
   drop inside the building. For an equivalent opening ratio, openings on
   opposite-walls generated a higher pressure drop compared to openings on
   adjacent-walls. Room-partitioning significantly affected the
   distribution of internal pressures, and hence the pressure drop that
   favored the ventilation in each room for the considered partitioning
   case. In addition, the total discharge coefficient C-d\_total and the
   ventilation rate Q/(V(r)A) increased with an increase of the opening
   ratio. The inlet discharge coefficients obtained in this experiment
   ranged from 0.65 to 1.08, similar to the results of various early
   studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{LiFePO4 has attracted much attention as a potential cathode material for
   advanced lithium-ion batteries due to its superior thermal stability. In
   spite of this, LiFePO4 still suffers from fast capacity fading at high
   temperature and/or moisture-contaminated electrolyte. The influence of
   moisture and the detailed corrosion mechanism is still not clear. Here,
   for the first time, we present a direct visual observation of the
   surface corrosion process at olivine LiFePO4 stored in
   moisture-contaminated electrolyte, and found the direct relationship
   between iron dissolution and LiFePO4 corrosion. By using the LiFePO4
   ingot sample with a flat surface as model materials, iron dissolution
   and surface chemistry change can be clearly observed and identified by
   field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   time-of-flightsecondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), and X-ray
   absorption near-edge structure (XANES). These iron dissolutions at some
   corrosion sites evoked the overall LiFePO4 surface corrosion. A
   significant improvement of the surface stability of LiFePO4 was obtained
   by nano-carbon coating, and the carbon surface layer protects LiFePO4
   from direct contact with corrosive medium, effectively restraining the
   surface corrosion and preserving the initial surface chemistry of
   LiFePO4.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer cross-linking was explored as an approach for increasing the
   relaxivity of macromolecular contrast agents for magnetic resonance
   imaging. Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate,
   N-(2-aminoethyl) methacrylamide hydrochloride, and the cross-linker
   ethylene glycol dimethacrylate were copolymerized under free radical
   conditions. By tuning the cross-linker content and reaction
   concentration, it was possible to obtain 10 nm nanogels in a single
   synthetic step. The pendant amine moieties were functionalized with an
   isothiocyanate derivative of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)
   and Gd(III) was chelated. In comparison with a linear control polymer
   prepared under the same conditions in the absence of the cross-linking
   agent, the nanogel contrast agent did exhibit enhanced relaxivity with
   an r(1) of 20.8 +/- 0.2 at 20 MHz and 17.5 +/- 0.4 at 60 MHz
   (corresponding to the clinical field strength of 1.5 T). The nuclear
   magnetic resonance dispersion profile was modeled to demonstrate that
   the enhanced relaxivity was a result of the nanogel agent's increased
   rotational correlation time, that is proposed to result from the
   constraint on motion imparted by the cross-linking. T-1 weighted imaging
   in mice showed enhanced contrast and vascular circulation for the
   nanogel relative to Gd(III)-DTPA (Magnevist) demonstrating the future
   promise of these new agents.}},

Abstract = {{Since the late 1990s, the use of nano zero valent iron (nZVI) for
   groundwater remediation has been investigated for its potential to
   reduce subsurface contaminants such as PCBs, chlorinated solvents, and
   heavy metals. nZVI shows tremendous promise in the environmental sector
   due to its high reactivity and as such, numerous laboratory and field
   studies have been performed to assess its effectiveness. This paper
   reviews the current knowledge of nZVI/bimetallic technology as it
   pertains to subsurface remediation of chlorinated solvents and heavy
   metals. The manuscript provides background on the technology,
   summarizing nZVI reactions with chlorinated solvents and metals, and
   examines the factors affecting nZVI reactivity. Studies on subsurface
   transport of bare and coated nZVI particles are also reviewed and
   challenges with field implementation are discussed. This manuscript
   offers a comprehensive review of nZVI technology and highlights the work
   still needed to optimize it for subsurface remediation. (C) 2012

Title = {{Wettability contrasts between fresh and weathered diesel fuels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{46-57}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The remediation of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminated sites is
   impeded due to subsurface complexities, including wettability.
   Wettability quantifies which of two immiscible fluids preferentially
   coats a solid. At most contaminated sites water-wetting conditions are
   typically assumed despite mounting evidence that this is not always the
   case. In this study, wettability was examined for two NAPL samples of
   contrasting origin: a fresh and a field sample. Wettability was assessed
   through (i) cyclical, `cumulative elapsed contact time' intrinsic
   contact angle measurements, (ii) interface jar tests, and (iii)
   cyclical, pseudo-static capillary pressure-saturation curves. The work
   as a whole demonstrated that while the fresh diesel sample was
   consistently water-wet, the field diesel sample exhibited repeatable
   cycles of wettability reversal between water drainage and imbibition.
   And while wettability hysteresis increased with contact time for the
   field diesel, the occurrence of wettability reversal at each change of
   saturation direction was independent of contact time. Such behavior is
   not easily assessed by standard wettability indices. Moreover, it
   contrasts with the permanent wettability alteration observed for complex
   organics (e.g., coal tar) observed in most studies. It is hypothesized
   that the cyclical wettability reversal is related to cyclical changes in
   intermediate pore wettability due to sorption of surface active
   compounds (causing NAPL-wetting imbibition) and rupturing of the soil
   grain water film (causing water-wet drainage). The wettability
   differences between the two NAPLs may be due to additives (i.e., a
   surfactant) in the original formulation and/or byproducts from
   subsurface weathering. These results support better characterization of
   site-specific wettability, improved model development and more realistic
   site conceptual models for improved remediation efforts. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper considers the consensus problem of double integrator
   multi-agent systems where: (i) each agent is subject to input
   saturations, and (ii) the velocity (second state) of each agent is not

   simultaneously the above mentioned situations. Sufficient conditions are
   derived such that consensus algorithms developed for first- and
   second-order multi-agent systems in ideal situations can be used to
   account for input saturations and remove the requirement of velocity
   measurements. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
   we propose solutions to two different second-order consensus problems in
   the case where the input is saturated and the velocity states are not
   available for feedback and simulation results are provided in each case.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a high-performance complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager with a new
   analog-to-digital-converter (ADC) scheme. The new ADC scheme, adopting
   the visual perception of human eyes, has realized a maximal 13 bit
   variable resolution and reduced clipped noise for imaging. The response
   probability of human eyes to a flashlight falls in the region of {[}-1 +
   sigma, 1 - sigma] of a normal distribution, where s is the standard
   deviation. In the region effective to human eyes {[}-1 + sigma, 1 -
   sigma], there exists a point corresponding to a maximum 13 bit variable
   resolution to improve the image quality and to save the power
   consumption and the chip size of sensors. The new ADC architecture uses
   an adjustable reference at both the top and bottom of the series of
   nonuniform resistors to reduce the clipped noise and to provide a wide
   dynamic range to image sensors. Based on reports of similar device
   design in the literature, this paper is particularly related to
   achieving a higher performance without increasing the chip size and
   power consumption. UXGA CMOS sensors with the newly developed ADC scheme
   are fabricated by the 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The test results show
   improved image quality compared to typical CMOS products with a linear
   ADC. Test results also show 79-dB signal-to-noise ratio (at gain = 0 dB)
   with a power consumption of 90 mW at 54 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles (FMNPs) with a core-shell structure
   are synthesized through a one-pot chemical method followed by the
   bioconjugation of gentamycin (Gm). The average diameter of the FMNPs is
   estimated to be 65 +/- 8 nm. The results of transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy
   (XANES), and fluorospectrometry indicate that the FMNPs consist of a
   Fe3O4 core and a fluorescent silica (SiO2) shell. The FMNPs show typical
   superparamagnetic properties with a blocking temperature (T-B) of 120 K.
   We demonstrate that gentamicin (Gm)-bioconjugated FMNPs can capture
   gram-negative bacteria, i.e. E. coli, (1 x 10(7) CFU mL(-1) from 10 mL
   of solution) within 20 min. TEM micrographs clearly show that the
   Gm-FMNPs disrupt the cell wall of E. coli prior to the lysis of E. coli
   as the interaction time (t) increases; whereas FMNPs without Gm are
   inert towards E. coli. In addition, the Gm-FMNPs are able to detect
   diluted E. coli cells at a concentration as low as 1 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1),
   which is revealed by a slight red-shift in fluorescent emissions from
   517 nm to 528 nm along with a dramatic decrease in intensity. The
   Gm-conjugated FMNPs can be a multifunctional platform for simultaneous
   rapid capture, sensitive detection, and decontamination of bacteria.}},

Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Torsional response for one-way or two-way asymmetric linear/nonlinear
   structural systems under uni- and bidirectional seismic excitations
   increases the maximum displacement demand on structural systems. In this
   study, we consider instantaneous load eccentricities caused by the
   motion of the center of mass. The eccentricities, which are time
   dependent, exist even for linear elastic two-way symmetric structures
   under seismic excitations, as the relative displacement between the
   center of mass and center of stiffness may not necessarily be
   negligible. The quantification of this second-order effect on structural
   response is not available in the literature. Equations are developed and
   some numerical results are obtained by incorporating this second-order
   effect for linear elastic structures under bidirectional excitations to
   quantify the importance of this phenomenon. The results obtained by
   considering more than 100 ground motion records suggest that, on
   average, an underestimation of seismic displacement demand can occur if
   this second-order effect is ignored, especially for two-way symmetrical
   systems. The degree of underestimation depends on the dynamic
   characteristics of the system and the record. DOI:

Abstract = {{Objective: To test the hypothesis that a custom-fit valgus knee brace
   and custom-made lateral wedge foot orthotic will have greatest effects
   on decreasing the external knee adduction moment during gait when used
   concurrently.
   Design: Proof-of-concept, single test session, crossover trial.
   Setting: Biomechanics laboratory within a tertiary care center.
   Participants: Patients (n=16) with varus alignment and knee
   osteoarthritis (OA) primarily affecting the medial compartment of the
   tibiofemoral joint (yarns gonarthrosis).
   Interventions: Custom-fit valgus knee brace and custom-made full-length
   lateral wedge foot orthotic. Amounts of valgus angulation and wedge
   height were tailored to each patient to ensure comfort.
   Main Outcome Measures: The external knee adduction moment (\% body
   weight {[}BW]{*}height {[}Ht]), frontal plane lever arm (cm), and ground
   reaction force (N/kg), determined from 3-dimensional gait analysis
   completed under 4 randomized conditions: (1) control (no knee brace, no
   foot orthotic), (2) knee brace, (3) foot orthotic, and (4) knee brace
   and foot orthotic.
   Results: The reduction in knee adduction moment was greatest when
   concurrently using the knee brace and foot orthotic (effect sizes ranged
   from 0.3 to 0.4). The mean decrease in first peak knee adduction moment
   compared with control was .36\% BW{*}Ht (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], -.66 to -.07). This was accompanied by a mean decrease in
   frontal plane lever arm of .59cm (95\% CI, -.94 to -.25).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that using a custom-fit knee brace
   and custom-made foot orthotic concurrently can produce a greater overall
   reduction in the knee adduction moment, through combined effects in
   decreasing the frontal plane lever arm. Archives of Physical Medicine

Abstract = {{Geometry-based errors constitute a special category of CAM-originated
   machining inaccuracies that significantly influence the precision of
   five-axis surface machining operations. Geometry-based errors reflect
   the inability of the cutter to accurately trace a prescribed 3D tool
   path in five-axis machining. Their magnitude constitutes an overlapped
   effect of the adopted interpolation scheme, cutter, and surface
   geometries, as well as kinematics of the five-axis machine tool, assumed
   free of errors by the CAM software. Although the presence of these
   errors is inherent in the current configuration of five-axis computer
   numerically controlled machining systems, little efforts were made so
   far towards their reduction. In this regard, the present study has
   investigated the magnitude of geometry-based errors as generated by
   various 5D interpolation schemes. These enhanced interpolation functions
   were determined by enforcing better approximations of the ideal machine
   control coordinate (MCC) trajectory as calculated in five-axis machine
   tool's joint space. By comparing the geometry-based errors generated by
   the enhanced 5D interpolation schemes with linear interpolation
   baseline, it was found that significant error reductions will be
   obtained when synchronized 5D quadratic functions are used to
   approximate the ideal MCC curve in joint space. Moreover, the parametric
   synchronization between rotational and translational machine tool
   motions represents an essential requirement for limitation of the amount
   of geometry-based errors.}},

Title = {{Automated IMRT planning with regional optimization using planning

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{176-191}},
Abstract = {{Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has become a standard
   technique in radiation therapy for treating different types of cancers.
   Various class solutions have been developed for simple cases (e.g.,
   localized prostate, whole breast) to generate IMRT plans efficiently.
   However, for more complex cases (e.g., head and neck, pelvic nodes), it
   can be time-consuming for a planner to generate optimized IMRT plans. To
   generate optimal plans in these more complex cases which generally have
   multiple target volumes and organs at risk, it is often required to have
   additional IMRT optimization structures such as dose limiting ring
   structures, adjust beam geometry, select inverse planning objectives and
   associated weights, and additional IMRT objectives to reduce cold and
   hot spots in the dose distribution. These parameters are generally
   manually adjusted with a repeated trial and error approach during the
   optimization process. To improve IMRT planning efficiency in these more
   complex cases, an iterative method that incorporates some of these
   adjustment processes automatically in a planning script is designed,
   implemented, and validated. In particular, regional optimization has
   been implemented in an iterative way to reduce various hot or cold spots
   during the optimization process that begins with defining and automatic
   segmentation of hot and cold spots, introducing new objectives and their
   relative weights into inverse planning, and turn this into an iterative
   process with termination criteria. The method has been applied to three
   clinical sites: prostate with pelvic nodes, head and neck, and anal
   canal cancers, and has shown to reduce IMRT planning time significantly
   for clinical applications with improved plan quality. The IMRT planning
   scripts have been used for more than 500 clinical cases.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to examine the air flow behavior in
   the channel of a transpired air collector under different heating
   conditions. Velocity fields were measured using Particle Image
   Velocimetry (Ply). Mean velocities and turbulent properties were
   computed and evaluated. Results show that at high flow rates, the flow
   was dominated by forced convection while at the lowest flow rate the
   flow was primarily buoyancy driven, where buoyancy-induced stabilities
   and heating effects were strongest. It was observed that the
   buoyancy-induced instabilities enhanced the magnitude and modified the
   structure of mean and turbulent properties as compared to the unheated
   flow. The flow rate influenced the relative magnitudes of the normalized
   mean and turbulent velocities that were enhanced with a decrease in the
   flow rate at a given heating condition. Collector efficiencies up to
   70\% were observed, which could be attributed to the corrugation surface
   geometry that enhanced turbulence and provided a larger heat transfer
   surface area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For a functionally graded (FG) circular cylinder loaded by uniform
   pressures on the inner and the outer surfaces and Young's modulus
   varying in the radial direction, we find lower and upper bounds for
   Young's modulus of the energetically equivalent homogeneous cylinder.
   That is, the strain energies of the FG and the homogeneous cylinders are
   equal to each other. For a typical power law variation of Young's
   modulus in the FG cylinder, it is shown that taking only two series
   terms, yields good values for bounds of the equivalent modulus. We also
   study two inverse problems. First, an investigation is made to find the
   radial variation of Young's modulus in the FG cylinder, having a
   constant Poisson's ratio, that gives the maximum value of the equivalent
   modulus. Second, the complementary problem of finding the radial
   variation of Poisson's ratio in the FG cylinder, having a constant
   stiffness, that gives the maximum value of the equivalent modulus, is
   considered. It is found that the spatial variation of the elastic
   properties, that maximizes the equivalent modulus, depends strongly upon
   the external loading on the cylinder.}},

Title = {{3D image-guided robotic needle positioning system for small animal
   interventions}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This paper presents the design of a micro-CT guided small
   animal robotic needle positioning system. In order to simplify the
   robotic design and maintain a small targeting error, a novel
   implementation of the remote center of motion is used in the system. The
   system has been developed with the objective of achieving a mean
   targeting error of <200 mu m while maintaining a high degree of user
   friendliness.
   Methods: The robot is compact enough to operate within a 25 cm diameter
   micro-CT bore. Small animals can be imaged and an intervention performed
   without the need to transport the animal from one workspace to another.
   Not requiring transport of the animal reduces opportunities for targets
   to shift from their localized position in the image and simplifies the
   workflow of interventions. An improved method of needle calibration is
   presented that better characterizes the calibration using the position
   of the needle tip in photographs rather than the needle axis. A
   calibration fixture was also introduced, which dramatically reduces the
   time requirements of calibration while maintaining calibration accuracy.
   Two registration modes have been developed to correspond the robot
   coordinate system with the coordinate system of the micro-CT scanner.
   The two registration modes offer a balance between the time required to
   complete a registration and the overall registration accuracy. The
   development of slow high accuracy and fast low accuracy registration
   modes provides users with a degree of flexibility in selecting a
   registration mode best suited for their application.
   Results: The target registration error (TRE) of the higher accuracy
   primary registration was TREprimary = 31 +/- 12 mu m. The error in the
   lower accuracy combined registration was TREcombined = 139 +/- 63 mu m.
   Both registration modes are therefore suitable for small-animal needle
   interventions. The targeting accuracy of the robotic system was
   characterized using targeting experiments in tissue-mimicking gelatin
   phantoms. The results of the targeting experiments were combined with
   the known calibration and needle deflection errors to provide a more
   meaningful measure of the needle positioning accuracy of the system. The
   combined targeting errors of the system were 149 +/- 41 mu m and 218 +/-
   38 mu m using the primary and combined registrations, respectively.
   Finally, pilot in vivo experiments were successfully completed to
   demonstrate the performance of the system in a biomedical application.
   Conclusions: The device was able to achieve the desired performance with
   an error of <200 mu m and improved repeatability when compared to other
   designs. The device expands the capabilities of image-guided
   interventions for preclinical biomedical applications. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of an analytical support system for
   implementation of the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)
   process. The system integrates four analytical tools: (i) geographic
   information system; (ii) system dynamics simulation; (iii) agent-based
   model; and (iv) hydrologic simulation. The choice of tools is driven by
   their ability to (a) respond to the main requirements of the IWRM and
   (b) explicitly describe system behaviour as function of time and
   location in space. The system dynamics simulation captures temporal
   dynamics in an integrated feedback model that includes sectors
   representing physical and socioeconomic system components. Management
   policies established in the participatory decision making environment
   are easily investigated through the simulation of system behaviour.
   Agent-based model is used to analyze spatial dynamics of complex
   physical-social-economic-biologic system. The IWRM support system is
   tested using data from the Upper Thames River Watershed, Ontario,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-51}},
Abstract = {{Therapeutic angiogenesis is a new revascularization strategy involving
   the administration of growth factors to induce new vessel formation. The
   biology and delivery of angiogenic growth factors involved in vessel
   formation have been extensively studied but success in translating the
   angiogenic capacity of growth factors into benefits for vascular disease
   patients is still limited. This could be attributed to issues related to
   patient selection, growth factor delivery methods or lack of vessel
   maturation. Comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular
   cross-talk during the different stages of vascular development is needed
   for the design of efficient therapeutic strategies. The presentation of
   angiogenic factors either in series or in parallel using a strategy that
   mimics physiological events, such as concentration and spatio-temporal
   profiles, is an immediate requirement for functional blood vessel
   formation. This review provides an overview of the recent delivery
   strategies of angiogenic factors and discusses targeting neovascular
   maturation as a promising approach to induce stable and functional
   vessels for therapeutic angiogenesis. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{Purpose: To perform a rigorous technological assessment and statistical
   validation of a software technology for anatomic delineations of the
   prostate on MRI datasets.
   Methods and Materials: A 3-phase validation strategy was used. Phase I
   consisted of anatomic atlas building using 100 prostate cancer MRI data
   sets to provide training data sets for the segmentation algorithms. In
   phase II, 2 experts contoured 15 new MRI prostate cancer cases using 3
   approaches (manual, N points, and region of interest). In phase III, 5
   new physicians with variable MRI prostate contouring experience
   segmented the same 15 phase II datasets using 3 approaches: manual, N
   points with no editing, and full autosegmentation with user editing
   allowed. Statistical analyses for time and accuracy (using Dice
   similarity coefficient) endpoints used traditional descriptive
   statistics, analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and pooled
   Student t test.
   Results: In phase I, average (SD) total and per slice contouring time
   for the 2 physicians was 228 (75), 17 (3.5), 209 (65), and 15 seconds
   (3.9), respectively. In phase II, statistically significant differences
   in physician contouring time were observed based on physician, type of
   contouring, and case sequence. The N points strategy resulted in
   superior segmentation accuracy when initial autosegmented contours were
   compared with final contours. In phase III, statistically significant
   differences in contouring time were observed based on physician, type of
   contouring, and case sequence again. The average relative timesaving for
   N points and autosegmentation were 49\% and 27\%, respectively, compared
   with manual contouring. The N points and autosegmentation strategies
   resulted in average Dice values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. Pre- and
   postedited autosegmented contours demonstrated a higher average Dice
   similarity coefficient of 0.94.
   Conclusion: The software provided robust contours with minimal editing
   required. Observed time savings were seen for all physicians
   irrespective of experience level and baseline manual contouring speed.

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{719-724}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biodiesel has become increasingly important over the past decade due to
   the dwindling of the planet's petroleum reserves. In addition, using
   biodiesel as a fuel is not only more economically favorable, but also
   provides a greater energy return and therefore higher efficiency. The
   transesterification of canola oil by using various heterogeneous
   catalysts was scrutinized in this study. After conducting preliminary
   tests by utilizing a condenser/refluxer apparatus, it was determined
   that highly ordered mesoporous silicate catalyst, namely SBA-15
   impregnated with cesium provided maximum biodiesel yield. The effects of
   different methanol to oil ratios (20: 1 and 40: 1), different reaction
   times (3-24 h), amount of catalyst (100-200 mg), and reaction
   temperatures (65-135 degrees C) were studied to achieve the highest
   conversion. Increasing the reaction temperature by utilizing a
   pressurized batch stirred-tank reactor was the most important factor
   contributing to the yield of biodiesel (1.05\% compared to 25.35\%).
   Moreover, the ratio of methanol to oil also seemed to be a limiting
   variable as experimental trials employing ratios of 40: 1 consistently
   resulted in high quality biodiesel. The optimized condition was found to
   be within the pressurized reactor (therefore allowing a temperature of
   135 degrees C) at a high methanol to oil ratio (40: 1), high reaction
   time (5 h) and low amount of catalyst (100 mg) providing biodiesel yield

Abstract = {{Various current differential based protection approaches are applied to
   detect and discriminate the internal/external faults in phase shifting
   transformer (PST). The differential current measuring principle is the
   one that distinguishes these approaches. These approaches exploit PST
   unique design to propose the differential current measuring principle
   that presents magnetically couple circuit, electrically connected
   circuit or compensated currents entering and leaving the zone of PST.
   In addition to the traditional challenges, PST brings new challenges to
   the biased differential protection. This paper presents a comparative
   performance analysis between various differential current measuring
   principles associated with PST. Old and new approaches are reviewed
   first followed by the detail performance analysis. Simulation studies
   are performed in the real time digital simulator (RTDS) and PSCAD/EMTDC.
   The results of the analysis identify the limitations of these approaches
   and suggest new research directions for the protection of nonstandard
   transformers like PST.}},

Abstract = {{Use Case Points (UCP) is a well-known method to estimate the project
   size, based on Use Case diagram, at early phases of software
   development. Although the Use Case diagram is widely accepted as a
   de-facto model for analyzing object oriented software requirements over
   the world, UCP method did not take sufficient amount of attention
   because, as yet, there is no consensus on how to produce software effort
   from UCP. This paper aims to study the potential of using Fuzzy Model
   Tree to derive effort estimates based on UCP size measure using a
   dataset collected for that purpose. The proposed approach has been
   validated against Treeboost model, Multiple Linear Regression and
   classical effort estimation based on the UCP model. The obtained results
   are promising and show better performance than those obtained by
   classical UCP, Multiple Linear Regression and slightly better than those

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) relies on the computation distributed
   over the environment to simplify the tasks performed by its users. A
   smart space is an instance of a ubiquitous environment, composed of a
   dynamic and heterogeneous set of devices that interact to support the
   execution of distributed smart applications. In this context, mobile
   devices provide new resources when they join the environment, which
   disappear when they leave it. This introduces the challenge of
   self-adaptation, in which smart applications may either include new
   resources as they become available or replace them when they become
   unavailable. Ubiquitous games combine ubicomp and computer game
   technologies to enrich user's experience and fun. Such games may benefit
   from different input and output resources offered by mobile devices. To
   support the development and deployment of ubiquitous games, this work
   presents the uOS middleware. Using a DSOA (Device Service Oriented
   Architecture) based architecture and lightweight service discovery
   protocols, uOS ensures compatibility among resources, providing resource
   rerouting between heterogeneous and limited software and hardware
   platforms. The uMoleHunt game is presented to illustrate the practical
   application of uOS.}},

Abstract = {{We consider physical layer multicasting in an amplify-and-forward
   multi-antenna relay network. Assuming each relay antenna has individual
   power budget, our objective is to design the relay processing matrix to
   minimize the maximum individual antenna power for a given received SNR
   target at each destination. As the problem is NP-hard, we propose an
   approximate solution by solving the problem in the Lagrange dual domain.
   Through this Lagrange dual approach, we reveal a prominent structure,
   which enables us to derive a semi-closed form expression for the relay
   processing matrix that depends on a set of dual variables. These dual
   variables can be determined through an efficient semi-definite
   programming formulation. Compared with the traditional semi-definite
   relaxation (SDR) approach, the proposed solution has much lower
   computational complexity. Furthermore, it produces the optimal solution
   if such solution can be extracted from the SDR approach. Thus, the
   proposed solution can serve as a good alternative to the SDR approach,
   for the performance and complexity trade-off.}},

Abstract = {{In cooperative communications, spatial channel diversity introduced by
   scattered locations of cooperating nodes can be exploited to enhance
   transmission security. In this paper, we propose a secure cooperative
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission scheme
   with the help of multiple relay nodes. For each relay, the wireless
   channels related to the destination and the eavesdropper are independent
   of each other, leading to different achievable rates over each
   subcarrier. In the proposed scheme, relay nodes with high rate
   differences between the intended receiver and the eavesdropper are
   selected for transmission. Different cooperation strategies ranging from
   single-relay selection to per-subcarrier-based multiple-relay selection
   are studied and compared. As a result of relay selection, each
   cooperative relay node only forwards a subset of subcarriers that
   exhibits high capacity differences, thereby enhancing transmission
   security of the whole system. Secrecy outage probabilities for the
   proposed scheme with different relay selection strategies are
   formulated. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the validity of the
   scheme for security enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{In cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks, the system
   performance over multipath channels is impacted by both
   frequency-selective fading and delay spread. However, most relay
   selection (RS) schemes choose the best relay node only based on the
   channel gain while ignoring the delay spread effect on the performance.
   If orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used in AF relay
   networks, the cyclic prefix (CP) length has to be extended to tolerate
   the accumulated delay spread from source via relay to destination due to
   the lack of the channel compensation at relay nodes. A long CP, which is
   the transmission overhead, redeces both the effective data transmission
   throughput and the overall system transmission efficiency. T herefore,
   an appropriate RS scheme in cooperation multiple-relay networks should
   not only enhance the overall transmission reliability but also minimize
   the relay overhead. To this end, we propose a variable-CP based RS
   scheme for AF relay networks to maximize the transmission efficiency by
   dynamically choosing the most suitable relay node. In the proposed
   scheme, a normalized effective throughput is defined as the selection
   criterion which depends on both the end-to-end channel gain and the
   accumulated delay spread. Based on this criterion, the best relay link
   is selected by achieving the trade-off between the transmission
   reliability and overhead. Both the theoretical analysis and simulation
   results show that when the channel delay spread varies, the proposed
   scheme can dramatically improve the the effective data transmission
   throughput compared to the maximum signal-to-noise-ratio schemes with
   variable/fixed CP.}},

Abstract = {{E-healthcare is an emerging and promising healthcare system to meet the
   increasing medical demand from aging population. It requires extensive
   data storage, pervasive data access, and reliable computing resources to
   support the real-time communication of critical health information and
   the real-time diagnosis. Recently, cloud computing, including public
   cloud and private cloud, with both scalability and accessibility is
   proposed to be integrated in the e-healthcare system. However, in
   meeting stringent medical requirements, private clouds lack necessary
   reliability, whereas public clouds suffer from communication delay. In
   this paper, we first introduce a cooperation framework to address the
   distinct challenger facing different clouds. It is inspired by the fact
   that private clouds are geographically deployed and public clouds can be
   regarded to possess infinite computing resources. In our framework,
   private clouds are designed to serve parts of local requests to public
   clouds, and rewarded by receiving help with excess requests. We adopt
   stochastic control theory to address the failure minimization issues for
   private clouds under random demand process. We prove the optimality of a
   policy constructed through recursion. Numerical and simulation results
   are presented to demonstrate that our proposed scheme can improve the
   reliability of private clouds, as well as reduce average delay of public
   clouds.}},

Abstract = {{The number of active users in a network is crucial for understanding the
   security level of wireless operating environments, since any node in a
   network could perform malicious attacks and be a potential threat. In
   this paper, we propose a novel estimation technique for the number of
   active users by exploiting a typical device fingerprint I/Q. imbalance,
   which has been identified as a device-specific hardware impairment. and
   can be utilized to distinguish different wireless devices. In the
   design, I/Q imbalance of a transmitter is first estimated from its
   transmitting signals. The estimate is then compared with the observed
   I/Q imbalances of previously identified users through a hypothesis
   testing, where the distances between the new estimate and previous
   observations are adopted as the test metric. If all the distances are
   larger than a properly selected threshold, a new active user is claimed.
   Finally, the number of active users is determined by counting all the
   distinct I/Q imbalances. Simulation results are provided to validate the
   proposed estimation scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, channel impulse response (CIR) based physical layer
   authentication has been studied to enhance the security of wireless
   communications. However, the reliability of CIR-based authentication is
   substantially reduced at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions due
   to the presence of communications noise, channel estimation error and
   mobility induced channel variation. To this end, we integrate additional
   multipath delay characteristics into the CIR-based physical layer
   authentication and propose a two dimensional quantization scheme to
   tolerate these random errors of CIRs for reduced false alarm rate and
   more reliable spoofing detection. Instead of directly comparing the
   estimated CIRs from different transmitters for authentication purpose,
   we first quantize the CIR estimates in two dimensions (i.e., the
   amplitude dimension and multipath delay dimension) and then
   differentiate transmitters based on the quantizer outputs with a binary
   hypothesis testing. More specifically, the quantization intervals are
   determined by using a searching algorithm based on a guaranteed miss
   probability of detection of the presence of spoofing attack. A
   logarithmic likelihood ratio test (LLRT) is used to evaluate the
   authentication performance, and a threshold with a constant value is
   used for the decision-making of authentication under the binary
   hypothesis testing. To verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithm,
   an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system is
   considered in our simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The success of cooperative communications hinges on the reliability of
   cooperating nodes between the communicating parties, which may not be
   guaranteed in realistic scenarios. To protect cooperative networks from
   selfish misbehaviors and malicious forwarding, a security mechanism
   monitoring various abnormal behaviors during cooperation is necessary
   because of the constantly changing network topology and variability of
   cooperating nodes. In this paper, based on the orthogonal time division
   protocol commonly used in cooperation, a misbehavior detection scheme is
   proposed for amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (OFDM) systems by introducing the time division
   duplexing (TDD) feature into the source node and exploiting the
   correlation properties between the transmitted and received signals.
   With the estimated amplification gain and noise power, two binary
   hypothesis tests are employed to detect power-reducing selfish behaviors
   and malicious jamming attacks respectively. Simulation results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in detecting
   different misbehaviors of cooperating nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the broadcast nature of wireless medium, wireless communication
   is extremely vulnerable to eavesdropping attack. Physical-layer security
   is emerging as a new paradigm to prevent the eavesdropper from
   interception by exploiting the physical characteristics of wireless
   channels, which has recently attracted a lot of research attentions. In
   this paper, we consider the physical-layer security in cooperative
   wireless networks with multiple decode-and-forward (DF) relays and
   investigate the best relay selection in the presence of eavesdropping
   attack. For the comparison purpose, we also examine the conventional
   direct transmission without relay and traditional max-min relay
   selection. We derive closed-form intercept probability expressions of
   the direct transmission, traditional max-min relay selection, and
   proposed best relay selection schemes in Rayleigh fading channels.
   Numerical results show that the proposed best relay selection scheme
   strictly outperforms the traditional direct transmission and max-min
   relay selection schemes in terms of intercept probability. In addition,
   as the number of relays increases, the intercept probabilities of both
   traditional max-min relay selection and proposed best relay selection
   schemes decrease significantly, showing the advantage of exploiting
   multiple relays against eavesdropping attack.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) system is widely recognized as
   an effective means to combat the effects of multi path fading in
   wireless communications. In this paper, we propose the use of chirp
   modulation technique in a MIMO system, as the modulated signals have
   inherent interference rejection capability and immunity against Doppler
   shift and fading due to multi path propagation. The performance of
   chirp-based MIMO system is examined using Monte Carlo simulations over
   Rayleigh fading channel. For example, it is shown that a simple 2 x 2
   MIMO system can offer a significant gain in performance relative to
   maximal ratio combining (MRC) using chirp modulation. Next, a multiuser
   MIMO (MU-MIMO) system is proposed, where each user is assigned a unique
   orthogonal chirp signal that efficiently modulates each user's incoming
   data as well as identifies them at the receiver. Numerical results show
   that chirp modulation is very effective in MU-MIMO system in eliminating
   the effects of multiple-access interference (MAI).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we identify and analyze the tradeoff between security and
   reliability for wireless communications in the presence of eavesdropping
   attack. Typically, we assume that both destination and the eavesdropper
   can only obtain channel state information with estimation errors,
   instead of perfect channel estimation predominantly assumed in the
   literature. Linear minimum mean-square error estimation (LMMSE) is
   performed and the expressions for data throughput of the main link and
   the wiretap link are derived considering estimation errors. Next the
   probability that an outage event occurs over the main link, named outage
   probability, is given to represent the reliability. Meanwhile, the
   probability that an eavesdropper succeeds in intercepting the source
   signal, called intercept probability, is found to measure the security.
   Based on these, the securityreliability tradeoff performance is analyzed
   and it is shown that the transmission security (reliability) can be
   improved by loosening the reliability (security) requirement.
   Simulations are then provided to corroborate the proposed studies.}},

   System Dynamics (SD) simulation approach to capture temporal dynamics of
   grasslands farming structure. The SD approach is particularly well
   suited for participatory modeling and involving stakeholders in the
   model development and simulation processes.
   In order to capture both spatial and temporal dimensions, this paper
   proposes a Spatial System Dynamics (SSD) approach. This approach is
   based on the strengths of system dynamics theory and geographical
   spatial modeling tools. The SSD approach links system dynamics (temporal
   simulation) and GIS (spatial analysis and visualization) software. For
   the purpose of this research, farm structural change is defined by the
   dynamics of farm size and farming intensity. These characteristics are
   considered in a conceptual SSD environment referred to as the two-farm
   structural dynamics (2FaSD) model.
   Currently the 2FaSD is a conceptual model, whereby physical farm size is
   considered part of a finite resources competition model. When farms
   change structure (physical expansion or reduction in farm size;
   intensification or deintensification of resources) they compete over
   grassland resources. The competition is driven by farmer preferences,
   managerial decisions, environmental conditions and economic situation.
   The 2FaSD model uses the SSD approach, which for this specific
   application requires a coupling technique to embed Vensim in ArcGIS. The
   anticipated model output includes a time-series of maps which
   graphically represent the changes of ownership structures in a two-farm
   system. This output is intended to provide decision support for
   agricultural planning and management strategies. The 2FaSD model is in
   the early development stage and the next major step is converting the
   model from causal loop form to an executable stock and flow simulation
   model. As the model is in its infancy stage, the 2FaSD model only models
   competition between two farms for the following reasons: ease of
   implementation, simplicity in concept demonstration and in anticipation
   of reduced simulation times. We foresee that the current 2FaSD model and
   methodology may be extended to consider additional farms in the
   grasslands competition model in the future. The current 2FaSD model
   structure has been developed based on assumptions specific to the
   grassland farming industry in Austria, however with minor modifications
   to the SD system structure, it is possible that the model could be
   adapted to simulate grassland farm structural changes in other areas of
   the world.}},

Abstract = {{The correct estimate of lateral earth pressure is important for the
   design of earth retaining structures. This study presents an
   investigation into the lateral earth pressure distribution on a wall and
   in particular the effect of arching at deeper levels of backfill for
   both at-rest and active conditions. Three-dimensional numerical
   simulations are performed using the ABAQUS finite element software. The
   effect of wall displacement. wall-backfill interaction, subsoil-wall
   interaction, subsoil-backlitl interaction, soil modulus and friction
   angle on the mobilization of an active condition are investigated. The
   results of these simulations indicate that the true lateral stress
   distribution on a wall is non-linear and backfill arching increases by
   wall displacement and backfill-subsoil friction while increasing
   friction between the backfill and wall or subsoil and wall has no
   substantial effect on arching. The results are further compared with
   those from physical model tests. An active state is mobilized at wall
   displacements smaller than those suggested by Terzaghi's physical model
   tests. By increasing backfill-subsoil friction and backfill stiffness,
   the active state is mobilized at smaller wall displacements.}},

Title = {{Modeling steady state SO2-dependent changes in capillary ATP
   concentration using novel O-2 micro-delivery methods}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is known to be released from the
   erythrocyte in an oxygen (O-2) dependent manner. Since ATP is a potent
   vasodilator, it is proposed to be a key regulator in the pathway that
   mediates micro-vascular response to varying tissue O-2 demand. We
   propose that ATP signaling mainly originates in the capillaries due to
   the relatively long erythrocyte transit times in the capillary and the
   short ATP diffusion distance to the electrically coupled endothelium. We
   have developed a computational model to investigate the effect of
   delivering or removing O-2 to limited areas at the surface of a tissue
   with an idealized parallel capillary array on total ATP concentration.
   Simulations were conducted when exposing full surface to perturbations
   in tissue O-2 tension (PO2) or locally using a circular micro-outlet
   (similar to 100 um in diameter), a square micro-slit (200 x 200um), or a
   rectangular micro-slit (1000 mu m wide x 200 mu m long). Results
   indicated the rectangular micro-slit has the optimal dimensions for
   altering hemoglobin saturations (SO2) in sufficient number capillaries
   to generate effective changes in total {[}ATP]. This suggests a
   threshold for the minimum number of capillaries that need to be
   stimulated in vivo by imposed tissue hypoxia to induce a conducted
   micro-vascular response. SO2 and corresponding {[}ATP] changes were also
   modeled in a terminal arteriole (9 mu m in diameter) that replaces 4
   surface capillaries in the idealized network geometry. Based on the
   results, the contribution of terminal arterioles to the net change in
   {[}ATP] in the micro-vascular network is minimal although they would
   participate as O-2 sources thus influencing the O-2 distribution. The
   modeling data presented here provide important insights into designing a
   novel micro-delivery device for studying micro-vascular O-2 regulation
   in the capillaries in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an optimal placement strategy for wearable inertial sensor
   placement on a human arm is presented with an ultimate goal of using a
   sensor cluster for epileptic seizure detection. The present study shows
   that the placement of sensors plays a significant role in achieving high
   sensing resolution. Employing the commercial package Motion Genesis
   (TM), a procedure is first developed to simulate the dynamic response
   when human body is under typical epileptic seizure episodes. The method
   uses Kane's method to obtain equations of motion and the resulting
   equations of motion are numerically solved using Matlab (TM) when the
   system is subjected to a prescribed seizure input. Simulation results
   give insights into influences of the neurological disorder on sensing in
   quantitative terms. Based on certain assumptions on the predicted
   quantitative measures of the response, optimal detection performance
   based on sensor location and number of sensors is proposed with
   particular emphasis on sensor resolution and noise. The optimization is
   carried out employing the genetic algorithm module of Mat lab global
   optimization toolbox to find the optimal placement of sensors to achieve
   least sensing noise in calculating the angular acceleration. The results
   are also verified with those predicted via simulated annealing. The
   predictions have also been validated via suitable sensitivity analysis
   to evaluate the efficacy of the method to uncertainties in the
   biomechanical, geometry as well as sensor noise parameters. The proposed
   optimal placement predictions are envisaged to be instrumental for the
   implementation of a wearable inertial sensor cluster.}},

Abstract = {{An equation for the bed development time of alluvial meandering streams
   is introduced. In agreement with the prevailing approach, it is assumed
   that the stream centreline follows a sine-generated curve; the banks are
   rigid; the flow is turbulent and subcritical; and the width-to-depth
   ratio is ``large{''}. The bed is flat at the beginning of an
   ``experiment{''} (i.e., at time t = 0). The bed development consists of
   the formation of large-scale, laterally adjacent pool-bar complexes
   strictly induced by the stream curvature. The derivation of the present
   equation rests on dimensional and physical considerations. It is found
   that the bed development time is proportional to the square of the flow
   width and inversely proportional to the specific volumetric bed-load
   corresponding to the channel-averaged flow. The proportionality factor
   is a not yet known function of the stream initial deflection angle. To
   bring the present equation into a form suitable for practical
   applications, the form of this function is revealed on the basis of a
   series of experiments carried out by the authors in three sine-generated
   meandering streams of varying sinuosity.}},

Abstract = {{In vivo metabolism of hyperpolarized pyruvate has been demonstrated to
   be an important probe of cellular glycolysis in diseases such as cancer.
   The usefulness of hyperpolarized C-13 imaging is dependent on the
   relaxation rates of the C-13-enriched substrates, which in turn depend
   on chemical conformation and properties of the dissolution media such as
   buffer composition, solution pH, temperature and magnetic field. We have
   measured the magnetic field dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation
   time of hyperpolarized {[}1-C-13]pyruvate using field-cycled
   relaxometry. {[}1-C-13]pyruvate was hyperpolarized using dynamic nuclear
   polarization and then rapidly thawed and dissolved in a buffered
   solution to a concentration of 80 mmol l(-1) and a pH of similar to 7.8.
   The hyperpolarized liquid was transferred within 8 s to a fast
   field-cycling relaxometer with a probe tuned for detection of C-13 at a
   field strength of similar to 0.75 T. The magnetic field of the
   relaxometer was rapidly varied between relaxation and acquisition fields
   where the sample magnetization was periodically measured using a small
   flip angle. Data were recorded for relaxation fields varying between
   0.237 mT and 0.705 T to map the T-1 dispersion of the C-1 of pyruvate.
   Using similar methods, we also determined the relaxivity of the
   triarylmethyl radical (OX063; used for dynamic nuclear polarization) on
   the C-1 of pyruvate at field strengths of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 0.5 T
   using 0.075, 1.0 and 2.0 mmol l(-1) concentrations of OX063 in the
   hyperpolarized pyruvate solution. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Volume = {{713}},
Pages = {{398-419}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that a significant drag reduction for pressure-driven
   flows can be realized by applying spatially distributed heating. The
   heating creates separation bubbles that separate the stream from the
   bounding walls and, at the same time, alter the distribution of the
   Reynolds stress, thereby providing a propulsive force. The strength of
   this effect is of practical interest for heating with wavenumbers alpha
   = O(1) and for flows with small Reynolds numbers and, thus, it is of
   potential interest for applications in micro-channels. Explicit results
   given for a very simple sinusoidal heating demonstrate that the
   drag-reducing effect increases proportionally to the second power of the
   heating intensity. This increase saturates if the heating becomes too
   intense. Drag reduction decreases as alpha(4) when the heating
   wavenumber becomes too small, and as alpha(-7) when the heating
   wavenumber becomes too large; this decrease is due to the reduction in
   the magnitude of the Reynolds stress. The drag reduction can reach up to
   87 \% for the heating intensities of interest and heating patterns
   corresponding to the most effective heating wavenumber.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamics of gas-solid flow were experimentally studied in depth in
   a Circulating Turbulent Fluidized Bed (CTFB) using FCC particles of 76
   mu m in a wide range of air velocities and solids circulation rates.
   Instantaneous local solids holdups were acquired with dual channel
   optical fibre probes. Through cross-correlating the sub-signals of the
   dilute and dense phases, separated from the measured solids holdup data,
   a Divided Phase Cross-Correlation Method (DPCCM) was proposed and was
   successfully used to obtain the distributions of particle velocity and
   solids flux of the dense and dilute phases. The upward particle velocity
   of the dilute phase increased with increasing air velocity and did not
   change significantly with solids circulation rate, while one of the
   dense phase increased proportionally with increasing solids circulation
   rate and hardly changed with increasing air velocity. The results also
   demonstrated that gas-particle interaction dominated in the dilute
   phase, while particle-particle interaction dominated in the dense phases
   at low solids circulation rate. Particle-particle and back-pressure
   interactions dominated in the dense phase at high solids circulation
   rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many cases, kinetic modeling requires that the arterial input
   function (AIF)-the time-dependent arterial concentration of a tracer-be
   characterized. A straightforward method to measure the AIF of red and
   near-infrared optical dyes (e.g., indocyanine green) using a pulse
   oximeter is presented. The method is motivated by the ubiquity of pulse
   oximeters used in both preclinical and clinical applications, as well as
   the gap in currently available technologies to measure AIFs in small
   animals. The method is based on quantifying the interference that is
   observed in the derived arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) following a
   bolus injection of a light-absorbing dye. In other words, the change in
   SaO(2) can be converted into dye concentration knowing the
   chromophore-specific extinction coefficients, the true arterial oxygen
   saturation, and total hemoglobin concentration. A simple error analysis
   was performed to highlight potential limitations of the approach, and a
   validation of the method was conducted in rabbits by comparing the pulse
   oximetry method with the AIF acquired using a pulse dye densitometer.
   Considering that determining the AIF is required for performing
   quantitative tracer kinetics, this method provides a flexible tool for
   measuring the arterial dye concentration that could be used in a variety
   of applications.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between a silica substrate and iron particles were
   investigated using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy
   (AFM). The micrometer- and nanosized iron particles employed were either
   bare or coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a polymer utilized to
   stabilize iron particle suspensions. The effect of water chemistry on
   the forces of interaction was probed by varying ionic strength (with 100
   mM NaCl and 100 mM CaCl2) or pH (4, 5.5, and 8) or by introducing 10
   mg/L of humic acids (HA). When particles were uncoated, the forces upon
   approach between silica and iron were attractive at pH 4 and 5.5 and in
   100 mM CaCl2 at pH 8, but they were negligible in 100 mM NaCl buffered
   to pH 8 and repulsive in water buffered to pH 8 and in HA solutions. HA
   produced electrosteric repulsion between iron particles and silica,
   likely due to its sorption to iron particles. HA sorption to silica was
   excluded on the basis of experiments conducted with a quartz-crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring. Repulsion with CMC-coated iron
   was attributed to electrosteric forces, which were damped at high ionic
   strength. An extended DLVO model and a modified version of Ohshima's
   theory were successfully utilized to model AFM data.}},

   modified carbon cloth (CCl) materials have been employed for the first
   time for the development of new electrode sensor materials, and
   characterised by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance

   shows a close to reversible electrochemical behaviour, under diffusion
   control, at both functionalised CNT\_CCl and CNx\_CCl. Polymerisation of
   3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) at CCl based electrodes was performed
   in order to decrease the material pore size and decrease sorption. The
   difference in charge values of PEDOT-modified CCl-based electrodes
   indicates that different amounts of polymer are deposited at each
   substrate. Glucose biosensors were constructed by immobilising glucose
   oxidase on top of PEDOT\_CNT/CNx\_CCl and the analytical properties
   together with operational stability were evaluated. Electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy was used to evaluate interfacial and bulk
   properties of CNT/CNx\_CCl, PEDOT\_CNT/CNx\_CCl and
   GOx\_PEDOT\_CNT/CNx\_CCl electrodes, and differences in both capacitance

Abstract = {{High-density three-dimensional Mo2S3 flowers have been facilely
   synthesized with controlled sites by introducing gold particles as the
   nucleation sites in a chemical vapor deposition process. The whole size
   of each flower is in micro scale while individual petal has extremely
   small thickness of around 10 nm. The role of gold particles and
   precursor concentration in the growth has been carefully investigated.
   Without gold particles, dense nanopetals were not able to be obtained
   unless in a highly concentrated sulfur atmosphere. With Au particles,
   dense products were steadily achieved in a wide precursor concentration
   range with S:MoO3 molar ratio from 1:5 to 5:1. The morphology and
   structure of the as-synthesized nanostructures were characterized using
   field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The growth mechanism was
   proposed in which gold particles acted as the initial nucleation sites
   fixing the nucleation position of the flowers following vapor-solid
   growth mechanism. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The capabilities of silver catalysts with different particle sizes for
   oxygen activation were systematically studied by O-17 solid-state NMR.
   The observation of O-17 signal at around 0 ppm for silver catalysts
   indicates that silver activates O-17(2) molecules and that subsequent
   formation of active O-17 species leads to the oxygen exchange with the
   mesoporous SiO2 supports. The initial appearances of the O-17 signals at
   different temperatures for three silver catalysts show that oxygen
   activation strongly depends on the size of Ag particle. Their ability of
   activating oxygen molecules is in the order Ag-3/MCM-41 > Ag-5/SBA-15 >
   Ag-10/SBA-15. Ag-3/MCM-41 is able to activate oxygen molecules and
   facilitates the oxygen exchange with the support even at room
   temperature. Although the NMR signal of active O-17 species on silver
   catalysts is not observed directly, the approach described in this work
   can be used to indirectly determine the conditions on which the active
   oxygen species can be produced during catalytic oxidation reactions. The
   silver catalysts can also be used for O-17 enrichment of the oxide-based
   materials under mild conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Radio wave returns from spread F plasma structures as received by
   ionosondes can originate from total/specular reflection, partial
   reflection or coherent backscattering. The dominant mechanism to account
   for the spread F traces in equatorial ionograms is still an open
   question. Depending upon the precise mechanism, ionosondes are sensitive
   to irregularity scale sizes of tens of meters to several tens/hundreds
   of kilometers. In this paper we analyze signatures of range spreading F
   layer traces in Digisonde ionograms, taken at Fortaleza (3.9 degrees S,
   38.45 degrees W, dip: -9 degrees) and Sao Luis (2.33 S, 44.2W, dip
   angle: -0.5 degrees), and at a dip equatorial site Cachimbo (9.5 degrees
   S, 54.8 degrees W, dip: -4.2 degrees) and at its two conjugate sites
   Bova Vista (02.8 degrees N, 60.7 degrees W, dip: 22.0 degrees) and Campo
   Grande (20.5 S, 54.7 W, dip -22.3 degrees) in Brazil, to determine the
   dominant process/mechanism of echo returns from the irregularity
   structures. A significant component of the ESF trace structures is found
   to be consistent with the echoes originating from coherent
   backscattering at field line perpendicular directions. The degree of
   range spreading of the echoes is found to increase linearly with the top
   frequency of the echo trace, which is shown to be a more precise
   indicator of the irregularity strength. Further, the irregularity
   strength exhibits a significant increase from the equator toward the EIA
   crests, as well as a strong asymmetry between the conjugate sites.

Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Minimotifs are short contiguous segments of proteins that have a known
   biological function. The hundreds of thousands of minimotifs discovered
   thus far are an important part of the theoretical understanding of the
   specificity of protein-protein interactions, posttranslational
   modifications, and signal transduction that occur in cells. However, a
   longstanding problem is that the different abstractions of the sequence
   definitions do not accurately capture the specificity, despite decades
   of effort by many labs. We present evidence that structure is an
   essential component of minimotif specificity, yet is not used in
   minimotif definitions. Our analysis of several known minimotifs as case
   studies, analysis of occurrences of minimotifs in structured and
   disordered regions of proteins, and review of the literature support a
   new model for minimotif definitions that includes sequence, structure,
   and function.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Microvasculature associated with the sciatic nerve was examined using
   high-resolution micro-CT scanning in one group of rats and surgical
   exploration in another. The results indicate that blood supply to the
   sciatic nerve is an ``open-ended{''} system in which the vessels run
   longitudinally within the epineurium and connect with external
   vasculature primarily at junction points. Although the range of
   vasculature found extended down to 4-5 mu, only a few isolated vessels
   of this size were found, with no capillary ``mesh{''} as such, possibly
   because of the close proximity of the intrinsic vessel to nerve fibers
   within the epineurium. While the study did not include direct
   measurements of flow or nerve function, the ``open-ended{''} pattern of
   vasculature found has important implications regarding the relationship
   between the two. Specifically, the nerve is less vulnerable to a severe
   or complete disruption in blood supply than it would be under a
   close-ended system such as that of the heart or brain, where a severe
   disruption can occur with the obstruction of only a single vessel.
   Indeed, the pattern of vasculature found, subject to further study of
   vasculature at the capillary level, suggests that flow within the
   intrinsic vessels may be in either direction, depending on
   circumstances, somewhat like flow within the circle of Willis in the
   cerebral circulation.}},

   SHEET IN POLYMER MEDIUM}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the nonlinear free vibration of a double layer
   graphene sheet (DLGS) embedded in a polymer matrix aroused by the
   nonlinear van der Waals (vdW) interactions based on the classic
   Kirchhoff plate theory. Harmonic balance method is used to predict the
   nonlinear relation between deflection amplitudes and resonant
   frequencies of the DLGS. The embedded DLGS presents a hardening
   nonlinearity in both in-phase vibration (IPV) and anti-phase vibration
   (APV) modes. The surrounding polymer medium is found to have significant
   effect on the resonant frequency, especially for the IPV mode. For
   example, the variation of the resonant frequencies of an embedded DLGS
   is less dependent on the graphene aspect ratio and mode numbers as
   compared with a free-standing one. Uni-axial and bi-axial in-plane load
   effects upon the vibrational behavior of DLGS are also investigated. It
   is concluded that due to the influence of the nonlinear interlayer and
   interfacial vdW forces on the DLGS, prediction on both linear and
   nonlinear resonant frequencies for the embedded DLGS is quite different
   from that for a free-standing one. This study is expected to be useful
   for understanding the nonlinear mechanical behavior of graphenes with
   their potential applications in nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of particles properties on biofilm structure, reactor
   performance, and energy consumption for denitrifying fluidized bed
   bioreactors (DFBBRs) using maxi-blast plastic (MX), multi-blast plastic
   (MB), natural zeolite (NZ), and lava rock (LR) was investigated. The
   work showed that the particles with sphericity of 0.9 (MB and NZ)
   maintained a fluffy protruding biofilm and achieved slightly higher
   nutrient removal efficiencies as compared to the particles with
   sphericity of 0.5 (MX and LR) which exhibited a patchy biofilm at low
   C/N ratio. As a results, lower detachment rate and biomass yields were
   observed for MB and NZ of 0.12 g VSS/g COD, as compared to 0.19 g VSS/g
   COD for both the MX and LR. This study showed that increasing the
   biofilm thickness, though not significantly impacting nutrient removal
   efficiencies, would decrease the annualized energy costs and therefore
   reduce the long-term operational cost. Moreover, MB appears to be the
   superior media. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   rates are calculated. Also, in the exergy analysis, exergy input,
   output, loss and destruction rates as well as exergetic coefficient of
   performance and primary exergy ratio and exergy efficiency values are
   determined. Furthermore, sustainability analysis of the system is
   conducted through a sustainability index method. The electrical energy
   consumption cost of this novel air cooler shows that, it consumes only
   59.85 \$/year, when it is operated 8 h a day and 125 days in a year. The
   maximum exergetic cost rate is found to be 0.0228 kWh/\$-year at a dead
   state temperature of 37.77 degrees C. Also, according to the
   enviroeconomic (environmental cost) analysis, this novel air cooler has
   very CO2 emissions cost as 6.96 \$/year. Consequently, these results
   show the originality of the Maisotsenko cycle based novel air cooler.

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation of the flow dynamics in a channel with a
   corrugated surface is presented. Particle image velocimetry was used to
   obtain two-dimensional velocity fields at three different locations
   along the channel length, over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results
   show a significant impact of the corrugation waveform on the mean and
   turbulent flow structure inside the channel. Strong bursting flow
   originating from the trough, sweeping flow from the bulk region and the
   vortex shedding off the crest were observed. Their interactions created
   a complex three-dimensional flow structure extended over almost the
   entire channel. The mean velocity profiles indicate a strong diffusion
   of shear. The profiles of various turbulent properties show the
   enhancement of turbulence in the vicinity of the waveform. It was found
   that the turbulence in the channel was almost entirely produced in this
   region above the corrugation trough. Significant momentum transfer from
   the corrugation wall by the turbulent velocity field was also observed.
   The mean and turbulent flow behaviour was found to be periodic with
   respect to the waveform over most of the channel length. The results
   show the presence of strong turbulence even at the Reynolds number that
   falls within the conventional laminar range. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Increased oxygen diffusivity through three dimensional (3D) porous
   scaffolds is an important requirement to successfully fabricate
   engineered tissue constructs. In this study, tubular and disk-shaped
   poly(carbonate urethane) (PCU) scaffolds for vascular tissue engineering
   application were fabricated by a solvent casting and particulate
   leaching method using different PCU concentration (15\%-30\% in N,
   N-dimethylformamide (DMF)) and NH4Cl porogens. Enhanced pore
   interconnectivity and oxygen diffusivity resulted from scaffolds
   fabricated using 15\% PCU in DMF. Human coronary artery smooth muscle
   cells (HCASMCs) were seeded into these scaffolds and cultured for up to
   28 days under static or flow conditions in a perfusion bioreactor. For
   both tubular and disk-shaped scaffolds, better cell infiltration depth
   and distribution was observed under flow condition than static culture
   controls as shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining and fluorescence
   staining respectively. Furthermore, preliminary Western blot data
   suggested that dynamically-cultured HCASMCs produced more elastin than
   static culture controls. The results demonstrated that scaffolds having
   high oxygen diffusivity and that support HCASMCs attachment and
   infiltration could be designed for the fabrication of tissue engineered
   vascular constructs.}},

Abstract = {{The genome of the phytophagous two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus
   urticae was recently sequenced, representing the first complete
   chelicerate genome, but also the first genome of a highly polyphagous
   agricultural pest. Genome analysis revealed the presence of an
   unexpected high number of cases of putative horizontal gene transfers,
   including a gene that encodes a cyanase or cyanate lyase. In this study
   we show by recombinant expression that the T. urticae cyanase remained
   functionally active after horizontal gene transfer and has a high
   affinity for cyanate. Cyanases were also detected in other plant
   parasitic spider mites species such as Tetranychus evansi and Panonychus
   citri, suggesting that an ancient gene transfer occurred before the
   diversification within the Tetranychidae family. To investigate the
   potential role of cyanase in the evolution of plant parasitic spider
   mites, we studied cyanase expression patterns in T urticae in relation
   to host plant range and cyanogenesis, a common plant defense mechanism.
   Spider mites can alter cyanase expression levels after transfer to
   several new host plants, including the cyanogenic Phaseolus lunatus.
   However, the role of cyanase is probably not restricted to cyanide
   response, but likely to the plant nutritional quality as a whole. We
   finally discuss potential interactions between cyanase activity and
   pyrimidine and amino acid synthesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A wind tunnel study has been performed on roof-mounted solar arrays of
   two different panel tilt angles. One of the arrays was also placed on
   the ground in order to distinguish array generated aerodynamic effects
   from building generated effects. It is shown that there are two main
   mechanisms causing the aerodynamic loads: (i) turbulence generated by
   the panels and (ii) pressure equalization. For higher tilt angles,
   significant array generated turbulence increases the net wind loads,
   while for low tilt angles, pressure equalization dominates. In addition,
   it is observed that the presence of the building changes the aerodynamic
   loads substantially compared to ground-mounted systems. There is a
   complex interaction between building generated vortices and the flow
   induced by the array, which depends on building height, the setback of
   the array from the roof edge, and other building parameters. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, a dynamic model of the Canadian supercritical
   water-cooled reactor (SCWR) is developed to examine its dynamics for
   potential control system design and analysis. The model development is
   based on fundamental mass, energy, and momentum conservation equations
   of major components within the Canadian SCWR operating at supercritical
   condition. A full set of nonlinear dynamic equations is first derived,
   from which linearized models are obtained. The linearized models are
   validated against the full-order nonlinear models in both time domain
   and frequency domain. The open-loop dynamic characteristics of the
   Canadian SCWR are investigated through extensive simulations.
   Steady-state and dynamic couplings among different inputs and outputs
   are examined using relative gain array and Nyquist plots, and adequate
   input-output pairings are identified. Cross-coupling at different
   operating conditions is also evaluated to illustrate the nonlinear
   behaviors of the system. The developed dynamic model provides a
   necessary platform for systematic investigation in the control system
   design and analysis of the Canadian SCWR.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Obtaining high levels of contouring consistency is a major
   limiting step in optimizing the radiotherapeutic ratio. We describe a
   novel quantitative methodology for the quality assurance (QA) of contour
   compliance referenced against a community set of contouring experts.
   Methods Two clinical tumour site scenarios (10 lung cases and one
   prostate case) were used with QA algorithm. For each case, multiple
   physicians (lung: n?=?6, prostate: n?=?25) segmented various
   target/organ at risk (OAR) structures to define a set of community
   reference contours. For each set of community contours, a consensus
   contour (Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE))
   was created. Differences between each individual community contour
   versus the group consensus contour were quantified by consensus-based
   contouring penalty metric (PM) scores. New observers segmented these
   same cases to calculate individual PM scores (for each unique
   target/OAR) for each new observerSTAPLE pair for comparison against the
   community and consensus contours.
   Results Four physicians contoured the 10 lung cases for a total of 72
   contours for quality assurance evaluation against the previously derived
   community consensus contours. A total of 16 outlier contours were
   identified by the QA system of which 11 outliers were due to
   over-contouring discrepancies, three were due to over-/under-contouring
   discrepancies, and two were due to missing/incorrect nodal contours. In
   the prostate scenario involving six physicians, the QA system detected a
   missing penile bulb contour, systematic inner-bladder contouring, and
   under-contouring of the upper/anterior rectum.
   Conclusion A practical methodology for QA has been demonstrated with
   future clinical trial credentialing, medical education and
   auto-contouring assessment applications.}},

   doi: 10.1152/jn.00312.2012.-The relationship between neck muscle
   electromyography (EMG) and torsional head rotation (about the
   nasooccipital axis) is difficult to assess during normal gaze behaviors
   with the head upright. Here, we induced acute head tilts similar to
   cervical dystonia (torticollis) in two monkeys by electrically
   stimulating 20 interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) sites or inactivating
   19 INC sites by injection of muscimol. Animals engaged in a simple gaze
   fixation task while we recorded three-dimensional head kinematics and
   intramuscular EMG from six bilateral neck muscle pairs. We used a
   cross-validation-based stepwise regression to quantitatively examine the
   relationships between neck EMG and torsional head kinematics under three
   conditions: 1) unilateral INC stimulation (where the head rotated
   torsionally toward the side of stimulation); 2) corrective
   poststimulation movements (where the head returned toward upright); and
   3) unilateral INC inactivation (where the head tilted toward the
   opposite side of inactivation). Our cross-validated results of
   corrective movements were slightly better than those obtained during
   unperturbed gaze movements and showed many more torsional terms, mostly
   related to velocity, although some orientation and acceleration terms
   were retained. In addition, several simplifying principles were
   identified. First, bilateral muscle pairs showed similar, but opposite
   EMG-torsional coupling terms, i.e., a change in torsional kinematics was
   associated with increased muscle activity on one side and decreased
   activity on the other side. s, whenever torsional terms were retained in
   a given muscle, they were independent of the inputs we tested, i.e., INC
   stimulation vs. corrective motion vs. INC inactivation, and left vs.
   right INC data. These findings suggest that, despite the complexity of
   the head-neck system, the brain can use a single, bilaterally coupled
   inverse model for torsional head control that is valid across different
   behaviors and movement directions. Combined with our previous data,
   these new data provide the terms for a more complete three-dimensional
   model of EMG: head rotation coupling for the muscles and gaze behaviors
   that we recorded.}},

Abstract = {{The integrity of the roof system is important to the safety of
   inhabitants and prevents excessive damage to light-frame wood
   structures. The uplift capacity of fastened roof panels has been
   investigated using experimental tests and numerical models.
   Monotonically increasing uniform static pressure is often employed in
   experimental investigations and numerical modeling is carried out by
   assuming that the tributary area method is adequate and the fasteners
   can be modeled as linear elastic springs, even though the
   force-deformation relationship for nail withdrawal is nonlinear and
   uncertain. This study is aimed at assessing the statistical
   characteristics and modeling the uplift capacity for the roof panel
   under stochastic wind pressure by incorporating the uncertainty in nail
   withdrawal behaviour. The results show that the nonlinear behaviour of
   nail withdrawal needs to be considered to improve the accuracy of the
   estimated uplift capacity; the statistics and the probability model of
   the uplift capacity are affected by the degree of correlation of the
   fastener behaviour within the panel; and that nail spacing and missing
   nails influence the uplift capacity significantly.}},

Abstract = {{The human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 oncoprotein binds cellular factors,
   preventing or retargeting their function and thereby making the infected
   cell conducive for viral replication. A key target of E7 is the product
   of the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (pRb). This interaction
   results in the release of E2F transcription factors and drives the host
   cell into the S phase of the cell cycle. E7 binds pRb via a
   high-affinity binding site in conserved region 2 (CR2) and also targets
   a portion of cellular pRb for degradation via the proteasome. Evidence
   suggests that a secondary binding site exists in CR3, and that this
   interaction influences pRb deregulation. Additionally, evidence suggests
   that CR3 also participates in the degradation of pRb. We have
   systematically analyzed the molecular mechanisms by which CR3
   contributes to deregulation of the pRb pathway by utilizing a
   comprehensive series of mutations in residues predicted to be exposed on
   the surface of HPV16 E7 CR3. Despite differences in the ability to
   interact with cullin 2, all CR3 mutants degrade pRb comparably to
   wild-type E7. We identified two specific patches of residues on the
   surface of CR3 that contribute to pRb binding independently of the
   high-affinity CR2 binding site. Mutants within CR3 that affect pRb
   binding are less effective than the wild-type E7 in overcoming
   pRb-induced cell cycle arrest. This demonstrates that the interaction
   between HPV16 E7 CR3 and pRb is functionally important for alteration of
   the cell cycle.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a process planning for machining of a Floor which is
   the most prominent elemental machining feature in a 2 1/2D pocket.
   Traditionally, the process planning of 2 1/2D pocket machining is posed
   as stand-alone problem involving either tool selection, tool path
   generation or machining parameter selection, resulting in sub-optimal
   plans. For this reason, the tool path generation and feed selection is
   proposed to be integrated with an objective of minimizing machining time
   under realistic cutting force constraints for given pocket geometry and
   cutting tool. A morphed spiral tool path consisting of G(1) continuous
   biarc and arc spline is proposed as a possible tool path generation
   strategy with the capability of handling islands in pocket geometry.
   Proposed tool path enables a constant feed rate and consistent cutting
   force during machining in typical commercial CNC machine tool. The
   constant feed selection is based on the tool path and cutting tool
   geometries as well as dynamic characteristics of mechanical structure of
   the machine tool to ensure optimal machining performance. The proposed
   tool path strategy is compared with those generated by commercial CAM
   software. The calculated tool path length and measured dry machining
   time show considerable advantage of the proposed tool path. For optimal
   machining parameter selection, the feed per tooth is iteratively
   optimized with a pre-calibrated cutting force model, under a cutting
   force constraint to avoid tool rupture. The optimization result shows
   around 32\% and 40\% potential improvement in productivity with one and
   two feed rate strategies respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objectives: (1) Test the hypothesis that walking poles decrease the
   external knee adduction moment during gait in patients with varus
   gonarthrosis, and (2) explore potential mechanisms.
   Design: Thirty-four patients with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis
   (OA) and varus alignment underwent three dimensional (3D) gait analysis
   with and without using walking poles. Conditions were randomized and
   walking speed was maintained +/- 5\% of the self-selected speed of the
   initial condition. The pole held in the hand of the unaffected side was
   instrumented with a compression load cell.
   Results: Student's t tests for paired samples indicated small but
   statistically significant increases (P < 0.001) in knee adduction moment
   (calculated from inverse dynamics) for its first peak, second peak and
   angular impulse when using the poles; mean increases (95\% confidence
   interval - Cl) were 0.17\% BW{*}Ht (0.08, 0.27), 0.17\%BW{*}Ht (0.04,
   0.30) and 0.15\%BW{*}Ht{*}s (0.09, 0.22), respectively. There was a
   decrease (P = 0.015) in vertical ground reaction force (-0.02 BW (-0.04,
   -0.01)), yet increase (P < 0.001) in its frontal plane lever arm about
   the knee (0.30 cm (0.15, 0.44)), at the time of the first peak knee
   adduction moment. Pole force in the vertical direction was inversely
   related (r = -0.34, P = 0.05) to the increase in first peak adduction
   moment.
   Conclusion: Although results are variable among patients, and may be
   related to individual technique, these overall findings suggest that
   walking poles do not decrease knee adduction moments, and therefore
   likely do not decrease medial compartment loads, in patients with varus
   gonarthrosis. Decreases in knee joint loading should not be used as
   rationale for walking pole use in these patients. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The simulated countercurrent moving-bed chromatographic reactor (SCMCR)

   solved using numerically tuned kinetic and adsorption parameters. The
   model predictions showed good agreement with available experimental
   results of SCMCR for OCM. Effects of several process parameters on the
   performance of SCMCR were investigated. A multi-objective optimisation
   problem was solved at the operating stage using state-of-the-art
   AI-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with jumping genes
   adaptations (NSGA-II-JG), which resulted in Pareto Optimal solutions. It
   was found that the performance of the SCMCR could be significantly

Number = {{33}},
Pages = {{7945-7952}},

Abstract = {{The conventional method of calculating atmospheric temperature profiles
   using Rayleigh-scattering lidar measurements has limitations that
   necessitate abandoning temperatures retrieved at the greatest heights,
   due to the assumption of a pressure value required to initialize the
   integration at the highest altitude. An inversion approach is used to
   develop an alternative way of retrieving nightly atmospheric temperature
   profiles from the lidar measurements. Measurements obtained by the
   Purple Crow lidar facility located near The University of Western
   Ontario are used to develop and test this new technique. Our results
   show temperatures can be reliably retrieved at all heights where
   measurements with adequate signal-to-noise ratio exist. A Monte Carlo
   technique was developed to provide accurate estimates of both the
   systematic and random uncertainties for the retrieved nightly average
   temperature profile. An advantage of this new method is the ability to
   seed the temperature integration from the lowest rather than the
   greatest height, where the variability of the pressure is smaller than
   in the mesosphere or lower thermosphere and may in practice be routinely
   measured by a radiosonde, rather than requiring a rocket or
   satellite-borne measurement. Thus, this new technique extends the
   altitude range of existing Rayleigh-scatter lidars 10-15 km, producing
   the equivalent of four times the power-aperture product. (C) 2012

Volume = {{333}},

Abstract = {{In the present work six different cases of vapour-liquid (VLE) and
   vapour-liquid-liquid equilibria (VLLE) selected from the literature,
   were modeled and verified. The objective of this work is to develop a
   general program for the VLE and VLLE prediction of the industrial
   solvents in multi-component fashion using a fast, reliable, and simple
   method. The ultimate goal is to develop a software package for the
   solvent screening in high-throughput crystallization of a chemical
   compound. The selection covers binary, ternary, and quaternary mixtures
   to verify and assess the accuracy of the suggested predictive
   thermodynamic models. In this work, the NRTL-SAC and UNIFAC models were
   employed to provide the phase behaviour prediction for the six cases
   studied. In binary systems under study, the UNIFAC model was better than
   NRTL-SAC in predicting light alcohol solutions with water and aromatic
   compounds. For systems of ethylene glycol, diethyl ether, and heavy
   alcohols the NRTL-SAC model gave better prediction than the UNIFAC. For
   the ternary system of ethanol-water-ethylene glycol, the NRTL-SAC was
   accurate, while the UNIFAC was not that precise. The NRTL-SAC could
   predict other ternary systems with good accuracy, while the UNIFAC gave
   less accurate results. In quaternary mixtures, the NRTL-SAC was slightly
   better, especially in prediction of bubble point temperatures. In order
   to develop a general VLE and VLLE software package for common solvents.
   the NRLT-SAC model is a good candidate, as the only database which has
   to be included in the routine is the four segment numbers, which are
   constant for each component and are available in the literature. In
   contrast, for the UNIFAC model the chemical structure and the
   corresponding parameters for each functional group need to be known. The
   computational complexity increases if the number of components in the
   mixture is increased. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{45}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the forced nonlinear vibration of
   multi-layered graphene sheets modelled at the atomic level by the
   lattice structure approach. In this, the covalent bond between two
   carbon atoms is assumed as a structural member with prescribed physical
   and material properties. An atom is treated as a nodal point with its
   own mass and six degrees of freedom. The highly nonlinear van der Waals
   interaction between adjacent graphene layers is fully incorporated in
   the model by placing it in the force vector. This adjustment
   significantly reduces the computational hardships due to nonlinearity
   and increases the efficiency of the method. Newmark's direct integration
   method is modified to address the nonlinearity in the load vector and
   used for the solution of the matrix equation governing the motion of the
   multi-layered graphene sheet. Double-layered square graphene with simply
   supported and clamped boundary conditions is analysed to examine the
   out-of-plane and in-plane vibrational characteristics. Also, in order to
   illustrate the applicability of the numerical method, analyses are
   carried out with the first- and second-order Taylor series
   approximations of the van der Waals interactions, influence of which is
   found to be quite significant in the bending modes of vibration, but it
   essentially does not have a role in the in-plane modes. The numerical
   method developed herein is quite appropriate with reference to the
   structural formation at the atomic scale and also more efficient than
   previous computational approaches by others.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the surface effects on the vibration and buckling
   behaviour of a simply supported piezoelectric nanoplate (PNP) by using a
   modified Kirchhoff plate model. Two kinds of in-plane constraints are
   defined for the PNP, and the surface effects are accounted in the
   modified plate theory through the surface piezoelectricity model and the
   generalized Young-Laplace equations. Simulation results show that the
   influence of surface effects on the plate resonant frequency depends on
   the in-plane constraints significantly. For the PNP with different
   in-plane constraints, the effects of the applied electric potential, the
   mode number, the plate aspect ratio and the plate thickness on the
   resonant frequency are examined with consideration of the surface
   effects. The possible mechanical buckling of the PNP is also studied,
   and it is found that the surface effects on the critical electric
   voltage for buckling are sensitive to the plate thickness and aspect
   ratio. Our results also reveal that there exists a critical transition
   point at which the combined surface effects on the critical electric
   voltage may vanish under certain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate commercial optical
   cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanners as devices for reading
   EBT2 radiochromic film. A secondary objective was to implement a spatial
   correction for stray light present within optical CBCT systems. Square
   (12.7 x 12.7 cm(2)) EBT2 films were positioned vertically in the middle
   of a small water-filled tank, co-linear with the central beam axis of a
   12 MeV electron beam. A total dose of 4.0 Gy was delivered at depth of
   3.0 cm. Films were imaged prior to irradiation and 24 hours
   post-irradiation. Two different models of scanners, Vista15 (TM) and
   Vista10 (TM), were used to read out the irradiated films. In the Vista15
   (TM) scanner, residual light scatter was corrected for using: 1) a
   single vertical slot array and 2) a slot pair array that produced a
   vertical fan beam of light. Vista10 (TM) was modified to have a smaller
   acceptance angle of scattered light and further corrections for residual
   scatter were made using a multiple slot array. With these different
   geometries, composite `open field' and `shadow field' images were
   generated and processed to create `glare-free' pre and post-irradiation
   film images respectively, from which the net optical density (OD) was
   calculated. Results were compared against the open light field
   measurement in which no correction for stray light was made. Using the
   above scanners, EBT2 films were additionally read out to obtain 12 MeV
   electron and 6 MV photon percentage depth doses. By correcting for stray
   light it was found that the central-axis change in the net OD increased
   particularly in the 12 MeV electron buildup region and at the depth of
   maximum dose (d(max) = 3.0 cm) where light transmission is lowest. In
   the open light field measurement acquired with the Vista15 (TM) scanner
   the net OD was 0.87 +/- 0.02. Using single vertical slot array geometry
   to correct for stray light, the net OD was 0.94 +/- 0.02, while with the
   slot pair array the net OD was 0.99 +/- 0.02. For the same film read out
   with the `modified' Vista10 (TM) scanner and corrected for scattered
   light using the multiple slot array technique, a maximum net OD of 1.30
   +/- 0.02 was obtained. This latter value is comparable to published data
   obtained with EBT2 film read out with a spectrophotometer. For 12 MeV
   electron and 6MV photon percentage depth doses measured with EBT2 film,
   agreement with thimble ion chamber measurements is shown. The results
   demonstrate that accurate radiochromic film densitometry can be achieved
   with optical CBCT scanners and slot array masks that correct for
   spatially varying stray light within these devices.}},

Abstract = {{The transmitter identification of the DTV systems becomes crucial
   nowadays. Transmitter identification (TxID, or transmitter
   fingerprinting) technique is used to detect, diagnose and classify the
   operating status of any radio transmitter of interest. A pseudo random
   sequence was proposed to be embedded into the DTV signal before
   transmission. Thus, the transmitter identification can be realized by
   invoking the cross-correlation functions between the received signal and
   the possible candidates of the pseudo random sequences. Gold sequences
   and Kasami sequences are two excellent candidates for the transmitter ID
   sequences as they provide a large family of nearly-orthogonal codes. In
   order to investigate the sensitivity of the transmitter identification
   to different topologies and different Kasami sequence lengths, we
   present the analysis here for four different geometric layouts, namely
   circular distribution, doubly concentric and circular distribution,
   square array and hexagonal tessellation under the ENG (electronic news
   gathering) crews' working environment. The coverage area and the lowest
   received signal-to-interference ratio are considered as two essential
   parameters for the multiple-transmitter identification. It turns out to
   be that the larger the Kasami sequence length, the larger the received
   signal-to-interference ratio. Our new analysis can be used to determine
   the required Kasami sequence length for a specific broadcasting
   coverage..}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses XML document classification by considering both
   structural and content-based features of the documents. This approach
   leads to better constructing a set of informative feature vectors that
   represents both structural and textual aspects of XML documents. For
   this purpose, we integrate soft clustering of words and feature
   reduction into the process. To extract structural information, we employ
   an existing frequent tree-mining algorithm combined with an information
   gain filter to retrieve the most informative substructures from XML
   documents. However, for extracting content information, we propose soft
   clustering of words using each cluster as a textual feature. We have
   conducted extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset, namely
   20NewsGroups, and an XML documents dataset given in LOGML that describes
   the web-server logs of user sessions. With regards to the classifier
   built only using our textual features, the results show that it
   outperforms a naive support-vector-machine (SVM)-based classifier, as
   well as an information retrieval classifier (IRC). We further
   demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating both structural and
   content information into the process of learning, by comparing our
   classifier model and several XML document classifiers. In particular, by
   applying SVM and decision tree algorithms using our feature vector
   representation of XML documents dataset, we have achieved 85.79\% and
   87.04\% classification accuracy, respectively, which are higher than
   accuracy achieved by XRules, a well-known structural-based XML document
   classifier.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, some potential sustainable hydrogen production options
   are identified and discussed. There are natural resources from which
   hydrogen can be extracted such as water, fossil hydrocarbons, biomass
   and hydrogen sulphide. In addition, hydrogen can be extracted from a
   large palette of anthropogenic wastes starting with biomass residuals,
   municipal wastes, plastics, sewage waters etc. In order to extract
   hydrogen from these resources one needs to use sustainable energy
   sources like renewables and nuclear. A total of 24 options for
   sustainable hydrogen production are then identified. Sustainable water
   splitting is the most important method of hydrogen production. Five
   sustainable options are discussed to split water, which include
   electrolysis, high temperature electrolysis, pure and hybrid
   thermochemical cycles, and photochemical/radiochemical methods. Other 19
   methods refer to extraction of hydrogen from other materials than water
   or in conjunction with water (e.g., coal gasification with CO2 capture
   and sequestration). For each case the achievable energy and exergy
   efficiency of the method were estimated based on state of the art
   literature screening for each involved process. In addition, a range of
   hydrogen production capacity is determined for each of the option. For a
   transition period to hydrogen economy nuclear or solar assisted coal
   gasification and fossil fuel reforming technologies - with efficiencies
   of 10-55\% including CO2 sequestration - should be considered as a
   viable option. Other ``ready to be implemented{''} technology is
   hydro-power coupled to alkaline electrolysers which shows the highest
   hydrogen generation efficiency amongst all electrical driven options
   with 60-65\%. Next generation nuclear reactors as to be coupled with
   thermochemical cycles have the potential to generate hydrogen with
   40-43\% energy efficiency (based on LHV of hydrogen) and 35-37\% exergy
   efficiency (based on chemical exergy of hydrogen). Furthermore,
   recycling anthropogenic waste, including waste heat, waste plastic
   materials, waste biomass and sewage waters, shows also good potential as
   a sustainable option for hydrogen production. Biomass conversion to
   hydrogen is found as potentially the most efficient amongst all studied
   options in this paper with up to 70\% energy efficiency and 65\% exergy
   efficiency. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Hydrogen produced from solar energy is one of the most promising solar
   energy technologies that can significantly contribute to a sustainable
   energy supply in the future. This paper discusses the unique advantages
   of using solar energy over other forms of energy to produce hydrogen.
   Then it examines the latest research and development progress of various
   solar-to-hydrogen production technologies based on thermal, electrical,
   and photon energy. Comparisons are made to include water splitting
   methods, solar energy forms, energy efficiency, basic components needed
   by the processes, and engineering systems, among others. The definitions
   of overall solar-to-hydrogen production efficiencies and the
   categorization criteria for various methods are examined and discussed.
   The examined methods include thermochemical water splitting, water
   electrolysis, photoelectrochemical, and photochemical methods, among
   others. It is concluded that large production scales are more suitable
   for thermochemical cycles in order to minimize the energy losses caused
   by high temperature requirements or multiple chemical reactions and
   auxiliary processes. Water electrolysis powered by solar generated
   electricity is currently more mature than other technologies. The
   solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency is the main limitation in the
   improvement of the overall hydrogen production efficiency. By
   comparison, solar powered electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and
   photochemical technologies can be more advantageous for hydrogen fueling
   stations because fewer processes are needed, external power sources can
   be avoided, and extra hydrogen distribution systems can be avoided as
   well. The narrow wavelength ranges of photosensitive materials limit the
   efficiencies of solar photovoltaic panels, photoelectrodes, and
   photocatalysts, hence limit the solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies of solar
   based water electrolysis, photoelectrochemical and photochemical
   technologies. Extension of the working wavelength of the materials is an
   important future research direction to improve the solar-to-hydrogen
   efficiency. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{A finite difference method was used to simulate the electric fields
   induced in the model by a gradient wire pattern. The pattern simulated
   corresponded to a design used to perform peripheral nerves stimulation
   experiments. The size (187.8, 169.02, and 150.24 cm tall) and position
   (brain and neck mode) of the model, relative to the magnet, as well as
   the voxel dimensions (3, 6, and 9 mm) of the model were varied to assess
   the effect on the simulation. The locations of stimulation reported from
   an experiment were classified according to nerve branch and compared
   with the peak-simulated electric fields. Model size and location
   affected the magnitude of the electric field, but not the position.
   Model resolution affected the location of the peak field. For the
   smallest resolution investigated, the nerves affected by the locations
   of peak stimulations in the model correlated to the frequency of
   stimulation in experiments. Although adequate resolution is required in
   order to assess the electric fields induced by gradient coil operation,
   the simulation of electric fields may be useful in evaluating gradient
   coil design prior to construction. Magn Reson Med, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

   the model errors, including the mean values, coefficients of variation
   and probability distributions, for the burst models are obtained by
   analyzing the ratios between the test and predicted burst pressures
   corresponding to the test data applicable to the model. For each of the
   burst models, separate model errors for short and long defects are also
   evaluated, whereby the short and long defects are separated by the

Abstract = {{Stable pluripotent feeder-free propagation of human embryonic stem cells
   (hESCs) prior to their therapeutic applications remains a major
   challenge. Matrigel (TM) (BD Singapore) is a murine sarcoma-derived
   extracellular matrix (ECM) widely used as a cell-free support combined
   with conditioned or chemically defined media; however, inherent
   xenogenic and immunological threats invalidate it for clinical
   applications. Using human fibrogenic cells to generate ECM is promising
   but currently suffers from inefficient and time-consuming deposition in
   vitro. We recently showed that macromolecular crowding (MMC) accelerated
   ECM deposition substantially in vitro. In the current study, we used
   dextran sulfate 500 kDa as a macromolecular crowder to induce WI-38
   fetal human lung fibroblasts at 0.5\% serum condition to deposit human
   ECM in three days. After decellularization, the generated ECMs allowed
   stable propagation of H9 hESCs over 20 passages in chemically-defined
   medium (mTEsR1) with an overall improved outcome compared to Matrigel in
   terms of population doubling while retaining teratoma formation and
   differentiation capacity. Of significance, only ECMs generated by MMC
   allowed the successful propagation of hESCs. ECMs were highly complex
   and in contrast to Matrigel, contained no vitronectin but did contain
   collagen XII, ig-h3 and novel for hESC-supporting human matrices,
   substantial amounts of transglutaminase 2. Genome-wide analysis of
   promoter DNA methylation states revealed high overall similarity between
   human ECM- and Matrigel-cultured hESCs; however, distinct differences
   were observed with 49 genes associated with a variety of cellular
   functions. Thus, human ECMs deposited by MMC by selected fibroblast
   lines are a suitable human microenvironment for stable hESC propagation
   and clinically translational settings. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Purpose: To quantitatively compare hyperpolarized helium 3 (He-3) and
   xenon 129 (Xe-129) magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained within 5
   minutes in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) and to evaluate the correlations between He-3
   and Xe-129 MR imaging measurements and those from spirometry and
   plethysmography.
   Materials and Methods: This study was approved by an ethics board and
   compliant with HIPAA. Written informed consent was obtained from all
   subjects. Eight healthy volunteers and 10 patients with COPD underwent
   MR imaging, spirometry, and plethysmography. Ventilation defect
   percentages (VDPs) at He-3 and Xe-129 imaging were obtained by using
   semiautomated segmentation. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were
   calculated from He-3 (b = 1.6 sec/cm(2)) and Xe-129 (b = 12 sec/cm(2))
   diffusion-weighted images. VDPs at hyperpolarized He-3 and Xe-129
   imaging were compared with a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test and
   analysis of variance; Pearson correlation coefficients were used to
   evaluate the relationships among measurements.
   Results: Xe-129 VDP was significantly greater than He-3 VDP for patients
   with COPD (P < .0001) but not for healthy volunteers (P = .35), although
   3He and Xe-129 VDPs showed a significant correlation for all subjects (r
   = 0.91, P < .0001). The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
   showed a similar and significant correlation with He-3 VDP (r = 20.84, P
   < .0001) and Xe-129 VDP (r = -0.89, P < .0001), although the correlation
   between the FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio and Xe-129 VDP (r =
   -0.95, P < .0001) was significantly greater (P = .01) than that for
   FEV1/FVC and He-3 VDP (r = 20.84, P < .0001). A significant correlation
   was also observed for He-3 and Xe-129 ADC (r = 0.97, P < .0001); Xe-129
   ADC was significantly correlated with diffusing capacity of lung for
   carbon monoxide (r = 20.79, P = .03) and computed tomographic emphysema
   measurements (areas with attenuation values in the 15th percentile: r =
   20.91, P = .0003; relative areas with attenuation values of less than
   2950 HU: r = 0.87, P = .001).
   Conclusion: In patients with COPD, the VDP obtained with hyperpolarized
   Xe-29 MR imaging was significantly greater than that with He-3 MR
   imaging, suggesting incomplete or delayed filling of lung regions that
   may be related to the different properties of Xe-129 gas and physiologic
   and/or anatomic abnormalities in COPD.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: Spirometry is insensitive to small airway
   abnormalities in asthma. Our objective was to evaluate regional lung
   structure and function using hyperpolarized He-3 magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) before, during and after a methacholine challenge (MCh).
   Methods: Twenty-five asthmatics (mean age = 34 +/- 11 years) and eight
   healthy volunteers (HV) (mean age = 33 +/- 11 years) underwent
   spirometry, plethysmography and hyperpolarized He-3 MRI prior to a MCh.
   MRI was repeated following the MCh and again 25 min after salbutamol
   administration. He-3 MRI gas distribution was quantified using
   semiautomated segmentation of the ventilation defect percent (VDP).
   Tissue microstructure was measured using the He-3 apparent diffusion
   coefficient (ADC). Analysis of variance with repeated measures was used
   to evaluate changes at each time point as well as to determine
   interactions between regions of interest (ROI) and subject group.
   Pearson's correlations were performed to evaluate associations between
   He-3 MRI measurements and established clinical measures.
   Results: In asthmatics, but not HV, whole-lung ADC was increased
   post-MCh (P < 0.01). In asthmatics only, ADC was increased post-MCh in
   posterior ROI (P < 0.01) and all ROI in the superior-inferior direction
   (P < 0.01). VDP was increased in posterior and inferior ROI (P < 0.001).
   There was a correlation between VDP and specific airway resistance (r =
   0.74, P < 0.0001), dyspnoea score (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and fractional
   exhaled nitric oxide (r = 0.45, P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: We evaluated the regional pulmonary response to
   methacholine and salbutamol using 3He MRI and showed heterogeneous VDP
   and ADC consistent with bronchoconstriction and gas trapping,
   respectively, post-MCh. These regional alterations resolved
   post-salbutamol.}},

   plates}},
Journal = {{THIN-WALLED STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The current study assesses the enhancement in the buckling capacity of
   steel plates through bonding glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP)
   plates. Despite their low modulus of elasticity, GFRP plates are
   relatively thick and, therefore, can be efficient in magnifying the
   buckling capacity of the retrofitted steel plates. In this application,
   a heavy duty adhesive system that was tested in a previous experimental
   programme is employed to bond the steel and the GFRP plates. The current
   study is conducted numerically using a nonlinear shell element model to
   simulate the steel and GFRP plates and a special contact element to
   simulate the flexibility of the adhesive medium. The failure modes in
   the adhesive and the GFRP plates, based on real strength values, as well
   as the instability of the entire system are considered. A buckling
   magnification factor relating the capacity of the retrofitted system to
   the capacity of the corresponding bare steel plate is evaluated. The
   study considers two types of boundary conditions as well as two types of
   in-plane compatibility between the steel and GFRP plates. The effect of
   geometric imperfection is also studied. Both elastic and inelastic
   stability analyses are considered in this investigation. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{One hundred and twenty-five new high-precision spectropolarimetric
   observations have been obtained with ESPaDOnS (Eschelle
   Spectro-Polarimetric Device for the Observation of Stars) at the
   CanadaFranceHawaii Telescope and Narval at Telescope Bernard Lyot to
   investigate the magnetic properties of the classical Be star ? Ori. No
   Stokes V signatures are detected in our polarimetric data. Measurements
   of the longitudinal magnetic field, with a median error bar of 30?G, and
   direct modelling of the mean least-squares deconvolved Stokes V profiles
   yield no evidence for a dipole magnetic field with polar surface
   strength greater than similar to 80?G. We are therefore unable to
   confirm the presence of the magnetic field previously reported by Neiner
   et al. However, our spectroscopic data reveal the presence of periodic
   emission variability in H and He lines analogous to that reported by
   Neiner et al., considered as evidence of magnetically confined
   circumstellar plasma clouds. We revisit this hypothesis in light of the
   new magnetic analysis. Calculation of the magnetospheric Kepler radius
   RK and confinement parameter ?{*} indicates that a surface dipole
   magnetic field with a polar strength larger than 63?G is sufficient to
   form of a centrifugally supported magnetosphere around ? Ori. Our data
   are not sufficiently sensitive to detect fields of this magnitude; we
   are therefore unable to confirm or falsify the magnetic cloud
   hypothesis. Based on our results, we examine three possible scenarios
   that could potentially explain the behaviour of ? Ori: (1) that no
   significant magnetic field is (or was) present in ? Ori, and that the
   observed phenomena have their origin in another mechanism or mechanisms
   than corotating clouds. We are, however, unable to identify one; (2)
   that ? Ori hosts an intermittent magnetic field produced by dynamo
   processes; however, no such process has been found so far to work in
   massive stars and especially to produce a dipolar field; and (3) that ?
   Ori hosts a stable, organized (fossil) magnetic field that is
   responsible for the observed phenomena, but with a strength that is
   below our current detection threshold. Of these three scenarios, we
   consider the second one (dynamo process) as highly unlikely, whereas the
   other two should be falsifiable with intense monitoring.}},

Volume = {{231}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{NaY zeolite nanoparticles were synthesized and shaped into the uniform
   spherical granules using a developed novel and simple two-step
   granulation technique. First, the alginate/nanozeolite or
   alginate/nanozeolite-bentonite spherical hybrid was successfully
   fabricated, and then the alginate was decomposed by calcinations
   resulting uniform spherical granules. To improve the mechanical
   stability of the prepared granules, bentonite was added as an inorganic
   binder at different ratios of 20 wt.\% to 40 wt.\%. Moreover, the effect
   of binder on the ion exchange properties of the prepared granules was
   studied. Increasing of binder content from 20 wt.\% to 40 wt.\% linearly
   enhanced the mechanical stability of the granules by 229\%.
   Nevertheless, the addition of binder decreased the N-2 adsorption
   capacity by 192\% at 77 K and reduced the maximum Sr2+ uptake per gram
   of granules by 35\%. It was revealed that the ion exchange and N-2
   adsorption capacities of the granulated NaY nanozeolites were,
   respectively, 24\% and 43\% higher than the micronsized granulated
   zeolite with the same amount of the binder (i.e. 20 wt.\% of bentonite).

Abstract = {{Liquid feed injection or spray atomization in gas-solid fluidized bed

   formation. Agglomeration has a detrimental effect in Fluid Cokers by
   increasing reactor fouling. The aim of this study is to understand the
   effect of fluidization velocity and various agglomerate properties, such
   as size and density, on the breakage of agglomerates in fluidized beds.
   Artificial agglomerates greatly improve the reproducibility and ease of
   the agglomerate stability measurements. They are fabricated from
   polyurethane foam, magnets and an RFID tag. Agglomerate breakage
   anywhere in the bed is detected with an RFID reader. The use of
   artificial agglomerates was validated by comparing their breakage rate
   to that of real liquid-solid agglomerates. Low density and smaller
   agglomerates break earlier as they spend more time near the highly

   bridges}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{248-259}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Modern cable-stayed bridges can be economically designed by applying
   optimum post-tensioning cable forces to achieve a minimum deflection and
   a uniform bending moment distribution in the bridge deck under the
   effect of dead loads. The determination of the optimum distribution of
   post-tensioning cable forces is an important task that affects the
   overall design of the bridge. In this study, a novel approach, combining
   finite element analysis, B-spline curves, and an optimization technique
   is presented to determine the optimum post-tensioning cable forces under
   dead load corresponding to the final configuration of the bridge. The
   new approach is based on using the B-spline curves to model the
   post-tensioning functions along the bridge. The Genetic Algorithm (GA),
   as a global search technique, is utilized to optimize shapes of
   post-tensioning functions to achieve minimum vertical deflections along
   the bridge deck. Optimizing shapes of post-tensioning functions instead
   of the cable forces decreases the number of the design variables. This
   reduction improves the convergence speed, the accuracy of final
   solutions, and the performance of the optimization technique. Another
   advantage of the proposed method is that it minimizes the vertical
   defection of the deck and the horizontal deflection of the pylon,
   simultaneously. The validity of this proposed method is checked by
   applying it to a bridge with geometry similar to an existing
   cable-stayed bridge. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The paper presents an experimental study to assess wind induced pressure
   on full-scale loose concrete roof pavers by using Wall of Wind, a
   large-scale hurricane testing facility at Florida International
   University. Experimental tests were conducted on full-scale concrete
   pavers mounted on a test building to evaluate wind-induced external and
   underneath pressures acting on the pavers. The study shows that roof
   pavers could be subjected to significant uplifting wind forces due to
   negative pressures. In corner and edge areas of the roof, pressure
   differences produced net uplift on the pavers, at design wind speed,
   that was greater than the individual weight of the pavers. The study
   provides new insights by testing the actual roofing material at high
   wind speeds in a controlled environment and also showed that locking the
   pavers together can mitigate the issues at corners and edges by
   increasing the weight of the pavers that acts together to counterbalance
   the net uplift pressure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   product yields from UTS irradiation were observed to be less than those
   obtained from CE heating and MW irradiation. CE heating resulted in the
   formation of two different crystal morphologies, whereas MW and UTS
   conditions rapidly produced small and homogeneous crystals. The energy
   consumption of UTS and MW irradiation were also shown to be far less

Title = {{Effect of a magnetic field on a two-dimensional metallic photonic
   crystal}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of a static magnetic field on the band structure of
   a two-dimensional metallic photonic crystal (MPC). The band structure of
   the MPC has been calculated using the transfer matrix method. It is
   found that the position of the photonic band gap and the band edges of
   the MPC depends on the polarization of the incident light and intensity
   of the applied magnetic field. In our calculations we consider linearly
   polarized light as well as right-and left-circularly polarized light. In
   the case of right-circularly polarized light it is found that as the
   intensity of the magnetic field increases the width of the band gap of
   the crystal decreases. At a certain magnetic field strength the band gap
   disappears altogether. In other words there is a transition from a
   metallic photonic band gap material to a transparent dielectric
   material. This is an interesting effect which is similar to the
   metal-insulator transition that occurs in semiconductors. On the other
   hand, for left-circularly and linear polarized light the band edges
   shift to the higher energy and the band gap increases in the presence of
   a magnetic field. This implies that the MPC switches from a transparent
   state to reflecting states due to the application of the magnetic field.
   This is an interesting effect which might be used to make photonic
   switches.}},

Abstract = {{Grafting from polymerization was used to synthesize
   nano-titania/polyurethane (nTiO(2)/polyurethane) composite coatings,
   where nTiO(2) was chemically attached to the backbone of the
   polyurethane polymer matrix with a bifunctional monomer,
   2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl) propionic acid (DMPA). This bifunctional monomer
   can coordinate to nTiO(2) through an available -COOH group, with two
   available hydroxyl groups that can react with diisocyanate terminated
   pre-polyurethane through step-growth polymerization. The coordination
   reaction was monitored by FTIR and TGA, with the coordination reaction
   found to follow first order kinetics. After step-growth polymerization,
   the polyurethane nanocomposites were found to be stable on standing with
   excellent distribution of Ti in the polymer matrix without any
   significant agglomeration compared to simple physical mixtures of
   nTiO(2) in the polyurethane coatings. The functionalized
   nTiO(2)-polyurethane composite coatings showed excellent antibacterial
   activity against gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli; 99\% of E.
   coli were killed within less than one hour under solar irradiation.
   Self-cleaning was also demonstrated using stearic acid as a model for

Abstract = {{A one-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal method (MAHM) has been
   developed to synthesize SnO2/graphene composites. It is shown that fine
   SnO2 nanoparticles with an average size of 3.5 nm can be homogeneously
   deposited on graphene nanosheets (GNSs) using this technique. The
   electronic structure as revealed from X-ray absorption near edge
   structure (XANES) shows that the SnO2 nanoparticles are abundant in
   surface defects with oxygen vacancies, which facilitate the
   immobilization of SnO2 onto GNSs by electronic interaction. Carbon K
   edge XANES provide direct evidence of strong interaction between SnO2
   and GNSs. The SnO2/graphene nanocomposites deliver a superior reversible
   capacity of 635 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and display excellent rate
   performance. All these desirable features strongly indicate that
   SnO2/graphene composite is a promising anode material in

Abstract = {{Bio-oil from the hydrothermal liquefaction of Eastern White Pine (Pinus
   strobus L.) sawdust was methylolated with formaldehyde in the presence
   of sodium hydroxide. The obtained methylolated bio-oil (MB) was used to
   synthesize methylolated bio-oilphenol formaldehyde (MBPF) resol resins
   with a phenol substitution ratio of up to 75 wt \%. All of the resins
   were used as wood adhesives for the production of a three-layered
   plywood. The MBPF resol resins were comprehensively characterized for
   their physical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties (e.g.,
   viscosity, nonvolatile content, shelf life, free formaldehyde level,
   molecular weight and distribution, curing temperature, bonding strength)
   when used as plywood adhesives. All of the MBPF resins contained similar
   nonvolatile contents as the reference pure phenol formaldehyde (PF)
   resin but had higher viscosities and shorter shelf lives, depending on
   the amount of MB in the MBPF. All of the MBPF resins displayed a lower
   curing temperature than the reference PF resin, with the main curing
   peak around 140 degrees C, which was similar to that of the pure PF
   resin. According to thermogravimetric analysis, the methylolation
   treatment of bio-oil improved the thermal stability of the MBPF resins
   compared to the bio-oilPF resol resins, which used untreated bio-oil.
   The dry/wet bonding strengths of the plywood specimens glued with the
   MBPF resol resins with up to 60 wt \% phenol substitution exceeded or
   were comparable to those of the conventional PF resol resin. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{In this study, an effort has been made to predict the solid-liquid
   equilibrium (SLE) behavior of different solids (pharmaceuticals) in many
   common solvents and their mixtures. A modified optimization of a recent
   thermodynamic model, the NRTL-SAC model, was used in all stages of
   calculation (VLE, LLE, and SLE predictions). The batch
   cooling-antisolvent crystallization process was simulated for seven
   model molecules from the initial temperature to the final temperature
   and for the volume fraction of each solvent. The feasible region of
   temperature for each crystallization case was calculated based on the
   bubble-point temperature of the solvent mixture and the melting point of
   the model molecules. The NRTL-SAC model was used in conjunction with the
   optimization procedure to test the complete miscibility of solvents
   during each part of crystallization. After estimating the optimum
   solvent mixture (combination) for a specific model molecule, the results
   for single, binary, and ternary solvent mixtures were compared. The
   results obtained from the binary and ternary combinations were similar
   in terms of crystallization yields per mass of solvent mixture and far
   superior to those obtained with single solvents. The proposed algorithm
   demonstrates flexibility, simplicity, and accuracy in predicting the
   phase behavior and eventual optimal solvent screening for the
   crystallization of pharmaceutical components.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamics of gas-solid flow were experimentally studied in depth in

   mu m at a wide range of air velocities (0.5-5.0 m/s) and solids
   circulation rates from 0 to 420 kg/m(2) s. A high density macro-flow
   structure, corresponding to homogeneous axial profiles with
   cross-sectional average solids holdup of higher than 0.25 and parabolic
   radial profiles of solids holdup from 0.15 to 0.50, was easily obtained

   Method and Divided Phase Cross-Correlation Method, solids holdups of the
   dense and dilute phases and dense phase fraction, local net solids flux
   and apparent particle velocity were predicted from the solids holdup
   signals. The results demonstrated that CTFB was characterized by dilute
   dominating flow in the center and dense phase dominating flow in the
   annular region, different from dense phase dominating flow in bubbling
   fluidized bed and dilute phase dominating flow in fast fluidized bed.
   The results also displayed that the local net solids flux and the local

   solution pH between 3 and 6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   results demonstrate the theoretical multiplet peaks for iron and
   chromium adsorbed iron at the surface of the gamma-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4
   mixture. Theoretical multiplet analysis shows that during Cr adsorption,
   the amount of maghemite increases (from 70 to 89\%). In magnetite
   spectra, the relative content of Fe(II) decreases from 8.2 to 3.6\%
   indicating the reduction of magnetite in the mixture particles. In Raman
   spectroscopy studies, clear peaks of chromium on iron oxide were
   generated at 826 cm(-1), which could be attributed to chemical
   interactions between chromium compound and iron oxide. From the results
   of Raman and XPS studies, electrostatic attraction and
   oxidation-reduction between chromium and mixed maghemite-magnetite are
   postulated as mechanisms for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous
   solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sample preparation method for percentage recovery of total sulphur
   (\%S) in reactive mine tailings based on ultrasound-assisted digestion
   (USAD) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy
   (ICP-OES) was developed. The influence of various methodological factors
   was screened by employing a two-level and three-factor (2(3)) full
   factorial design and using KZK-1, a sericite schist certified reference
   material (CRM), to find the optimal combination of studied factors and
   \%S. Factors such as the sonication time, temperature and acid
   combination were studied, with the best result identified as 20 min of
   sonication, 80 degrees C temperature and 1 ml of HNO3:1 ml of HCl, which
   can achieve 100\% recovery for the selected CRM. Subsequently a fraction
   of the 2(3) full factorial design was applied to mine tailings. The
   percentage relative standard deviation (\%RSD) for the ultrasound method
   is less than 3.0\% for CRM and less than 6\% for the mine tailings. The
   investigated method was verified by X-ray diffraction analysis. The USAD
   method compared favorably with existing methods such as hot plate
   assisted digestion method. X-ray fluorescence and LECO (TM)-CNS method.

Abstract = {{This study uses micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging for
   assessment of concentration and transport mechanisms of ocular drug
   surrogates following intravitreal injection. Injections of an iodinated
   contrast agent were administered to enucleated porcine eyes prior to
   scanning over 192 min. Image analysis was performed using signal
   profiles and regions of interest that corresponded to specific iodine
   concentrations. Diffusion coefficients of the injected iodine solutions
   were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis with a diffusion
   model. There was a predominantly diffusive component in the movement of
   the contrast to the back of the eye in the horizontal (sagittal \&
   coronal) directions, with ultimate retinal fate observed after 120 min.
   The diffusion coefficients were found to have a mean of 4.87 x 10(-4)
   mm(2) s(-1) and standard deviation of 8.39 x 10(-5) mm(2) s(-1) for 150
   mg ml(-1) iodine concentration and 6.13 x 10(-4) +/- 1.83 x 10(-4) mm(2)
   s(-1) for 37.5 mg ml(-1) concentration. However, it should be noted that
   these coefficients were time dependent and were found to decay as the
   diffusion front interacted with the retinal wall. A real-time, accurate,
   non-invasive method of tracking a bolus and its concentration is
   achieved using a high spatial resolution and fast scanning speed
   micro-CT system.}},

Title = {{Pre-Diabetes Augments Neuropeptide Y-1- and alpha(1)-Receptor Control of
   Basal Hindlimb Vascular Tone in Young ZDF Rats}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Peripheral vascular disease in pre-diabetes may involve
   altered sympathetically-mediated vascular control. Thus, we investigated
   if pre-diabetes modifies baseline sympathetic Y-1-receptor (Y1R) and
   alpha(1)-receptor (alpha R-1) control of hindlimb blood flow (Q(fem))
   and vascular conductance (VC).
   Methods: Q(fem) and VC were measured in pre-diabetic ZDF rats (PD) and
   lean controls (CTRL) under infusion of BIBP3226 (Y1R antagonist),
   prazosin (alpha R-1 antagonist) and BIBP3226+prazosin. Neuropeptide Y
   (NPY) concentration and Y1R and alpha R-1 expression were determined
   from hindlimb skeletal muscle samples.
   Results: Baseline Q(fem) and VC were similar between groups. Independent
   infusions of BIBP3226 and prazosin led to increases in Q(fem) and VC in
   CTRL and PD, where responses were greater in PD (p<0.05). The percent
   change in VC following both drugs was also greater in PD compared to
   CTRL (p<0.05). As well, Q(fem) and VC responses to combined blockade
   (BIBP3226+prazosin) were greater in PD compared to CTRL (p<0.05).
   Interestingly, an absence of synergistic effects was observed within
   groups, as the sum of the VC responses to independent drug infusions was
   similar to responses following combined blockade. Finally, white and red
   vastus skeletal muscle NPY concentration, Y1R expression and alpha R-1
   expression were greater in PD compared to CTRL.
   Conclusions: For the first time, we report heightened baseline Y1R and
   alpha R-1 sympathetic control of Q(fem) and VC in prediabetic ZDF rats.
   In support, our data suggest that augmented sympathetic ligand and
   receptor expression in pre-diabetes may contribute to vascular
   dysregulation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate shuffle-decomposability into two words. We give an

   decomposable, the sublinear time complexity of only determining the two
   words under the assumption of decomposability is surprising given the
   complexity of shuffle, and demonstrates an interesting property of the
   operation.
   We also show that for given words u and u and a DFA M we can determine

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In order to understand the effects of inertia and gravity on draw
   resonance and on the physical mechanism of draw resonance in
   three-dimensional Newtonian film casting, a linear stability analysis
   has been conducted. An eigenvalue problem resulting from the linear
   stability analysis is formulated and solved as a nonlinear two-point
   boundary value problem to determine the critical draw ratios. Neutral
   stability curves are plotted to separate the stable/unstable domain in
   different appropriate parameter spaces. Both inertia and gravity
   stabilize the process and the process is more unstable to two- than to
   three-dimensional disturbances. The effects of inertia and gravity on
   the physical mechanism of draw resonance have been investigated using
   the eigenfunctions from the eigenvalue problem. A new approach is
   introduced in order to evaluate the traveling times of kinematic waves
   from the perturbed thickness at the take-up, which satisfies the same
   stability criterion illustrating the general stability of the system.

Abstract = {{Purpose: Volumetric x-ray microcomputed tomography (CT) can be employed
   in a variety of quantitative research applications such as image-guided
   interventions or characterization of medical devices. To ensure the
   highest geometric fidelity of images for these applications, a phantom
   and image processing algorithm have been developed to calibrate the
   scaling accuracy of micro-CT scanners to a traceable standard and
   provide corrections to image voxel sizing.
   Methods: The calibration phantom contains six borosilicate beads whose
   separations have been measured to a traceable standard. An image
   processing algorithm compares the known separations of the beads to
   their separations in micro-CT images. A least-squares solution is used
   to determine linear scaling correction factors along each of the three
   scanner axes to minimize errors in the bead separations within the
   images by correcting the image voxel size. The correction factors were
   applied to images of a similar phantom with beads at different positions
   to evaluate the ability of the correction factors to reduce errors at
   points independent of the fiducial locations in the calibration phantom.
   The calibration phantom was used to evaluate the scaling accuracy of
   five different micro-CT scanners representing four different scanner
   models.
   Results: In two of the five scanners evaluated, the correction factors
   significantly reduced the mean error in bead separations in the images
   from 0.17\% to 0.05\% and from 0.37\% to 0.07\% of the actual bead
   separations, respectively. Scanners yielding similar voxel sizes
   possessed comparable geometric errors after correction using the
   phantom.
   Conclusions: Although the magnitude of the corrections is small, such
   corrections can be important for demanding micro-CT applications. Even
   if no voxel size correction is required, the phantom provides an easily
   implemented method to verify the geometric fidelity of micro-CT scanners
   to a traceable standard of measurement. (C) 2012 American Association of

Title = {{Measurement of joint kinematics using a conventional clinical
   single-perspective flat-panel radiography system}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{6090-6103}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The ability to accurately measure joint kinematics is an
   important tool in studying both normal joint function and pathologies
   associated with injury and disease. The purpose of this study is to
   evaluate the efficacy, accuracy, precision, and clinical safety of
   measuring 3D joint motion using a conventional flat-panel radiography
   system prior to its application in an in vivo study.
   Methods: An automated, image-based tracking algorithm was implemented to
   measure the three-dimensional pose of a sparse object from a
   two-dimensional radiographic projection. The algorithm was tested to
   determine its efficiency and failure rate, defined as the number of
   image frames where automated tracking failed, or required user
   intervention. The accuracy and precision of measuring three-dimensional
   motion were assessed using a robotic controlled, tibiofemoral knee
   phantom programmed to mimic a subject with a total knee replacement
   performing a stair ascent activity. Accuracy was assessed by comparing
   the measurements of the single-plane radiographic tracking technique to
   those of an optical tracking system, and quantified by the measurement
   discrepancy between the two systems using the Bland-Altman technique.
   Precision was assessed through a series of repeated measurements of the
   tibiofemoral kinematics, and was quantified using the across-trial
   deviations of the repeated kinematic measurements. The safety of the
   imaging procedure was assessed by measuring the effective dose of
   ionizing radiation associated with the x-ray exposures, and analyzing
   its relative risk to a human subject.
   Results: The automated tracking algorithm displayed a failure rate of
   2\% and achieved an average computational throughput of 8 image
   frames/s. Mean differences between the radiographic and optical
   measurements for translations and rotations were less than 0.08 mm and
   0.07 degrees in-plane, and 0.24 mm and 0.6 degrees out-of-plane. The
   repeatability of kinematics measurements performed using the
   radiographic tracking technique was better than +/- 0.09 mm and 0.12
   degrees in-plane, and +/- 0.70 mm and +/- 0.07 degrees out-of-plane. The
   effective dose associated with the imaging protocol used was 15 mu Sv
   for 10 s of radiographic cine acquisition.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability to accurately measure
   knee-joint kinematics using a single-plane radiographic measurement
   technique. The measurement technique can be easily implemented at most
   clinical centers equipped with a modern-day radiographic x-ray system.
   The dose of ionizing radiation associated with the image acquisition
   represents a minimal risk to any subjects undergoing the examination.

Abstract = {{Crystalline SnO2 nanowires with smooth surface and uniform diameter were
   readily produced via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method on various
   current collectors including carbon paper, stainless steel and copper.
   The growth followed a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism employing a
   gold thin film as the catalyst. Morphology, composition and structure of
   the SnO2 nanowires on different collectors were characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction
   (XRD). Morphology results demonstrated that the growth of SnO2 nanowires
   only occurred in a narrow temperature range, while the structure and
   composition information unveiled the correlation between the quality of
   the nanowires and the employed substrates. The unique architecture of
   SnO2 nanowires directly growing on current collectors are expected to
   act as building blocks in producing various types of nanodevices,

Abstract = {{Fast angiogenesis in 3D fibrous constructs that mimic the morphology of
   the extracellular matrix remains challenging due to limited porosity in
   the densely packed constructs. We investigated whether mimicking the in
   vivo chemotaxis microenvironment for native blood vessel formation would
   stimulate angiogenesis in the fibrous constructs. The chemotaxis
   microenvironment was created by introducing 3D angiogenic growth factor
   gradients into the constructs. We have developed a technique that can
   quickly fabricate (similar to 40 min) such 3D gradients by
   simultaneously electrospinning polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers,
   encapsulating gradient amount of bFGF (stabilized by heparin) into
   poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres, and electrospraying the
   microspheres into PCL fibers. Gradient formation was confirmed by
   fluorescence microscopy. Gradients with different steepnesses were
   obtained by modulating the initial concentration of the bFGF solution.
   All of the constructs were able to sustainedly release bioactive bFGF
   over a 28 day period. The release kinetics was dependent on the bFGF
   loading and steepness of the gradient. In vitro cell migration study
   demonstrated that bFGF gradients significantly increased the depth of
   cell migration. To assess the efficacy of bFGF gradients in inducing
   angiogenesis, we implanted constructs subcutaneously using mouse model.
   bFGF gradients significantly promoted cell penetration into the
   constructs. After 10 days of implantation, a high density of mature
   blood vessels (positive to both CD31 and alpha-SMA) were formed in the
   constructs. Vessel density was increased with the increase in steepness
   of the bFGF gradient. These gradient constructs may have potential to
   engineer vascularized tissues for various applications.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study described in this paper was the development
   of novel polymer/ceramic nanocomposite coatings for implants through the
   application of ultrafine powder coating technology. Polyester resins
   were combined with mu m-sized TiO2 (25\%) as the biocompatibility agent,
   nTiO(2) (0.5\%) as the flow additive and mineral trioxide aggregates
   (ProRoot (R) MTA, 5\%) as bioactive ceramics. Ultrafine powders were
   prepared and applied to titanium to create continuous polymeric powder
   coatings (PPCs) through the application of electrostatic ultrafine
   powder coating technology. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis confirmed
   that MTA had been incorporated into the PPCs, and elemental mapping
   showed that it had formed small clusters that were evenly distributed
   across the surface. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed
   continuous and smooth, but highly textured surface coatings that
   contrasted with the scalloped appearance of commercially pure titanium
   (cpTi) controls. Atomic force microscopy revealed intricate
   nano-topographies with an abundance of submicron-sized pits and
   nano-projections, evenly dispersed across their surfaces. Inverted
   fluorescence microscopy, SEM and cell counts showed that human embryonic
   palatal mesenchymal cells attached and spread out onto PPC and
   MTA-enriched PPCs within 24 h. Mitochondrial enzyme activity measured
   viable and metabolically active cells on all of the surfaces. After 72 h
   of growth, cell counts and metabolic activity were significantly higher
   (P < 0.05) on the grey-MTA enriched PPC surfaces, than on unmodified PPC
   and cpTi. The novel polymer/ceramic nanocomposites that were created
   with ultrafine powder coating technology were continuous, homogenous and
   nano-rough coatings that enhanced human mesenchymal cell attachment and
   growth.}},

Title = {{Alterations in Default Mode Network Connectivity During Pain Processing

Abstract = {{Context: Recent neuroimaging studies have associated activity in the
   default mode network (DMN) with self-referential and pain processing,
   both of which are altered in borderline personality disorder (BPD). In
   patients with BPD, antinociception has been linked to altered activity
   in brain regions involved in the cognitive and affective evaluation of
   pain. Findings in healthy subjects indicate that painful stimulation
   leads to blood oxygenation level-dependent signal decreases and changes
   in the functional architecture of the DMN.
   Objectives: To connect the previously separate research areas of DMN
   connectivity and altered pain perception in BPD and to explore DMN
   connectivity during pain processing in patients with BPD.
   Design: Case-control study.
   Setting: University hospital.
   Participants: Twenty-five women with BPD, including 23 (92\%) with a
   history of self-harm, and 22 age-matched control subjects.
   Interventions: Psychophysical assessment and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during painful heat vs neutral temperature
   stimulation.
   Main Outcome Measure: Connectivity of DMN as assessed via independent
   component analysis and psychophysiological interaction analysis.
   Results: Compared with control subjects, patients with BPD showed less
   integration of the left retrosplenial cortex and left superior frontal
   gyrus into the DMN. Higher BPD symptom severity and trait dissociation
   were associated with an attenuated signal decrease of the DMN in
   response to painful stimulation. During pain vs neutral, patients with
   BPD exhibited less posterior cingulate cortex seed region connectivity
   with the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   Conclusions: Patients with BPD showed significant alterations in DMN
   connectivity, with differences in spatial integrity and temporal
   characteristics. These alterations may reflect a different cognitive and
   affective appraisal of pain as less self-relevant and aversive as well
   as a deficiency in the switching between baseline and task-related
   processing. This deficiency may be related to everyday difficulties of
   patients with BPD in regulating their emotions, focusing mindfully on 1
   task at a time, and efficiently shifting their attention from one task
   to another.

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A low cost method to convert triglycerides to biodiesel by
   transesterification reaction has been investigated. The new approach is
   based on controlled feeding of oil into a pool of alcohol allowing easy
   dispersion of oil creating large interfacial area for mass transfer. It
   also enabled equilibrium constants to shift in the forward direction due
   to excess of alcohol in the dispersion. As a result product yield higher
   than 95\% could be achieved at lower energy input compared to
   conventional method. Comparisons made with conventional batch and
   co-solvent enabled method show differences and highlight improvements.
   Reactions were conducted in one liter reactor at various residence time,
   temperature and molar ratio of canola oil with methanol in presence of
   potassium hydroxide as the catalyst. Samples were collected at regular
   intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to determine the

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   To highlight the recent advances in the understanding of the diagnosis
   and management of viral inner ear disorders. Congenital sensorineural
   hearing loss (cSNHL), sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL),
   Meniere's disease, and vestibular neuritis/viral labyrinthitis are
   discussed.
   Recent findings
   Cytomegalovirus infection during pregnancy is an under-recognized cause
   of hearing loss and central nervous system disease amongst the general
   population. Prevention of maternal infection and treatment of affected
   newborns with ganciclovir are promising interventions. Recent evidence
   in SSNHL patients has resulted in recommendations against viral serology
   or the use of antivirals. There appears to be an increased risk of SSNHL
   in patients with comorbid hypertension and diabetes. The viral
   hypothesis of Meniere's disease remains unproven. In patients with an
   acute episode of vestibular neuritis, there is presently not sufficient
   evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids or antiviral
   medications.
   Summary
   cSNHL remains the most clearly defined of the viral inner ear disorders.
   The evidence for viral involvement in SSNHL, Meniere's disease, and
   vestibular neuritis is indirect and equivocal. This review highlights
   the recent advancements in the diagnosis and management of these
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an enhanced control strategy for electronically

   ride through network faults, irrespective of whether they take place
   within the host microgrid or impact the upstream grid. Moreover, the
   proposed control ensures acceptable power quality for the duration of
   the faults, which is an important feature for protection against certain
   classes of faults, as well as for sensitive loads. Further, the paper
   proposes a supplementary control loop that improves the microgrid
   post-fault recovery. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy
   is demonstrated through a comprehensive set of simulation studies,

Abstract = {{An artificial neural network (ANN) approach is investigated to model and
   study the phase holdup distributions of a liquid-solid circulating
   fluidized bed (LSCFB) system. The ANN model is developed based on
   different operating parameters of the LSCFB including primary and
   auxiliary liquid velocities, and superficial solids velocity. The
   competency of the model is examined by comparing the model predicted and
   the experimental phase holdup of the LSCFB riser reactor. It is also
   found that the ANN model successfully predicted the radial
   non-uniformity of phase holdup that is observed in the experimental runs
   of the riser. When compared, the model predicted output and trend of
   radial flow structure for solids holdup are in well agreement with the
   experiments. The mean absolute percentage error is around 6\% and the
   correlation coefficient value of the predicted output and the
   experimental data is 0.992. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct jet impingement boiling heat transfer operating at low flow rates
   is of great interest for the localized moderate heat fluxes from the
   targets with delicate mechanical structure, where the aggressive
   techniques such as high-speed jets are not suitable. Boiling heat
   transfer from an upward facing disk targeted by a falling jet was
   studied experimentally at different volumetric flow rates and various
   jet lengths. The working fluid was chosen to be the dielectric liquid
   HFE7100 and the heated spot was an 8-mm diameter disk. Using previous
   CHF correlations in their original form, valid at very low volumetric
   flow rates, results in large disagreements since it was found that
   variation in the jet length changes the boiling characteristics. It is
   demonstrated that although the circular hydraulic jump formation within
   the heater diameter may suppress the heat transfer under certain
   conditions, moving the jet closer to the target may significantly
   improve the boiling curves at the critical heat flux (CHF) regime. At
   low flow rates, the CHF increases as the jet length decreases while for
   moderate and high flow rates the boiling curves show approximately a
   universal behavior for different jet lengths. For such low flow rates,
   the effect of jet length on boiling curves was shown to be related to
   the variation of the cross section of the falling jet and the formation
   of hydraulic jump at radial distances smaller than the heater diameter.
   The current CHF results for different jet lengths are correlated by
   including the effect of jet length in the previous correlation proposed
   by Sharan and Lienhard. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solid acid catalysts, which have favorable characteristics such as
   efficient activity, high selectivity, long catalyst life and ease in
   recovery and reuse, have great potential for efficiently transforming
   lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels and can replace many conventional
   liquid acids for hydrolysis and pretreatment. This work briefly
   introduces conventional biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis techniques,
   and reviews in detail the characteristics of biomass hydrolysis for five
   types of solid acid catalysts grouped as H-form zeolites,
   transition-metal oxides, cation-exchange resins, supported solid acids
   and heteropoly compounds. Carbonaceous solid acid (CSA) catalysts are
   considered as the most promising catalyst for cellulose hydrolysis,
   since they provide good access of reactants to the acidic sites of SO3H
   groups. High glucose yields of up to 75\% with 80\% selectivity have
   been achieved at 150 degrees C for 24 h with CSA. However, separation of
   CSA from un-hydrolyzed cellulose residues after hydrolysis needs further
   research since these catalysts have similar physical and chemical
   properties to the residues. Use of functionalized CSA catalysts that
   contain paramagnetic groups is one method to improve CSA separation and
   reuse. Suggestions are given for promoting catalytic efficiency for each
   kind of solid acid catalysts. Methods to promote reactions or increase
   selectivities such as microwave, ultrasonication and nanotechnology are
   introduced. Finally, we highlight a recent strategy that exploits
   acid-functionalized paramagnetic nanoparticles suitable for cellulose
   hydrolysis, and address new opportunities for the use of solid acid
   catalysts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Operations of existing reservoirs will be affected by climate change.
   Reservoir operating rules developed using historical information will
   not provide the optimal use of storage under changing hydrological
   conditions. In this paper, an integrated reservoir management system has
   been developed to adapt existing reservoir operations to changing
   climatic conditions. The reservoir management system integrates: (1) the
   K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) weather generator model; (2) the HEC-HMS
   hydrological model; and (3) the Differential Evolution (DE) optimization
   model. Six future weather scenarios are employed to verify the
   integrated reservoir management system using Upper Thames River basin in
   Canada as a case study. The results demonstrate that the integrated
   system provides optimal reservoir operation rule curves that reflect the
   hydrologic characteristics of future climate scenarios. Therefore, they
   may be useful for the development of reservoir climate change adaptation

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing is one of the most challenging issues of Cognitive
   Radio communications. The possibility of extremely low signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) of the received signal poses a fundamental challenge to
   spectrum sensing. In this paper, pilot-based spectrum sensing for OFDM
   signals is investigated. It is shown that the existing pilot-based OFDM
   spectrum sensing algorithms suffer from the frequency offset between the
   transmitter and sensing devices, as well as the noise uncertainty in the
   sensing threshold design. We consequently propose a robust pilot-based
   spectrum sensing algorithm for low SNR OFDM signals using a sliding
   frequency correlator. The proposed algorithm processes additional
   bandwidth to eliminate the impact of frequency offset. In addition,
   considering the unknown noise statistics and its time-varying nature, a
   ratio threshold which is not sensitive to the noise power level is
   derived for spectrum sensing. Our theoretical analysis and simulation
   results show that this algorithm can achieve exceptionally good sensing
   performance at very low SNR, while being insensitive to time and
   frequency offsets and requiring no information of the noise statistics.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporation of endogenous elastin, a key structural component of the
   vascular extracellular matrix (ECM), is an important requirement for
   engineered vascular tissues. In addition to providing elastic recoil of
   the tissue, elastin influences cell function and promotes cell signaling
   by interacting with specific cell surface receptors. Although progress
   has been made in understanding the mechanisms of in vivo elastin
   expression and incorporation into fibers, it is notably absent from
   engineered vessels. Recently we showed that the three-dimensional (3D)
   scaffold topography was able to upregulate elastin synthesis by human
   coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC). The present study was
   undertaken to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for 3D
   scaffold-induced elastin gene transcription. Here, we show several lines
   of evidence that signal transduction pathway leading to elastin gene
   expression by HCASMC cultured in synthetic 3D scaffolds to be strikingly
   different from two-dimensional (2D) surfaces. In 3D scaffolds, alpha 5
   beta 1 integrin engagement by HCASMC was significantly reduced and the
   putative focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was poorly phosphorylated
   concomitant with FAK and protein tyrosine kinase Pyk2 downregulation.
   FAK-associated adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin were also
   significantly downregulated by the 3D scaffold topography. Furthermore,
   contrary to 2D cultures, HCASMC cultured on 3D scaffolds had no Rho
   activation suggesting pliability of the elastomeric synthetic scaffold.
   Elastin expression in 3D cultures followed Ras-ERK1/2 signal
   transduction pathway and was further dependent on endogenously expressed
   interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Blocking of ERK1/2 activation using a
   pharmacologic inhibitor reduced both elastin and IL-1 beta gene
   expressions in 3D cultures. Transient transfection of IL-1 beta using
   siRNA, however, did not affect ERK1/2 activation but downregulated
   elastin gene expression suggesting that endogenous IL-1 beta acts
   downstream from ERK1/2. Taken together, results of the present study
   provide evidence that endogenous IL-1 beta play a role in elastin gene
   upregulation and, that this upregulation is mediated by the Ras-ERK1/2
   pathway in 3D cultures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium implant osseointegration is dependent on the cellular response
   to surface modifications and coatings. Titania-enriched nanocomposite
   polymeric resin coatings were prepared through the application of
   advanced ultrafine powder coating technology. Their surfaces were
   readily modified to create nano-rough (<100 nm) surface
   nano-topographies that supported human embryonic palatal mesenchymal
   cell responses. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirmed
   continuous and homogenous coatings with a similar composition and even
   distribution of titanium. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed
   complex micro-topographies, and atomic force microscopy revealed
   intricate nanofeatures and surface roughness. Cell counts, mitochondrial
   enzyme activity reduction of yellow
   3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to
   dark purple, SEM, and inverted fluorescence microscopy showed a marked
   increase in cell attachment, spreading, proliferation, and metabolic
   activity on the nanostructured surfaces. Reverse Transcription-
   Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that type I collagen
   and Runx2 expression were induced, and Alizarin red staining showed that
   mineral deposits were abundant in the cell cultures grown on
   nanosurfaces. This enhancement in human mesenchymal cell attachment,
   growth, and osteogenesis were attributed to the nanosized surface
   topographies, roughness, and moderate wetting characteristics of the
   coatings. Their dimensional similarity to naturally occurring matrix
   proteins and crystals, coupled with their increased surface area for
   protein adsorption, may have facilitated the response. Therefore, this
   application of ultrafine powder coating technology affords highly
   biocompatible surfaces that can be readily modified to accentuate the

Abstract = {{Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
   System (ANFIS) modeling techniques are applied to study the radial and
   axial solids holdup distributions in a liquid-solid circulating
   fluidized bed (LSCFB) system. The modeling process is based on the
   experiments that were conducted using 500 mu m size glass beads as solid
   phase. The radial nonuniformity of the solids holdup is observed under
   different superficial liquid-velocities at superficial solids velocity
   of 0.95 cm/s and auxiliary liquid-velocity of 1.4 cm/s at four axial
   locations (H = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 3.8 m above the distributor). The
   effects of different operating parameters such as auxiliary and primary
   liquid-velocities and superficial solids velocity on radial phase
   distribution in different axial positions of the riser are considered in
   the model development and analysis. The adequacy of the developed models
   is investigated by comparing the model predicted and experimental solids
   holdup data obtained from the pilot scale LSCFB reactor. Radial
   nonuniformity of the solids holdup is observed under different
   superficial liquid-velocities at superficial solids velocity of 0.95
   cm/s and auxiliary liquid-velocities of 1.4 cm/s at four axial locations
   (H = 1, 2, 3, and 3.8 m above the distributor). The cross-sectional
   average solids holdup in axial directions is compared to the output of
   the two models. The model outputs show good agreements with the
   experimental data and reasonable trends of phase distributions. The
   correlation coefficient values of the predicted output and the
   experimental data are 0.95 and 0.96 for ANFIS and ANN models,
   respectively.}},

   transformation of carbamazepine from form II to form III in 1-propanol.
   The polymorphic forms initially crystallized from solution, in the
   absence of seeds, could be clearly identified by FBRM and showed good
   agreement with results of microscopic images. Furthermore, the kinetics
   of the conversion of carbamazepine from metastable form to the stable
   form at different cooling rates could be readily followed.}},

Abstract = {{Self-immolative polymers containing 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol alternating
   with either N-methylaminoethanol or 2-mercaptoethanol spacers were
   synthesized and demonstrated to controllably depolymerize in response to
   the cleavage of a stabilizing end-cap from the polymer termini. These
   new polymers depolymerized at much higher rates than the previously
   reported polymer containing an N,Ni-dimethylethylenediamine spacer, with
   the time scales for complete depolymerization reduced from days to
   hours. Herein, we report the design and synthetic strategies for
   incorporating both stronger nucleophilic and electrophilic sites to
   induce faster cyclization reactions, which are known to be the
   rate-limiting steps in the depolymerization of this class of
   self-immolative polymers. These modifications and results demonstrate
   that the proposed structure-to-property relationships translate to the
   development of new polymer backbones for applications that require rapid

Title = {{Cost Effectiveness of Screening Strategies for Early Identification of

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the cost, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness
   of HIV and HCV screening of injection drug users IDUs) in opioid
   replacement therapy (ORT).
   Design: Dynamic compartmental model of HIV and HCV in a population of
   IDUs and non-IDUs for a representative U.S. urban center with 2.5
   million adults (age 15-59).
   Methods: We considered strategies of screening individuals in ORT for
   HIV, HCV, or both infections by antibody or antibody and viral RNA
   testing. We evaluated one-time and repeat screening at intervals from
   annually to once every 3 months. We calculated the number of HIV and HCV
   infections, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).
   Results: Adding HIV and HCV viral RNA testing to antibody testing averts
   14.8-30.3 HIV and 3.7-7.7 HCV infections in a screened population of
   26,100 IDUs entering ORT over 20 years, depending on screening
   frequency. Screening for HIV antibodies every 6 months costs
   \$30,700/QALY gained. Screening for HIV antibodies and viral RNA every 6
   months has an ICER of \$65,900/QALY gained. Strategies including HCV
   testing have ICERs exceeding \$100,000/QALY gained unless awareness of
   HCV-infection status results in a substantial reduction in
   needle-sharing behavior.
   Discussion: Although annual screening for antibodies to HIV and HCV is
   modestly cost effective compared to no screening, more frequent
   screening for HIV provides additional benefit at less cost. Screening
   individuals in ORT every 3-6 months for HIV infection using both
   antibody and viral RNA technologies and initiating ART for acute HIV
   infection appears cost effective.}},

Abstract = {{New tools that allow dynamic visualization of molecular neural events
   are important for studying the basis of brain activity and disease.
   Sensors that permit ligand-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   are useful reagents due to the noninvasive nature and good temporal and
   spatial resolution of MR methods. Paramagnetic metalloproteins can be
   effective MRI sensors due to the selectivity imparted by the protein
   active site and the ability to tune protein properties using techniques
   such as directed evolution. Here, we show that structure-guided directed
   evolution of the active site of the cytochrome P450-BM3 heme domain
   produces highly selective MRI probes with submicromolar affinities for
   small molecules. We report a new, high-affinity dopamine sensor as well
   as the first MRI reporter for serotonin, with which we demonstrate
   quantification of neurotransmitter release in vitro. We also present a
   detailed structural analysis of evolved cytochrome P450-BM3 heme domain
   lineages to systematically dissect the molecular basis of
   neurotransmitter binding affinity, selectivity, and enhanced MRI
   contrast activity in these engineered proteins. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Discovery of a magnetic field in the early B-type star sigma Lupi}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{545}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Context. Magnetic early B-type stars are rare. Indirect indicators are
   needed to identify them before investing in time-intensive
   spectropolarimetric observations.
   Aims. We use the strongest indirect indicator of a magnetic field in B
   stars, which is periodic variability of ultraviolet (UV) stellar wind
   lines occurring symmetric about the approximate rest wavelength. Our aim
   is to identify probable magnetic candidates which would become targets
   for follow-up spectropolarimetry to search for a magnetic field.
   Methods. From the UV wind line variability the B1/B2V star sigma Lupi
   emerged as a new magnetic candidate star. AAT spectropolarimetric
   measurements with SEMPOL were obtained. The longitudinal component of
   the magnetic field integrated over the visible surface of the star was
   determined with the least-squares deconvolution method.
   Results. The UV line variations of sigma Lupi are similar to what is
   known in magnetic B stars, but no periodicity could be determined. We
   detected a varying longitudinal magnetic field with amplitude of about
   100 G with error bars of typically 20 G, which supports an oblique
   magnetic-rotator configuration. The equivalent width variations of the
   UV lines, the magnetic and the optical-line variations are consistent
   with the photometric period of 3.02 d, which we identify with the
   rotation period of the star. Additional observations with ESPaDOnS
   attached to the CFHT confirmed this discovery, and allowed the
   determination of a precise magnetic period. Analysis revealed that sigma
   Lupi is a helium-strong star, with an enhanced nitrogen abundance and an
   underabundance of carbon, and has a chemically spotted surface.
   Conclusions. sigma Lupi is a magnetic oblique rotator, and is a
   He-strong star. Like in other magnetic B stars the UV wind emission
   appears to originate close to the magnetic equatorial plane, with
   maximum emission occurring when a magnetic pole points towards the
   Earth. The 3.01972 +/- 0.00043 d magnetic rotation period is consistent
   with the photometric period, with maximum light corresponding to maximum
   magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{Application of quantitative myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) for the
   assessment of coronary artery disease may have a significant effect on
   patient care as the functional significance of a coronary stenosis can
   be evaluated through absolute measurement of the downstream myocardial
   perfusion (MP) both at rest and under exercise or pharmacologic stress.
   A main challenge of myocardial CTP is beam hardening (BH), arising from
   the polychromatic nature of x-rays used in CT scanning and the presence
   of highly attenuating contrast agent in the heart chambers during the CT
   acquisition. The BH effect induces significant nonuniform shifts in CT
   numbers which, if uncorrected, can lead to inaccurate assessment of MP.
   With the recent developments of dual-energy CT (DECT) scanning on
   clinical scanners, the BH effect on MP measurement could be reduced with
   the generation of monochromatic images relatively free of BH artifacts
   from the acquired dual-energy data. Here, we review the different
   techniques of acquiring dual-energy scans and generating monochromatic
   images, followed by discussion on the progress of developing a DECT
   technique with reduced radiation dose for quantitative myocardial CTP.

   Stabilization}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic displacement is a mass removal technology suitable for
   stabilization of a dense, nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone,
   where stabilization is defined as reducing DNAPL saturations and
   reducing the risk of future pool mobilization. High resolution
   three-dimensional multiphase flow simulations incorporating a spatially
   correlated, heterogeneous porous medium illustrate that hydraulic
   displacement results in an increase in the amount of residual DNAPL
   present, which in turn results in increased solute concentrations in
   groundwater, an increase in the rate of DNAPL dissolution, and an
   increase in the solute mass flux. A higher percentage of DNAPL recovery
   is associated with higher initial DNAPL release volumes, lower density
   DNAPLs, more heterogeneous porous media, and increased drawdown of
   groundwater at extraction wells. The fact that higher rates of recovery
   are associated with more heterogeneous porous media stems from the fact
   that larger contrasts in permeability provide for a higher proportion of
   capillary barriers upon which DNAPL pooling and lateral migration can
   occur. Across all scenarios evaluated in this study, the ganglia-to-pool
   (GTP) ratio generally increased from approximately 0.1 to between
   approximately 0.3 and 0.7 depending on the type of DNAPL, the degree of
   heterogeneity, and the imposed hydraulic gradient. The volume of DNAPL
   recovered as a result of implementing hydraulic displacement ranged from
   between 9.4\% and 45.2\% of the initial release volume, with the largest
   percentage recovery associated with 1,1,1 trichloroethane, the least
   dense of the three DNAPLs considered.}},

   the strains of 0.3, 0.5 and peak. Microstructural evolutions were
   studied using optical and scanning electron microscopes. The results
   show that during the compression process, the recrystallized grains
   nucleate along the pre-existing grain boundaries. The amount of
   dynamically recrystallized grains is increased with strain in a sigmoid
   scheme followed by Avrami equation. The size of dynamically
   recrystallized grains also increases at the beginning and decreases

Abstract = {{In minimally invasive image-guided interventions, different imaging
   modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed
   tomography (CT), and 3-D ultrasound (US), can provide complementary,
   multispectral image information. Dynamic image registration is a
   well-established approach that permits real-time diagnostic information
   to be enhanced by placing lower-quality real-time images within a high
   quality anatomical context. For the guidance of cardiac interventions,
   it would be valuable to register dynamic MRI or CT with intra-operative
   US. However, in practice, either the high computational cost prohibits
   such real-time visualization, or else the resulting image quality is not
   satisfactory for accurate interventional guidance. Modern graphics
   processing units (GPUs) provide the programmability, parallelism and
   increased computational precision to address this problem. In this
   paper, we first outline our research on dynamic 3-D cardiac MR and US
   image acquisition, real-time dual-modality registration and US tracking.
   Next, we describe our contributions on image processing and optimization
   techniques for 4-D (3-D + time) cardiac image rendering, and our
   GPU-accelerated methodologies for multimodality 4-D medical image
   visualization and optical blending, along with real-time synchronization
   of dual-modality dynamic cardiac images. Finally, multiple transfer
   functions, various image composition schemes, and an extended
   window-level setting and adjustment approach are proposed and applied to
   facilitate the dynamic volumetric MR and US cardiac data exploration and
   enhance the feature of interest of US image that is usually restricted
   to a narrow voxel intensity range.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two attribute-oriented authentication and
   transmission schemes for secure and privacy-preserving health
   information sharing in health social networks (HSNs). HSN users are
   tagged with formalized attributes. The attribute-oriented authentication
   scheme enables each HSN user to generate an attribute proof for itself,
   where its sensitive attributes are anonymized. By verifying provided
   attribute proof, other users are able to know what attributes an HSN
   user has. The attribute-oriented transmission scheme enables an HSN user
   to encrypt his/her health information into a ciphertext bonded with a
   customized access policy. The access policy is defined by a target set
   of attributes. Only users who satisfy the access policy are able to
   decrypt the ciphertext. Through security analysis, we show that the
   proposed schemes can effectively resist various attacks including
   forgery attack, attribute-trace attack, eavesdropping attack, and
   collusion attack. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate
   that both schemes can offer satisfactory performance in helping HSN
   users to share health information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The pressure dependence of the crystal and molecular structure of the
   bis-1,2,3-thiaselenazolyl radical dimer {[}1b](2) has been investigated
   over the range 0-11 GPa by powder diffraction methods using synchrotron
   radiation and diamond anvil cell techniques. At ambient pressure, the
   dimer consists of a pair of radicals linked by a hypervalent 4-center
   6-electron S-Se-Se-S sigma-bond in an essentially coplanar arrangement.
   The dimers are packed in cross-braced slipped pi-stack arrays running
   along the x-direction of the monoclinic (space group P2(1)/c) unit cell.
   Pressurization to 11 GPa causes the unit cell dimensions a and c to
   undergo a slow but uniform compression, while the b-axis is slightly
   elongated. There is virtually no change in the molecular structure or in
   the slipped g-stack crystal architecture. This behavior is in marked
   contrast to that of the isostructural radical dimer {[}1a]2, where the
   basal fluorine is replaced by hydrogen. Pressurization of this latter
   material induces a phase change near 4-5 GPa, characterized by a sharp
   contraction in a and c, and a correspondingly large increase in b. At
   the molecular level, the transition is associated with a buckling of the
   a-bonded dimer to a more conventional pi-bonded arrangement. Geometry
   optimized DFT band structure calculations on {[}1b](2) replicate the
   observed structural changes and indicate that compression widens both
   the valence and conduction bands but does not induce band gap closure
   until >13 GPa. This result is consistent with the measured thermal
   activation energy for conduction E-act, which indicates that a metallic
   state requires pressures > 10 GPa.}},

Abstract = {{Potential shifts in extreme rainfall at the local level require
   revisions of existing water infrastructure management regulations as
   well as changes in design practices. This paper assesses the change in
   IDF curves for use by the City of London, Ontario under changing
   climatic conditions. A non-parametric K-Nearest Neighbour weather
   generator (WG) algorithm is used to synthetically create long time
   series of weather data. Nine daily maximum rainfall datasets (5, 10, 15,
   30 minutes, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hour) collected from the London Airport
   station for the period 1961-2002 are used as input into the WG. The WG
   uses sophisticated shuffling and perturbation mechanisms to generate
   synthetic rainfall records similar (but not identical) to the observed
   historic record. The shuffling mechanism generates synthetic rainfall
   values and the perturbation mechanism can generate extreme rainfall
   values outside the observed bounds to simulate plausible future rainfall
   amounts not yet observed. Two climate scenarios are selected for the
   analysis: climate change lower bound (CC\_LB) and climate change upper
   bound (CC\_UB). The CC\_LB scenario uses observed rainfall record as WG
   input. The CC\_UB scenario modifies the observed record using the
   results of a selected global climate model (change fields) and then uses
   the modified rainfall datasets as WG input. Outputs are used to generate
   IDF curves. Results of the study include numerical and graphical
   presentation of updated IDF curves for 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years
   for the city of London, Ontario. The comparison between climate change
   scenario IDF curves and Environment Canada IDF curves indicates an
   increase in maximum rainfall intensities and magnitudes which has major
   implications on ways in which current (and future) municipal water
   management infrastructure is designed, operated, and maintained.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Climate Change on Extreme Precipitation Events in the

Abstract = {{Future changes in climatic conditions from increasing greenhouse gas
   concentrations will have a major impact on the hydrologic cycle. It is
   important to understand and predict future changes in temperature and
   precipitation in order to effectively manage water resources.
   Atmosphere-Ocean coupled Global Climate Models (AOGCMs) are used widely
   to predict the effects of greenhouse-gas forcing on global climate
   conditions. However, their spatial and temporal resolutions are quite
   large so their outputs must be modified to represent local climate
   conditions. This process is called downscaling, and there are a variety
   of tools available to achieve this goal. This study compares three
   downscaling approaches, namely the Statistical Down Scaling Model
   (SDSM), Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), and
   the K-NN Weather Generator with Principal Component Analysis (VVG-PCA).
   Each weather generator is used to simulate the historical climate for
   the Upper Thames River Basin in Ontario, Canada for use in a comparison
   of downscaling tools. Future climate conditions are simulated by LARS-WG
   and WG-PCA from six different AOGCMs, each with two to three emissions
   scenarios, for a total of 15 different models. In simulation of
   historical climate variability, the models generally perform better in
   terms of mean daily precipitation and total monthly precipitation.
   LARS-WG simulates precipitation events well but cannot reproduce means
   and variances in the daily temperature series. SDSM adequately simulates
   both temperatures and precipitation events. WG-PCA reproduces daily
   temperatures very well but overestimates the occurrence of some extreme
   precipitation events. Results are variable for the downscaling of
   AOGCMs; however, the downscaling tools generally predict a rise in
   winter, spring and fall precipitation totals, as well as an overall
   increase in mean annual precipitation in future decades.}},

Abstract = {{Background/objectives: To develop an online patient education resource
   for use in spinal cord injury rehabilitation.
   Participants: The development process involved more than 100
   subject-matter experts (SMEs) (rehabilitation professionals and
   consumers) from across Canada. Preliminary evaluation was conducted with
   25 end-users.
   Methods: An iterative development process was coordinated by a project
   team; SMEs (including patients) developed the content in working groups
   using wiki-based tools. Multiple rounds of feedback based on early
   prototypes helped improve the courses during development.
   Results: Five courses were created, each featuring more than 45 minutes
   of video content and hundreds of media assets. Preliminary evaluation
   results indicate that users were satisfied by the courses and perceived
   them to be effective.
   Conclusions: This is an effective process for developing multimedia
   patient education resources; the involvement of patients in all parts of
   the process was particularly helpful. Future work will focus on
   implementation, integration into clinical practice and other delivery
   formats (smart phones, tablets).}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00261.2012.-Electrical communication and its role
   in blood flow regulation are built on an examination of charge movement
   in single, isolated vessels. How this process behaves in broader
   arterial networks remains unclear. This study examined the nature of
   electrical communication in arterial structures where vessel length and
   branching were varied. Analysis began with the deployment of an existing
   computational model expanded to form a variable range of vessel
   structures. Initial simulations revealed that focal endothelial
   stimulation generated electrical responses that conducted robustly along
   short unbranched vessels and to a lesser degree lengthened arteries or
   branching structures retaining a single branch point. These predictions
   matched functional observations from hamster mesenteric arteries and
   support the idea that an increased number of vascular cells attenuate
   conduction by augmenting electrical load. Expanding the virtual network
   to 31 branches revealed that electrical responses increasingly ascended
   from fifth- to first-order arteries when the number of stimulated distal
   vessels rose. This property enabled the vascular network to grade
   vasodilation and network perfusion as revealed through blood flow
   modeling. An elevation in endothelial-endothelial coupling resistance,
   akin to those in sepsis models, compromised this ascension of
   vasomotor/perfusion responses. A comparable change was not observed when
   the endothelium was focally disrupted to mimic disease states including
   atherosclerosis. In closing, this study highlights that vessel length
   and branching play a role in setting the conduction of electrical
   phenomenon along resistance arteries and within networks. It also
   emphasizes that modest changes in endothelial function can, under
   certain scenarios, impinge on network responsiveness and blood flow
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are an extremely important class of
   porous materials with many applications. The metal centers in many
   important MOFs are zinc cations. However, their Zn environments have not
   been characterized directly by 67Zn solid-state NMR (SSNMR)
   spectroscopy. This is because 67Zn (I=5/2) is unreceptive with many
   unfavorable NMR characteristics, leading to very low sensitivity. In
   this work, we report, for the first time, a 67Zn natural abundance SSNMR
   spectroscopic study of several representative zeolitic imidazolate
   frameworks (ZIFs) and MOFs at an ultrahigh magnetic field of 21.1 T. Our
   work demonstrates that 67Zn magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra are
   highly sensitive to the local Zn environment and can differentiate
   non-equivalent Zn sites. The 67Zn NMR parameters can be predicted by
   theoretical calculations. Through the study of MOF-5 desolvation, we
   show that with the aid of computational modeling, 67Zn NMR spectroscopy
   can provide valuable structural information on the MOF systems with
   structures that are not well described. Using ZIF-8 as an example, we
   further demonstrate that 67Zn NMR spectroscopy is highly sensitive to
   the guest molecules present inside the cavities. Our work also shows
   that a combination of 67Zn NMR data and molecular dynamics simulation
   can reveal detailed information on the distribution and the dynamics of
   the guest species. The present work establishes 67Zn SSNMR spectroscopy
   as a new tool complementary to X-ray diffraction for solving outstanding
   structural problems and for determining the structures of many new MOFs
   yet to come.}},

Abstract = {{The microscopic strain distributions were studied for stress corrosion
   cracks produced electrochemically in C-rings of Alloy 600 (0.65 Ni, 0.16
   Cr, 0.08 Fe). The strain data were obtained using polychromatic X-ray
   microdiffraction (PXM) and (in part) by electron backscatter diffraction
   (EBSD). PXM was used to measure plastic and elastic strain distributions
   around the tip of a short crack, along with the changes to the direction
   and shape of the diffraction spots (ellipticity). For a sample with a
   short (30 mu m) crack, the misorientation map showed a well-defined
   region of plastic deformation along the grain boundary in advance of the
   crack tip, extending to the next triple point. For the large crack
   sample, plastic and elastic stains as well as crystalline order could be
   measured in high detail with respect to the crack path. However, no
   correlation between these could be obtained, except for a notable
   degradation of crystalline order near the crack mouth. A comparable EBSD
   misorientation map shows strong correlation between misorientation and
   the crack edges; this may in part reflect the role of sharp edges in the
   more surface-sensitive approach. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published

   diameters between 200 and 1000nm, surfaces charges between 40 and 55mV,
   and polydispersity between 0.2 and 0.35. RSM optimized
   chitosan-carrageenan nanoparticles demonstrated an increased rHu-EPO
   encapsulation efficiency of 47.97 +/- 4.10\% and a more sustained in
   vitro release of similar to 50\% over a 2 week period when compared to
   previous nano/microparticle delivery systems. Studies on the effect of
   surface charge and chitosan molecular weight on the encapsulation and
   controlled release of rHu-EPO revealed that increasing either led to
   improved encapsulation efficiency and reduced release rate.}},

Abstract = {{As there are no thermodynamic studies on the 4-aminocoumarin
   tautomerization molecule, this study was done for the first time in the
   world. 4-Aminocoumarin molecule stability was studied in the gaseous
   state and it has two isomers (imino form and amino form). The
   theoretical study and based on the results of density functions theory
   (DFT), imino possess higher stability state compared with amino. The
   thermodynamic values (the change in entropy Delta S and the change in
   enthalpy Delta H) of the isomerization form of amino to imino revealed
   that the conversion is spontaneous and endothermic.. The results showed
   that wavelength for greatest absorption (lambda(max)) of imino form is
   longer than amino and this is due to the formation of a new double bond
   which leads to the association distribution of the electronic density
   along the molecule in the imino form.}},

Abstract = {{A new positioning system using transmitter signature waveforms of DVB-T2
   in Single Frequency Networks (SFNs) is proposed in this paper. Due to
   the wide coverage of the SFN and extremely high transmission power of
   digital television (DTV) transmitting stations, positioning based on DTV
   SFN can be considered as a promising complementary to remedy the poor
   coverage of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in dense multipath
   propagation environments. Based on the newly proposed transmitter
   signature waveform in DVB-T2 systems, transmitter identification and
   timing estimation using threshold-based first path detection method are
   jointly achieved, and subsequently utilized for
   Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA)-based positioning approach. The
   proposed positioning system is fully compatible with the current DVB-T2
   standard and therefore, no dedicated hardware modification is required.
   The performance of the proposed positioning system is evaluated through
   computer simulations under different signal propagation scenarios and
   compared with existing methods. Simulation results show that very high
   accuracy can be obtained with the proposed positioning system.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the recent technological advances in precision engineering
   and the concurrent progresses in biomedical research including numerous
   surgical operations, the development of precision positioning systems
   capable of executing large travel in vertical direction with nanometer
   scale resolution or simply Z nano-positioner has become inevitable. The
   motion in Z-axis is typically achieved by mounting a planner stage on an
   L-bracket which often has low force capacity and lacks compactness. In
   many applications, compactness is desired, yet long travel ranges are
   highly demanded. The actuator must provide enough output force to lift a
   mass mounted on it along with positioning platform weight against the
   effect of gravity. Therefore, design criteria and features for a novel
   compact positioner capable of lifting mass with long stroke and
   nanometer accuracy have been presented and discussed. In the designs,
   two major challenges have been faced and solved: proper installation of
   the actuator within the stage and perfect alignment of the actuator to
   the stage. An embedded actuator can provide the benefits to the
   structure of being realistically compact and the friction surfaces not
   being exposed to dust or any other contamination.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: The management of engaging Hill-Sachs defects (HSD) is
   controversial. The purpose of this study was to biomechanically compare
   3 treatment strategies.
   Materials and methods: Eight specimens were tested on a shoulder
   simulator. The protocol involved testing 2 unrepaired HSD (30\% and
   45\%), which were then treated with remplissage, humeral head allograft
   (HHA), and partial resurfacing arthroplasty (PRA). Stability (defect
   engagement and glenohumeral stiffness) and range of motion (ROM) were
   measured.
   Results: All 30\% and 45\% HSDs engaged and dislocated. Remplissage and
   HHA effectively prevented engagement in all specimens; however, 62\% of
   PRA engaged. No repair exhibited stiffness significantly greater than
   intact, but 30\% and 45\% remplissage produced a 74\% and 207\%
   increase, respectively, and were significantly greater than the
   unrepaired states (P <= .047). Stiffness results for HHA and PRA closely
   matched those of intact. In adduction, remplissage reduced
   internal-external ROM compared with both defects (P <= .01), but only
   30\% remplissage caused a significant decrease compared with intact (P =
   .049). In abduction, all repairs reduced ROM compared with HSD (P <=
   .04), but none compared with intact (P > 0.05). In extension,
   remplissage had significantly less ROM than either HHA or PRA (P < .02).
   Conclusion: All procedures improved stability; however, unlike
   remplissage, results from HHA and PRA closely resembled intact.
   Remplissage (30\% and 45\%) improved stability and eliminated engagement
   but caused reductions in ROM. HHA and PRA re-established intact ROM, but
   PRA could not fully prevent engagement. The effects of each technique
   are not equivalent and further studies are required.

Abstract = {{We consider the minimization of long-term average power consumption for
   packet transmission between a mobile station and the base station over
   Nakagami-m fading channel. Power consumption is minimized by intelligent

   packet loss across MAC and physical layers being confined below certain
   levels. The problem is formulated as an infinite horizon constrained
   Markov decision problem and solved by linear programming (LP) method.
   The primary intention of this paper is to provide a visible paradigm on
   using LP method to optimize the performance of mobile wireless
   communication systems. We elaborate the detailed mathematical solution
   with consistent simulation experiments and emphasize the effectiveness
   of adaptive transmission scheduling for cross-layer QoS provisioning.

   5 to 15\% by MK, SF, RHA or FA used along with a new generation
   polycarboxylate-based high-range water reducing admixture (PCH) at
   dosages ranging from 0.25 to 1.5\% and at different temperatures ranging
   from 23 to 60A degrees C. The significance and validity of the models
   were confirmed by statistical analysis and verification experiments. The
   regression models were used to analyze the influence of the mixture
   proportion as well as temperature on the rheological properties of OWC
   slurries. The statistical design can be applied to optimize rheological
   properties such as yield stress and plastic viscosity considering the
   addition of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) at different
   temperatures, and to gain a better understanding of trade-offs between
   key mixture parameters such as the superplasticizer dosage and the level
   of SCMs used.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that neuropeptide Y (NPY) exerts vasoconstrictor
   properties in sciatic nerve blood supply by a Y1 receptor (Y1R)
   mechanism. Using Doppler ultrasound (40 MHz), we measured blood flow
   velocity through a sciatic nerve supply artery during infusions of NPY
   and/or Y1R blockade with BIBP3226 in Wistar Kyoto rats before, and
   following, ganglionic blockade with Hexamethonium (Hex). Following Hex
   infusion, mean arterial pressure (baseline: 83 +/- 18, Hex: 57 +/- 3 mm
   Hg) was reduced. After 30 min, the index of conductance at the sciatic
   nerve (velocity/MAP expressed as \% baseline) started to increase from
   103 +/- 35 to 127 +/- 39\% baseline in the following 30 min (p<0.05).
   Infusion of NPY (Y1 agonist) minimized this dilatory response (Hex
   baseline: 99 +/- 15, NPY: 104 +/- 11\% baseline; NS). This NPY-induced
   attenuation was, in turn, minimized by BIBP3226 (Hex baseline: 73 +/-
   12, NPY + BIBP3226: 89 +/- 14\% baseline). Neither NPY nor BIBP3226
   infusions without Hex affected the sciatic nerve arterial conductance.
   We conclude that the late dilation following Hex which is reversed by
   Y1R activation suggests some level of sympathetic control over sciatic
   nerve blood flow. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) range scanning of large spaces, such as civil
   structures, generates an immense cloud of 3D points with inconsistent
   data densities due to the limited positions of the stationary scanner,
   inaccessible surfaces, and narrow pathways. This density variation is
   the dominant detrimental factor in extracting accurate scanned shapes.
   This article introduces an effective scan planning methodology for
   capturing accurate geometry from long and narrow spaces, which minimizes
   the need for subsequent data approximations. The technique computes an
   optimum scanning range for each stationary position of the scanner that
   limits the density variation to a user-defined value. Three cases are
   proposed to define the limited data density and a FARO (R)-LS880 laser
   scanner is used to illustrate the proposed approach that achieves
   acceptable scanning results in terms of its critical shape capturing
   capability, overall point cloud density, and accurate point-based
   visualization. The experimental observations confirm that the accuracy
   of the scanned data can be improved by registering multiple partial
   scans with restricted density and positioning the data acquisition
   device close to the critical features. The latter recommended step
   decreases the incident angle to the world domain, which, in turn,
   reduces the surface occlusions and data density variations.}},

   efficiencies increased and tend to saturate with inhibitor
   concentration. Potentiodynamic polarization results showed that AMTT is
   a mixed-type inhibitor. Adsorption of AMTT molecules is a spontaneous
   process, and its adsorption behavior obeys Langmuir's adsorption
   isotherm model. The reactivity of AMTT was analyzed through theoretical

Abstract = {{Ceria supported silver nano catalyst was synthesized using a simple,
   fast and cost-effective gel-casting technique. The gel was made of acryl
   amide monomer (AM) to disperse, stabilize and control the size of metal
   nanoparticles. The obtained results revealed that nano particles can
   easily be confined into the three dimensional network of the polymeric
   gel. The polymer matrix was then removed by calcination under a
   controlled atmosphere and temperature. A central composite experimental
   design, which is one of the most popular designs of response surface
   methodology, was used to optimize the production parameters influencing
   the surface area and particle size. The studied parameters were the
   amount of cross-linker (N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAM)), the monomer
   (AM) to cross linker ratio and the monomer to salt (silver nitrate)
   ratio. Two quadratic mathematical model equations were derived for
   predicting the surface area and particle size. Analysis of the variance
   showed that the AM/salt ratio was the most significant factor affecting
   the surface area of nanoparticles. In the process optimization, the
   maximum amount of surface area was achieved concurrently with the
   minimum values for particle size at 5.38 m(2)/g and 190 nm,
   respectively. The optimal ranges of the AM/salt ratio and the amount of
   MBAM to achieve the minimum particle size were 46.97-49.43 and
   0.38-0.51, respectively. The optimal values of the MBAM, AM/MBAM and
   AM/salt ratio for the maximum surface area of 6.09 m(2)/g were found to
   be 0.54 g, 33.92 and 51.89, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{228}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Fluidized beds are used for a variety of processes such as food,
   pharmaceutical, petrochemical and energy production. Supersonic gas
   injection nozzles are used to grind particles in fluidized beds. For
   example, in the Fluid Coking process, which uses thermal cracking
   reactions to upgrade heavy oil, supersonic nozzles inject steam to
   control coke particle size. Maintaining a high attrition rate with a
   lower steam flowrate would reduce energy consumption, increase reactor
   throughput. and reduce sour wastewater production. The purpose of the
   present research is to study particle attrition with supersonic
   convergent-divergent nozzles in a fluidized bed at high temperatures,
   under conditions such as those encountered in the Fluid Coking process.
   According to the experimental results, the grinding efficiency is
   significantly improved by increasing fluidized bed temperature,
   attrition gas properties, or nozzle size. The experimental data further
   suggest that particle fragmentation is the dominant attrition process
   when using supersonic nozzles in a hot fluidized bed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{Direct path detection using multipath interference cancelation for
   communication-based positioning system}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Recent development in wireless communication-based positioning
   technology brings significant challenge of detecting the weak signal
   component arriving from the direct propagation path for time-of-arrival
   (TOA)-based approach. Due to the common obstruction of the direct
   propagation path in dense multipath environments, identification of the
   weak direct path in these environments can be very difficult via the
   classical correlation-based estimator in the presence of interference
   from significant later arriving multipath components. A new direct path
   detection scheme using the multipath interference cancelation is
   presented in this article. For data communication purpose, an iterative
   estimator with improved accuracy for joint channel and data estimation
   is first developed; based on which, the interference of multipath
   components are reconstructed and subtracted from the original received
   signal. With the aid of the detected data, an enhanced preamble is
   formulated. The accuracy of direct path detection is substantially
   improved by using the correlation between the multipath
   interference-suppressed signal and the enhanced preamble.
   Semi-analytical expression of the performance of the iterative estimator
   is derived. The analysis enables the system to determine an automatic
   stopping criterion to reduce the computational complexity of the
   iterative process. The performance of the direct path detection is also
   analyzed in terms of the signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and
   compared with that of the conventional approach. Computer simulation
   results show the superiority of the proposed direct path detection. The
   accuracy of the positioning system using the proposed method is also
   evaluated in dense multipath environments.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-indentation hardness was used to assess the local equivalent
   plastic strain distribution in four fcc metals subjected to identical
   splined mandrel flow forming processes. Both the maximum local
   equivalent plastic strain and the grain-to-grain variability in the
   equivalent plastic strain increased with increasing strain-hardening
   rate of the work piece material. The deformed microstructure of the
   formed work pieces indicated that considerably more grain-to-grain
   variability in the dislocation slip step and deformation twin densities
   exist in the material with a high strain-hardening rate. These findings
   are of considerable importance and should be considered when assessing
   the suitability of high strain forming processes for producing reliable,
   and homogeneous, parts from fcc metal alloys that display high strain
   hardening rates. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Oiling out, an undesirable effect of the crystallization of organic
   molecules from solution, usually disturbs the crystallization process
   and deteriorates the product properties. In this work the purification
   of raw idebenone that oils out was firstly attempted by use of both
   drowning out and cooling crystallization from hexane/methylene chloride
   mixtures. Experimental results have shown that, oiling out can greatly
   affect the outcome of crystallization: at low initial concentrations,
   oiling out did not take place and crystallization proceeded normally to
   harvest the product with high purity; while at high initial
   concentrations, oiling out frequently occurred and crystallization was
   hindered or even stopped. In addition, such parameters as the polarity
   of solvent, cooling rate, seeding and addition rate of antisolvent can
   also be utilized to avoid the occurrence of oiling out so as to increase
   the purity of crystallization product. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{This study reports the kinetics of the photocatalytic degradation of
   phenol using four different TiO2 catalysts. It is shown that phenol
   yields hydroquinone, catechol, benzoquinone and acetic and formic acids
   as main intermediate species. A phenomenological unified kinetic model
   (UKM) based in a ``series-parallel{''} reaction network is proposed. The
   UKM follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics with this being applicable
   to the various TiO2 photocatalysts studied. The UKM requires a number of
   significant assumptions in order to be used effectively avoiding
   overparametization. This approach also requires that the adsorption
   constants be obtained independently. As a result, the UKM is adapted for
   each specific TiO2 photocatalyst to describe the experimental
   photoconversion data. It is concluded that this approach provides good
   and objective parameter estimates with low to moderate cross-correlation
   among kinetic parameters and acceptable 95\% CIs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A comparison among three weakly nonlinear approaches for
   thermo-gravitational instability in a Newtonian fluid layer heated from
   below is presented. First, the dynamical systems describing the time
   evolution of the problem from different weakly nonlinear approaches,
   namely, the Lorenz model, the amplitude equations and the perturbation
   expansion approaches are obtained. Next, the steady states and their
   stability, as well as the transient behaviour are obtained from each
   dynamical system. The similarity and difference among the three models
   are emphasized. The role of each of the nondimensional groups, the
   Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number is compared for the three models.
   The different approaches lead to similar behaviours when the Rayleigh
   number is just above its critical value and Prandtl number is high.
   However, only the dynamical system obtained from the amplitude equations
   is able to reflect the role of the Prandtl number. On the other hand,
   the amplitude equations and perturbation expansion techniques are not
   suitable for predicting the uniform oscillatory behaviour observed
   frequently in RayleighBenard convection. The novelty of the current work
   lies in studying the critical differences in the findings of the three
   popular approaches to investigate weakly nonlinear thermal convection
   for the first time. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript reports ``individual{''} particle cluster information
   obtained using a Chemical Reactor Engineering Centre Gas-Solid Optical
   Probe (CREC-GS-Optiprobe) equipped with a Graded Refractive Index (GRIN)
   lens. The CREC-GS-Optiprobe is used to study the fluid dynamics in the
   developed region of a co-current gas solid down flow fluidized bed unit.
   The CREC-GS-Optiprobe forms a 118 +/- 34 mu m diameter highly
   illuminated light region at 8.05 mm distance in front of the sensor tip.
   Experiments are carried out in a circulating fluidized bed downer cold
   model unit of 3.0 m height and 0.0257 m internal diameter. The solid
   used is a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst with a mean particle
   diameter of 84.42 mu m and a particle density of 1722 kg/m(3). The
   superficial gas velocity and solid mass fluxes are varied from 0.95 to
   2.53 m/s and from 10 to 106 kg/m(2) s, respectively. Analysis of the
   data obtained involves a rigorous methodology for setting the data
   baseline in compliance with solid mass balances. The application of this
   method allows the simultaneous measurement of (i) cluster solid
   concentrations, (ii) individual cluster slip velocities and (iii)
   individual cluster sizes. These data also allow calculation of cluster
   size frequency distribution at various radial positions in the downer
   unit. On the strength of these experimental data, particle cluster drag
   coefficients are calculated as a function of the cluster Reynolds'
   number and average particle number in the cluster. Drag coefficients
   determined using the proposed method provide close range values. These
   findings support a particle string configuration for clusters in downer
   units. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Yeasts Isolated from the Brazilian Amazonian Forest}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study is the first to investigate the Brazilian
   Amazonian Forest to identify new D-xylose-fermenting yeasts that might
   potentially be used in the production of ethanol from sugarcane bagasse
   hemicellulosic hydrolysates.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 224 yeast strains were
   isolated from rotting wood samples collected in two Amazonian forest
   reserve sites. These samples were cultured in yeast nitrogen base
   (YNB)-D-xylose or YNB-xylan media. Candida tropicalis, Asterotremella
   humicola, Candida boidinii and Debaryomyces hansenii were the most
   frequently isolated yeasts. Among D-xylose-fermenting yeasts, six
   strains of Spathaspora passalidarum, two of Scheffersomyces stipitis,
   and representatives of five new species were identified. The new species
   included Candida amazonensis of the Scheffersomyces clade and
   Spathaspora sp. 1, Spathaspora sp. 2, Spathaspora sp. 3, and Candida sp.
   1 of the Spathaspora clade. In fermentation assays using D-xylose (50
   g/L) culture medium, S. passalidarum strains showed the highest ethanol
   yields (0.31 g/g to 0.37 g/g) and productivities (0.62 g/L.h to 0.75
   g/L.h). Candida amazonensis exhibited a virtually complete D-xylose
   consumption and the highest xylitol yields (0.55 g/g to 0.59 g/g), with
   concentrations up to 25.2 g/L. The new Spathaspora species produced
   ethanol and/or xylitol in different concentrations as the main
   fermentation products. In sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic fermentation
   assays, S. stipitis UFMG-XMD-15.2 generated the highest ethanol yield
   (0.34 g/g) and productivity (0.2 g/L.h), while the new species
   Spathaspora sp. 1 UFMG-XMD-16.2 and Spathaspora sp. 2 UFMG-XMD-23.2 were
   very good xylitol producers.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates the promise of using
   new D-xylose-fermenting yeast strains from the Brazilian Amazonian
   Forest for ethanol or xylitol production from sugarcane bagasse
   hemicellulosic hydrolysates.}},

Title = {{Evolution of the Yiwulushan metamorphic core complex from distributed to
   localized deformation and its tectonic implications}},
Journal = {{TECTONICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{31}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{The Yiwulushan metamorphic core complex (YSMCC) is situated in the
   northern part of the eastern North China Craton (NCC) that experienced
   significant lithospheric thinning in an extensional regime during the
   Late Mesozoic. We present structural and geochronological evidence to
   show that the YSMCC underwent NNE-SSW extension in the Late Jurassic and
   WNW-ESE extension in the Early Cretaceous. We show that the YSMCC
   started with a sub-horizontal shear zone referred to as the Yiwulushan
   detachment shear zone (YDSZ) in the Late Jurassic between 157 and 147 Ma
   with a top-to-the-SSW shear sense. The YDSZ was subjected to limited
   doming probably toward the end of its formation. The NNE-striking,
   WNW-dipping Waziyu normal shear zone (WZYSZ) was formed along the
   western margin of the core complex during the Early Cretaceous, and
   truncates the earlier YDSZ. The whole core complex underwent doming in a
   rolling-hinge manner in the end of the latest Early Cretaceous.
   Thereafter, the YSMCC was overprinted by brittle normal faults along its
   western margin in the Late Cretaceous. Development of the initially
   flat-lying YDSZ is associated with diffuse mid-crustal flow whereas the
   formation of the rolling-hinge type WZYSZ is characterized by localized
   deformation. The Late Jurassic more diffuse deformation has a rather
   constant top-to-the- SSW shearing and produced a variety of
   shear-related structures such as recumbent isoclinal folds and
   transposition foliation. The YSMCC evolution also demonstrates that the
   Late Mesozoic extension along the northern part of the eastern NCC
   started as early as the Late Jurassic rather than the previously
   proposed Early Cretaceous.}},

Abstract = {{Calpain has been implicated in acute myocardial injury after myocardial
   infarction (MI). However, the causal relationship between calpain and
   post-MI myocardial remodeling has not been fully understood. This study
   examined whether deletion of Capn4, essential for calpain-1 and
   calpain-2 activities, reduces myocardial remodeling and dysfunction
   following MI, and if yes, whether these effects of Capn4 deletion are
   associated with NF-kappa B signaling and inflammatory responses in the
   MI heart. A novel mouse model with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of
   Capn4 (Capn4-ko) was employed. MI was induced by left coronary artery
   ligation. Deficiency of Capn4 dramatically reduced the protein levels
   and activities of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in the Capn4-ko heart. In vivo
   cardiac function was relatively improved in Capn4-ko mice at 7 and 30
   days after MI when compared with their wild-type littermates. Deletion
   of Capn4 reduced apoptosis, limited infarct expansion, prevented left
   ventricle dilation, and reduced mortality in Capn4-ko mice. Furthermore,
   cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas and myocardial collagen deposition
   were significantly attenuated in Capn4-ko mice, which were accompanied
   by down-regulation of hypertrophic genes and profibrotic genes. These
   effects of Capn4 knock-out correlated with restoration of I kappa B
   protein and inhibition of NF-kappa B activation, leading to suppression
   of proinflammatory cytokine expression and inflammatory cell
   infiltration in the Capn4-ko heart after MI. In conclusion, deficiency
   of Capn4 reduces adverse myocardial remodeling and myocardial
   dysfunction after MI. These effects of Capn4 deletion may be mediated
   through prevention of I kappa B degradation and NF-kappa B activation,
   resulting in inhibition of inflammatory responses.}},

Title = {{Supergene gold transformation: Biogenic secondary and nano-particulate
   gold from arid Australia}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{320}},
Pages = {{17-31}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Biofilms on Au grains from sub-tropical and tropical sites promote the
   dispersion of gold (Au) by continuously recycling coarse Au and
   releasing nano-particulate Au. In this study we investigated the
   influences of (bio) geochemical processes on the transformation of Au
   grains in arid environments. At these sites water and nutrient
   availability are limited and episodic, hence abiogenic evaporative
   mechanisms were thought to control the formation of secondary and
   especially nano-particulate Au. Gold grains were collected from eight
   arid sites in three Australian Au provinces, i.e., Lawlers (Western
   Australia), Tanami (Northern Territory), and Flinders Ranges (South
   Australia). Sites were chosen based on contrasting deposit styles, i.e.,
   primary underground and epithermal deposits as well as secondary
   eluvial-, colluvial- and alluvial placers at increasing distances from
   primary mineralization. Gold grains were studied using optical
   microscopy, FEG-SEM, FIB-SEM-EDXA, EPMA and PIXE. Gold grains from all
   surface environments displayed supergene transformation features, i.e.,
   morphotypes indicative of Au and Ag dissolution, Au aggregation and Au
   neoformation. The latter included spheroidal and bacteriomorphic Au,
   which increased in abundance with distance to source. Viable biofilms
   containing abundant Au nano-particles and spheroidal Au mu-crystals were
   detected on all grains from the Flinders Ranges. Gold grains from the
   Lawlers and the Tanami provinces are covered by polymorphic layers
   containing abundant nano-particulate, spheroidal and bacteriomorphic Au.
   The polymorphic layers consist of vermiform clays and organic matter,
   suggestive of remnant biofilms. These results demonstrate that biofilms
   capable of transforming Au grains develop episodically on Au grains in
   arid environments. In conclusion, this study shows that microbial
   processes play a critical role for the transformation of Au grains and
   contribute to the dispersion of Au and the formation of geochemical
   anomalies in arid environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

Abstract = {{This study investigates the strong photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray
   excited optical luminescence observed in nitrogen-functionalized 2D
   graphene nanoflakes (GNFs:N), which arise from the significantly
   enhanced density of states in the region of pi states and the gap
   between pi and pi{*} states. The increase in the number of the sp(2)
   clusters in the form of pyridine-like N-C, graphite-N-like, and the C=O
   bonding and the resonant energy transfer from the N and O atoms to the
   sp(2) clusters were found to be responsible for the blue shift and the
   enhancement of the main PL emission feature. The enhanced PL is strongly
   related to the induced changes of the electronic structures and bonding
   properties, which were revealed by the X-ray absorption near-edge
   structure, X-ray emission spectroscopy, and resonance inelastic X-ray
   scattering. The study demonstrates that PL emission can be tailored
   through appropriate tuning of the nitrogen and oxygen contents in GNFs
   and pave the way for new optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Iron oxide nanoparticles with superparamagnetic properties (SIONPs) have
   demonstrated the great capability to separate heavy metals from
   contaminated aqueous system, e.g., river, ground water, etc. To date,
   thermal decomposition methods are commonly used to synthesize highly
   crystalline monodisperse SIONPs with various shapes (e.g., spherical and
   cubic). However, the produced SIONPs show very poor dispersibility and
   stability in aqueous media. Thus, it is important to produce hydrophilic
   SIONPs by modifying the surface of iron oxide nanop.articles.Here,
   highly mono-dispersed iron oxide nanocubes (IONCs) were synthesized by a
   modified thermal decomposition approach. Following that, the oleic acid
   ligand was then replaced by 11-Mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) through a
   ligand exchange method. By control the growth of crystals, we are able
   to produce nanocubes that can be well dispersed in aqueous media. The
   average length for the edges of IONCs was estimated at 8 nm. The
   successful ligand replacement was proved by the spectra of FTIR.
   Furthermore, the thiol group presenting on the surface of nanocubes
   enable the functionalized IONCs as the excellent sorbent materials for
   extraction of heavy metal and actinide contaminants from environmenta
   and clinical samples.}},

Abstract = {{Biological nutrient removal (BNR) from high strength wastewater was
   investigated using a newly developed integrated anaerobic fluidized bed
   (AF) with circulating fluidized bed bioreactor henceforth called
   A-CFBBR. The A-CFBBR showed 99.7\% COD removal, 84\% nitrogen removal,
   with a very low sludge yield of 0.017 g VSS/g COD while treating a
   synthetic wastewater containing 10,700 mg COD/L and 250 mg NH3-N/L over
   a period of 6 months. The system was operated at an organic loading rate
   (OLR) of 35 kg COD/m(AF)(3)d and nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 1.1 kg
   N/m(CFBBR)(3) data hydraulic retention time (HRT) of less than 12 h in
   the A-CFBBR. Microbial communities analysis using DGGE confirmed the
   presence of both AOBs and NOBs in the riser and downer. Pseudomonas
   putida and Pseudomonas fluorescence were the dominant denitrifiers
   present in the downer. Methanogenic activity was accomplished by a
   microbial mixture of archaea and bacteria in the anaerobic column. (C)

Abstract = {{Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has recently been introduced for
   clinical use. One potential application of DECT is myocardial perfusion
   imaging through the significant reduction of beam-hardening artifacts by
   using monochromatic image reconstruction; analysis of these images can
   improve the accuracy of quantitative measurement of myocardial
   perfusion. Single-source DECT enabled by rapid switching between the low
   and high tube potentials (kV) can minimize misregistration of the high
   and low kV projection datasets from cardiac motion. We have recently
   implemented prospective electrocardiography-triggering capability in our
   rapid kV-switching computed tomography (CT) scanner to reduce the high
   effective dose from a quantitative CT myocardial perfusion imaging study
   with DECT. Our initial investigation suggests that prospectively
   electrocardiography-triggered rapid kV-switching DECT can eliminate beam
   hardening and provide a more reproducible myocardial perfusion
   measurement compared with the traditional single-energy CT protocol. (J

Abstract = {{In recent years, numerous delivery systems based on polymers,
   dendrimers, and nano-scale assemblies have been developed to improve the
   properties of drug molecules. In general, for the drug molecules to be
   active, they must be released from these delivery systems, ideally in a
   selective manner at the therapeutic target. As the changes in
   physiological conditions are relatively subtle from one tissue to
   another and the concentrations of specific enzymes are often quite low,
   a release strategy involving the amplification of a biological signal is
   particularly attractive. This article describes the development of
   oligomers, dendrimers, and linear polymers based on self-immolative
   spacers. This new class of molecules is designed to undergo a cascade of
   intramolecular reactions in response to the cleavage of a trigger
   moiety, resulting in molecular fragmentation and the release of multiple
   reporter or drug molecules. Progress in the development of these
   materials as drug delivery vehicles and sensors will be highlighted. (c)

   spatial correlation models for ground-motion measures such as peak
   ground acceleration and spectral acceleration have been developed using
   strong ground-motion records from California, Taiwan, and Japan. In this
   paper, we compare an empirical spatial correlation model for the 1999
   Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake with that obtained from stochastic
   finite-fault simulations; the stochastic finite-fault method is a widely
   used technique to generate synthetic ground-motion records for
   engineering applications and hazard assessment. We show that the
   stochastic records do not reproduce the observed intraevent spatial
   correlation characteristics and comment on what would be required to
   make them do so.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis: Surgical simulation is becoming an increasingly
   common training tool in residency programs. The first objective was to
   implement real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting into a virtual
   reality myringotomy simulator. The second objective was to test the
   various implemented incision algorithms to determine which most
   accurately represents the tympanic membrane during myringotomy. Study
   Design: Descriptive and face-validity testing. Methods: A deformable
   tympanic membrane was developed, and three soft-tissue cutting
   algorithms were successfully implemented into the virtual reality
   myringotomy simulator. The algorithms included element removal,
   direction prediction, and Delaunay cutting. The simulator was stable and
   capable of running in real time on inexpensive hardware. A face-validity
   study was then carried out using a validated questionnaire given to
   eight otolaryngologists and four senior otolaryngology residents. Each
   participant was given an adaptation period on the simulator, was blinded
   to the algorithm being used, and was presented the three algorithms in a
   randomized order. Results: A virtual reality myringotomy simulator with
   real-time soft-tissue deformation and cutting was successfully
   developed. The simulator was stable, ran in real time on inexpensive
   hardware, and incorporated haptic feedback and stereoscopic vision. The
   Delaunay cutting algorithm was found to be the most realistic algorithm
   representing the incision during myringotomy (P < .05). The Likert and
   visual analog scales had strong correlations, suggesting good internal
   reliability. Conclusions: The first virtual reality myringotomy
   simulator is being developed and now integrates a real-time deformable
   tympanic membrane that appears to have face validity. Further
   development and validation studies are necessary before the simulator
   can be studied with respect to training efficacy and clinical impact.

Abstract = {{The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Nearby Galaxies Legacy Survey (NGLS)
   comprises an H?i-selected sample of 155 galaxies spanning all
   morphological types with distances less than 25?Mpc. We describe the
   scientific goals of the survey, the sample selection and the observing
   strategy. We also present an atlas and analysis of the CO J=3 - 2 maps
   for the 47 galaxies in the NGLS which are also part of the Spitzer
   Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey. We find a wide range of molecular gas
   mass fractions in the galaxies in this sample and explore the
   correlation of the far-infrared luminosity, which traces star formation,
   with the CO luminosity, which traces the molecular gas mass. By
   comparing the NGLS data with merging galaxies at low and high redshift,
   which have also been observed in the CO J=3 - 2 line, we show that the
   correlation of far-infrared and CO luminosity shows a significant trend
   with luminosity. This trend is consistent with a molecular gas depletion
   time which is more than an order of magnitude faster in the merger
   galaxies than in nearby normal galaxies. We also find a strong
   correlation of the LFIR/LCO(3-2) ratio with the atomic-to-molecular gas
   mass ratio. This correlation suggests that some of the far-infrared
   emission originates from dust associated with atomic gas and that its
   contribution is particularly important in galaxies where most of the gas
   is in the atomic phase.}},

Title = {{A Rapid Hot-Embossing Prototyping Approach Using SU-8 Molds Coated With

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have developed a rapid prototyping process using
   hybrid master molds for hot-embossing lithography. The hybrid master
   mold developed here typically consists of a structural layer of SU-8, an
   overlayer of copper, and a top layer of antistick compound. The
   structure is first formed by the negative photoresist SU-8 layer with
   conventional photolithography. On the structural SU-8 layer, a nanoscale
   copper thin film is deposited to enhance the mechanical strength of the
   mold and improve heat transfer during the hot-embossing process.
   Finally, an outermost antistick layer is formed by the reaction of
   trichloro-(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoroctyl)-silane with the oxidized copper
   surface. These three layers cooperatively yield a hybrid mold which can
   be fabricated on a silicon wafer or any other suitable substrates for
   subsequent hot-embossing lithography. Our tests have verified that the
   molds fabricated with this method do not show any degradation of their
   structural design features and surface smoothness after 30 hot-embossing
   cycles. In comparison to other methods of making master molds for
   hot-embossing lithography such as laser machining and electroplating,
   the present method is simple and fast, with no reliance on any
   additional replication steps and fabrication procedures. Hence, the
   present method can remarkably reduce cost and the processing time in hot
   embossing, which is particularly attractive in prototyping or small
   volume production.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNx tubes) with nitrogen content of 7.6
   at.\% are synthesized on carbon papers. Thermal and chemical stability
   of the nanotubes are investigated by thermogravimetric analysis,
   differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   techniques. The results indicate that the nitrogen can be firmly kept in
   the nanotubes after annealing at 300 degrees C in air. Under an argon
   atmosphere, the nitrogen would not release until 670 degrees C, and half
   of the nitrogen incorporated is released after annealing at 700 degrees
   C for 30 min. Chemical stability investigation indicates that the
   nitrogen incorporated in the nanotubes is very stable under the thermal
   and acid environment comparable to working condition of proton exchange
   membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Profile of the nitrogen species inside the
   nanotubes reveals that graphite-like nitrogen releases slower than any
   other kind of nitrogen in the nanotubes during the chemical stability
   measurement. These CNx tubes synthesized by this simple chemical vapor
   deposition method are expected to be suitable for many applications,
   such as PEM fuel cells that work under both thermal and corrosive
   conditions and some other mild thermal environments.}},

Abstract = {{A tornado outbreak is a severe weather event that involves the
   occurrence of multiple tornadoes in a short period of time in a region.
   Although widespread damage has been associated with many historical
   outbreaks, wind hazard assessments, and the methodology for making such
   assessments, are lacking in the literature. The current study addresses
   this by developing a probabilistic simulation-based approach and then
   applying it to southern Ontario, using a model for the outbreak
   characteristics based on the tornado database for the regions
   neighboring southern Ontario and the tornado characteristics obtained
   from historical occurrences of tornadoes in southern Ontario. A
   quantitative assessment of the outbreak hazard for an area representing
   an idealized city in southern Ontario was carried out and the results
   are compared with those obtained by ignoring the outbreak phenomenon.
   The comparison shows that ignoring outbreaks can lead to an order of
   magnitude decrease in hazard estimates when an accumulated damage area
   of 100 km(2) or more is of concern. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published

Abstract = {{AC/DC converters used in electric vehicles generally consist of two
   stages: an input power factor correction (PFC) boost AC/DC stage that
   converts input AC voltage to an intermediate DC voltage and reduces
   input current harmonics injected to the grid, and a DC/DC converter that
   provides high-frequency galvanic isolation. Since there is a
   low-frequency ripple (second harmonic of the input ac line frequency) in
   the output voltage of the PFCAC/DC boost converter, the voltage loop in
   the conventional control system typically has a very low bandwidth to
   avoid distorting the input current waveform. This causes the
   conventional PFC controller to have slow dynamics against load
   variations. This paper presents a new control approach that regulates
   the input power of the converter instead of the output voltage by using
   an optimal nonlinear control approach based on the Control-Lyapunov
   Function (CFL). In this paper, it is shown that the proposed controller
   is able to eliminate the low bandwidth voltage control loop in the
   conventional PFC controller, thus allowing the front-end AC/DC boost PFC
   converter to operate with faster dynamic response than with the
   conventional controller approach. Experimental results from a 3 kW AC/DC
   converter are presented in the paper to validate the proposed control
   method and its superior performance.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the tolerability of hyperpolarized Xe-129 gas inhaled from functional
   residual capacity and magnetic resonance imaging in healthy subjects and
   those with pulmonary disease.
   Materials and Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (mean age, 59 +/- 17
   years), seven subjects with asthma (mean age, 47 +/- 7 years), 10
   subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (mean age, 74 +/- 4
   years), three subjects with cystic fibrosis (mean age, 27 +/- 10 years),
   and a single subject with radiation-induced lung injury (age, 66 years)
   were enrolled and evaluated over 43 visits with 136 anoxic inhalations
   of 500 mL Xe-129 gas mixed with 500 mL He-4 gas. Oxygen saturation and
   heart rate were monitored during the breath-hold and imaging; subjects
   were queried for adverse events (AEs) before and immediately following
   gas inhalation and for 24 hours after the last dose.
   Results: No subjects withdrew from the study or reported serious,
   hypoxic, or severe AEs. Over the course of 136 dose administrations, two
   mild AEs (1\%) were reported in two different subjects (two of 33
   {[}6\%]). One of these AEs (light-headedness) was temporally related and
   judged as possibly related to Xe-129 administration and resolved without
   treatment within 2 minutes. Statistically significant but clinically
   insignificant changes in oxygen saturation and heart rate were observed
   after inhalation (P <.001), and both resolved 1 minute later, with no
   difference between subject groups.
   Conclusions: Inhalation of hyperpolarized Xe-129 gas and subsequent
   magnetic resonance imaging were well tolerated in healthy subjects and
   ambulatory subjects with obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease.}},

Abstract = {{Achieving excellence in rowing requires optimization of technique to
   maximize efficiency and force production. Investigation of the
   kinematics of the trunk, upper and lower extremity, together with muscle
   activity of the trunk, provides an insight into the motor control
   strategies utilized over a typical race. Nine elite female rowers
   performed a 2000 m race simulation. Kinematic data of the trunk and
   extremities, together with electromyography (EMG) activity of spinal and
   pelvic extensor and flexor muscles, were compared at 250 and 1500 m. At
   1500 m, there was greater dissociation in the timing of leg extension
   and arm flexion and delayed trunk extension. Also at 1500 m, the spine
   demonstrated a delayed peak extension angular velocity of the T4T7 and
   L3S1 spinal segments in the early drive along with delayed and increased
   peak extension angular velocity of T10L1 and L1L3 spinal segments during
   the late drive. Trunk muscle fatigue was not evident; however, the
   abdominals demonstrated larger EMG burst areas at 1500 m. Alterations in
   trunk kinematics suggest that the trunk acts as a less stiff lever on
   which to transfer the forces of the legs to the arms and handle.
   Increased abdominal activity may reflect increased demand to control the
   trunk, given the altered coordination between the legs, trunk and arms.}},

Title = {{The response of a wood-frame, gable roof to fluctuating wind loads}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{498-509}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Damage surveys following severe wind storms have shown that the roofs of
   residential, wood-frame buildings are particularly vulnerable to
   failures. While damage surveys can provide detailed information of what
   components fail, they cannot provide the loads at which these failures
   occurred or how they initiated. Wind tunnel pressure models provide
   detailed information of the wind loads on buildings, however, they are
   not able to predict failures or how these loads are transferred through
   the structure. In order to better understand the response of wood framed
   houses when subjected to high wind loads, realistic fluctuating wind
   loads were applied to a full scale two-story wood frame house. The tests
   performed on the roof of the house showed that the uplift capacity of
   the roof is significantly higher than that predicted using the
   individual connection results and is attributed to significant load
   sharing between adjacent connections. Since toe-nailed, roof-to-wall
   connections are partially withdrawn during peak wind gusts, how the
   loads are transferred through the structural system, to the connections,
   changes as the connections become increasingly damaged. (C) 2012

   trade-off between performance and complexity. Compared to the existing
   non-prediction based energy-aware power allocation algorithm, which is
   solely based on the current channel state information, the proposed

Abstract = {{Purpose: First, to show that low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy plans
   using oblique needle trajectories are more successful than parallel
   trajectories for large prostates with pubic arch interference (PAI);
   second, to test the accuracy of delivering an oblique plan by using a
   three-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided
   mechatronic system.
   Methods and Materials: Prostates were contoured for 5 subjects' 3D TRUS
   images showing a maximum PAI of <= 1 cm and a prostate volume of <50 cc.
   Two planning studies were done. First, prostate contours were
   artificially enlarged to 45 to 80 cc in 5- to 10-cc increments for a
   single subject. Second, all subject prostate contours were enlarged to
   60 cc. For each study, three types of plans were manually created for
   comparison: a parallel needle template (PT) plan, a parallel needle
   no-template (PNT) plan, and an oblique needle no-template (OBL) plan.
   Needle positions and angles were not discretized for nontemplate plans.
   European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology dose-volume
   histogram guidelines, iodine-125 (145-Gy prescription, 0.43 U), and
   needle angles of <15 degrees were used. An OBL plan was delivered to a
   pubic arch containing a 60-cc prostate phantom that mimicked the anatomy
   of the subject with the greatest PAI (23\% by volume).
   Results: In the increasing-prostate volume study, OBL plans were
   successful for prostates of <= 80 cc, and PT plans were successful for
   prostates of < 65 cc. In paired, one-sided t tests for the 60-cc volume
   study, OBL plans showed dosimetric improvements for all organs compared
   to both of the parallel type plans (p < 0.05); PNT plans showed a
   benefit only in planning target volumes receiving more than 100 Gy
   compared to PT plans. A computed tomography scan of the phantom showed
   submillimeter seed placement accuracy in all directions.
   Conclusion: OBL plans were significantly better than parallel plans, and
   an OBL plan was accurately delivered to a 60-cc prostate phantom with
   23\% PAI by volume. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{IMPROVED OBJECTIVE SELECTION OF POWER DOPPLER WALL-FILTER CUT-OFF
   VELOCITY FOR ACCURATE VASCULAR QUANTIFICATION}},
Journal = {{ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The wall-filter selection curve method is proposed to objectively
   identify a cut-off velocity that minimizes artifacts in power Doppler
   images. A selection curve, which is constructed by plotting the color
   pixel density (CPD) as a function of the cut-off velocity, exhibits
   characteristic intervals hypothesized to include the optimum cut-off
   velocity. This article presents an improved implementation of the method
   that automatically detects characteristic intervals in a selection curve
   and selects an operating point cut-off velocity along a characteristic
   interval. The method is applied to subregions within the Doppler image
   to adapt the cut-off velocity to local variations in vascularity. The
   method's performance is evaluated in 30-MHz power Doppler images of a
   four-vessel flow phantom. At high (>5 mm/s) flow velocities, qualitative
   improvements in vessel delineation are achieved and the CPD in the
   resulting images is accurate to within 3\% of the vascular volume
   fraction of the phantom. (E-mail: jlacefie@uwo.ca) (C) 2012 World

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{306-315}},

Abstract = {{Retrieved knee implants were examined to investigate the influence of
   patient and implant related factors on backside damage. Fifty-two
   implants of three different models were examined that all had cemented
   tibial trays without screw holes. A semi-quantitative grading system
   supplied backside damage scores (BDS) for each polyethylene (PE) tibial
   insert. Evidence was obtained to support the use of a constraining
   partial-peripheral locking mechanism and polished tibial tray surface
   (particularly for male patients) to reduce backside damage. Overall,
   male patients in the present study were associated with higher body mass
   and higher BDS compared with female patients. Furthermore, PE inserts
   sterilized by gamma-in-air had higher BDS than PE inserts sterilized in
   inert environments (gas-plasma or ethylene-oxide). Also, the proximal
   surfaces of tibial trays that had been grit-blasted showed embedded
   particles that may have increased backside damage. While none of these
   overall findings was unexpected, the present study provided detailed
   supporting analysis based on data from clinical retrievals, which may
   further support the use of a polished tibial tray combined with
   partial-peripheral locking mechanism to reduce BDS. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Since its acceptance as the adopted symmetric-key algorithm, the
   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and its recently standardized
   authentication Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) have been utilized in various
   security-constrained applications. Many of the AES-GCM applications are
   power and resource constrained and require efficient hardware
   implementations. In this paper, different application-specific
   integrated circuit (ASIC) architectures of building blocks of the
   AES-GCM algorithms are evaluated and optimized to identify the
   high-performance and low-power architectures for the AES-GCM. For the
   AES, we evaluate the performance of more than 40 S-boxes utilizing a
   fixed benchmark platform in 65-nm CMOS technology. To obtain the least
   complexity S-box, the formulations for the Galois Field (GF) subfield
   inversions in GF(2(4)) are optimized. By conducting exhaustive
   simulations for the input transitions, we analyze the average and peak
   power consumptions of the AES S-boxes considering the switching
   activities, gate-level netlists, and parasitic information.
   Additionally, we present high-speed, parallel hardware architectures for
   reaching low-latency and high-throughput structures of the GCM. Finally,
   by investigating the high-performance GF(2(128)) multiplier
   architectures, we benchmark the proposed AES-GCM architectures using
   quadratic and subquadratic hardware complexity GF(2(128)) multipliers.
   It is shown that the performance of the presented AES-GCM architectures
   outperforms the previously reported ones in the utilized 65-nm CMOS
   technology.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient implementation of point multiplication is crucial for elliptic
   curve cryptographic systems. This paper presents the implementation
   results of an elliptic curve crypto-processor over binary fields
   GF(2(m)) on binary Edwards and generalized Hessian curves using Gaussian
   normal basis (GNB). We demonstrate how parallelization in higher levels
   can be performed by full resource utilization of computing point
   addition and point-doubling formulas for both binary Edwards and
   generalized Hessian curves. Then, we employ the w-coordinate
   differential formulations for computing point multiplication. Using a
   lookup-table (LUT)-based pipelined and efficient digit-level GNB
   multiplier, we evaluate the LUT complexity and time-area tradeoffs of
   the proposed crypto-processor on an FPGA. We also compare the
   implementation results of point multiplication on these curves with the
   ones on the traditional binary generic curve. To the best of the
   authors' knowledge, this is the first FPGA implementation of point
   multiplication on binary Edwards and generalized Hessian curves
   represented by w-coordinates.}},

Abstract = {{Tremendous interest exists towards synthesizing nanoassemblies for
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using earth-abundant and -friendly
   materials with green synthetic approaches. In this work, high surface
   area TiO2 nanowire arrays were grown on the surface of functionalized
   graphene sheets (FGSs) containing -COOH functionalities acting as a
   template by using a sol-gel method in the green solvent, supercritical
   carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). The effect of scCO(2) pressure (1500, 3000 and
   5000 psi), temperature (40, 60 and 80 degrees C), acetic acid/titanium
   isopropoxide monomer ratios (HAc/TIP = 2, 4 and 6), functionalized
   graphene sheets. FGSs/TIP weight ratios (1: 20, 1: 40 and 1: 60 w/w) and
   solvents (EtOH, hexane) were investigated. Increasing the HAc/TIPweight
   ratio from 4 to 6 in scCO(2) resulted in increasing the TiO2 nanowire
   diameter from 10 to 40 nm. Raman and high resolution XPS showed the
   interaction of TiO2 with the -COOH groups on the surface of the graphene
   sheets, indicating that graphene acted as a template for
   polycondensation growth. UV-vis diffuse reflectance and
   photoluminescence spectroscopy showed a reduction in titania's bandgap
   and also a significant reduction in electron-hole recombination compared
   to bare TiO2 nanowires. Photocurrent measurements showed that the TiO2
   nanowire/graphene composites prepared in scCO(2) gave a 5 x enhancement
   in photoefficiency compared to bare TiO2 nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are used widely in today's consumer
   electronics and offer great potential for hybrid electric vehicles
   (HEVs), plug-in HEVs, pure EVs, and also in smart grids as future
   energy-storage devices. However, many challenges must be addressed
   before these future applications of LIBs are realized, such as the
   energy and power density of LIBs, their cycle and calendar life, safety
   characteristics, and costs. Recently, a technique called atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) attracted great interest as a novel tool and approach
   for resolving these issues. In this article, recent advances in using
   ALD for LIB studies are thoroughly reviewed, covering two technical
   routes: 1) ALD for designing and synthesizing new LIB components, i.e.,
   anodes, cathodes, and solid electrolytes, and; 2) ALD used in modifying
   electrode properties via surface coating. This review will hopefully
   stimulate more extensive and insightful studies on using ALD for
   developing high-performance LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{The transport of particles through groundwater systems is governed by a
   complex interplay of mechanical and chemical forces that are ultimately
   responsible for binding to geological substrates. To understand these
   forces in the context of zero valent iron particles used in the
   remediation of groundwater, atomic force microscopy (AFM)based force
   spectroscopy was employed to characterize the interactions between AFM
   tips modified with either carbonyl iron particles (CIP) or
   electrodeposited Fe as a function of counterion valency, temperature,
   particle morphology, and age. The measured interaction forces were
   always attractive for both fresh and aged CIP and electrodeposited iron,
   except in 100 mM NaCl, as a consequence of electrostatic attraction
   between the negatively charged mica and positively charged iron. In 100
   mM NaCl, repulsive hydration forces appeared to dominate. Good agreement
   was found between the experimental data and predictions based on the
   extended DLVO (XDLVO) theory. The effect of aging on iron particle
   composition and morphology was assessed by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) revealing that the aged particles
   comprising zero valent iron core passivated by a mixture of iron oxides
   and hydroxides. Force spectroscopy showed that aging caused variations
   in the adhesive force due to the changes in particle morphology and
   contact area.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{197}},
Pages = {{322-329}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The effects of particle properties (density and size) on solids holdup
   (epsilon(s)) in the riser of a Liquid-Solid Circulating Fluidized Bed
   (LSCFB) were investigated experimentally based on three parameters: the
   superficial liquid velocity (U-l), the normalized superficial liquid
   velocity (U-l/U-t)and the excess superficial liquid velocity (U-l-U-t).
   The results showed that the excess superficial liquid velocity (U-l-U-t)
   among those three parameters is a more appropriate parameter to evaluate
   the effects of the particle properties on the solids holdup facilitating
   general and direct comparisons for different types of particles. A
   discussion on the force balance of the particles revealed that the
   excess superficial liquid velocity (U-l-U-t) is approximately equivalent
   to the average particle velocity ((V) over bar (p)) when the solids
   holdup (epsilon(s)) is less than 0.1. Also the solids holdup
   (epsilon(s)) is a function of superficial solids velocity (U-s) and
   particle velocity (V-p), expressed quantitatively in terms of average
   value as (epsilon) over bar (s) = U-s/(V) over barp = U-s/(U-l-U-t) when
   (epsilon) over bar (s) < 0.1. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Stress has long been thought of to be associated with increased risk of
   cancer. Chronic stress is associated with elevated levels of sympathetic
   neurotransmitter (norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y: NPY) release and
   immunosuppression. The expression of NPY receptors has been reported in
   human breast carcinomas. Recently, activation of the NPY Y5 receptor was
   shown to stimulate cell growth and increase migration in human breast
   cancer cells; however the effects of NPY have yet to be investigated in
   a murine model of breast cancer. Thus, the specific aims of the current
   study were to: (i) characterize NPY receptor expression in 4T1 breast
   cancer cells and orthotopic tumors grown in BALB/c mice and (ii)
   investigate the impact of NPY receptor activation on 4T1 cell
   proliferation and migration in vitro. Positive expression of NPY
   receptors (Y1R, Y2R and Y5R) was observed in cells and tumor tissue. As
   well, NPY treatment of 4T1 cells promoted a concentration-dependent
   increase in proliferation, through increased phosphorylation of ERK 1/2.
   Using NPY receptor antagonists (Y1R:BIBP3226, Y2R:BIIE0246 and
   Y5R:L-152,804), we found the proliferative response to be Y5R mediated.
   Additionally, NPY increased chemotaxis through Y2R and Y5R activation.
   These data are in congruence with those from human cell lines and
   highlight the 4T1 cell line as a translatable model of breast cancer in
   which the effects of NPY can be studied in an immunocompetent system.}},

Abstract = {{A novel active and multi-dose dry powder inhaler (DPI) was developed and
   evaluated to deliver a small quantity (100-500 mu g) of pure drug
   without any excipient. This dry powder inhaler utilized two compressed
   air flows to dispense and deliver drug powder: the primary flow
   aerosolizes the drug powder from its pocket and the secondary flow
   further disperses the aerosol.
   In vitro tests by Anderson Cascade Impactor (ACI) indicated that the
   fine particle fraction (FPF) (<4.7 mu m) of drug delivery could reach
   over a range of 50-70\% (w/w). Emitted dose tests showed that delivery
   efficiency was above 85\% and its relative standard deviation (RSD) was
   under 10\%. Confocal microscopy was used to confirm the deposition of
   fluorescently labeled spray-dried powder in rabbit lungs. Also, a
   chromatographic method was used to quantify drug deposition. The results
   of animal tests showed that 57\% of aerosol deposited in the rabbit lung
   and 24\% deposited in its trachea. All the results implied that this
   novel active dry powder inhaler could efficiently deliver a small
   quantity of fine drug particles into the lung with quite high fine
   particle fraction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconium oxide (ZrO2) thin film was deposited on nitrogen-doped carbon
   nanotubes (NCNTs) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using
   tetrakis(dimethylamido)zirconium(IV) and water as precursors. The
   observation using scanning electron microscope and transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) revealed that the tubular films of 100-cycle ZrO2 were
   very uniform and conformal on NCNTs. Further characterization using
   X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, selected area electron
   diffraction, and high-resolution TEM disclosed that the crystallinity of
   the deposited ZrO2 films was controllable with deposition temperatures
   in the range of 100-250 degrees C. In contrast to the pure amorphous
   ZrO2 film deposited at 100 degrees C, tetragonal crystalline ZrO2 film
   was prepared at 250 degrees C, while a mixture of the former two phases
   was found between 150 and 200 degrees C. In all cases, the growth of
   ZrO2 tubular films on NCNTs showed a transformation from an island
   growth mode to a layer-by-layer growth mode with increasing ALD cycles.
   The ZrO2-NCNT nanocomposites with controllable crystallinity will have
   great potential for various applications in fuel cells, batteries,
   electronics devices, and chemical sensors.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effect of incorporating wollastonite microfibers in
   ultrahigh performance concrete (UHPC) on its early-age properties was
   investigated. Wollastonite microfibers were added at 0, 4, 8, and 12\%
   as partial volume replacement for cement. Results show that the
   early-age properties of UHPC mixtures incorporating wollastonite
   microfibers are highly affected by the microfiber content and aspect
   ratio. Increasing the wollastonite microfiber content resulted in a
   compressive strength comparable to or higher than that of the control
   mixture without microfibers. Wollastonite microfibers reduced shrinkage
   strains and increased cracking resistance compared to that of the
   control mixture. However, no significant improvement in the flexural
   behavior was achieved with the addition of wollastonite microfibers
   because of a sudden rupture of microfibers within the matrix.
   Wollastonite microfibers can act as an internal restraint for shrinkage,
   reinforcing the microstructure at the microcrack level, and leading to
   an enhancement of the early-age engineering properties of UHPC matrix.
   Partially replacing cement with natural wollastonite microfibers leads
   to a reduction in the cement factor, which represents economic and
   environmental benefits. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000473. (C)

Title = {{The importance of the posterior osteoligamentous complex to subaxial
   cervical spine stability in relation to a unilateral facet injury}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{590-595}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Unilateral facet disruptions are relatively common
   in the cervical spine; however, the spectrum of injury is large, and
   little is known regarding the magnitude of instability expected to be
   present in an isolated posterior osteoligamentous injury.
   PURPOSE: To quantify the contribution of the posterior osteoligamentous
   structures to cervical spine stability during simulated
   flexion-extension (FE), lateral bend (LB), and axial rotation (AR).
   STUDY
   DESIGN: An in vitro biomechanical study.
   METHODS: Eight cadaveric C2-C5 spines were used in this study. A
   custom-developed spinal loading simulator applied independent FE, LB,
   and AR to the specimens at 3 degrees/s up to 61.5 Nm. Using an optical
   tracking system, data were collected for the intact specimen and after
   sequential surgical interventions of posterior ligamentous complex (PLC)
   disruption, unilateral capsular disruption, progressive resection of the
   inferior articular process of C3 by one-half, and finally complete
   resection of the inferior articular process of C3. The magnitude of
   segmental and overall range of motion (ROM) for each simulated movement
   along with the overall neutral zone (NZ) was analyzed using two-way
   repeated-measures analyses of variance and post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls
   tests (alpha=.05).
   RESULTS: An increase in ROM was evident for all movements (p<.001).
   Within FE, ROM increased after cutting only the PLC (p<.05). For AR,
   sectioning of the PLC and complete bony facet fracture increased ROM
   (p<.05). Lateral bend ROM increased after facet capsular injury and
   complete articular facet removal (p<.05). There was an overall effect of
   injury pattern on the magnitude of the NZ for both FE (p<.001) and AR
   (p<. 001) but not for LB (p-.6); however, the maximum increase in NZ
   generated was only 30\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PLC and facet complex are dominant stabilizers for FE
   and AR, respectively. The overall changes in both ROM and NZ were
   relatively small but consistent with an isolated posterior
   osteoligamentous complex injury of the Stage I flexion-distraction
   injury. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{548-562}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is well-known that specimen-preparation method and the resulting sand
   fabric significantly affect sand behavior. In many cases, the fabric and
   behavior of reconstituted sand samples do not represent those of in-situ
   deposits. Therefore, understanding the influence of specimen preparation
   and sand fabric on its behavior, particularly at the critical state, is
   important for relating the behavior of laboratory reconstituted
   specimens to in-situ soil response. In this study, the effect of sand
   fabric and specimen-preparation method on the shearing behavior of three
   sands is studied using ring-shear tests. Ring-shear tests are used to
   reach large shear displacements and determine critical states,
   particularly for dense sand specimens. Moist tamping and air pluviation
   are used to prepare the specimens. The results indicate that the
   shearing behavior of sand in ring-shear tests is not only affected by
   the specimen-preparation method (i.e., sand fabric), but also by
   particle damage and compressibility. However, these mechanisms do not
   affect the critical states at which particle rearrangement and damage
   are complete and the initial sand fabric is completely erased.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, surface effects on the vibration and buckling of a
   clamped-clamped piezoelectric nanoplate (PNP) are investigated by using
   Kirchhoff plate theory with the incorporation of the surface
   piezoelectricity model and the generalized Young-Laplace equations. Ritz
   solutions show that the surface effects on the resonant frequency are
   more prominent for the PNPs with smaller thickness and larger aspect
   ratio, with dominant effect from surface piezoelectricity and residual
   surface stress. Results also suggest potential for frequency tuning of
   the PNPs via applied electric potentials. Simulation results on the
   critical buckling potential indicate that the influence of the combined
   surface effects is the competition between the residual surface stress
   and surface piezoelectricity. This work is helpful for the
   characterization of the mechanical properties and design of PNP-based
   devices. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2012}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy systems have developed wide interest to supply
   electricity in remote areas as well as for distributed power generation
   particularly during peak loads. Fuel-cell-based power generation is also
   gaining popularity in residential applications as well as distributed
   power generation due to its cleanliness, portability, and suitability
   for electricity and heat generation. Development of a suitable power
   electronic interface to make the technology viable is still a challenge.
   This paper presents modeling, simulation, and experimental study of a
   fuel cell (FC) power plant (FCPP) suitable for stand-alone application
   as well as for micro-grid/grid interface. A single-stage pulsewidth
   modulation inverter is selected as power electronic interface between FC
   and grid. A mathematical model is developed in per unit system to define
   the power limits in terms of FC, converter, and power system parameters.
   The simulation model is developed in MATLAB environment with control
   scheme implementation in qd reference frame for investigation. A
   prototype of single-stage FCPP is developed in the laboratory to
   validate the results.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical approach to compute restrained shrinkage effects on

   test-to-predicted ratios for these quantities are excellent, with a mean
   value of 0.89 and a coefficient of variation of 0.11. It is also
   demonstrated that (1) single test specimens with a single drying face
   exhibit a large gradient of free shrinkage strain across the depth of
   the specimen that must be properly considered in the analysis; (2)
   shrinkage parameters estimated using generic rules based on the concrete
   mixture composition are not realistic for the particular mix used by
   Brattland and Kennedy; and (3) history-independent analysis methods, as
   described in Annex H of CSA S16-09, do not accurately predict the slab

Abstract = {{Accuracy and validity of scintillation indices estimated using the power
   and phase of the GPS signal depend heavily on the detrending method used
   and the selection of the cutoff frequency of the associated filter. A
   Butterworth filter with a constant cutoff frequency of 0.1 Hz is
   commonly used in detrending GPS data. In this study, the performance of
   this commonly used filter is evaluated and compared with a new
   wavelet-based detrending method using GPS data from high latitudes. It
   was observed that in detrending high-latitude GPS data, a wavelet filter
   performed better than Butterworth filters as the correlation between
   amplitude- and phase-scintillation indices in S (4) and sigma (I center
   dot) improved significantly from 0.53, when using a Butterworth filter,
   to 0.79, when using the wavelet filtering method. We also introduced an
   improved phase-scintillation index, sigma (CHAIN), which we think is
   comparatively a better parameter to represent phase scintillations at
   high latitudes as the correlation between S (4) and sigma (CHAIN) was as
   high as 0.90. During the analysis, we also noted that the occurrence of
   the ``phase scintillation without amplitude scintillation{''} phenomenon
   was significantly reduced when scintillation indices were derived using
   the wavelet-based detrending method. These results seem to indicate that
   wavelet-based detrending is better suited for GPS scintillation signals
   and also that sigma (CHAIN) is a better parameter for representing GPS
   phase scintillations at high latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{The lake levels in Lake Michigan-Huron have recently fallen to near
   historical lows, as has the elevation difference between Lake
   Michigan-Huron compared to Lake Erie. This decline in lake levels has
   the potential to cause detrimental impacts on the lake ecosystems,
   together with social and economic impacts on communities in the entire
   Great Lakes region. Results from past work suggest that morphological
   changes in the St Clair River, which is the only natural outlet for Lake
   Michigan-Huron, could be an appreciable factor in the recent trends of
   lake level decline. A key research question is whether bed erosion
   within the river has caused an increase in water conveyance, therefore,
   contributed to the falling lake level. In this paper, a numerical
   modeling approach with field data is used to investigate the possibility
   of sediment movement in the St Clair River and assess the likelihood of
   morphological change under the current flow regime. A two-dimensional
   numerical model was used to study flow structure, bed shear stress, and
   sediment mobility/armoring over a range of flow discharges. Boundary
   conditions for the numerical model were provided by detailed field
   measurements that included high-resolution bathymetry and
   three-dimensional flow velocities. The results indicate that, without
   considering other effects, under the current range of flow conditions,
   the shear stresses produced by the river flow are too low to transport
   most of the coarse bed sediment within the reach and are too low to
   cause substantial bed erosion or bed scour. However, the detailed maps
   of the bed show mobile bedforms in the upper St Clair River that are
   indicative of sediment transport. Relatively high shear stresses near a
   constriction at the upstream end of the river and at channel bends could
   cause local scour and deposition. Ship-induced propeller wake erosion
   also is a likely cause of sediment movement in the entire reach. Other
   factors that may promote sediment movement, such as ice cover and
   dredging in the lower river, require further investigation. Copyright

Abstract = {{A model to represent loss of control effectiveness in an aircraft is
   developed by analyzing physical faults in the hydraulically-driven
   control surfaces. A hybrid fault-tolerant control system (FTCS) that
   combines the merits of passive and active FTCSs is proposed to
   accommodate this kind of partial actuator failures. The hybrid FTCS is
   able to first slow down the rate of fault induced system deterioration
   with minimal fault information so that the fault detection and diagnosis
   (FDD) schemes can have additional time to achieve more accurate fault
   diagnosis. Once the correct fault information is obtained, the hybrid
   FTCS can counteract the faults effectively through an optimal
   reconfigurable controller. Depending on the availability of actuator
   redundancies, the passive FTCS and the reconfigurable controller are
   designed in the framework of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach.
   Case studies of an aircraft subject to different degree of loss of
   control effectiveness have been carried out to prove the effectiveness
   of this new approach to FTCS.}},

Abstract = {{Mass transfer and hydrodynamic characteristics of an oscillatory-plate
   column (OPC) and their relation to energy dissipation were investigated
   using a 0.1-m diameter pilot-scale unit. The column is characterized by
   having plates with a small hole diameter (1.63.2?mm) oscillating at 180
   degrees out of phase at higher frequencies (030?Hz) and small amplitudes
   (03.2?mm). Using this design, it was possible to achieve gas holdup and
   specific interfacial areas as high as similar to 0.8 and 400?m1,
   respectively. The maximum gas superficial velocity achieved reaches as
   high as 1.7?m/s, while the axial dispersion coefficient ranged from
   similar to 104 to over similar to 3 x 10(3)?m2s1, which is almost one
   order of magnitude lower than that in bubble columns under similar flow
   rates. The value of gas velocity of similar to 0.1?m?s1 seems to mark a
   transition beyond which interfacial area, holdup, and axial mixing
   become practically unchanged. Keeping in view its performance
   characteristics, the column can satisfactorily meet many of the demands
   posed by intensified wastewater treatment processes, namely high rates
   of oxygen transfer, multistage operational mode, uniform distribution of
   small-scale turbulence structure, and the ability to handle sludge with
   relatively high concentrations of suspended solids.}},

Abstract = {{The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, a transient global warming event,
   is characterized by extensive evidence of a more active hydrological
   cycle. This includes a widespread pulse of kaolinite accumulation on
   continental margins, viewed as the by-product of either enhanced
   chemical weathering consistent with much more humid conditions and/or
   increased erosion of previously deposited laterites. The former would be
   more consistent with year-round humid conditions, whereas the latter
   might be indicative of extreme seasonal precipitation patterns. To
   assess these hypotheses, we present a new high-resolution clay mineral
   assemblage and oxygen isotope record from Bass River, a site on the New
   Jersey margin (east coast of North America), which shows a sharp rise in
   the abundance of kaolinite beginning a few thousand years before the
   onset of the carbon isotope excursion (CIE). The delta O-18 of the <2-mu
   m-size fraction exhibits a shift toward lower values during the event.
   On the basis of a coeval shift in clay assemblages, the shift in delta
   O-18(Clays) can be explained by a shift in the relative percent of the
   primary clay phases rather than a change in the isotopic composition of
   kaolinite, as would be expected if the kaolinite had been produced
   primarily during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum. This finding
   points to accelerated exhumation and erosion of kaolinitic soils, most
   likely Cretaceous laterites.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the dynamics of vestibular perception is important, for
   example, for improving the realism of motion simulation and virtual
   reality environments or for diagnosing patients suffering from
   vestibular problems. Previous research has found a dependence of
   direction discrimination thresholds for rotational motions on the period
   length (inverse frequency) of a transient (single cycle) sinusoidal
   acceleration stimulus. However, self-motion is seldom purely sinusoidal,
   and up to now, no models have been proposed that take into account
   non-sinusoidal stimuli for rotational motions. In this work, the
   influence of both the period length and the specific time course of an
   inertial stimulus is investigated. Thresholds for three acceleration
   profile shapes (triangular, sinusoidal, and trapezoidal) were measured
   for three period lengths (0.3, 1.4, and 6.7 s) in ten participants. A
   two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task was used where
   participants had to judge if a yaw rotation around an earth-vertical
   axis was leftward or rightward. The peak velocity of the stimulus was
   varied, and the threshold was defined as the stimulus yielding 75 \%
   correct answers. In accordance with previous research, thresholds
   decreased with shortening period length (from similar to 2 deg/s for 6.7
   s to similar to 0.8 deg/s for 0.3 s). The peak velocity was the
   determining factor for discrimination: Different profiles with the same
   period length have similar velocity thresholds. These measurements were
   used to fit a novel model based on a description of the firing rate of
   semi-circular canal neurons. In accordance with previous research, the
   estimates of the model parameters suggest that velocity storage does not
   influence perceptual thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{The eastern North China Craton (NCC) west of the Pacific Ocean has a
   long history of rifting from Early Cretaceous to the end of Paleogene
   when the craton experienced destruction and significant thinning of the
   lithosphere. The cause and geotectonic environment for this destruction
   remain controversial. We use a set of field observation including basin
   patterns, fault geometry and kinematics, fault plane slip data, dike
   distribution, and fabric data from metamorphic core complexes to
   determine the kinematic evolution of the deformation in the eastern NCC
   during this period. We show that the principal extension direction in
   the eastern NCC evolved from WNW-ESE in the earliest-middle Early
   Cretaceous, via NW-SE in the latest Early Cretaceous, to nearly N-S in
   the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene. The movement history, from Late Mesozoic
   to Early Cenozoic, of the oceanic plates in the Pacific Ocean with
   respect to the eastern NCC is available from previous studies. The
   Izanagi Plate first subducted nearly orthogonally (WNW-wards) during
   earliest-middle Early Cretaceous time, and then moved obliquely
   (NNW-wards) in the latest Early Cretaceous while the relaying Pacific
   Plate moved generally northwards from the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene.
   Both the movement direction of oceanic plates and the principal
   extension direction of the continental deformation rotated clockwise. We
   suggest that such a correlation can be explained by the eastern NCC
   being in a backarc setting in the Cretaceous-Paleogene period. The
   results support the backarc extensional model for the destruction and
   significant lithospheric thinning of the eastern NCC. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Background: The aim was to examine the cost-effectiveness of magnetic
   resonance enterography (MRE) compared with computed tomography
   enterography (CTE) for routine imaging of small bowel Crohn's disease
   (CD) patients to reduce patients' life-time radiation-induced cancer
   risk. Methods: We developed a Markov model to compare the lifetime
   costs, benefits (measured in quality-adjusted life-years {[}QALYs] of
   survival and cancers averted) and cost-effectiveness of using MRE rather
   than CTE for routine disease monitoring in hypothetical cohorts of
   100,000 20-year-old patients with CD. We assumed each CT radiation
   exposure conferred an incremental annual risk of developing cancer using
   the linear, no-threshold model. Results: In the base case of 16 mSv per
   CTE, we estimated that radiation from CTE resulted in 1,206 to 20,146
   additional cancers depending on the frequency of patient monitoring.
   Compared to using CTE only, using MRE until age 30 and CTE thereafter
   resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between
   \$37,538 and \$41,031 per life-year (LY) gained and between \$52,969 and
   \$57,772 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Using MRE until
   age 50 resulted in ICERs between \$58,022 and \$62,648 per LY gained and
   between \$84,250 and \$90,982 per QALY gained. In a threshold analysis,
   any use of MRE had an ICER of greater than \$100,000 per QALY gained
   when CT radiation doses are less than 6.0 mSv per CTE exam. Conclusions:
   MRE is likely cost-effective compared to CTE in patients younger than
   age 50. Low-dose CTE may be an alternative cost-effective choice in the
   future. (Inflamm Bowel Dis 2011;)}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Susceptibility field gradients (SFGs) cause problems for functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in regions like the orbital frontal
   lobes, leading to signal loss and image artifacts (signal displacement
   and ``pile-up{''}). Pulse sequences with spiral-in k-space trajectories
   are often used when acquiring fMRI in SFG regions such as
   inferior/medial temporal cortex because it is believed that they have
   improved signal recovery and decreased signal displacement properties.
   Previously postulated theories explain differing reasons why spiral-in
   appears to perform better than spiral-out; however it is clear that
   multiple mechanisms are occurring in parallel. This study explores
   differences in spiral-in and spiral-out images using human and phantom
   empirical data, as well as simulations consistent with the phantom
   model.
   Using image simulations, the displacement of signal was characterized
   using point spread functions (PSFs) and target maps, the latter of which
   are conceptually inverse PSFs describing which spatial locations
   contribute signal to a particular voxel. The magnitude of both PSFs and
   target maps was found to be identical for spiral-out and spiral-in
   acquisitions, with signal in target maps being displaced from distant
   regions in both cases. However, differences in the phase of the signal
   displacement patterns that consequently lead to changes in the
   intervoxel phase coherence were found to be a significant mechanism
   explaining differences between the spiral sequences.
   The results demonstrate that spiral-in trajectories do preserve more
   total signal in SFG regions than spiral-out; however, spiral-in does not
   in fact exhibit decreased signal displacement. Given that this signal
   can be displaced by significant distances, its recovery may not be
   preferable for all fMRI applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{User satisfaction has always been a major factor in the success of
   software, regardless of whether it is closed proprietary or open source
   software (OSS). In open source projects, usability aspects cannot be
   improved unless there are ways to test and measure them. Hence, the
   increasing popularity of open source projects among novice and
   non-technical users necessitates a usability evaluation methodology.
   Consequently, this paper presents a usability maturity model
   specifically aimed at usability-related issues for open source projects.
   In particular, the model examines the degree of coordination between
   open source projects and their usability aspects. The measuring
   instrument of the model contains factors that have been selected from
   four of our empirical studies, which examine the perspectives of OSS
   users, developers, contributors and the industry. In addition to
   presenting the usability maturity model, this paper discusses assessment
   questionnaires, a rating methodology and two case studies. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) assesses the
   vascular support of tumours through analysis of temporal changes in
   attenuation in blood vessels and tissues during a rapid series of images
   acquired with intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material.
   Commercial software for DCE-CT analysis allows pixel-by-pixel
   calculation of a range of validated physiological parameters and
   depiction as parametric maps. Clinical studies support the use of DCE-CT
   parameters as surrogates for physiological and molecular processes
   underlying tumour angiogenesis. DCE-CT has been used to provide
   biomarkers of drug action in early phase trials for the treatment of a
   range of cancers. DCE-CT can be appended to current imaging assessments
   of tumour response with the benefits of wide availability and low cost.
   This paper sets out guidelines for the use of DCE-CT in assessing tumour
   vascular support that were developed using a Delphi process.
   Recommendations encompass CT system requirements and quality assurance,
   radiation dosimetry, patient preparation, administration of contrast
   material, CT acquisition parameters, terminology and units, data
   processing and reporting. DCE-CT has reached technical maturity for use
   in therapeutic trials in oncology. The development of these consensus
   guidelines may promote broader application of DCE-CT for the evaluation
   of tumour vascularity.

Title = {{Downer reactor flow measurements using CREC-GS-Optiprobes}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{224}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The present study describes the potential intrusive effects of
   CREC-GS-Optiprobes on the flow pattern in gas-solid downflow units.
   Granular flows and their interactions with the CREC-GS-Optiprobes are
   calculated using a CPFD (Computational Particle Fluid Dynamic) numerical
   scheme in three dimensions, using particle clusters. Once particles
   dispersed in the column, the numerical simulations revealed that these
   particles formed a relatively homogeneous suspension with cluster
   formation and solids accelerating until reaching a fully-developed
   regime. CPFD simulations showed that two axially aligned
   CREC-GS-Optiprobes, when placed in the fully developed flow regime,
   introduce minimum perturbations in the gas-solid suspension. Therefore
   this CREC-GS-Optiprobe creates a highly illuminated focal region where
   hydrodynamic parameters can be measured without significant flow
   disturbance. Thus, this study supports the application of fiber optic
   probes; such as in the case of the CREC-GS-Optiprobes, which can provide
   undisturbed axial particle cluster velocity, axial cluster slip
   velocities, cluster size and solid fraction measurements at
   strategically selected locations in the gas-solid downer unit. (C) 2012

Journal = {{MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{977-994}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With the growing use of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) in various
   infrastructure applications, it has become necessary to establish
   reliable data on its long-term durability since its mixture design,
   rheology and consolidation are different than that of normal concrete.
   Several applications of SCC involve its exposure to chemical attack,
   particularly to sulphate-rich media such as wastewater treatment
   facilities, industrial and agricultural zones which also encompass
   ammonium cations. Thereby, this study aims at investigating the
   resistance of a wide scope of SCC mixture designs to ammonium sulphate
   attack. Specimens from 23 SCC mixtures were continuously immersed in a
   high concentration ammonium sulphate solution with controlled pH
   (6.0-8.0) up to 54 weeks. The main test variables included the type of
   binder (single, binary, ternary and quaternary), air-entrainment,
   sand-to-total aggregates mass ratio, and the inclusion of fibre
   reinforcement (single and hybrid). The SCC specimens showed variable
   degrees of deterioration after 54 weeks, indicating different modes of
   degradation. The study highlights the role of ternary and quaternary
   binders in improving the resistance of SCC to ammonium sulphate attack.
   It is also emphasized that multiple performance indicators are needed to
   achieve a reliable assessment of cement-based materials under ammonium
   sulphate attack.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of applying oscillatory flows as a method for enhancing
   the performance of electrodialysis with bipolar membrane has been
   investigated using the production of lactic acid from sodium lactate
   solution as an example. Up to 160\% increase to the limiting current
   density was achieved using such intensification approach. The
   enhancement was found to increase with increasing the oscillation
   frequency and amplitude but decreased with the cell steady flow rate,
   likely due to flow reversal inhibition. The enhancement mechanism was
   mainly attributed to the increase in mass transfer rate at the cationic
   membrane fluid-surface interface due to the oscillatory shear and the
   eddies generated at the rough surface of the net spacers during flow
   reversals. This however, did not have any measurable effect on the mass
   transfer at the bipolar membrane, indicating negligible mass transfer
   resistance there. A correlation is developed for predicting the
   percentage limiting current density enhancement with an average error of
   11\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work aims to investigate the electroelastic responses of a thin

   elasticity, residual surface stress and surface piezoelectricity, are
   incorporated into the conventional Kirchhoff plate theory for a
   piezoelectric plate via the surface piezoelectricity model and the
   generalized Young-Laplace equations. Different from the results
   predicted by the conventional plate theory ignoring the surface effects,
   the proposed model predicts size-dependent behaviours of the
   piezoelectric thin plate with nanoscale thickness. It is found that
   surface effects have significant influence on the electroelastic
   responses of the piezoelectric nanoplate. This work is expected to
   provide more accurate predictions on characterizing nanofilm or

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional porous self-assembled LiFePO4/graphene (LFP/G)
   composite was successfully fabricated using a facile template-free
   sol-gel approach. Graphene nanosheets were incorporated into the porous
   hierarchical network homogenously, which greatly enhances the electrical
   conductivity and efficient use of the LiFePO4 (LFP), leading to an
   outstanding electrochemical performance of the hybrid cathodes. The
   obtained LFP/G composite has a reversible capacity of 146 mAh g(-1) at
   17 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles, which is more than 1.4 times higher than
   that of porous LFP (104 mAh g(-1)). Moreover, the porous LFP/G composite
   also exhibits a desirable tolerance to varied charge/discharge current
   densities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to use an animal model to quantify the
   spatial displacement uncertainties and test the fundamental assumptions
   of an image-based 4D-CT algorithm in vivo. Six female Landrace cross
   pigs were ventilated and imaged using a 64-slice CT scanner (GE
   Healthcare) operating in axial cine mode. The breathing amplitude
   pattern of the pigs was varied by periodically crimping the ventilator
   gas return tube during the image acquisition. The image data were used
   to determine the displacement uncertainties that result from matching CT
   images at the same respiratory phase using normalized cross correlation
   (NCC) as the matching criteria. Additionally, the ability to match the
   respiratory phase of a 4.0 cm subvolume of the thorax to a reference
   subvolume using only a single overlapping 2D slice from the two
   subvolumes was tested by varying the location of the overlapping
   matching image within the subvolume and examining the effect this had on
   the displacement relative to the reference volume. The displacement
   uncertainty resulting from matching two respiratory images using NCC
   ranged from 0.54 +/- 0.10 mm per match to 0.32 +/- 0.16 mm per match in
   the lung of the animal. The uncertainty was found to propagate in
   quadrature, increasing with number of NCC matches performed. In
   comparison, the minimum displacement achievable if two respiratory
   images were matched perfectly in phase ranged from 0.77 +/- 0.06 to 0.93
   +/- 0.06 mm in the lung. The assumption that subvolumes from separate
   cine scan could be matched by matching a single overlapping 2D image
   between to subvolumes was validated. An in vivo animal model was
   developed to test an image-based 4D-CT algorithm. The uncertainties
   associated with using NCC to match the respiratory phase of two images
   were quantified and the assumption that a 4.0 cm 3D subvolume can by
   matched in respiratory phase by matching a single 2D image from the 3D
   subvolume was validated. The work in this paper shows the image-based
   4D-CT algorithm to be a promising method for producing 4D-CT images for
   radiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The 1971 San Fernando earthquake led to the failure and large
   displacement of the Lower San Fernando dam, which was constructed by the
   hydraulic filling method. Hydraulic filling has been condemned as
   producing liquefiable sand deposits, and in situ relative densities as
   large as 60\% have been reported in the Lower San Fernando dam. On the
   other hand, laboratory element tests on loosest specimens of primarily
   quartz sands, pluviated through air or water (resembling the soil fabric
   produced by hydraulic filling) have been dilative, which brings into
   question the failure mechanism of the Lower San Fernando dam. In this
   paper, the behaviour of the dam during the 1971 earthquake is studied
   using the results of an improved sliding-block deformation analysis,
   which incorporates the shearing behaviour from ring shear tests of two
   sands with different mineralogies: quartz sand, and albite sand with
   some carbonates. The results indicate that sand particle composition and
   compressibility may have caused the failure and large displacement of
   the Lower San Fernando dam, even in a dense state (relative density
   similar to 60\%).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an artificial intelligence model has been developed to
   predict the rheological properties of oil well cement (OWC) slurries
   incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such as
   metakaolin (MK), silica fume (SF), rice husk ash (RHA) or fly ash (FA).
   An experimental study has been carried out to create the database used
   for training the model. OWC slurries having a water-to-binder ratio of
   0.44 along with a new-generation, polycarboxylate-based, high-range
   water-reducing admixture (PCH) were prepared. They had 5 to 15\% partial
   replacement of API class-G OWC by MK, SF, RHA or FA. The rheological
   properties of the slurries were investigated at different temperatures
   in the range 23 to 60 degrees C using an advanced
   shear-stress/shear-strain controlled rheometer. Experimental data thus
   obtained were used to develop a predictive model based on feed-forward
   back-propagation artificial neural networks. The developed model could
   effectively predict the effect of key variables such as temperature,
   dosage of SCM and dosage of PCH on the rheological properties of OWC
   slurries with an absolute error of less than 7\%. The developed model
   could also effectively predict the rheological properties of new
   slurries designed within the range of input parameters of the
   experimental database used in the training process.}},

Abstract = {{The instability of a functionally graded material (FGM) strip as a free
   standing film or a substrate-bound film is studied in this work, in
   which the stiffness of the film is assumed to change exponentially along
   the length. The buckling load and the buckling mode shapes for the free
   standing FGM film are determined analytically. For the substrate-bound
   film, the substrate is modeled as a Winkler foundation and the wrinkling
   load and wrinkling pattern are determined numerically by using a finite
   difference method and a series solution. In contrast with the wrinkling
   of homogenous thin films in which the wrinkles propagate in the entire
   domain, the wrinkles of the FGM films accumulate around the location
   with the least bending rigidity. The results of this work show that the
   sensitivity of the wrinkle accumulation around the weak locations of the
   system with lower stiffness is very high. This work is expected to
   provide a better understanding for localization of wrinkles around a
   region of substrate-bounded thin films in thin film technology.}},

Abstract = {{We validated a CT Perfusion technique with beam hardening (BH)
   correction for quantitative measurement of myocardial blood flow (MBF).
   Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was created in four pigs by occluding
   the distal LAD for 1 h followed by reperfusion. MBF was measured from
   dynamic contrast enhanced CT (DCE-CT) scanning of the heart, with
   correction of cardiac motion and BH, before ischemic insult and on day
   7, 10 and 14 post. On day 14 post, radiolabeled microspheres were
   injected to measure MBF and the results were compared with those
   measured by CT Perfusion. Excised hearts were stained with
   2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to determine the relationship
   between MBF measured by CT Perfusion and myocardial viability. MBF
   measured by CT Perfusion was strongly correlated with that by
   microspheres over a wide range of MBF values (R = 0.81, from 25 to 225
   ml min(-1) 100 g(-1)). While MBF in the LAD territory decreased
   significantly from 98.4 +/- A 2.5 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1) at baseline to
   32.2 +/- A 9.1 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1), P < 0.05 at day 7 and to 49.4 +/- A
   9.3 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1), P < 0.05 at day 14, the decrease in remote
   myocardium (LCx territory) from baseline (103.9 +/- A 1.9 ml min(-1) 100
   g(-1)) was minimal throughout the study (90.6 +/- A 5.1 ml min(-1) 100
   g(-1) on day 14 post, P > 0.05). TTC staining confirmed incomplete
   infarction in the LAD territory and no infarction in the LCx territory.
   Microvascular obstruction in infarcted tissue resulted in no-reflow and
   hence persistently low MBF in the reperfused LAD territory which
   contained a mixture of viable and non-viable tissue. CT Perfusion
   measurement of MBF was accurate and correlated well with histology and
   microspheres measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of novel biomaterials for bone regeneration is based on
   the development of scaffolds that exhibit bone-bonding ability,
   biocompatibility, and sufficient mechanical strength. In this study,
   using novel poly (epsilon-caprolactone)/bioactive glass (PCL/BG) hybrids
   with different organic/inorganic ratios, the effects of BG contents on
   the in vitro bone-like hydroxyapatite (HA) formation, mechanical
   properties, and biocompatibility were investigated. Rapid precipitation
   of HA on the PCL/BG hybrid surfaces were observed after incubating in
   simulated body fluid (SBF) for only 6 h, as confirmed by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX),
   Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and inductively coupled
   plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPS). The ICPS elemental analysis
   results were further analyzed in terms of the Ca2+ and PO43- which were
   consumed to form the apatite layer. The results revealed that the rate
   and total amount of HA deposition decreased with an increase in PCL
   content. The compressive modulus and strength of the PCL/BG hybrids
   increased with the decrease in PCL content. The highest values were
   achieved at the lowest PCL content (10 wt \%) and were around, 90 MPa
   and 1.4 GPa, respectively. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of PCL/BG
   bioactive hybrids, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells were cultured for up
   to 72 h. Our data indicated that whereas initial cell attachment was
   marginally lower than the control tissue culture poly styrene (TCPS)
   surface, the hybrid materials promoted cell growth in a time-dependent
   manner. Cell viability within the different PCL/BG hybrid samples
   appeared to be influenced by compositional differences whereby higher
   PCL contents correlated with slight reduction in cell viability. Taken
   together, this study adds important new information to our knowledge on
   hydroxyapatite formation, mechanical properties, and cytotoxic effects
   of PCL/BG hybrids prepared by the sol gel process using a tertiary glass
   composition and may have considerable potential for bone tissue
   regeneration applications.}},

Abstract = {{Water tanks are an essential lifeline whose continuing availability and
   serviceability immediately after earthquake events are crucial for
   providing undisrupted emergency services. Their seismic performance is,
   therefore, of paramount importance. The seismic response of an elevated
   liquid tank situated on a soft soil deposit was studied by means of
   field vibration tests and numerical simulations. The ambient and forced
   vibration tests were conducted to identify the soil-structure
   interaction (SSI) effects on the small strain dynamic behavior of the
   structure. A series of time domain numerical analyses were performed to
   evaluate the seismic performance of these structures from a performance
   based design point of view. The results showed that consideration of SSI
   increased the displacement demand significantly. Thus, the calculated
   maximum displacement demand for supporting frame components of the tank
   may be underestimated significantly when the SSI effects are neglected.
   In addition, the seismic induced shear forces considering SSI effects
   were much smaller than the seismic shear forces for the fixed based
   case. For some soil types, the effect of this reduction on the overall
   response may become more prominent than the structural ductility
   mechanism. This resulted in the failure mechanism being initiated by a
   coupled compression - bending moment effect, rather than shear failure.
   Finally, the sloshing response is significantly increased due to the
   SSI.}},

Journal = {{FLUID DYNAMICS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A temporal stability analysis was carried out to investigate the
   stability of an axially moving viscous annular liquid jet subject to
   axisymmetric disturbances in surrounding co-flowing viscous gas media.
   We investigated in this study the effects of inertia, surface tension,
   the gas-to-liquid density ratio, the inner-to-outer radius ratio and the
   gas-to-liquid viscosity ratio on the stability of the jet. With an
   increase in inertia, the growth rate of the unstable disturbances is
   found to increase. The dominant (or most unstable) wavenumber decreases
   with increasing Reynolds number for larger values of the gas-to-liquid
   viscosity ratio. However, an opposite tendency for the most unstable
   wavenumber is predicted for small viscosity ratio in the same inertia
   range. The surrounding gas density, in the presence of viscosity, always
   reduces the growth rate, hence stabilizing the flow. There exists a
   critical value of the density ratio above which the flow becomes stable
   for very small viscosity ratio, whereas for large viscosity ratio, no
   stable flow appears in the same range of the density ratio. The
   curvature has a significant destabilizing effect on the thin annular
   jet, whereas for a relatively thick jet, the maximum growth rate
   decreases as the inner radius increases, irrespective of the surrounding
   gas viscosity. The degree of instability increases with Weber number for
   a relatively large viscosity ratio. In contrast, for small viscosity
   ratio, the growth rate exhibits a dramatic dependence on the surface
   tension. There is a small Weber number range, which depends on the
   viscosity ratio, where the flow is stable. The viscosity ratio always
   stabilizes the flow. However, the dominant wavenumber increases with
   increasing viscosity ratio. The range of unstable wavenumbers is
   affected only by the curvature effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an efficient technique for reducing the bit error
   rate (BER) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals
   transmitted over nonlinear solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs). The
   proposed technique is based on predicting the distortion power that an
   SSPA would generate due to the nonlinear characteristics of such
   devices. Similar to the selective-mapping or partial-transmit-sequence
   (PTS) schemes, the predicted distortion is used to select a set of
   phases that minimize the actual SSPA distortion. Simulation results
   confirmed that the signal-to-noise ratio that is required to obtain a
   BER of similar to 10(-4) using the proposed technique is less by about 8
   dB when it is compared to the standard PTS utilizing 16 partitions.
   Moreover, complexity analysis demonstrated that the proposed system
   offers a significant complexity reduction of about 60\% compared to
   state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Salmanpour A, Shoemaker JK. Baroreflex mechanisms regulating the
   occurrence of neural spikes in human muscle sympathetic nerve activity.
   J Neurophysiol 107: 3409-3416, 2012. First published March 21, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00925.2011.-This study tested the hypothesis that the
   discharge patterns of action potentials (APs) within bursts of
   postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) are subject to
   arterial baroreflex control but in a manner that varies inversely with
   AP size. MSNA data were collected over 5 min of supine rest in 15 young
   and healthy individuals (8 males; 24 +/- 4 yr of age; means +/- SD). The
   baroreflex threshold and sensitivity diagrams were constructed for both
   the integrated sympathetic bursts and for the AP clusters. For the
   integrated bursts, a strong linear relationship between burst
   probability and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was observed (P < 0.05).
   There was little relationship between integrated burst strength
   (amplitude) and DBP. On average, 12 AP clusters were observed across
   individuals. Larger APs tended to appear in the larger bursts. Linear
   regression analysis was used to study the baroreflex threshold
   (probability of AP cluster occurrence vs. DBP) as well as the baroreflex
   sensitivity (AP cluster size vs. DBP). A significant reflex threshold
   relationship was observed in 75-100\% of AP clusters across all
   individuals. In contrast, significant reflex sensitivity relationships
   were observed in only 9 of 15 individuals and for limited APs. Overall,
   the slope of the AP baroreflex threshold relationship was greater for
   the small-medium sized AP clusters than that of the larger APs.
   Therefore, within each burst, the small-medium sized APs are governed by
   the baroreflex mechanism. However, the large APs, which tend to appear
   in the large integrated bursts, are weakly associated with a baroreflex
   control feature. The variable impact of baroreflex control over AP
   occurrence provides a plausible explanation for the overall weak
   baroreflex control over integrated burst strength, a feature that is
   determined by both the number and size of the AP complement.}},

Abstract = {{A general stability result for bilateral teleoperator systems with
   projection-based force reflection algorithms from a broad class is
   presented. It is shown that the overall stability of a teleoperator
   system can be achieved under mild assumptions on subsystem stability,
   properties of the communication channel, dynamics of the human operator,
   and the human force measurement/estimation process. In particular, the
   stability is achieved under a new general assumption on human dynamics
   which allows for both passive and nonpassive behaviour of the human
   operator. It is demonstrated that the use of projection-based force
   reflection algorithms effectively removes the constraints on subsystem
   gains that are typical for direct application of the small-gain design,
   thus solving the trade-off between stability, manoeuvrability, and high
   force reflection gain in bilateral teleoperation over communication

Abstract = {{Wind-driven waves and currents exert shear stress on the bed of a
   tailings pond. A semi-empirical approach for estimating this bed shear
   stress is presented in this paper. For the first time in a mine tailings
   storage facility, the current-induced component of the bed shear stress
   was obtained using 1,200-kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler
   measurements of in situ currents and a log-law fit to the mean velocity
   profiles, while the wave-induced portion was calculated using empirical
   wave hindcasting equations. The total bed shear stress was obtained by
   non-linear addition of wave and current components using a wave-current
   interaction approach. The study was conducted in the middle cell of the
   Shebandowan tailings storage facility, northern Ontario, Canada. The
   measured currents facilitated the visualization of the complex near-bed
   circulatory flow pattern in the pond. The estimated combined
   wave-current bed shear stress varied from 0.0006 to 0.16 Pa with an
   average value of 0.028 Pa. The results also showed that linear addition
   of bed shear stresses due to waves and currents could underestimate the
   total bed shear stress. A comparison of the results of the present work
   to those of previous studies suggests that it is more reliable to obtain
   current-induced bed shear stress from field measurements than to
   estimate it from empirical equations.}},

Abstract = {{Porous titanium foam is now a standard material for various dental and
   orthopedic applications due to its light weight, high strength, and full
   biocompatibility properties. In practical biomedical applications, outer
   surface geometry and porosity topology significantly influence the
   adherence between implant and neighboring bone. New microfabrication
   technologies, such as micromilling and laser micromachining opened new
   technological possibilities for shape generation of this class of
   products. Besides typical geometric alterations, these manufacturing
   techniques enable a better control of the surface roughness that in turn
   affects to a large extent the friction between implant and surrounding
   bone tissue. This paper proposes an image analysis approach for optical
   investigation of the porosity that is tailored to the specifics of
   micromilling process, with emphasis on cutting force monitoring.
   According to this method, the area of porous material removed during
   micromilling operation is estimated from optical images of the
   micromachined surface, and then the percentage of solid material cut is
   calculated for each tool revolution. The employment of the
   aforementioned methodology in micromilling of the porous titanium foams
   revealed reasonable statistical correlations between porosity and
   cutting forces, especially when they were characterized by low-frequency
   variations. The developed procedure unlocks new opportunities in
   optimization of the implant surface micro-geometry, to be characterized
   by an increased roughness with minimal porosity closures in an attempt
   to maximize implant fixation through an appropriate level of bone
   ingrowth.}},

Abstract = {{This work aimed to degrade alkali lignin (AL) for the production of
   bio-phenolic compounds. Effective degradation of AL was achieved in
   50/50 (v/v) water-ethanol at 200-450 degrees C under 5 MPa H-2 with or
   without a catalyst. Hydrothermal treating AL at 300 degrees C for 2 h
   without a catalyst led to an 89\% yield of degraded lignin (DL). The
   molecular weights of the lignin were significantly reduced from its
   original M-w and M-n of 60,000 and 10,000 g/mol to M-w and M-n of 1010
   and 415 g/mol, respectively. Compared to the 50/50 (v/v) water-ethanol
   treatment, the pure ethanol treatment at 300 degrees C led to a lower
   yield of DL ( < 15\%) with smaller molecular weights (M-w = 631 g/mol
   and M-n = 260 g/mol). Moreover, the DLs from the pure ethanol treatment
   were completely soluble in THF, in comparison, only similar to 30\%
   soluble in THF for DL from the 50/50 (v/v) water-ethanol treatment.
   While reaction time had negligible effects on the DL yields and
   properties, reaction temperature dramatically influenced the product
   yield and properties: 300-325 degrees C and 400 degrees C appeared to be
   the optimal temperature for the process in 50/50 (v/v) water-ethanol and
   pure ethanol, respectively. In both solvent-systems, generally the use
   of a catalyst did not significantly affect the yields of DL, but
   slightly reduced the molecular weights of the DLs and greatly increased
   the solubility of DLs in tetrahydrofuran (THF). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present Ha fluxes, star formation rates (SFRs) and equivalent widths
   (EWs) for a sample of 156 nearby galaxies observed in the 12CO J= 32
   line as part of the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope Nearby Galaxies Legacy
   Survey. These are derived from images and values in the literature and
   from new Ha images for 72 galaxies which we publish here. We describe
   the sample, observations and procedures to extract the Ha fluxes and
   related quantities. We discuss the SFR properties of our sample and
   confirm the well-known correlation with galaxy luminosity, albeit with
   high dispersion. Our SFRs range from 0.1 to 11 M? yr-1 with a median SFR
   value for the complete sample of 0.2 M? yr-1. This median value is
   somewhat lower than similar published measurements, which we attribute,
   in part, to our sample being H i selected and, thus, not biased towards
   high SFRs as has frequently been the case in previous studies.
   Additionally, we calculate internal absorptions for the Ha line, A(Ha),
   which are lower than many of those used in previous studies. Our derived
   EWs, which range from 1 to 880 angstrom with a median value of 27
   angstrom, show little dependence on luminosity but rise by a factor of 5
   from early- to late-type galaxies. This paper is the first in a series
   aimed at comparing SFRs obtained from Ha imaging of galaxies with
   information derived from other tracers of star formation and atomic and
   molecular gas.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of a polymeric chain extender on the properties of
   bioplastic film made from blends of plasticized polylactic acid (p-PLA)
   and thermoplastic starch (TPS) were studied. Joncryl((TM)) ADR 4370S, a
   polymeric chain extender, was blended with TPS and p-PLA at a level of
   1\% (w/w). A co-rotating twin-screw extrusion process was used to
   prepare films with various ratios of TPS and p-PLA. Mechanical and
   physical properties of films, including film tensile properties, surface
   energy, moisture content, hydrophilicity, moisture sorption behaviour
   and thermal mechanical properties were determined. During extrusion,
   films enhanced by 1\% Joncryl addition demonstrated more desirable and
   consistent qualities, such as smoother film edge and surface. Addition
   of Joncryl significantly improved film tensile strength, 0.2\% offset
   yield strength, and elongation, especially evident with the 250\%
   elongation of 70/30 (TPS/p-PLA) film. Total surface energy of films was
   not significantly influenced by addition of Joncryl. However, the polar
   contribution to the total surface energy of 70/30 (TPS/p-PLA) film
   increased after the addition of Joncryl. The study showed that blending
   TPS with p-PLA transformed TPS film from being highly hydrophilic to
   highly hydrophobic. On the other hand, addition of Joncryl had limited
   effects on moisture content, water solubility, glass transition
   temperature and moisture sorption behaviour of TPS/p-PLA blend films.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the response of Symbiodinium sp. endosymbionts from
   the coral Stylophora pistillata to moderate levels of thermal
   ``bleaching{''} stress, with and without trace metal limitation. Using
   quantitative high throughput proteomics, we identified 8098 MS/MS events
   relating to individual peptides from the endosymbiont-enriched fraction,
   including 109 peptides meeting stringent criteria for quantification, of
   which only 26 showed significant change in our experimental treatments;
   12 of 26 increased expression in response to thermal stress with little
   difference affected by iron limitation. Surprisingly, there were no
   significant increases in antioxidant or heat stress proteins; those
   induced to higher expression were generally involved in protein
   biosynthesis. An outstanding exception was a massive 114-fold increase
   of a viral replication protein indicating that thermal stress may
   substantially increase viral load and thereby contribute to the etiology
   of coral bleaching and disease. In the absence of a sequenced genome for
   Symbiodinium or other photosymbiotic dinoflagellate, this proteome
   reveals a plethora of proteins potentially involved in microbial-host
   interactions. This includes photosystem proteins, DNA repair enzymes,
   antioxidant enzymes, metabolic redox enzymes, heat shock proteins,
   globin hemoproteins, proteins of nitrogen metabolism, and a wide range
   of viral proteins associated with these endosymbiont-enriched samples.
   Also present were 21 unusual peptide/protein toxins thought to originate
   from either microbial consorts or from contamination by coral
   nematocysts. Of particular interest are the proteins of apoptosis,
   vesicular transport, and endo/exocytosis, which are discussed in context
   of the cellular processes of coral bleaching. Notably, the protein
   complement provides evidence that, rather than being expelled by the
   host, stressed endosymbionts may mediate their own departure. Molecular

Abstract = {{To address the challenges of surgical instruction during minimally
   invasive surgery (MIS), a wireless hands-free pointer system has been
   developed. The Wireless Hands-free Surgical Pointer system incorporates
   infrared and inertial tracking technologies to address the need for
   hands-free pointing during MIS. The combination of these technologies
   allows for optimal movement of the pointer and excellent accuracy while
   the user is located at a realistic distance from the surgical monitor.
   Several experimental evaluations were performed to optimize the settings
   of the sensors, and to validate the system when compared to a
   commercially available hands-free pointing system. The results show
   improved performance with the proposed technology as measured by the
   total trajectory travelled by the pointer and the smoothness of the
   curve. The technology presented has the potential to significantly
   improve surgical instruction and guidance during MIS.}},

Title = {{A combinatorial optimization approach for evaluating minimum-zone

Pages = {{1170-1179}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new and robust approach for the accurate
   evaluation of minimum-zone spatial straightness error from a set of
   coordinate measurement data points. The algorithm iteratively searches
   for the specific data points that define the minimum bound of the
   spatial straightness zone using combinatorial optimization. It is based
   on the fact that the minimum circumscribed cylinder of a point set,
   which is equivalent to the minimum spatial straightness zone of the
   measurement data, will pass through three, four, or five of the data
   points that constitute the convex hull vertices of the entire data set.
   Computed results have shown that although the presented approach may
   lead to increased computational time, it is robust and able to construct
   the exact minimum circumscribed cylinder for a given point set. The
   minimum-zone spatial straightness error can thus be evaluated with the
   best possible accuracy. The advantage of the presented algorithm is
   demonstrated via comparison with published computed results of existing
   algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{The degradation mechanisms of glass in a buried context result in
   surfaces that have been depleted in various elements. The stability of
   the glass is primarily affected by the burial environment and the glass
   composition. However, in all archaeological glasses, the corroded layer
   that is formed on the surface tends to be low in alkalis, high in silica
   and lacking in cohesion. The extent to which the material has degraded,
   along with the physical nature of the corrosion, has a profound effect
   upon a wide range of factors affecting the stability of artefacts, as
   well as the choice of conservation techniques to be employed. This study
   has a number of objectives: determination of the morphology of the
   surface of the leached layer in glasses of two different compositions
   with different surface finishes; examination of the transition between
   the corroded material and the unaffected substrate; and investigation of
   concentration profile of different elements within the surface layers,
   as a function of depth. The study uses two glasses, fabricated under
   laboratory conditions, to replicate two common glass types found in the
   historical environment; a sodalimesilica glass typical of those found in
   the Roman period throughout the Mediterranean and northwestern Europe,
   and high-limepotash glasses typical of those of Western Europe in the
   late medieval period. Three different surfaces have been prepared to
   mimic alternative manufacturing techniques such as blown, cast and
   ground surfaces for each composition. The glasses have been corroded
   under controlled laboratory conditions to replicate the buried
   environment. Imaging and chemical information is obtained using SEMEDX
   and morphological information using IFM to produce 3-D mapping from
   topographical surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the mechanical response of the distal radius pre-fracture
   and at fracture under dynamic impact loads. The distal third of eight
   human cadaveric radii were potted and placed in a custom designed
   pneumatic impact system. The distal intra-articular surface of the
   radius rested against a model scaphoid and lunate, simulating 45 degrees
   of wrist extension. The scaphoid and lunate were attached to a load cell
   that in turn was attached to an impact plate. Impulsive impacts were
   applied at increasing energy levels, in 10?J increments, until fracture
   occurred. Three 45 degrees stacked strain gauge rosettes were affixed
   along the length of the radius quantifying the bone strains. The mean
   (SD) fracture energy was 45.5 (16)?J. The mean (SD) resultant impact
   reaction force (IRFr) at failure was 2,142 (1,229)?N, resulting in high
   compressive strains at the distal (2,718 (1,698)?mu e) and proximal
   radius (3,664 (1,890)?mu e). We successfully reproduced consistent
   fracture patterns in response to dynamic loads. The fracture energy and
   forces reported here are lower and the strains are higher than those
   previously reported and can likely be attributed to the controlled,
   incremental, dynamic nature of the applied loads. (c) 2011 Orthopaedic

   conversion products}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{96}},

Pages = {{511-523}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study addresses the influence of USY zeolite crystallite size on
   catalyst activity and selectivity during the catalytic conversion of
   methylcyclohexane (MCH). The crystallite size of the supported zeolites
   is varied between 0.4 and 0.9 mu m with both activity and selectivity
   being monitored. Experiments are developed in a fluidized bench-scale
   batch CREC riser simulator reactor. MCH overall conversion ranges
   between 4 and 16 wt.\%, with higher conversions obtained using the
   larger zeolite crystallites due to their slightly higher acidity. It is
   found that even if the difference in zeolite crystallite size does not
   have a significant effect on MCH conversion; it still is an important
   factor affecting product distribution. Bi-molecular reactions between
   adsorbed species in neighboring sites, particularly hydrogen transfer,
   are promoted using the 0.9 mu m zeolite crystallites. This is assigned
   to the increased opportunity for adsorbed chemical species to interact
   with each other within the bigger surface areas per crystallite and
   longer pores provided by the larger crystallites. To provide
   quantifications of the differences in activity and selectivity between
   the two catalysts, a heterogeneous kinetic model for MCH conversion
   accounting for adsorption and intrinsic catalytic reaction phenomena is
   considered. It is proven that there are significant variations between
   catalysts with respect to intrinsic kinetic constants associated with
   hydrogen transfer, ring-opening/cracking and transalkylation reactions,
   showing the importance of zeolite properties, particularly crystallite
   size, during the catalytic conversion of naphthenes. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   load conditions that other single-stage converters have because of its
   three-level structure. It can operate over a wider load range with
   significantly less output inductor current ripple; moreover, its input
   current has little distortion. In the paper, the operation of the new
   converter is explained in detail and analyzed, its steady-state
   characteristics are determined, and its design is discussed.

   coordinate system is defined in such a way that one of its axes is
   aligned with the grooves. It is shown that the governing equations
   expressed in this system decouple into a two-dimensional flow across the
   grooves and a flow in the direction along the grooves, resulting in
   improved solution efficiencies. Fourier series are used for
   discretization in the direction transverse to the grooves and Chebyshev
   expansions for the direction across the channel. Special solvers that
   take advantage of the matrix structure have been implemented providing a
   significant acceleration of computation and reduction of memory
   requirements. Various tests have been conducted in order to illustrate
   the performance of the algorithm, to show its spectral accuracy and to
   characterize the effects of various numerical and physical parameters.

Abstract = {{It is known that surface-plasmon resonances of metallic nanoparticles
   can significantly enhance the field experienced by semiconductor quantum
   dots. In this paper we show that, when quantum dots are in the vicinity
   of metallic nanoparticles and interact with coherent light sources
   (laser fields), coherent exciton-plasmon coupling (quantum coherence
   effects) can increase the amount of the plasmonic field enhancement
   significantly. We also study how the coherent molecular resonances
   generated by such a coupling process are influenced by the
   self-renormalization of the plasmonic fields and the structural
   parameters of the systems, particularly the size and shape of the
   metallic nanoparticle. The renormalization process happens via mutual
   impacts of the radiative decay rate of excitons and the coherent
   exciton-plasmon coupling on each other. Our results highlight the
   conditions where the molecular resonances become very sharp, offering
   optical switching processes with high extinction ratio and wide ranging
   device applications.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Soft-Tissue Restraints After Type II Odontoid Fractures in

Abstract = {{Study Design. A biomechanical analysis of soft-tissue restraints to
   passive motion in odontoid fractures.
   Objective. To quantify the role of the C1-C2 facet joint capsules and
   anterior longitudinal ligaments (ALLs) in the setting of a type II
   odontoid fracture in the elderly.
   Summary of Background Data. The odontoid process itself is the primary
   stabilizer at the C1-C2 level; however, little is known about the role
   of the soft-tissue structures that remain intact in the setting of an
   odontoid fracture after a low-energy mechanism.
   Methods. Ten cadaveric C0-C2 spinal segments were studied. Specimens
   were tested under simulated axial rotation with an applied moment of +/-
   1 Nm and with an application of a 10 N anteriorly directed force to the
   body of C2 to induce sagittal translation. Optical motion data were
   initially collected for the intact state and after a simulated dens
   fracture. The specimens were then divided into 2 groups, where 1 group
   underwent unilateral and then bilateral C1-C2 facet capsular injuries
   followed by an ALL injury. The second group underwent the ALL injury
   before the same capsular injuries. Changes in axial range of motion and
   C1-C2 translation were analyzed using 2-way repeated measures analyses
   of variance and post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls tests (alpha = 0.05).
   Results. In axial rotation, there was an increase in range of motion by
   approximately 13\%, with the fracture of the dens compared with the
   intact state (P < 0.05). An increase was also present for each
   subsequent soft-tissue injury state compared with the previous (P <
   0.05); however, there was no difference found between the 2 sectioning
   protocols. For sagittal translation testing, it was found that the
   odontoid fracture alone showed an increase of 3 mm of C1-C2 translation
   compared with intact (P < 0.05). Further soft-tissue injuries did not
   show an increase until the complete injury state.
   Conclusion. This study identifies that type II odontoid fractures
   without associated soft-tissue injury may be stable under certain
   loading modes.}},

Title = {{Assessment of gravity wave momentum flux measurement capabilities by
   meteor radars having different transmitter power and antenna
   configurations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{Measurement capabilities of five meteor radars are assessed and compared
   to determine how well radars having different transmitted power and
   antenna configurations perform in defining mean winds, tidal amplitudes,
   and gravity wave (GW) momentum fluxes. The five radars include two
   new-generation meteor radars on Tierra del Fuego, Argentina (53.8
   degrees S) and on King George Island in the Antarctic (62.1 degrees S)
   and conventional meteor radars at Socorro, New Mexico (34.1 degrees N,
   106.9 degrees W), Bear Lake Observatory, Utah (similar to 41.9 degrees
   N, 111.4 degrees W), and Yellowknife, Canada (62.5 degrees N, 114.3
   degrees W). Our assessment employs observed meteor distributions for
   June of 2009, 2010, or 2011 for each radar and a set of seven test
   motion fields including various superpositions of mean winds, constant
   diurnal tides, constant and variable semidiurnal tides, and superposed
   GWs having various amplitudes, scales, periods, directions of
   propagation, momentum fluxes, and intermittencies. Radars having higher
   power and/or antenna patterns yielding higher meteor counts at small
   zenith angles perform well in defining monthly and daily mean winds,
   tidal amplitudes, and GW momentum fluxes, though with expected larger
   uncertainties in the daily estimates. Conventional radars having lower
   power and a single transmitting antenna are able to describe monthly
   mean winds and tidal amplitudes reasonably well, especially at altitudes
   having the highest meteor counts. They also provide reasonable estimates
   of GW momentum fluxes at the altitudes having the highest meteor counts;
   however, these estimates are subject to uncertainties of similar to 20
   to 50\% and uncertainties rapidly become excessive at higher and lower
   altitudes. Estimates of all quantities degrade somewhat for more complex
   motion fields.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Urogenital infections are the most common ailments afflicting women.
   They are treated with dated antimicrobials whose efficacy is
   diminishing. The process of infection involves pathogen adhesion and
   displacement of indigenous Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus
   jensenii. An alternative therapeutic approach to antimicrobial therapy
   is to reestablish lactobacilli in this microbiome through probiotic
   administration. We hypothesized that lactobacilli displaying strong
   adhesion forces with pathogens would facilitate coaggregation between
   the two strains, ultimately explaining the elimination of pathogens seen
   in vivo. Using atomic force microscopy, we found that adhesion forces
   between lactobacilli and three virulent toxic shock syndrome toxin
   1-producing Staphylococcus aureus strains, were significantly stronger
   (2.2-6.4 nN) than between staphylococcal pairs (2.2-3.4 nN), especially
   for the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (4.0-6.4 nN) after 120 s
   of bond-strengthening. Moreover, stronger adhesion forces resulted in
   significantly larger coaggregates. Adhesion between the bacteria
   occurred instantly upon contact and matured within one to two minutes,
   demonstrating the potential for rapid anti-pathogen effects using a
   probiotic. Coaggregation is one of the recognized mechanisms through
   which lactobacilli can exert their probiotic effects to create a hostile
   micro-environment around a pathogen. With antimicrobial options fading,
   it therewith becomes increasingly important to identify lactobacilli
   that bind strongly with pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{The photocatalytic oxidations of anionic, dodecylbenzene sulfonate
   (DBS), and cationic, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) surfactants were
   studied in a swirl-flow monolithic reactor. The degradation kinetics in
   aqueous TiO2 suspensions was investigated as a function of catalyst
   loading, light intensity, initial surfactant concentration, dissolved
   oxygen concentration, and pH. A systematic analysis of rates at various
   loadings of TiO2 was carried out to distinguish ``kinetic{''} and
   ``transport{''} limited regimes for the photocatalytic degradation of
   DBS and CPC in TiO2 suspensions. The optimal catalyst loading of DBS and
   CPC in TiO2 suspensions were determined to be 0.75 and 1.5 g L-1,
   respectively, at a neutral pH. A small increase in oxidation rates was
   observed with an increase in initial concentration of the surfactant and
   partial pressure of the oxygen in the system. The rates as a function of
   initial surfactant concentration and partial pressures of oxygen were
   determined using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. The photocatalytic
   oxidation of DBS and CPC showed an opposite pH dependence. Removal of
   DBS was efficient in acidic condition while CPC showed efficacy at basic
   pH. The adsorption of surfactants onto TiO2 surfaces as a function of pH
   was studied to explain the influence of pH on the oxidation rates. The
   subsequent decreases in TOC levels of surfactant during oxidation were
   found to be more efficient at a neutral pH than acidic or basic pH. (C)

   motion and turbulence promoters can result in substantial flux
   augmentation due to the efficient removal of the deposited cake by the

   peak ionospheric electron density of the ionosphere. Bottom height of
   the ionospheric layers produced by precipitating particles varied
   between 130 km (upper E region) and 300 km (F region), indicating
   variable particle precipitation energy. Frequency analysis of
   high-resolution TEC data showed a broad range of discrete frequency
   components from 1.60 mHz to 22.80 mHz present in the TEC oscillations,
   which may provide insight into the energization/modulation of
   precipitating particles by these oscillations. A broad distribution of
   equivalent vertical thickness of arcs was calculated using GPS TEC and
   ionosonde measurements of peak electron density. This distribution
   showed a minimum thickness of 21 km, a maximum of 84 km, and an average
   of 49 km. The equivalent vertical thickness also showed a linear
   relationship with bottomside height of the ionospheric layer (auroral
   arc). The relationship showed an increase in the vertical thickness with
   an increase in bottomside height of the layer. This relationship is a
   consequence of variations in the energy of the precipitating particles
   causing different ionospheric production profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Steady RANS CFD simulations were used to evaluate convective heat
   transfer from the roof of a low-rise building immersed in an atmospheric
   boundary layer for different terrain, with relevance to
   photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) systems. Dimensionless correlations for the
   exterior convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC), expressed as
   Nusselt number (Nu), were developed for the windward roof, based on
   Reynolds number and incident turbulence intensity at eaves height,
   thereby quantifying the strong influence of incident turbulence on the
   CHTC. Simulations were also performed for a generic flat plate of the
   same streamwise length so as to provide further insight into the effects
   of incident turbulence on the windward roof boundary layer. The CHIC
   values for the windward roof and, hence, the correlations presented
   here, for a given terrain, are largely insensitive (less than 5\%
   change) to variations in roof slope (from 20 to 45 degrees) or small
   changes in wind direction (up to 20 degrees from the normal to the
   eaves). Mixed convection simulations for conditions with significant
   buoyancy forces (Richardson numbers from 0.9 to 7) show that the CHIC
   values can be up to 14\% higher than those based on forced convection
   only. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data available in the literature for bed voidage and bed

   based on Archimedes number and physical properties of biofilm-coated
   particles were proposed to calculate the bed expansion index of
   fluidized biofilm-coated particles as well as bed voidage in fluidized

Title = {{Chemical abundances of magnetic and non-magnetic Herbig Ae/Be stars}},

Abstract = {{The photospheres of about 1020 per cent of main-sequence A- and B-type
   stars exhibit a wide range of chemical peculiarities, often associated
   with the presence of a magnetic field. It is not exactly known at which
   stage of stellar evolution these chemical peculiarities develop. To
   investigate this issue, in this paper we study the photospheric
   compositions of a sample of Herbig Ae and Be stars, which are considered
   to be the pre-main-sequence progenitors of A and B stars. We have
   performed a detailed abundance analysis of 20 Herbig stars (three of
   which have confirmed magnetic fields), and one dusty young star. We have
   found that half the stars in our sample show lambda Bootis (lambda Boo)
   chemical peculiarities to varying degrees, only one star shows weak
   Ap/Bp peculiarities and all the remaining stars are chemically normal.
   The incidence of lambda Boo chemical peculiarities we find in Herbig
   stars is much higher than what is seen on the main sequence. We argue
   that a selective accretion model for lambda Boo star formation is a
   natural explanation for the remarkably large number of lambda Boo stars
   in our sample. We also find that the magnetic Herbig stars do not
   exhibit a range of chemical compositions remarkably different from the
   normal stars: one magnetic star displays lambda Boo chemical
   peculiarities (HD 101412), one displays weak Ap/Bp peculiarities (V380
   Ori A) and one (HD 190073) is chemically normal. This is completely
   different from what is seen on the main sequence, where all magnetic A
   and cool B stars show Ap/Bp chemical peculiarities, and this is
   consistent with the idea that the magnetic field precedes the formation
   of the chemical peculiarities typical of Ap and Bp stars.}},

Abstract = {{Helical piles are used increasingly to support new and existing
   foundations. This paper presents a field study on the axial monotonic
   and cyclic behaviour of steel fibre-reinforced helical pulldown
   micropiles. Test piles consisted of a round corner square helical pile
   with three helices attached to it, and a steel fibre-reinforced grout
   shaft. To assess the grout shaft contribution, one helical pile without
   a grout shaft was tested. Piles were instrumented with strain gauges to
   evaluate the load-transfer mechanism. This paper discusses the
   load-displacement response of this pile system, and load-sharing
   mechanism between the grout shaft and lead section. The study shows that
   the grout shaft significantly improves the helical pile axial
   performance. It was found that the load-transfer mechanism within the
   lead section is through individual bearing of each helix. Also, the
   findings demonstrate that the behaviour of this pile system is
   satisfactory under one-way cyclic loading conditions. The results
   suggest that the reinforced helical pulldown micropile is a viable deep
   foundation option for axial monotonic and one-way cyclic loading
   applications.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study investigates the fundamental signal and noise
   performance limitations imposed by the stochastic nature of x-ray
   interactions in selected photoconductor materials, such as Si, a-Se,
   CdZnTe, HgI2, PbI2, PbO, and TlBr, for x-ray spectra typically used in
   mammography.
   Methods: It is shown how Monte Carlo simulations can be combined with a
   cascaded model to determine the absorbed energy distribution for each
   combination of photoconductor and x-ray spectrum. The model is used to
   determine the quantum efficiency, mean energy absorption per
   interaction, Swank noise factor, secondary quantum noise, and
   zero-frequency detective quantum efficiency (DQE).
   Results: The quantum efficiency of materials with higher atomic number
   and density demonstrates a larger dependence on convertor thickness than
   those with lower atomic number and density with the exception of a-Se.
   The mean deposited energy increases with increasing average energy of
   the incident x-ray spectrum. HgI2, PbI2, and CdZnTe demonstrate the
   largest increase in deposited energy with increasing mass loading and
   a-Se and Si the smallest. The best DQE performances are achieved with
   PbO and TlBr. For mass loading greater than 100 mg cm(-2), a-Se, HgI2,
   and PbI2 provide similar DQE values to PbO and TlBr.
   Conclusions: The quantum absorption efficiency, average deposited energy
   per interacting x-ray, Swank noise factor, and detective quantum
   efficiency are tabulated by means of graphs which may help with the
   design and selection of materials for photoconductor-based mammography
   detectors. Neglecting the electrical characteristics of photoconductor
   materials and taking into account only x-ray interactions, it is
   concluded that PbO shows the strongest signal-to-noise ratio performance
   of the materials investigated in this study. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Electrokinetics (EK) has been used extensively to remove heavy metals
   from low permeability porous media. Electrokinetics (EK) or more
   specifically electrophoresis (EP) has also been proposed to enhance
   transport of nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) in fine grained porous
   media in the subsurface. However, increased dissolved oxygen and lower
   pH, due to electrolysis of water at the anode oxidizes NZVI particles
   and thus affects the remediation potential of EP with NZVI. This study
   focuses on minimization of NZVI oxidation and quantification of NZVI
   migration enhancement through the application of EP. Application of 50
   and 100 mA currents under constant current conditions with an oxygen
   scavenger enhanced NZVI transport from the cathode to the anode. The
   enhancement in transport compared to diffusion was proportional to the
   applied current. Predictions of a numerical model, based on traditional
   colloidal filtration theory (CFT), were consistent with experimental
   results. In developing the model, the traditional CFT based mass balance
   equation was modified for the case of no advection. This study suggests
   that EP has the potential to deliver NZVI in low permeability porous
   media and that the numerical simulator can be used to predict NZVI
   mobility with EP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Based on the solubility and thermochemical data, the amorphous form and

   form are enantiotropically related. In addition, both transformations
   from anhydrous form to I form and from I form to II form are greatly
   temperature-dependent, which gives us a window to prepare each pure

Abstract = {{The oxidation of sulphidic mine tailings and consequent acid generation
   poses challenges for the environment. Accurate and precise analysis of
   sulphur content is necessary for impact assessment and management of
   mine tailings. Here, the authors aim at developing a rapid and easy
   digestion procedure, which may analyse and measure the total amount of
   sulphur in mine tailings by using inductively coupled plasma. For
   evaluating effects of several variables, the researchers used a
   univariate (analysis of variance (ANOVA)) strategy and considered
   factors such as composition of the acid mixture, heating time, and
   refluxing device to optimize the performance. To do the experiment, the
   researchers have used two certified reference materials (KZK-1 and
   RTS-2) and samples of tailings from Musselwhite mine. ANOVA result shows
   that heating time is the most influencing factor on acid digestion of
   the reference materials whereas in case of a digestion of tailings
   sample, hydrochloric acid proved to be the most significant parameter.
   Satisfactory results between the measured and referenced values are
   found for all experiments. It is found that the aqua regia (1 ml HNO3 +
   3 ml HCl) digestion of 0.1 g of samples after only 40 min of heating at
   95A degrees C produced fast, safe, and accurate analytical results with
   a recovery of 97\% for the selected reference materials.}},

Abstract = {{Recent spectropolarimetric studies of seven slowly pulsating B (SPB) and
   beta Cep stars have suggested that photospheric magnetic fields are more
   common in B-type pulsators than in the general population of B stars,
   suggesting a significant connection between magnetic and pulsational
   phenomena. We present an analysis of new and previously published
   spectropolarimetric observations of these stars. New Stokes V
   observations obtained with the high-resolution ESPaDOnS and Narval
   instruments confirm the presence of a magnetic field in one of the stars
   (C Lup), but find no evidence of magnetism in five others. A re-analysis
   of the published longitudinal field measurements obtained with the
   low-resolution FORS1/2 spectropolarimeters finds that the measurements
   of all stars show more scatter from zero than can be attributed to
   Gaussian noise, suggesting the presence of a signal and/or systematic
   underestimation of error bars. Re-reduction and re-measurement of the
   FORS1/2 spectra from the ESO archive demonstrates that small changes in
   reduction procedure lead to substantial changes in the inferred
   longitudinal field, and substantially reduces the number of field
   detections at the 3 sigma level. Furthermore, we find that the published
   periods are not unique solutions to the time series of either the
   original or the revised FORS1/2 data. We conclude that the reported
   field detections, proposed periods, and field geometry models for alpha
   Pyx, 15 CMa, 33 Eri, and V1449 Aql are artifacts of the data analysis
   and reduction procedures, and that magnetic fields at the reported
   strength are no more common in SPB/beta Cep stars than in the general
   population of B stars.}},

Abstract = {{During the resolution of 2-chloromandelic acid with

   salt were grown, and their structure were determined and presented. The
   chiral discrimination mechanism was investigated by examining the weak
   intermolecular interactions (such as hydrogen bond, CH/p, and van der
   Waals interactions) and molecular packing mode in crystal structure of
   the less soluble diastereomeric salt. A one-dimensional double-chain
   hydrogen-bonding network and a lock-and-key supramolecular packing mode
   are disclosed. The investigation demonstrates that hydrophobic layers
   with corrugated surfaces can fit into the grooves of one another to
   realize a compact packing, when the molecular structure of resolving
   agent is much larger than that of the racemate. This lock-and-key
   assembly is recognized to be another characteristic of molecular packing
   contributing to the chiral discrimination, in addition to the well-known
   sandwich-like packing by hydrophobic layers with planar boundary
   surfaces. Chirality 24:349355, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{LiFePO4 has been a promising cathode material for rechargeable lithium
   ion batteries. Different secondary or impurity phases, forming during
   either synthesis or subsequent redox process under normal operating
   conditions, can have a significant impact on the performance of the
   electrode. The exploration of the electronic and chemical structures of
   impurity phases is crucial to understand such influence. We have
   embarked on a series of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge
   structure (XANES) spectroscopy studies for the element speciation in
   various impurity phase materials relevant to LiFePO4 for Li ion
   batteries. In the present report, soft-X-ray XANES spectra of Li K-edge,
   P L-2,L-3-edge, O K-edge and Fe L-2,L-3-edge have been obtained for
   LiFePO4 in crystalline, disordered and amorphous forms and some possible
   ``impurities'', including LiPO3, Li4P2O7, Li3PO4, Fe-3(PO4)(2), FePO4,
   and Fe2O3. The results indicate that each element from different pure
   reference compounds exhibits unique spectral features in terms of energy
   position, shape and intensity of the resonances in its XANES. In
   addition, inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) reveals the surface
   vs. bulk property of the specimens. Therefore, the spectral data
   provided here can be used as standards in the future for phase
   composition analysis.}},

   and characterizing red blood cell velocity profiles and blood flow in
   rat skeletal muscle arterioles. Microcirculation 19: 327335, 2012.
   Abstract Objectives: To develop a valid experimental method for
   quantifying blood flow in continuously branching skeletal muscle
   arterioles, and to derive an empirical relationship between velocity
   ratio (VMax/VMean) and arteriolar diameter. Methods: We evaluated
   arteriolar trees using IVVM of rat gluteus maximus muscle and developed
   a method to acquire single fluorescent-labeled RBC velocities across
   arteriolar lumens to create velocity profiles. These data were used to
   calculate the blood flow for 37 vessel segments (diameters: 21115 mu m).
   Results: Mass balance at arteriolar bifurcations had 0.6 +/- 3.2\%
   error. Velocity ratios ranged from 1.35 to 1.98 and were positively
   correlated with diameter (p < 0.0001), and VRBC profiles were blunted
   with decreasing diameter. Conclusions: We present a means for
   quantifying blood flow in continuously branching skeletal muscle
   arterioles. Further, we provide an equation for calculating velocity
   ratios based on arteriolar diameter, which may be used by others for
   blood flow calculations.}},

Abstract = {{The exact mechanism by which pulmonary surfactant films reach the very
   low surface tensions required to stabilize the alveoli at end expiration
   remains uncertain. We utilized the nanoscale sensitivity of atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) to examine phospholipid (PL) phase transition and
   multilayer formation for two Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) systems: a simple 3
   PL surfactant-like mixture and the more complex bovine lipid extract
   surfactant (BLES). AFM height images demonstrated that both systems
   develop two types of liquid condensed (LC) domains (micro- and
   nano-sized) within a liquid expanded phase (LE). The 3 PL mixture failed
   to form significant multilayers at high surface pressure err while BLES
   forms an extensive network of multilayer structures containing up to
   three bilayers. A close examination of the progression of multilayer
   formation reveals that multilayers start to form at the edge of the
   solid-like LC domains and also in the fluid-like LE phase. We used the
   elemental analysis capability of time-of-flight secondary ion mass
   spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) to show that multilayer structures are enriched
   in unsaturated PLs while the saturated PLs are concentrated in the
   remaining interfacial monolayer. This supports a modified squeeze-out
   model where film compression results in the hydrophobic surfactant
   protein-dependent formation of unsaturated PL-rich multilayers which
   remain functionally associated with a monolayer enriched in disaturated
   PL species. This allows the surface film to attain low surface tensions
   during compression and maintain values near equilibrium during
   expansion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the calibration protocol. A case study of a circulating fluidized bed
   bioreactor (CFBBR) system used for biological nutrient removal (BNR)
   with a fluidized bed respirometric study of the biofilm stoichiometry

Abstract = {{A comparative evaluation of single-stage and two-stage anaerobic
   digestion processes for biomethane and biohydrogen production using thin
   stillage was performed to assess the impact of separating the acidogenic
   and methanogenic stages on anaerobic digestion. Thin stillage, the main
   by-product from ethanol production, was characterized by high total
   chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) of 122 g/L and total volatile fatty acids
   (TVFAs) of 12 g/L. A maximum methane yield of 0.33 L CH4/gCOD(added)
   (STP) was achieved in the two-stage process while a single-stage process
   achieved a maximum yield of only 0.26 L CH4/gCOD(added) (STP). The
   separation of acidification stage increased the TVFAs to TCOD ratio from
   10\% in the raw thin stillage to 54\% due to the conversion of
   carbohydrates into hydrogen and VFAs. Comparison of the two processes
   based on energy outcome revealed that an increase of 18.5\% in the total
   energy yield was achieved using two-stage anaerobic digestion. (C) 2012

Title = {{Estimate of turbulent dissipation in a decaying grid turbulent flow}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The dissipation rate of kinetic energy is a key quantity in turbulent
   flows. The number of measured components and the resolution of the
   measurement techniques limit dissipation rat estimates; thus, they are
   derived by surrogates of dissipation. We examine the validity and
   accuracy of these estimates by investigating decaying grid turbulence
   using particle image velocimetry and laser Doppler velocimetry.
   Dissipation rates are computed and compared via three different methods
   (i) using the decay rate of turbulent kinetic energy, (ii) direct
   calculation using measured velocity gradients, anti (iii) using second
   and third order structure functions. Discrepancies have been found
   between the surrogate methods; specifically, the structure function
   method requires correction terms. The known factors leading to bias are
   viscous correction which is significant at low Reynolds numbers and
   inhomogeneity of the decaying flow. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   inaccuracy in calculations of the third order structure function which
   are related to inter-scale dependencies. Test procedures are suggested
   for decaying and inhomogeneous flows to determine susceptibility to
   these sources of error. (C) 2012 Elsevier lac. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a robust T2-weighted volumetric imaging technique
   with uniform water-silicone separation and simultaneous fat suppression
   for rapid assessment of breast implants in a single acquisition.
   Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional (3D) fast spin echo sequence
   that uses variable refocusing flip angles was combined with a
   three-point chemical-shift technique (IDEAL) and short tau inversion
   recovery (STIR). Phase shifts of -pi/6, +pi/2, and +7 pi/6 between water
   and silicone were used for IDEAL processing. For comparison,
   two-dimensional images using 2D-FSE-IDEAL with STIR were also acquired
   in axial, coronal, and sagittal orientations.
   Results: Near-isotropic (true spatial resolution-0.9 x 1.3 x 2.0 mm(3))
   volumetric breast images with uniform water-silicone separation and
   simultaneous fat suppression were acquired successfully in clinically
   feasible scan times (7:00-10:00 min). The 2D images were acquired with
   the same in-plane resolution (0.9 x 1.3 mm(2)), but the slice thickness
   was increased to 6 mm with a slice gap of 1 mm for complete coverage of
   the implants in a reasonable scan time, which varied between 18:00 and
   22:30 min.
   Conclusion: The single volumetric acquisition with uniform water and
   silicone separation enables images to be reformatted into any
   orientation. This allows comprehensive assessment of breast implant
   integrity in less than 10 min of total examination time.}},

Abstract = {{The first 16-channel transceive surface-coil array that conforms to the
   human head and operates at 298 MHz (7 T) is described. Individual coil
   elements were decoupled using circumferential shields around each
   element that extended orthogonally from the former. This decoupling
   method allowed elements to be constructed with arbitrary shape, size,
   and location to create a three-dimensional array. Radiofrequency
   shimming achieved a transmit-field uniformity of 20\% over the whole
   brain and 14\% over a single axial slice. During radiofrequency
   transmission, coil elements couple tightly to the head and reduce the
   amount of power necessary to achieve a mean 90 degrees flip angle
   (660-mu s and 480-mu s pulse lengths were required for a 1-kW hard pulse
   when shimming over the whole brain and a single axial slice,
   respectively). During reception, the close proximity of coil elements to
   the head increases the signal-to-noise ratio in the periphery of the
   brain, most notably at the superior aspect of the head. The sensitivity
   profile of each element is localized beneath the respective shield. When
   combined with the achieved isolation between elements, this results in
   the capacity for low geometry factors during both transmit and receive:
   1.04/1.06 (mean) and 1.25/1.54 (maximum) for 3-by-3 acceleration in the
   axial/sagittal plane. High cortical signal-to-noise ratio and parallel
   imaging performance make the conformal coil ideal for the study of high
   temporal and/or spatial cortical architecture and function. Magn Reson

Abstract = {{Microalgal biotechnology could generate substantial amounts of biofuels
   with minimal environmental impact if the economics can be improved by
   increasing the rate of biomass production. Chlorella kessleri was grown
   in a small-scale raceway pond and in flask cultures with the entire
   volume, 1\% (v/v) at any instant, periodically exposed to static
   magnetic fields to demonstrate increased biomass production and
   investigate physiological changes, respectively. The growth rate in
   flasks was maximal at a field strength of 10?mT, increasing from 0.39
   +/- 0.06 per day for the control to 0.88 +/- 0.06 per day. In the
   raceway pond the 10?mT field increased the growth rate from 0.24 +/-
   0.03 to 0.45 +/- 0.05 per day, final biomass from 0.88 +/- 0.11 to 1.56
   +/- 0.18?g/L per day, and maximum biomass production from 0.11 +/- 0.02
   to 0.38 +/- 0.04?g/L per day. Increased pigment, protein, Ca, and Zn
   content made the biomass produced with magnetic stimulation
   nutritionally superior. An increase in oxidative stress was measured
   indirectly as a decrease in antioxidant capacity from 26 +/- 2 to 17 +/-
   1 mu mol antioxidant/g biomass. Net photosynthetic capacity (NPC) and
   respiratory rate were increased by factors of 2.1 and 3.1, respectively.
   Loss of NPC enhancement after the removal of magnetic field fit a
   first-order model well (R2=0.99) with a half-life of 3.3 days.
   Transmission electron microscopy showed enlarged chloroplasts and
   decreased thylakoid order with 10?mT treatment. By increasing daily
   biomass production about fourfold, 10?mT magnetic field exposure could
   make algal oil cost competitive with other biodiesel feedstocks.

Abstract = {{Two semi-quantitative grading methods (referred to as the
   Hood/Wasielewski-method and the Modified-method) were described and then
   applied to 52 retrieved tibial polyethylene inserts from modular total
   knee replacements. Their ability to assess backside surface damage was
   compared. The damage score correlation with the implantation period
   greater than 24 months was better using the Modified-method (R=0.524,
   p=0.006) than using the Hood/Wasielewski-method (R=0.328, p=0.102).
   Also, the Modified-method gave significantly higher damage scores for
   males with gamma-in-air irradiated polyethylene inserts whereas the
   Hood/Wasielewski-method did not. Thus, the damage score obtained using
   the Modified-method seemed to provide a better representation of
   clinical surface damage and possibly PE wear. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Electrospinning of a sol-gel and polymer mixture is used to produce
   titania-alumina (TiO2-Al2O3) fibers with diameters ranging from 200 to
   800 nm. These composite metal-oxide fibers were calcined at various
   temperatures and their morphology is studied using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The
   decrease in the average diameter of the fibers with increasing
   temperature is observed. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals that up
   to 800 degrees C the composite fibers have anatase titania structure
   whereas at 900 degrees C the fibers exhibit mixture of anatase and
   rutile phases. It is found that specific surface area decreases as a
   function of temperature in the 700 -900 degrees C range. The change in
   phase (anatase-to-rutile) and the increase in crystallite size occur
   simultaneously. The presence of smaller amount of amorphous alumina in
   the primarily titania-based structure seems to play the role in
   stabilizing the anatase phase. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{This work presents the development and proof of concept of a
   phenomenologically-based numerical model capable of simulating the
   expansion of a smoldering front in a heterogeneous reactive porous
   medium. This practical tool has potential for investigating a range of
   large-scale smoldering phenomena including subsurface peat and coal
   fires. The model is applied to the smoldering of non-aqueous phase
   liquids (NAPLs) embedded in soil. NAPLs are industrial chemicals found
   extensively polluting the subsurface and their in situ destruction via
   smoldering combustion is a promising site remediation approach referred
   to as STAR (Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation). The In
   Situ Smoldering Model was developed through the novel coupling of a
   multiphase flow simulator with a combustion front expansion model,
   linked at the local (i.e., nodal) scale by a calibrated expression for
   the forward smoldering front velocity that is a function of airflow
   velocity and NAPL content. Numerical testing revealed that the model is
   computationally efficient and capable of handling two-dimensional
   smoldering propagation for a range of challenging physical scenarios.

Abstract = {{A Canadian chlorine-rich peat was co-fired with lignite in a bubbling
   fluidized bed combustor (FBC) in this study. With an air-cooled probe
   installed in the freeboard of the riser, effects of portion of peat,
   moisture content and addition of sulfur on ash and chlorine deposition
   during combustion/co-combustion of lignite-peat blends were
   investigated. The results indicated that the contents of chlorine
   element, alkali/alkaline earth metals and SiO2 and Al2O3 of the feed
   played a key role in the ash deposition in all tests. A higher chlorine
   concentration in the feed would generally result in a higher tendency of
   ash deposition. For instance, combustion of 100\% peat pellet showed a
   much higher tendency of ash deposition than combustion of the lignite
   alone. Nevertheless, co-firing of the lignite-peat blends with 20\% or
   50\% peat resulted in lower relative ash deposition rates (RDA).
   Combustion of relatively wet solid fuels produced a decreased RDA value
   and reduced chlorine deposition. Adding sulfur into the fuel of coal or
   peat could effectively decrease the chloride deposition in the ash
   deposits via sulfation. The sulfur addition could also reduce the ash
   deposition rate for the combustion of lignite, while it slightly
   increased the ash deposition rate for the peat fuel. The deposited Ca,
   Mg, Al and Si elements were present mostly in the forms of calcium and
   magnesium sulfates, aluminates and silicates that have relatively lower
   melting points. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The energy efficiency of the photocatalytic conversion of gas-phase
   organic pollutants was studied using a redesigned and scaled-up
   photo-CREC-air reactor. This photocatalytic unit has the unique feature
   of allowing an accurate analysis of the irradiation field by
   establishing macroscopic balances and in situ measurements. The
   photo-CREC-air reactor operates in batch mode with the photocatalyst
   supported by a stainless steel mesh being irradiated by eight UV lamps.
   Kinetic modeling was performed, and quantum yields (QYs) and
   photochemical thermodynamic efficiency factors (PTEFs) were calculated
   using data for acetone and acetaldehyde photocatalytic degradation in
   ambient air utilizing a Degussa P25 (Aeroxide 25) photocatalyst. It was
   found that the photo-CREC-air reactor is suitable for the determination
   of kinetic and adsorption parameters, given a design with excellent
   irradiation usage and fluid-catalyst contact. In this respect, quantum
   yields for both acetone and acetaldehyde exceed the value of 1
   (equivalent to 100\%), with PTEFs in both cases remaining below the
   level of 1, as required by thermodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most promising negative electrode materials in lithium-ion
   batteries (LIBs), SnO2 experiences intense investigation due to its high
   specific capacity and energy density, relative to conventional graphite
   anodes. In this study, for the first time, atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   is used to deposit SnO2, containing both amorphous and crystalline
   phases, onto graphene nanosheets (GNS) as anodes for LIBs. The resultant
   SnO2-graphene nanocomposites exhibit a sandwich structure, and, when
   cycled against a lithium counter electrode, demonstrate a promising
   electrochemical performance. It is demonstrated that the introduction of
   GNS into the nanocomposites is beneficial for the anodes by increasing
   their electrical conductivity and releasing strain energy: thus, the
   nanocomposite electrode materials maintain a high electrical
   conductivity and flexibility. It is found that the amorphous SnO2-GNS is
   more effective than the crystalline SnO2-GNS in overcoming
   electrochemical and mechanical degradation; this observation is
   consistent with the intrinsically isotropic nature of the amorphous
   SnO2, which can mitigate the large volume changes associated with
   charge/discharge processes. It is observed that after 150
   charge/discharge cycles, 793 mA h g-1 is achieved. Moreover, a higher
   coulombic efficiency is obtained for the amorphous SnO2-GNS composite
   anode. This study provides an approach to fabricate novel anode
   materials and clarifies the influence of SnO2 phases on the
   electrochemical performance of LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory motion may lead to dose errors when treating thoracic and
   abdominal tumours with radiotherapy. The interplay between complex
   multileaf collimator patterns and patient respiratory motion could
   result in unintuitive dose changes. We have developed a treatment
   reconstruction simulation computer code that accounts for interplay
   effects by combining multileaf collimator controller log files,
   respiratory trace log files, 4DCT images and a Monte Carlo dose
   calculator. Two three-dimensional (3D) IMRT step-and-shoot plans, a
   concave target and integrated boost were delivered to a 1D rigid motion
   phantom. Three sets of experiments were performed with 100\%, 50\% and
   25\% duty cycle gating. The log files were collected, and five
   simulation types were performed on each data set: continuous isocentre
   shift, discrete isocentre shift, 4DCT, 4DCT delivery average and 4DCT
   plan average. Analysis was performed using 3D gamma analysis with
   passing criteria of 2\%, 2 mm. The simulation framework was able to
   demonstrate that a single fraction of the integrated boost plan was more
   sensitive to interplay effects than the concave target. Gating was shown
   to reduce the interplay effects. We have developed a 4DCT Monte Carlo
   simulation method that accounts for IMRT interplay effects with
   respiratory motion by utilizing delivery log files.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear vibration and postbuckling behavior of a single layer graphene
   sheet (SLGS) embedded in a polymer matrix aroused by the nonlinear van
   der Waals (vdW) forces are investigated using the Kirchhoff plate
   theory. The interfacial vdW forces are described by a nonlinear function
   in terms of the graphene deflection. Through harmonic balance method,
   the nonlinear relation between deflection amplitudes and resonant
   frequencies of free vibrations of the SLGS and its postbuckling
   equilibrium path are derived. It is found that variation of resonant
   frequencies of an embedded SLGS is less dependent on the graphene aspect
   ratio and mode numbers as compared with a free-standing one. In-plane
   load effects upon the vibrational behavior of the SLGS and its
   postbuckling are also discussed. Simulation results have demonstrated
   the significance of considering the surrounding medium effect and its
   nonlinearity in the study of the vibration and buckling of the embedded

   although there was no significant difference in methane yield (on
   average 114 mL CH4/g TCODsub) or biodegradability (on average 28.3\%) of
   primary sludge using pre-incubated or non-incubated inocula, the maximum
   methane production rates using non-incubated inoculum were higher than
   those using pre-incubated inoculum at all SIX ratios. Moreover,

Abstract = {{Extending time-resolved laser-induced incandescence (TiRe-LII), a
   diagnostic traditionally used to characterize soot and other
   carbonaceous particles, into a tool for measuring metal nanoparticles
   requires knowledge of the thermal accommodation coefficient for those
   systems. This parameter can be calculated using molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations provided the interatomic potential is known between the gas
   molecule and surface atoms, but this is not often the case for many
   gas/surface combinations. In this instance, researchers often resort to
   the Lorentz-Berthelot combination rules to estimate the gas/surface
   potential using parameters derived for homogeneous systems. This paper
   compares this methodology with a more accurate approach based on ab
   initio derived potentials to estimate the thermal accommodation
   coefficient for laser-energized nickel nanoparticles in argon. Results
   show that the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules overestimate the true
   potential well depth by an order of magnitude, resulting in perfect
   thermal accommodation, whereas the more accurate ab initio derived
   potential predicts an accommodation coefficient in excellent agreement
   with experimentally-determined values for other metal nanoparticle
   aerosols. This result highlights the importance of accurately
   characterizing the gas/surface potential when using MD to estimate
   thermal accommodation coefficients for TiRe-LII.}},

Abstract = {{During strong windstorms, sheathing and siding on residential,
   wood-framed, wall systems have commonly failed. In the current study, a
   clear difference is observed in the rate of failure occurrence for wall
   sheathing above or below the eaves. This observation can be explained
   from tests examining ultimate capacities and pressure equalization of
   both single-and multilayer residential, wood-framed, wall systems using
   realistic fluctuating loads. The results indicate that pressure
   equalization is a critical parameter in the performance of both the
   cladding and exterior sheathing. With interior sheathing included,
   significant pressure equalization was observed to occur across the
   exterior sheathing, because pressure equalization is observed to
   increase with load (and damage) levels. This substantially increases the
   ultimate capacity of these wall systems; however, the construction
   details of the various exterior layers play an important role in the
   levels of pressure equalization across each layer. DOI:

Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete (RC) framed buildings dissipate the seismic energy
   through yielding of the reinforcing bars. This yielding jeopardizes the
   serviceability of these buildings as it results in residual lateral
   deformations. Superelastic Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) can recover
   inelastic strains by stress removal. Since SMA is a costly material,
   this paper defines the required locations of SMA bars in a typical RC
   frame to optimize its seismic performance in terms of damage scheme and
   seismic residual deformations. The intensities of five earthquakes
   causing failure to a typical RC six-storey building are defined and used
   to evaluate seven SMA design alternatives.}},

Title = {{Effect of the orientation of records on displacement ductility demand}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{362-373}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Effects of the ground motion record orientation on the estimated
   pseudo-spectral acceleration (PSA) have been investigated and reported
   in the literature; the statistics of the PSA along the major and minor
   principal axes differ from that for a random orientation. This is true
   for California as well as for Mexican records. However, a statistical
   assessment of the effect of record orientation on the displacement
   ductility demand is lacking. Such an assessment could be important for
   gaining confidence in and understanding of using the ductility demand
   rules for seismic hazard and risk evaluations. The statistical analyses
   of the effect of orientation on the estimated displacement ductility
   demand for elastic-perfectly-plastic and bilinear hysteretic (single
   degree of freedom) systems is carried out in the present study using
   sets of records from Mexican inslab and interplate earthquakes, and
   California earthquakes. Based on the obtained statistics, it is
   suggested that the consideration that the ductility demand is
   independent of the orientation of the records can be adequate,
   especially for T-n greater than 0.3 s and elastic-perfectly-plastic
   hysteretic single degree of freedom systems.}},

Title = {{Robust Multipoint Water-Fat Separation Using Fat Likelihood Analysis}},
Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{67}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fat suppression is an essential part of routine MRI scanning. Multiecho
   chemical-shift based water-fat separation methods estimate and correct
   for Bo field inhomogeneity. However, they must contend with the
   intrinsic challenge of water-fat ambiguity that can result in water-fat
   swapping. This problem arises because the signals from two chemical
   species, when both are modeled as a single discrete spectral peak, may
   appear indistinguishable in the presence of Bo off-resonance. In
   conventional methods, the water-fat ambiguity is typically removed by
   enforcing field map smoothness using region growing based algorithms. In
   reality, the fat spectrum has multiple spectral peaks. Using this
   spectral complexity, we introduce a novel concept that identifies water
   and fat for multiecho acquisitions by exploiting the spectral
   differences between water and fat. A fat likelihood map is produced to
   indicate if a pixel is likely to be water-dominant or fat-dominant by
   comparing the fitting residuals of two different signal models. The fat
   likelihood analysis and field map smoothness provide complementary
   information, and we designed an algorithm (Fat Likelihood Analysis for
   Multiecho Signals) to exploit both mechanisms. It is demonstrated in a
   wide variety of data that the Fat Likelihood Analysis for Multiecho
   Signals algorithm offers highly robust water-fat separation for 6-echo
   acquisitions, particularly in some previously challenging applications.

Abstract = {{A site-specific study is carried out to assess the suitability of froth
   flotation for desulphurization of reactive mine tailings at the
   Musselwhite Mine, Northern Ontario, Canada, to prevent acid mine
   drainage (AMD). The results from pilot scale flotation tests on an
   Outokumpu flotation unit are presented, which confirm that froth
   flotation is effective to reduce sulphide contents of tailings. The
   factors affecting the treatment effectiveness, such as the froth depth,
   air flow rate, pulp density and impeller speed are studied. The sulphur
   recoveries after 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 12 min of flotation time are
   fitted to a second-order kinetic model. It is found that the second
   order rate constant, k(2) is negatively correlated with the froth depth
   and positively correlated with the air flow rate. Based on the data
   presented in this study; the maximum recovery of total sulphur was
   achieved when the operational parameters were set to the froth depth of
   5 cm, air now rate 125 L/min, impeller speed 1300 rpm and pulp density

Abstract = {{Objectives: (1) To investigate the efficacy of a computer-generated
   three-dimensional laryngeal model for laryngeal anatomy teaching; (2) to
   explore the relationship between students' spatial ability and
   acquisition of anatomical knowledge; and (3) to assess participants'
   opinion of the computerised model.
   Subjects and methods: Forty junior doctors were randomised to undertake
   laryngeal anatomy study supplemented by either a three-dimensional
   computer model or two-dimensional images. Outcome measurements comprised
   a laryngeal anatomy test, the modified Vandenberg and Kuse mental
   rotation test, and an opinion survey.
   Results: Mean scores +/- standard deviations for the anatomy test were
   15.7 +/- 2.0 for the `three dimensions' group and 15.5 +/- 2.3 for the
   `standard' group (p = 0.7222). Pearson's correlation between the
   rotation test scores and the scores for the spatial ability questions in
   the anatomy test was 0.4791 (p = 0.086, n = 29). Opinion survey answers
   revealed significant differences in respondents' perceptions of the
   clarity and `user friendliness' of, and their preferences for, the
   three-dimensional model as regards anatomical study.
   Conclusion: The three-dimensional computer model was equivalent to
   standard two-dimensional images, for the purpose of laryngeal anatomy
   teaching. There was no association between students' spatial ability and
   functional anatomy learning. However, students preferred to use the
   three-dimensional model.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid preceramic poly(silylacetylene)siloxane resin was synthesized via
   a two-step protocol including organometallic condensation and hydrolysis
   reactions. The preceramic resin was well soluble in acetone, toluene,
   and tetrahydrofuran (THF), etc. By thermal cure at 180-250 degrees C a
   hard monolithic solid was formed through radical polymerization of
   secondary ethynyl groups. The poly(silylacetylene)siloxane resin was
   processed easily to various nonporous shapes to silicon carbide (SiC)
   and silicon oxycarbide (SiCO). SiCO ceramic was obtained at a yield of
   >75\% by pressureless pyrolysis at 900-1200 degrees C; while SiC ceramic
   was obtained at 1500 degrees C at a yield of approximate to 67\%. The
   molar ratio of Si/C in the SIC was found at 1:1.1-1:3, based on ICP-MS
   elemental analysis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results revealed the typical
   p-sic structure in the poly(silylacetylene)siloxane derived SiC
   ceramics. The SiC ceramics exhibited high thermo-oxidation resistance at
   elevated temperatures in air atmosphere. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{The main objective of the current study is to utilize the huge
   capabilities of modern heuristic search algorithms for structural design
   optimization of pre-stressed concrete slab: providing a general,
   flexible, and relatively easy to use tool for practicing engineers. A
   robust numerical tool integrating design, analysis, and optimization
   techniques is developed for this purpose. The tool utilizes the Finite
   Element method for the structural analysis of the system. Optimum values
   for the slab thickness, number and size of tendons, and tendon profile
   are found subject to design constraints imposed by the relevant code of
   practice. The objective function incorporates the cost of both concrete
   and prestressing tendons. Although the objective function is simple and
   monotonic, the optimization problem is quiet challenging due to the
   complexity and nonlinearity of the constraints in addition to the
   discreteness of some of the variables. As a demonstration problem, the
   optimum design of a square prestressed flat slab is sought. Direct
   search methods, heuristic optimization techniques such as Genetic
   Algorithms, and multi-objective optimization techniques are considered.
   Results indicated that search should be conducted along a constraint
   boundary. It is suggested to divide the design variables into two groups
   and to define a second objective function representing the distance away
   from the constraint. Optimization should be carried out for both
   objective functions (cost and distance) simultaneously. Using the
   suggested procedure, optimum design is found more efficiently. (C) 2011

Title = {{Numerical Results for the Effective Flow and Thermal Properties of
   Idealized Graphite Foam}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{To simulate the heat transfer performance of devices incorporating
   high-conductivity porous materials, it is necessary to determine the
   relevant effective properties to close the volume-averaged momentum and
   energy equations. In this work, we determine these effective properties
   by conducting direct simulations in an idealized spherical void phase
   geometry and use the results to establish closure relations to be
   employed in a volume-averaged framework. To close the volume-averaged
   momentum equation, we determine the permeability as defined by Darcy's
   law as well as a non-Darcy term, which characterizes the departure from
   Darcy's law at higher Reynolds numbers. Results indicate that the
   non-Darcy term is nonlinearly related to Reynolds number, not only
   confirming previous evidence regarding such behavior in the weak inertia
   flow regime, but demonstrating that this is generally true at higher
   Reynolds numbers as well. The volume-averaged energy equation in the
   fluid phase is closed by the thermal dispersion conductivity tensor, the
   convecting velocity, and the interfacial Nusselt number. Overall, it has
   been found that many existing correlations for the effective thermal
   properties of graphite foams are oversimplified. In particular, it has
   been found that the dispersion conductivity is not well characterized
   using the Peclet number alone, rather the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers
   must be considered as separate influences. Additionally, the convecting
   velocity modification, which is not typically considered, was found to
   be significant, while the interfacial Nusselt number was found to
   exhibit a nonzero asymptote at low Peclet numbers. Finally, simulations
   using the closed volume-averaged equations reveal significant
   differences in heat transfer when employing the present dispersion model
   in comparison to a simpler dispersion model commonly used for metallic
   foams, particularly at high Peclet numbers and for thicker foam blocks.

Abstract = {{Phenol degradation with TiO2 photocatalyst under UV light is known to be
   an effective method. Under solar radiation, however, this approach does
   not receive adequate photons for catalyst activation, as the solar
   spectrum comprises mostly visible light (46\%). In this study, we
   applied the dye-sensitization technique to prepare visible-light-active
   catalyst and used it under visible solar light generated from a solar
   simulator with a UV cutoff filter (lambda > 420 nm) for phenol
   degradation. Eosin Y dye was used as a sensitizer for the TiO2 catalyst
   with a very low level of platinum as a cocatalyst. Triethanolamine was
   used as a sacrificial electron donor. Parametric studies were performed
   for the catalyst loading, initial triethnolamine concentration, initial
   phenol concentration, platinum content on TiO2, solution pH, and visible
   light intensity. About 93\% degradation of 40 ppm phenol solution was
   achieved within 90 min using Eosin Y TiO2/Pt photocatalyst under optimum
   conditions (pH 7.0, catalyst loading of 0.8 g/L, triethnolamine
   concentration of 0.2 M, 0.5\% Pt loading on TiO2, visible solar light
   intensity of 100 mW/cm(2)). The kinetic rate constant and adsorption
   equilibrium constant were determined, and a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type
   equation was proposed to describe phenol degradation on TiO2 at
   different visible light intensities. The model equation was found to
   predict the experimental results quite well.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of pharmaceutical pollutants such as ibuprofen (IBU) and its
   metabolite 4-isobutylacetophenone (4-IBAP) from water was investigated
   in a laboratory scale commercial hollow fibre membrane contactor by
   non-dispersive solvent extraction. The effects of water and solvent flow
   rates (92-474 ml/min) on the shell and tube side of the hollow fibre,
   respectively, were investigated. The hollow fibres were found to be very
   efficient in reducing the concentrations (10-110 mu g/ml) of the
   pharmaceuticals in water by approximately 90\% or greater within the
   first couple of minutes of experiment showing extremely fast kinetics.
   Faster removal was obtained when the organic phase flowed at a higher
   rate than the aqueous feed phase. The effect of aqueous phase pH on the
   removal was tested in the pH range 2-10. Ibuprofen removal was greatly
   affected by pH with close to 100\% removal occurred at pH 2, and less
   than 20\% removal occurred at pH 10. Removal of ibuprofen metabolite
   (4-isobutylacetophenone) was not affected by pH, and an average removal
   of 96\% was achieved at both basic and acidic pH. The laboratory-scale
   experiments were conducted in both batch and once through modes. The
   mass transfer coefficients were also estimated under various operating

Abstract = {{Modern radiation therapy techniques such as intensity-modulated

   use tightly conformed megavoltage x-ray fields to irradiate a tumour

   (Co-60 up to 18 MV), five field sizes (1 x 1 cm(2) up to 15 x 15 cm(2)),
   and 12 lung densities (0.001 g cm(-3) up to 1 g cm(-3)) for a total of
   1440 simulations. We developed the relative depth-dose factor (RDDF),
   which can be used to characterize the extent of LED (RDDF <1.0). For
   RDDF <0.7 severe LED occurred, and both lung and tumour dose were
   drastically reduced. For example, a 6 MV (3 x 3 cm(2)) field was used to
   irradiate a 1 cm(3) tumour embedded in lung with ultra-low density of
   0.001 g cm(-3) (RDDF = 0.2). Dose in up-stream lung and tumour centre
   were reduced by as much as 80\% with respect to the water density
   calculation. These reductions were worse for smaller tumours irradiated
   with high energy beams, small field sizes, and low lung density. In
   conclusion, SBRT trials based on dose calculations in homogeneous tissue
   are misleading as they do not reflect the actual dosimetric effects due
   to LED. Future clinical trials should only use dose calculation engines
   that can account for electron scatter, with special attention given to
   patients with low lung density (i.e. emphysema). In cases where tissue
   inhomogeneity corrections are applied, the nature of the correction used
   may be inadequate in predicting the correct level of LED. In either
   case, the dose to the tumour is not the prescribed dose and clinical
   response data are uncertain. The new information from this study can be
   used by radiation oncologists who wish to perform advanced radiation
   therapy techniques while avoiding the deleterious predictable dosimetric
   effects of LED.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its importance to the arthropod exoskeleton, chitin
   biogenesis is an attractive target for pest control. This point is
   demonstrated by the economically important benzoylurea compounds that
   are in wide use as highly specific agents to control insect populations.
   Nevertheless, the target sites of compounds that inhibit chitin
   biogenesis have remained elusive, likely preventing the full
   exploitation of the underlying mode of action in pest management. Here,
   we show that the acaricide etoxazole inhibits chitin biogenesis in
   Tetranychus urticae (the two-spotted spider mite), an economically
   important pest. We then developed a population-level bulk segregant
   mapping method, based on high-throughput genome sequencing, to identify
   a locus for monogenic, recessive resistance to etoxazole in a
   field-collected population. As supported by additional genetic studies,
   including sequencing across multiple resistant strains and genetic
   complementation tests, we associated a nonsynonymous mutation in the
   major T. urticae chitin synthase (CHS1) with resistance. The change is
   in a C-terminal transmembrane domain of CHS1 in a highly conserved
   region that may serve a noncatalytic but essential function. Our finding
   of a target-site resistance mutation in CHS1 shows that at least one
   highly specific chitin biosynthesis inhibitor acts directly to inhibit
   chitin synthase. Our work also raises the possibility that other chitin
   biogenesis inhibitors, such as the benzoylurea compounds, may also act
   by inhibition of chitin synthases. More generally, our genetic mapping
   approach should be powerful for high-resolution mapping of simple traits
   (resistance or otherwise) in arthropods.}},

Abstract = {{A novel nanoporous tree-like SiO2 film was synthesized by a sol-gel
   assisted electrostatic spray deposition (SG-ESD) approach. The sol-gel
   process employed was better to create SiO2 with linear cross-link chains
   for the electrostatic spray deposition. From electron microscopic study,
   it was found that the as-deposited SiO2 films possess nanoporous
   tree-like morphology in macroscale; and monodispersed hollow nanoporous
   spherical structure in microscale. The formation of the nanoporous
   ``tree{''} structure is related to the preferential landing of droplets
   on the substrate and the electrostatic repulsion force among landing
   droplets during the ESD process. The catalytic effect of hydrochloric
   acid in the sol-gel system contributes to the formation of the hollow
   and porous structured SiO2 spheres. The charge-discharge characteristics
   of the porous SiO2 as an anode for Li-ion batteries were briefly
   evaluated and good long-term cycle performance was reached. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Spectral methods for analyses of steady flows in annuli bounded by walls
   with either axi-symmetric or longitudinal ribs are developed. The
   physical boundary conditions are enforced using the immersed boundary
   conditions concept. In the former case, the Stokes stream function is
   used to eliminate pressure and to reduce system of field equations to a
   single fourth-order partial differential equation. The ribs are assumed
   to be periodic in the axial direction and this permits representation of
   the solution in terms of the Fourier expansion. In the latter case, the
   problem is reduced to the Laplace equations for the flow modifications
   that can be expressed in terms of the Fourier expansions. The modal
   functions, which are functions of the radial coordinate, are discretized
   using Chebyshev polynomials. The problem formulations are closed using
   either the fixed volume flow rate constraint or the fixed pressure
   gradient constraint. Various tests have been carried out in order to
   demonstrate the spectral accuracy of the discretizations, as well as the
   spectral accuracy of the enforcement of the flow boundary conditions at
   the ribbed walls using the immersed boundary conditions concept. Special
   linear solver that takes advantage of the matrix structure has been
   implemented in order to reduce computational time and memory
   requirements. It is shown that the algorithm has superior performance
   when one is interested in the analysis of a large number of geometries,
   as part of the coefficient matrix that corresponds to the field equation
   is always the same and one needs to change only the part of the matrix
   that corresponds to the boundary relations when changing geometry of the
   flow domain. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{The use of hollow core bars in micropiles has greatly increased over the
   past ten years. Hollow core construction, also termed self drilled, is
   becoming a popular option because it allows a faster installation
   processes and ground improvement at the same time. This paper presents a
   field study on the behaviour of single hollow core micropiles in stiff
   silty clay deposit. Four hollow core micropilcs were installed using an
   air flushing technique employing large drilling carbide bits. Ten axial
   tests were conducted on the four micropiles, including three compression
   tests, two tension monotonic axial tests, four compression cyclic tests,
   and one tension cyclic axial tests. The results of the full-scale
   loading tests are presented and analyzed in terms of load displacement
   curves. The results of the monotonic testing phase showed that the bond
   strength values (alpha(bond)) suggested by the Federal Highway
   Administration in 2000 for the silty clay deposits may be underestimated
   when considering hollow core micropiles as type B micropile grouting.
   The response of the micropiles to cyclic loading is considered
   satisfactory. No sign of full debonding occurring at the pile-soil
   interface was observed after 15 load cycles with cyclic load amplitude
   of 33\% of the micropile design load. The stiffness of most micropiles
   remained almost constant after the cyclic loading. However, the pile
   head movement increased after the cyclic loading due to limited strain
   softening behaviour of the soil deposit occurs at the grout/ground
   interface. The results showed that the micopile's performance in stiff
   clay is not sensitive to minor changes in cyclic load amplitudes, but
   sensitive to the magnitude and rate of the total applied load.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a waveform relaxation algorithm is presented for
   efficient transient analysis of large transmission-line networks. The
   proposed methodology represents lossy transmission lines as a cascade of
   lumped circuit elements alternating with lossless line segments, where
   the lossless line segments are modeled using the method of
   characteristics. Partitioning the transmission lines at the natural
   interfaces provided by the method of characteristics allows the
   resulting subcircuits to be weakly coupled by construction. The
   subcircuits are solved independently using a proposed hybrid iterative
   technique that combines the advantages of both traditional Gauss-Seidel
   and Gauss-Jacobi algorithms. The overall algorithm is highly
   parallelizable and exhibits good scaling with both the size of the
   network involved and the number of CPUs available. Numerical examples
   have been presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of the
   proposed work.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of biomaterials to support the adhesion of cells is a
   necessary condition for their use in scaffold-guided tissue engineering.
   Waveguide evanescent field fluorescence (WEFF) microscopy is a
   relatively new microscopic technique that allows the number of cell
   adhesions to a waveguide surface be measured by imaging the interfacial
   contact region between the cells and their substratum. In this work, the
   adhesion of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) to
   ultrathin films (20 nm) of poly(ester amide)s (PEAs) prepared by
   Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technology on waveguides was investigated and
   compared with conventional vinculin irnmunostaining on solvent cast PEA
   films. Cell culture was conducted both in the presence and absence of
   serum to evaluate the effect of nonspecific protein adsorption that
   mediates cell adhesion. WEFF microscopy analyses revealed that the
   cationic PEA enhanced the number of attachment sites compared with the
   control waveguides regardless of the culture medium. Although
   differences in cell adhesions between different PEAs were suggested by
   the results, no statistically significant differences were found.
   Similar results were observed with presently and previously reported
   vinculin immunostaining studies, further validating the use of WEFF
   microscopy to quantify cell adhesions. Moreover, the focal adhesions of
   the HCASMCs to the PEA surfaces indicate these PEAS can promote integrin
   signaling, which is vital in cell survival, migration, and
   proliferation, and ultimately in scaffold-guided vascular tissue
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale hydroxyapatite (HA) is an optimal candidate biomaterial for
   bone tissue engineering because of its bioactive and osteoconductive
   properties. In this study, micro-and nanoscale HA particles with rod-
   and wirelike morphology were synthesized by a novel sol gel hydrothermal
   process. Sol gel chemistry was used to produce a dry gel containing
   amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), which was used as a precursor
   material in a hydrothermal process. The sol-gel-hydrothermal products
   were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to
   determine particle morphology, crystal structure, and the presence of
   chemical functional groups. A pure HA crystal was synthesized, which
   underwent both one- and three-dimensional growth, resulting in tunable
   microrod and nanorod, and wire morphologies. The effects of solution pH
   and reaction time on particle diameter and length were assessed.
   Particle diameter ranged from 25 to 800 nm and decreased with an
   increase in solution pH, whereas both particle length and diameter
   increased as the hydrothermal process was prolonged. Nanowire HA powders
   (10-50 wt \%) were mixed with poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) to produce
   PCL/HA composites. Fracture surfaces of PCL/HA composites showed a
   well-dispersed and homogeneous distribution of HA nanowires within the
   PCL matrix. Mechanical testing revealed a significant (p < 0.05)
   increase in the Young's and compressive moduli of PCL/HA composites
   compared to PCL alone, with 50 wt \% HA producing a 3-fold increase in
   Young's modulus from 193 to 665 MPa and 2-fold increase in compressive
   modulus from 230 to 487 MPa. These HA nanowires can be used to reinforce
   polymer composites and are excellent biomaterials for tissue engineering
   of bone.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of Ethernet passive optical networks (EPONs) with
   wireless worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) is an
   approved solution for an access network. A resilient packet ring (RPR)
   is a good candidate for a metro network. Hence RPR, EPON, and WiMAX
   integration is a viable solution for metro-access network bridging. The
   present paper examines such integration, including an architecture and a
   joint media access control (MAC) protocol, as a solution for both access
   and metro networks. The proposed architecture is reliable due to the
   dependability of the RPR standard and the protection mechanism employed
   in the EPON. Moreover, the architecture contains a high fault tolerance
   against node and connection failure. The suggested MAC protocol includes
   a multi-level dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm, a distributed
   admission control, a scheduler, and a routing algorithm. This MAC
   protocol aims at maximizing the advantages of the proposed architecture
   by distributing its functionalities over different parts of the
   architecture and jointly executing the parts of the MAC protocol.}},

   sequential and simultaneous boost to a dominant intraprostatic lesion}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1505-1517}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate experimentally the impact of intrafractional
   prostate motion on the delivered dose to a dominant intraprostatic
   lesion (DIL) using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity
   modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with sequential and simultaneous
   boost.
   Methods: A series of six IMRT and VMAT treatment plans were generated,
   evaluated, and compared for two patient CT scans with dissimilar
   anatomies. Plans were generated for the prostate with and without the
   DIL. Plans were delivered using a Varian CLINAC and 2D dose
   distributions were measured using MAPCHECK(TM)-MAPPHAN(TM) system. The
   effect of the prostate intrafractional motion on the delivery of the
   plans was studied by delivering the plans to the
   MAPCHECK(TM)-MAPPHAN(TM) system on a programmable motion platform.
   Prostate intrafractional motion was simulated based on six different
   motion patterns from the literature obtained on Calypso system (Calypso
   System, Calypso Medical, Seattle, WA, USA) in a clinical study that
   provided continuous, real-time localization, and monitoring of the
   prostate. Absolute dose differences and Gamma analysis were used to
   assess the quality of a total of 42 plans with motion and without
   motion.
   Results: Dose escalation to the whole prostate from 76 to 86 Gy caused
   the rectum and bladder to exceed normal tissue tolerances in both
   patients. All the DIL boost plans satisfied the planning criteria and
   delivery quality assurance when motion was not present. For a single
   fraction, the motion pattern with large constant shift caused the
   largest dose delivery discrepancy with mean Gamma value (1.14-1.44) and
   the lowest plan passing percentage (18.9\%-35.7\%), while the motion
   pattern with continuous random changes during treatment had the least
   impact on dose delivery with mean Gamma value (0.33-0.55) and the
   highest passing percentage (81.9\%-100\%) for all the investigated
   plans. For dose escalation to DIL in the presence of intrafractional
   prostate motion, a significant difference was observed between the
   different motion patterns (p < 0.05), but no significant difference in
   the sensitivity to motion between the various plans was observed (p =
   0.30). Based on Gamma analysis, treatment courses in which 15\% of the
   fractions are dominated by severe motion proved to be significantly
   different from those dominated by random motion (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The impact of intrafractional prostate motion on dose
   delivery is sensitive to different motion patterns but not to different
   delivery techniques. Dose escalation to DIL using either sequential or
   simultaneous boost plans with 7 mm PTV margin is achievable in the
   presence of intrafractional prostate motion, even if the severe motion
   comprised 8.6\% (3 out of the 35) treatment fractions. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Predicting target vessel location on robot-assisted coronary artery
   bypass graft using CT to ultrasound registration}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1579-1587}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Although robot-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting
   (RA-CABG) has gained more acceptance worldwide, its success still
   depends on the surgeon's experience and expertise, and the conversion
   rate to full sternotomy is in the order of 15\%-25\%. One of the reasons
   for conversion is poor preoperative planning, which is based solely on
   pre-operative computed tomography (CT) images. In this paper, the
   authors propose a technique to estimate the global peri-operative
   displacement of the heart and to predict the intra-operative target
   vessel location, validated via both an in vitro and a clinical study.
   Methods: As the peri-operative heart migration during RA-CABG has never
   been reported in the literatures, a simple in vitro validation study was
   conducted using a heart phantom. To mimic the clinical workflow, a
   pre-operative CT as well as peri-operative ultrasound images at three
   different stages in the procedure (Stage(0)-following intubation;
   Stage(1)-following lung deflation; and Stage(2)-following thoracic
   insufflation) were acquired during the experiment. Following image
   acquisition, a rigid-body registration using iterative closest point
   algorithm with the robust estimator was employed to map the
   pre-operative stage to each of the peri-operative ones, to estimate the
   heart migration and predict the peri-operative target vessel location.
   Moreover, a clinical validation of this technique was conducted using
   offline patient data, where a Monte Carlo simulation was used to
   overcome the limitations arising due to the invisibility of the target
   vessel in the peri-operative ultrasound images.
   Results: For the in vitro study, the computed target registration error
   (TRE) at Stage(0), Stage(1), and Stage(2) was 2.1, 3.3, and 2.6 mm,
   respectively. According to the offline clinical validation study, the
   maximum TRE at the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was
   4.1 mm at Stage(0), 5.1 mm at Stage(1), and 3.4 mm at Stage(2).
   Conclusions: The authors proposed a method to measure and validate
   peri-operative shifts of the heart during RA-CABG. In vitro and clinical
   validation studies were conducted and yielded a TRE in the order of 5 mm
   for all cases. As the desired clinical accuracy imposed by this
   procedure is on the order of one intercostal space (10-15 mm), our
   technique suits the clinical requirements. The authors therefore believe
   this technique has the potential to improve the pre-operative planning
   by updating peri-operative migration patterns of the heart and,
   consequently, will lead to reduced conversion to conventional open
   thoracic procedures. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in

Abstract = {{To enhance the anaerobic digestion of municipal waste-activated sludge
   (WAS), ultrasound, thermal, and ultrasound + thermal (combined)
   pretreatments were conducted using three ultrasound specific energy
   inputs (1000, 5000, and 10,000 kJ/kg TSS) and three thermal pretreatment
   temperatures (50, 70 and 90 degrees C). Prior to anaerobic digestion,
   combined pretreatments significantly improved volatile suspended solid
   (VSS) reduction by 29-38\%. The largest increase in methane production
   (30\%) was observed after 30 min of 90 degrees C pretreatment followed
   by 10,000 kJ/kg TSS ultrasound pretreatment. Combined pretreatments
   improved the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) removal efficiency by 42-72\% but
   did not show any further improvement in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal
   when compared with ultrasound and thermal pretreatments alone. Economic
   analysis showed that combined pretreatments with 1000 kJ/kg TSS specific
   energy and differing thermal pretreatments (50-90 degrees C) can reduce
   operating costs by \$44-66/ton dry solid when compared to conventional
   anaerobic digestion without pretreatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   platform has been chosen to implement such a shutdown system.
   Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations have been performed to
   demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. Furthermore, connections
   between the speed of response of the shutdown system and the nominal
   operating power level of the reactor have been drawn to support for

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{442-446}},

Abstract = {{Oiling-out, also termed as demixing or liquid liquid phase separation
   (LLPS), frequently occurs in the crystallization process of
   pharmaceuticals and normally results in slow crystal growth,
   uncontrollable crystal morphology, and low purity of products. In this
   work, the oiling-out and cooling crystallization of idebenone were
   investigated. The cooling crystallization and the purity of its products
   were found to depend upon whether an oiling-out occurred in the course
   of cooling. At low initial concentrations (e.g., 12 mg/mL), oiling-out
   did not take place, and the crystallization products possessed higher
   purity. At moderate initial concentrations (e.g., 25 mg/mL) small
   quantities of oil droplets formed and then coalesced into larger
   droplets, which subsequently crystallized into products with lower
   purity. When high initial concentrations (e.g., 31 mg/mL) were employed,
   large quantities of oil droplets formed a stable oil phase, and thus no
   products could be harvested. In addition to initial concentration, other
   parameters such as solvent, cooling rate, and seeding also affected the
   occurrence of oiling-out. On the basis of the above results, the
   approach to purifying idebenone through cooling crystallization will be
   found.}},

Abstract = {{Vertically aligned nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with modulated
   nitrogen content have been synthesized in a large scale by using spray

   electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman techniques have been employed to
   characterize the morphology, composition, and vibrational properties of
   nanotubes. The results indicate that the nitrogen incorporation
   significantly influences the growth rate, morphology, size and structure
   of nanotubes. Electrical measurement investigation of the nanotubes
   indicates that the change in electrical resistance increases with
   temperature and pressure as the nitrogen concentration increases inside
   the tubes. This work presents a versatile, safe, and easy way to scale
   up route of growing carbon nanotubes with controlled nitrogen content
   and modulated structure, and may provide an insight in developing

Abstract = {{In pharmaceutical manufacturing, control of particle size is crucial for
   achieving reproducible products of acceptable quality. Robust
   technologies to measure particle size online during operations such as
   blending, granulation and tabletting are required, but to date have not
   been implemented. A previous study showed acoustic emissions generated
   during high-shear granulation are correlated to changes in particle
   size; however, the origin of the relationship is not well understood. In
   this work, the correlation between audible acoustic emissions (AAEs) and
   particle size was investigated by isolating particle-particle and
   particle-equipment interactions MCC and sugar spheres of known size were
   rotated in 1.2 and 12 L stainless steel beakers and a PMA-10 granulator.
   AAEs were collected using a condenser microphone positioned above the
   moving bed. The results showed the acoustic 10 Hz total power spectral
   densities (TPSDs) between 20 and 20,000 Hz were predictive of particle
   size. The correlations were positive for the majority of the 10 Hz
   frequency groups and were shown to correspond to an increase in surface
   velocity with increasing particle size. Some of the low frequency groups
   were negatively correlated, in agreement with a reduction in AAEs
   generated by interparticle friction. The investigation also demonstrated
   a predictive relationship between the 10 Hz TPSDs and size for wet
   granules in the 12 L beaker that agrees with the results for the dry
   spheres. The findings support correlations developed between AAEs and
   particle size using process data and encourage further development of
   AAEs for use in online, non-intrusive monitoring. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The present study utilized a specially built tilting tank to measure the
   shear strength of deposited mine tailings beds under different degrees
   of drainage and in the stress range below 1 kPa. Two modes of tilting
   were employed to simulate drained and partially drained conditions. The
   slow tilting mode ensured that the excess pore pressure generated in the
   tailings bed in response to shearing remained low and did not influence
   the shear strength of the bed. During rapid tilting, the excess pore
   pressure build-up was significant and ultimately led to bed failure.
   Failure occurred at a plane parallel to the surface of the bed and at a
   depth of 0.4 to 1.5 cm. Linear drained and partially drained shear
   strength envelopes with zero cohesion intercept were defined over the
   vertical stress range of 0 to 1 kPa. The effective friction angles were
   determined to be 40.4 degrees and 40.8 degrees for the 3 and 12 day old
   beds, respectively. For beds of the same thickness and age, the total
   friction angles obtained from partially drained tests were 23.3 degrees
   and 23.8 degrees, respectively. Small variations in total and effective
   friction angles with consolidation time were observed.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotype regulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) is an
   important requirement in both tissue engineering and balloon angioplasty
   strategies. In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that the
   Notch signalling pathway plays a critical role in regulating vascular
   morphogenesis during development and the transcription of differentiated
   VSMC and its maturation. In arteries, Notch3 is the predominant receptor
   on VSMC and, signalling is initiated upon binding to its ligand,
   Jagged1. However, little is known on how ligand presenting strategies
   affect Notch signalling and subsequently upregulation of smooth muscle
   cell differentiation. In this study, using human coronary artery smooth
   muscle cells (HCASMC) and human coronary artery endothelial cells
   (HCAEC), we show several lines of evidence that direct heterocellular
   cell-cell contact is necessary for VSMC differentiation via Notch3
   signalling. First, neither the addition of soluble Jagged1 nor Jagged1
   immobilized to protein G beads induced HCASMC differentiation in
   culture. Second, despite the upregulation of Notch3 expression,
   EC-conditioned medium failed to induce HCASMC differentiation. However,
   when HCASMC and HCAEC were co-cultured either on opposite sides of
   porous membrane or when these cells were co-cultured directly, both
   Notch3 and VSMC differentiation marker proteins were upregulated. These
   upregulations were abrogated by Jagged1-specific siRNA. This study
   provides the first direct evidence that contact of HCASMC and HCAEC is
   required for regulating smooth muscle cell differentiation. These
   findings may have clinical importance and therapeutic potential for
   modulating vascular SMC phenotype during various cardiovascular disease
   states and in tissue engineering. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{21-35}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Machining along continuous circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool
   stoppage and even feed rate variation. This helps particularly in
   high-speed milling by reducing the effect of the machine tool mechanical
   structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity
   of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip
   formation in circular end milling is becoming necessary for accurate
   kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper,
   chip formation during circular end milling is studied with a major focus
   on feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness along with their
   analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference
   in the feed per tooth formulation for end milling along linear and
   circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid
   formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in circular end milling is
   derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory with a wide
   range of the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations
   encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach
   to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of
   undeformed chip thickness are validated with results of numerical
   simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular end milling and
   also compared to the linear end milling. The close resemblance between
   analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed chip thickness
   in circular end milling suggests validity of the proposed analytical
   formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in circular end
   milling are calculated based on the derived chip thickness formulations
   and an existing mechanistic model. The calculation results reiterate the
   need of taking into account adjusted feed per tooth and valid chip
   thickness formulations in circular end milling, especially for small
   tool-path radii, for more realistic process modeling.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, modeling and control system design of a three-phase VSC
   system are investigated. The linear model and the control design are
   developed in the stationary-frame. The model shows a highly coupled
   system along alpha and beta coordinates when using a Delta-Y transformer
   vs. two completely decoupled subsystems in the case of Y-Y transformer.
   This issue was often overlooked in literature. The developed model
   includes the phase shift caused by the Delta-Y transformer to address
   its effect on the steady-state and the dynamic behaviors under balanced
   and unbalanced distorted three phase conditions. Linear state-space
   model of the closed-loop system is developed to study the dynamics and
   stability of the two configurations. Modal analysis shows that the phase
   shift introduced by the Delta-Y configuration can reduce the ultimate
   gain of the open loop system by 62\% as compared to the system
   interfaced using Y-Y configuration. The developed linear model has been
   simulated inMATLAB/SIMULINK and validated using a detailed switching
   model in PSCAD/EMTDC under balanced and unbalanced three-phase
   conditions. The proposed control method can provide fast active and
   reactive power control with a minimum harmonics distortion in the line

Title = {{An optoelectronic sensor for the monitoring of mould growth in concealed
   spaces}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{9-16}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The growth of mould in the indoor environment is an important
   contributor to the development and exacerbation of atopic disease, and
   potentially poses other health risks. Moreover, the detection and
   elimination of mould have resulted in massive remedial expenditures,
   often without clear engineering knowledge of the nature of the moisture
   events that led to the damage, especially for residential light
   wood-frame construction. Relatively little research has considered such
   failure of the building enclosure as a starting point for developing
   practical, evidence-based construction practices to improve building
   performance. One research limitation concerns the use of invasive or
   destructive testing as the sole means to monitor mould growth in
   concealed assemblies, such as wall cavities, making it difficult or
   impossible to conduct time-course experiments to assess the performance
   of different materials and designs. The present paper concerns the
   development and testing of a new optoelectronic sensor capable of
   non-invasive monitoring of mould growth in concealed spaces in real-time
   by measuring changes in light reflectance from the sensor's active
   element, a membrane impregnated with mould spores. It builds upon an
   earlier concept {[}1] in which mould-impregnated cellophane coupons were
   attached to building surfaces, then removed and examined periodically
   for growth by microscopy. The new device incorporates
   computer-controlled measurement of mould growth, in response to the
   environmental conditions and, thus, functions as a remote sensor.
   Although primarily intended for research use, the device has the
   potential to be used as a post-remediation monitoring device to provide
   early-warning of any re-occurrence of mould growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A new class of nanoengineered partial oxidation catalyst has been
   prepared through the use of chemical vapor deposition of a vanadium
   oxide precursor over a highly ordered TiO2 nanotube array. A battery of
   characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD) together
   with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS), Raman, and DRS-UV/vis indicate that the vanadia
   species are extremely well dispersed onto the surface of the nanotube
   array. Studies of the catalytic activity of this material were performed
   using the partial oxidation of ethanol as a probe reaction and compared
   with those obtained using typical P-25 TiO2 powdered support. Results
   showed that the nanoengineered approach to catalyst fabrication leads to
   a highly active catalytic material where most of the vanadium oxide
   phase is located on the surface and accessible for catalysis. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Nanoflower-like and nanoparticle spinel Li4Ti5O12 were synthesized by a
   microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MH) method following calcination.
   As-prepared Li4Ti5O12 was characterized by scanning electron microscopy,

   voltammetry. The nanoflower-like and nanoparticle Li4Ti5O12 exhibited
   discharge capacities of 176.7 and 109.8 mAh g(-1), respectively, for the
   first cycle, and maintained reversible capacities of 38.4 and 91.7 mAh
   g(-1), respectively, at a 1.1 C-rate (200 mA g(-1)) after 100 cycles.
   The better performance of nanoflower-like Li4Ti5O12 relative to
   nanoparticle Li4Ti5O12 is attributed to the larger specific surface area
   and shorter Li+ diffusion path of the former relative to the latter. The
   MH preparation process is straightforward and fast; thus it shows
   promise for widespread lithium ion battery applications. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The behavior of cells responsible for bone formation, osseointegration,
   and bone bonding in vivo are governed by both the surface chemistry and
   topography of scaffold matrices. Bone-like apatite coatings represent a
   promising method to improve the osteoconductivity and bonding of
   synthetic scaffold materials to mineralized tissues for regenerative
   procedures in orthopedics and dentistry. Polycaprolactone (PCL) films
   were coated with calcium phosphates (CaP) by incubation in simulated
   body fluid (SBF). We investigated the effect of SBF ion concentration
   and soaking time on the surface properties of the resulting apatite
   coatings. CaP coatings were examined by scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
   (FTIR), and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). Young's modulus
   (E-s) was determined by nanoindentation, and surface roughness was
   assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and mechanical stylus
   profilometry. CaP such as carbonate-substituted apatite were deposited
   onto PCL films. SEM and AFM images of the apatite coatings revealed an
   increase in topographical complexity and surface roughness with
   increasing ion concentration of SBF solutions. Young's moduli (E-s) of
   various CaP coatings were not significantly different, regardless of the
   CaP phase or surface roughness. Thus, SBF with high ion concentrations
   may be used to coat synthetic polymers with CaP layers of different
   surface topography and roughness to improve the osteoconductivity and
   bone-bonding ability of the scaffold.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change may affect magnitude and frequency of regional extreme
   events with possibility of serious impacts on the existing
   infrastructure systems. This study investigates how the current spatial
   and temporal variations of extreme events are affected by climate change
   in the Upper Thames River basin, Ontario, Canada. A weather generator
   model is implemented to obtain daily time series of three climate
   variables for two future climate scenarios. The daily time series are
   disaggregated into hourly to capture characteristics of intense and
   rapidly changing storms. The maximum annual precipitation events for
   five short durations, 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, and 72-h durations, at each
   station are extracted from the generated hourly data. The frequency and
   seasonality analyses are conducted to investigate the temporal and
   spatial variability of extreme precipitation events corresponding to
   each duration. In addition, this study investigates the impacts of
   increase in temperature using reliability, resilience, and
   vulnerability. The results indicate that the extreme precipitation
   events under climate change will occur earlier than in the past. In
   addition, episodes of extremely high temperature may last longer up to
   19.7\% than under the no-change climate scenario. This study points out
   that the revision of the design storms (e.g. 100- or 250-year return
   period) is warranted for the west and the south east region of the
   basin. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Tidal influence on seawater intrusion in unconfined coastal aquifers}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Studies of seawater intrusion in unconfined coastal aquifers typically
   neglect oceanic oscillations such as tides and assume a static seaward
   boundary condition defined by the mean sea level. Laboratory experiments
   and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the influence of
   tidal oscillations on the behavior of the saltwater wedge. For the
   conditions examined, the experiments showed that an upper saline plume
   formed in the intertidal zone due to tide-induced seawater circulation.
   The presence of the upper saline plume shifted the fresh groundwater
   discharge zone seaward to the low-tide mark and restricted the intrusion
   of the saltwater wedge. The overall seawater intrusion extent, as
   indicated by the wedge toe location, was reduced significantly compared
   with the nontidal (static) case. Results from the numerical model
   matched these experimental observations and further demonstrated the
   similar type of tidal influence on the saltwater wedge in a field-scale
   aquifer system. The Glover (1959) solution for predicting the saltwater
   wedge was modified to account for the tidal effect by including the
   tide-induced circulation as a ``recharge{''} to the aquifer. The
   findings highlight the significant impact of the tide in modulating the
   groundwater behavior and salt-freshwater dynamics, not only within but
   also landward of the intertidal zone.}},

Abstract = {{Tensegrity mechanisms are interesting candidates for high-acceleration
   robotic applications since their use of cables allows for a reduction in
   the weight and inertia of their mobile parts. In this work, a planar
   two-degree-of-freedom translational tensegrity mechanism that could be
   used for pick and place applications is introduced. The mechanism uses a
   strategic actuation scheme to generate the translational motion as well
   as to ensure that the cables remain taut at all times. Analytical
   solutions to the direct and inverse kinematic problems are developed,
   and the mechanism's workspace boundaries are computed in both the
   actuator and Cartesian spaces. The influence of the mechanism's geometry
   on the size and shape of the Cartesian workspace are then studied. Based
   on workspace size only, it is found that the optimal mechanism geometry
   corresponds to a relatively large ratio between the length of the struts

Abstract = {{The utilization of multiple antennas and space-time codes in
   multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems
   significantly improves the transmission channel capacity without using
   additional bandwidth and power. The improvement is achieved by
   decomposing the spatial structure of transmission channels and
   performing appropriate temporal and spatial multiplexing. In this paper,
   we propose a novel theoretical framework for MIMO channel modeling and
   characterization in order to facilitate the MIMO system design and
   performance evaluation. The channels are represented in space, time,
   wave vector, and frequency domains while the space-time and wave
   vector-frequency interdependences are considered. A realization of the
   theoretical framework, in a form of a practical framework, is also
   proposed to address the channel modeling and characterization at both
   transmitter and receiver sides. The utilization of the practical
   framework in MIMO communication system design is discussed to illustrate
   its applications in realistic scenarios. The angle of arrival estimation
   based on the proposed practical framework using field test measurement
   data is also presented as illustrative examples.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional lung tumor segmentation from x-ray computed tomography
   using sparse field active models}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Manual segmentation of lung tumors is observer dependent and
   time-consuming but an important component of radiology and radiation
   oncology workflow. The objective of this study was to generate an
   automated lung tumor measurement tool for segmentation of pulmonary
   metastatic tumors from x-ray computed tomography (CT) images to improve
   reproducibility and decrease the time required to segment tumor
   boundaries.
   Methods: The authors developed an automated lung tumor segmentation
   algorithm for volumetric image analysis of chest CT images using shape
   constrained Otsu multithresholding (SCOMT) and sparse field active
   surface (SFAS) algorithms. The observer was required to select the tumor
   center and the SCOMT algorithm subsequently created an initial surface
   that was deformed using level set SFAS to minimize the total energy
   consisting of mean separation, edge, partial volume, rolling,
   distribution, background, shape, volume, smoothness, and curvature
   energies.
   Results: The proposed segmentation algorithm was compared to manual
   segmentation whereby 21 tumors were evaluated using one-dimensional (1D)
   response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), two-dimensional
   (2D) World Health Organization (WHO), and 3D volume measurements. Linear
   regression goodness-of-fit measures (r(2) = 0.63, p<0.0001; r(2) = 0.87,
   p<0.0001; and r(2) = 0.96, p<0.0001), and Pearson correlation
   coefficients (r = 0.79, p<0.0001; r = 0.93, p<0.0001; and r = 0.98,
   p<0.0001) for 1D, 2D, and 3D measurements, respectively, showed
   significant correlations between manual and algorithm results.
   Intra-observer intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) demonstrated
   high reproducibility for algorithm (0.989-0.995, 0.996-0.997, and
   0.999-0.999) and manual measurements (0.975-0.993, 0.985-0.993, and
   0.980-0.992) for 1D, 2D, and 3D measurements, respectively. The
   intra-observer coefficient of variation (CV\%) was low for algorithm
   (3.09\%-4.67\%, 4.85\%-5.84\%, and 5.65\%-5.88\%) and manual observers
   (4.20\%-6.61\%, 8.14\%-9.57\%, and 14.57\%-21.61\%) for 1D, 2D, and 3D
   measurements, respectively.
   Conclusions: The authors developed an automated segmentation algorithm
   requiring only that the operator select the tumor to measure pulmonary
   metastatic tumors in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Algorithm and manual measurements
   were significantly correlated. Since the algorithm segmentation involves
   selection of a single seed point, it resulted in reduced intra-observer
   variability and decreased time, for making the measurements. (C) 2012

Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{We apply Frequency-domain Waveform Tomography to form quantitative,
   high-resolution P-wave velocity images of a megasplay fault system
   within the central Nankai subduction zone offshore of southwest Japan,
   using controlled source Ocean Bottom Seismometer (OBS) data originally
   acquired in 2004. The Waveform Tomography method exploits recorded
   seismic waveforms beyond their first arrivals, and thus achieves a much
   higher resolution (of the order of a wavelength) than that of
   conventional Traveltime Tomography methods. Frequency-domain Waveform
   Tomography facilitates a multi-scale approach to stabilize the
   inversion, in which initial Traveltime Tomography results are
   sequentially improved on by first fitting low frequency components of
   the seismic records (starting at 2.25 Hz): higher frequency components
   (up to 8.5 Hz) are then introduced progressively.
   Our final Waveform Tomography image allows velocity anomalies as small
   as 700 m (horizontally) and 350 m (vertically) to be discerned and
   interpreted, as confirmed by checkerboard modeling tests. The improved
   explanatory power of the final images is verified by observing that
   synthetic waveforms calculated from the final results yield much better
   fit to the observed waveforms than those estimated from the original
   Traveltime Tomography image. Apparent lithological boundaries from
   Waveform Tomography agree well with corresponding reflections on seismic
   migration images, providing further confidence in the validity of the
   results. The megasplay fault is evident on the final Waveform Tomography
   image as a sharp velocity discontinuity, delineating the upper surface
   of a velocity reduction of nearly 1 km/s with respect to the regional 1D
   velocity trend.
   The megasplay fault can be traced continuously throughout the entire
   image, from a nearly horizontal section at the landward extent, moving
   seaward through to a steeper angle penetrating the old accretionary
   prisms, with several additional splays appearing to branch in the
   shallow subsurface. The location of the low-velocity zones imaged by our
   waveform tomography method coincides with two-previously-identified low
   velocity zones. The image reveals a low velocity zone that is continuous
   from deeper to shallower portions of the subsurface, suggesting that
   pore-fluids may be transported from the inner wedge, to the transition
   zone, and to the surface, through fluid conduits associated with the
   megasplay fault system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of the interfacial magnetization dynamics of a magnonic
   crystal comprising alternating, contacting cobalt and Permalloy
   nanostripes is reported. Recently measured spin-wave dispersion data of
   the crystal in its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases are
   interpreted in terms of the effective spin pinning at its
   cobalt-Permalloy interfaces based on generalized Guslienko-Slavin
   boundary conditions. Calculations using a macroscopic theory well
   reproduce the experimental data. Numerically generated mode profiles
   reveal considerable effective pinnings at the interfaces. The obtained
   pinning parameters have values significantly larger than the values
   calculated at the lateral edges of individual stripes, suggesting that
   the strong interfacial coupling, reported in our previous study,
   contributes significantly to the effective pinning at the interfaces
   between adjacent stripes. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{SAPO-34 zeolite-like particles were successfully synthesized at high
   temperature environment. An L9 orthogonal array of the Taguchi method
   was implemented to investigate the effects of experimental conditions to
   prepare SAPO-34 with respect to crystallinity of the final product
   phase. The results showed that the favorable phase crystallinity was
   improved by increasing the hydrothermal synthesis temperature and
   organic template content, whereas increasing the water content in
   synthesis mixture decreased the crystallinity. No significant changes in
   crystallinity of the final products were observed by increasing the
   synthesis duration. In addition, zeolite SAPO-5, which was formed as the
   impurity in the mid temperature runs, was not be formed at high
   temperature environment due to its low hydrothermal stability. (C) 2011

Title = {{The study of stress application and corrosion cracking on Ni-16 Cr-9 Fe

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Microscopic strains associated with stress corrosion cracks have been
   investigated in stressed C-rings of Ni-16 Cr-9 Fe (Alloy 600) boiler
   tubing. Polychromatic X-ray microdiffraction was used to measure
   deviatoric strain tensors and the distribution of dislocations near
   cracks that had been propagated in electrochemically accelerated
   corrosion tests. An associated investigation of the C-ring-induced
   strains prior to corrosion showed significant tensile strain in the
   stress axis direction by the torsional closure of the alloy tube section
   in the C-ring test. Significant grain lattice rotation and pronounced
   plastic strain at some grain boundaries were noted.
   Stress-corrosion-cracking-generated intergranular cracks were produced
   in two Alloy 600 specimens after 6 h and 18 h tests. The diffraction
   patterns and resultant strain tensors were mapped around the cracked
   area to a 1 mu m spatial resolution. The strain tensor transverse to the
   crack growth direction showed tensile strain at the intergranular region
   just ahead of the crack tip for both specimens. Both cracks were found
   to follow grain boundary pathways that had the lowest angle of
   misorientation. Dislocation distributions within each grain were
   qualitatively obtained from the shapes of the diffraction spots and the
   effect of ``hard{''} and ``soft{''} grains on the crack pathway was
   explored for both 6 h and 18 h specimens. The Schmid factor of one of
   the grains adjacent to the crack at the 6 h and 18 h initiation sites
   was found to be the lowest, compared to Schmid factors calculated for
   surface grains away from the initiation site, and also along the crack
   path into the bulk. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{This paper gives an insight of biofuel production and the status -into
   the co-products obtained from this industry. Furthermore this work
   explores the possibility of these co-products as raw materials for
   value-added uses in material applications. This is achieved by
   understanding composition, solid density, and moisture content of
   prominent co-products such as soy meal, DDGS (distillers' dried grains
   with solubles) and jatropha meal. Moisture content and density
   measurements showed no trend. Soy meal has the highest protein content,
   followed by jatropha and DDGS. Thermal stability of these co-products
   was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which revealed that
   the thermal stabilities are ranked as soy meal>DDGS>jatropha meal. FT-IR
   spectroscopy was used to understand the functional groups in these meals
   and it showed that the amide group was prominent in all of these meals.
   In pursuit of finding value-added uses for these co-products of biofuel
   industries, biodegradable polymer, i.e. polycaprolactone (PCL), based
   biocomposites were prepared by melt processing technique using extrusion
   followed by injection molding. Tensile, flexural and impact properties
   were evaluated. Also, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of fractured
   sections of the biocomposites was examined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All
