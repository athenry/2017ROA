Abstract = {{Increasing concerns about food safety have prompted strong interest in
   the development of new pathogen detection technologies. The currently
   used techniques usually rely on specially equipped laboratories and are
   labor-intensive and time-consuming. Microresonator-based biosensors
   incorporating specific biorecognition probes are promising for the
   development of highly sensitive bacterial detection sensors. We present
   an optimized microresonator array platform that uses phage tail-spike
   proteins as a recognition probe. This array is composed of one thousand
   beams in a small area (i.e. 13.5 mm(2) area) and therefore offers large
   surface area for capture of bacteria. These resonators feature a high
   natural frequency due to the optimized beam design, with the first
   resonance frequency at f(0) = 1.095 +/- 0.005 MHz. Theoretical analysis
   of these devices indicates a high mass sensitivity with a threshold for
   the detection of added mass as small as delta m = 52 fg (lighter than a
   single bacterial cell). FEA and the experimental results show that the
   frequency shift is mainly due to the mass loading effect of adsorbed
   bacteria. We have successfully demonstrated the application of these
   arrays for specific detection of Campylobacter jejuni cells after
   immobilization of devices with phage GST-Gp48 tail-spike proteins.
   TSP-functionalized devices did not show any sensitivity to Escherichia
   coli bacteria confirming the specificity of detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The application of nanostructured thin films grown by glancing angle
   deposition (GLAD) to enhance the sensitivity of Love wave liquid sensors
   was investigated. The effect of high-angle GLAD films, with and without
   nanostructure modification by ion milling and clustering, on device
   response was studied. Ion milling was used to prevent clustering of
   individual nanostructured posts, and was compared to films that were
   intentionally clustered. Both sets of modified films were shown to
   eliminate signal losses due to damping from the non-rigid, as-deposited
   posts. Sensitivity enhancement was tested by viscous loading with
   varying mixtures of glycerol and de-ionized water. Frequency shifts were
   found to be non-linear with the square root of the density-viscosity
   product, (rho eta)(1/2), and were modeled with exponentials. The
   sensitivity was shown to increase with film thickness, but decreased
   with increasing values of (rho eta)(1/2). There was also an increase in
   signal loss with film thickness under a liquid environment. The balance
   between sensitivity enhancement and signal loss must be carefully
   optimized with consideration for the intended application. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Deposition of particles in the aerodynamic diameter range of 0.5-6.7 mu
   m was measured in nine replicas of the extrathoracic airways of adults

   breathing and during nebulization therapy. Additionally, deposition of
   micrometer-sized particles in the ``Alberta Idealized Adult Throat,{''}
   which was previously found useful in simulating the average deposition
   of particles during inhalation of constant flow rates, was measured
   during inhalation of the four sinusoidal patterns in this study. To
   reduce intersubject scatter in developing predictive correlations, the
   non-dimensional Reynolds (Re) and Stokes (Stk) numbers are used with the
   square root of the average cross sectional area of the oral airways as
   the characteristic diameter being found to reduce intersubject
   variability to the highest extent. Our best fit to the deposition data

Abstract = {{This study aimed to develop actively targeted liposomal formulations of
   doxorubicin (DOX) using an engineered breast tumor targeting peptide
   ligand, p18-4 (WxEAAYQrFL). Towards this goal, stealth liposomes bearing
   different molar ratios of p18-4 peptide (1.5 and 03 peptide/total lipid
   mol \%), namely HD and LD liposomes, were successfully prepared. The
   effect of p18-4 peptide modification and density on breast cancer cell
   uptake, selective cytotoxicity as well as inhibition of tumor growth and
   the tissue disposition of encapsulated DOX in breast tumor xenograft
   models in mice were assessed. The results showed a 2.4 and 5 folds
   decrease in the IC50 of HD liposomes in MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 breast
   tumor cells, respectively. Although LD liposomes showed less (1.6 and
   2.2 folds) decrease in the IC50 of DOX in the same breast cancer cell
   lines, they were more selective in their cytotoxic effect and uptake
   towards breast cancer over normal breast epithelial cells, MCF10A.
   Evaluation of the anticancer activity in NOD-SCID mice bearing
   MDA-MB-435 xenografts after receiving six i.v. injections of 2.5
   mg/kg/week DOX equivalent showed a superior anticancer activity for LD
   liposomal DOX compared to HD and unmodified liposomal formulations. Mice
   treated with LD liposomal DOX illustrated 4.8 folds reduction in the
   mean relative tumor volume compared to non-targeted DOX liposomes. This
   was despite similar tumor accumulation of DOX as part of LD liposomes
   compared to that for unmodified liposomes 24 h following the last
   injection. In contrast, HD liposomes showed decreased DOX accumulation
   in the tumor and preferential uptake by liver and spleen. Treatment with
   unmodified and LD liposomes did not have any adverse impact on the
   activity level and mean body weight of live animals during the study
   period. In conclusion, surface modification of liposomal DOX with
   engineered p18-4 peptide at an optimum density can improve the antitumor
   efficacy and selectivity of liposomal DOX. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper gives an asymptotic analysis of plane strain deformation and

   the third order, which ensures the strict positivity of the Jacobian
   determinant in the vicinity of the moving crack tip. The derived
   solutions are applied to a specific hyperelastic material for which some
   recent experimental data are available in the literature. The comparison
   with the experimental data showed that the crack-face profile and the
   energy release rate predicted by the present model are in reasonable
   agreement with experiments and several recent finite-strain elastic
   models. In addition, the crack branching angle predicted by the present
   model also agrees well with some known experimental data. All of these

   oscillation detection. An improved DCT-based method is proposed with
   three main modifications, namely, a revised hypothesis test based on the
   confidence interval of coefficient of variation, a fitness index to
   determine a dominant oscillation component, and a hypothesis test on the
   regularity of oscillation magnitudes. These modifications are also
   applicable to other oscillation detection methods in the literature.
   Moreover, an online oscillation detection method is proposed, with a
   mechanism by which the size of a supervision time window is adaptive to
   frequency variation of process variables. Industrial examples are
   provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed methods.

Abstract = {{Tunneling's linearity causes planning complications: at any point, the
   actions that can be taken are determined by previous accomplishments.
   These constraints mean that tunneling projects require careful
   preparation for success. Current planning tools do not address the
   breadth and scope of the variables affecting tunneling and are not
   easily updatable. This paper contributes a real-world case study of the
   practical use of scenario-based simulation analysis for project planning
   and decision support in a CA\$22 million utility tunneling project in
   Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. An integrated simulation-based solution for
   tunnel planning and decision support was created by using modular
   development and a high level architecture (HLA)-inspired communications
   framework. This is a demonstration of a generic yet flexible project
   modeling approach that may be of interest to both practitioners and
   researchers; it incorporates the modeling powers of simulation, appeals
   to a practicing tunneling engineer, and facilitates rapid scenario-based
   planning with swift development. The simulation was built in Simphony.

   welding of dissimilar aluminium alloys is investigated. Sheets of Al
   2024 and Al 6061 alloys are friction stir welded in lap and butt

   with serial sectioning is utilised to systematically study material flow
   when small variations are made to the tool pin. It is shown that three
   flat features on the pin impose vertical material flow which can promote
   intermixing. When a threaded tool is used, the material flow and
   formation of the intermixed region depends on the orientation of the
   base materials, since the differences in viscosity of material on the
   advancing versus retreating side of the tool will inhibit intermixing.
   Decreasing the travel speed will promote intermixing by increasing the
   residence time to compensate for the differences in material viscosity
   that otherwise limit intermixing.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Industrial projects are constructed in the form of prefabricated modules
   that are transported to sites for installation, a process which enhances
   efficiency and productivity. As these prefabricated modules become
   heavier, proper lift planning is essential for onsite efficiency and
   safety. One aspect of the heavy lift study is to check the path
   feasibility for specific lifted modules. Current practice in path
   checking process is tedious and prone to errors. This paper proposes a
   generic method for mobile crane lifting binary (yes-or-no) path
   checking. The methodology calculates the minimum and maximum crane lift
   radii based on capacity and the crane's configuration, which are then
   modified considering site constraints. The modules' erection orders are
   also taken into consideration, and a configuration space approach is
   used to simplify the work space. The modified radii and simplified work
   space are merged with the lifted module pick area for path checking. The
   methodology is incorporated into a computer module for automatic
   calculation and visualization. A case study involving an industrial
   project is provided for validation and to highlight the designed
   computer module's essential features. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published

Abstract = {{Cranes maintain a central role in construction projects, and tower
   cranes are one of the major equipment used in the construction of

   crane with two jibs that operates using propellers mounted at the end of
   each jib to improve the performance of crane operations. This paper
   presents a methodology to quantify and assess the environmental

Abstract = {{In this article, a novel miniaturised dual-wideband bandpass filter
   (DWB-BPF) based on two different resonators including a quasi-spiral
   loaded multiple-mode resonator (QSL-MMR) and L-shaped transmission line
   (LS-TL) is presented. At the first step, in order to design a single
   wideband BPF filter with controllable transmission zeros near the centre
   frequency, the open circuit impedance parameter of quasi-spiral loaded
   resonator Z21 is determined in terms of ABCD matrix. Then an equivalent
   circuit model of the proposed structure is derived and the impedance
   characteristic and electrical length of LS-TLs to achieve a DWB-BPF with
   excellent selectivity are calculated through even- and odd-mode
   analysis. The proposed filter possesses both compact and simple
   structure as well as two wide passbands with fractional bandwidth (FBW)
   of 70\% and 22.8\% for its first and second passbands, respectively. The
   proposed technique creates two transmission zeros at the lower and upper
   stopbands of each passband resulting in a very sharp roll-off
   accompanied by a wide stopband. Notably, the circuit size is reduced and
   the bandwidth is enhanced in comparison with its conventional
   counterparts. The theoretical performance of the filter is verified by
   the experimental one where a good agreement is reported between them.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In many industrial environments like manufacturing systems, military
   equipments, power generation systems, etc., system maintenance is
   performed between successive missions. Different maintenance options (do
   nothing, minimal repair, preventive maintenance options or system
   overhaul, etc.) are possible for components in the system. However, it
   may not be feasible to do all possible maintenance actions during the
   maintenance break. Hence, optimal maintenance decision is required such
   that available resources are optimally used to maximize the next mission
   reliability. In this paper, a mathematical model is used to help in
   decision making for selective maintenance under imperfect repair. The
   level of maintenance actions determines the improvement in the component
   health. A model is formulated to relate the amount of resources used for
   maintenance to the level of imperfect repair. Further, a characteristic
   constant is used which determines the component response to resource
   consumed by a maintenance task. Selective maintenance model is
   formulated and illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the
   applicability and advantages of the proposed method. The results show
   that introduction of imperfect repair facilitates better allocation of

Abstract = {{Single-phase grid-connected converters are widely used in many
   applications such as photovoltaics, fuel cells, active power filters,
   etc. An important topic for the development of their control schemes is
   ac signal detection, such as grid phase detection for grid-interfacing
   inverters, and harmonic detection for harmonic compensation devices.
   Since only one signal is available, the task is more difficult than in
   three-phase systems. Among the existing methods, the frequency-domain
   ones are known to have a one-cycle delay and heavier computational
   burden. Meanwhile, the time-domain methods often rely on phase-locked
   loop, quadrature signal generation, and complex filtering techniques;
   the resulted multiple-looped system may suffer from slow transients and
   stability issues. This paper proposes a new detection method based on
   anticonjugate harmonic decomposition and cascaded delayed signal
   cancellation. The method uses constant zero as the quadrature signal,
   and has a completely open-looped structure. The resulted detection
   system is very simple and robust. The fundamental and harmonic detection
   transients can be as short as 0.47 cycle in most cases, or 1.5 cycles
   for cases with considerable frequency variations. Meanwhile, zero

Title = {{Hybrid Voltage and Current Control Approach for DG-Grid Interfacing

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid voltage and current control method to
   improve the performance of interfacing converters in distributed
   generation (DG) units. In general, current-controlled methods have been
   widely adopted in grid-connected converters nowadays. Nevertheless, in
   an islanded system, the voltage control of DG units is desired to
   provide direct voltage support to the loads. Due to the absence of
   closed-loop line current controller, the voltage control scheme can
   hardly regulate the DG unit's line current harmonics. Furthermore, if
   not addressed properly, the transfer between the grid-connected
   operation and autonomous islanding operation will introduce nontrivial
   transient currents. To overcome the drawbacks of voltage-and
   current-controlled DG units, this paper develops a hybrid voltage and
   current control method (HCM). The proposed method allows the coordinated
   closed-loop control of the DG unit fundamental voltage and line harmonic
   currents. With the HCM, local harmonic loads of the DG unit can even be
   compensated without using harmonic current extraction. In addition, the
   HCM guarantees smooth transition during the grid-connected/islanding
   operation mode transfer. Simulated and experimental results are provided
   to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{A predictive correlation relating isobaric liquid specific heat capacity
   to absolute temperature and elemental composition was recently reported.
   The Dadgostar-Shaw correlation, valid where C-V >> T(partial derivative
   V/partial derivative T)(P)(partial derivative P/partial derivative
   T)(V), is modified in the present work to accommodate the critical
   region and the consequent variation of liquid phase isobaric heat
   capacity among isomers at the same absolute temperature. The results
   obtained for a training data set and a test data set are presented and
   compared with results obtained with the Dadgostar-Shaw correlation, and
   two variants of the Rowlinson-Bondi correlation. The C-p(o) contribution
   is calculated using either compound specific correlations or the
   predictive universal Lastovka-Shaw equation for ideal gases. For pure
   hydrocarbon liquids where compound specific C-p(o) correlations, T-c and
   omega are available, the Rowlinson-Bondi based approach should be used
   to compute saturated liquid heat capacities. If only T-c and omega are
   available, the Rowlinson-Bondi based approach + the predictive
   Lastovka-Shaw equation for C-p(o) values is preferred. If the liquid is
   a multicomponent or ill-defined hydrocarbon liquid, the modified
   Dadgostar-Shaw correlation is preferred over the Dadgostar correlation
   as long as T-c is available or can be estimated. The accuracy penalty
   for use of the modified Dadgostar-Shaw correlation appears small
   relative to either Rowlinson-Bondi based calculation approaches. (C)

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{229}},

Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a design methodology of polynomial
   function-based Neural Network (pf-NN) classifiers (predictors). The
   essential design components include Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) regarded as a
   generic clustering algorithm and polynomials providing all required
   nonlinear capabilities of the model. The learning method uses a weighted
   cost function (objective function) while to analyze the performance of
   the system we engage a standard receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
   analysis. The proposed networks are used to detect software defects.
   From the conceptual standpoint, the classifier of this form can be
   expressed as a collection of ``if-then{''} rules. Fuzzy clustering
   (Fuzzy C-Means, FCM) is aimed at the development of premise layer of the
   rules while the corresponding consequences of the rules are formed by
   some local polynomials. A detailed learning algorithm for the pf-NNs is
   presented with particular provisions made for dealing with imbalanced
   classes encountered quite commonly in software quality problems. The use
   of simple measures such as accuracy of classification becomes
   questionable. In the assessment of quality of classifiers, we confine
   ourselves to the use of the area under curve (AUC) in the receiver
   operating characteristics (ROCs) analysis. AUC comes as a sound
   classifier metric capturing a tradeoff between the high true positive
   rate (TP) and the low false positive rate (FP). The performance of the
   proposed classifier is contrasted with the results produced by some
   ``standard{''} Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for multi-scale modelling using
   pre-computed data for the small scales. By pre-computing the required
   data at the micro- and meso-scales and storing them in a look-up table,
   these small-scale effects can be captured in a macro-scale model that
   executes with practicable execution times. The methodology is presented
   in the context of modelling a washcoated monolith reactor for the
   catalytic combustion of methane using a detailed multistep mechanistic
   model. The modelling is illustrated as a sequence of steps of increasing
   model simplification. In the first instance, only the reaction rates are
   pre-computed. Then the washcoat diffusion is included using a 2D
   axisymmetric model with a washcoat of uniform thickness, then with a
   non-symmetrical channel with a washcoat of non-uniform thickness. It is
   shown how a simple 1D single channel model can accurately account for
   the presence of a non-uniform washcoat. Finally, the external transport
   resistance is included in the pre-computation step, and it is shown that
   a simple one dimensional pseudo-homogeneous single channel model can be
   used provided the effective average rates are appropriately calculated.
   Execution times are shown to decrease by several orders of magnitude at
   minimal loss of solution accuracy. The use of pre-computed data allows
   for the inclusion of complex heat and mass transfer phenomena, as well
   as complex kinetics in full scale converter models at relatively small
   computational cost. The implementation of look-up tables into full scale
   CFD models is described, and optimal strategies proposed. (c) 2013

Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a robust moving horizon estimation scheme augmented by an
   auxiliary nonlinear observer is proposed for nonlinear systems with
   bounded model uncertainties. Specifically, an auxiliary deterministic
   nonlinear observer that asymptotically tracks nominal system state is
   taken advantage of to calculate a confidence region that contains the
   actual system state taking into account the effects of bounded model
   uncertainties at every sampling time. This region is then used to design
   a constraint on the state estimates in the proposed moving horizon
   estimation. The proposed design brings together deterministic and
   optimization-based observer design techniques. First, the proposed
   moving horizon estimation scheme is proved to give bounded estimation
   errors in the case of bounded model uncertainties. Second, the proposed
   approach provides another option to compromise the effects of errors in
   arrival cost approximations and can be used together with different
   arrival cost approximation techniques to further improve the state
   estimate. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach
   is demonstrated through the application to two chemical process
   examples. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Online monitoring of an ultraviolet (UV) facility not only can ensure
   disinfection efficiency, but also conserve energy. In this work, a
   tri-parameter online monitoring system was developed by using three
   micro-fluorescent silica detectors (MFSDs) installed into a UV
   disinfection reactor. The detector signals were computed by
   theoretically derived mathematical equations to determine three key
   operational parameters: the lamp output attenuation coefficient (N),
   water UV transmittance (T), and quartz sleeve fouling coefficient (F).
   Results indicate that the N, T and F parameters could be monitored well
   by the MFSDs. The monitored lamp output exhibited a significant
   dependence on water temperature; the monitored water transmittance was
   verified by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer; and the monitored sleeve fouling
   coefficient decreased from 1.00 to 0.66 after an 18-day operation with a
   synthetic hard water. A long-term 30-day experiment, where the UV
   reactor was directly connected to a tap water faucet to simulate
   practical conditions, demonstrated the good applicability of the
   developed monitoring system. This monitoring system in real time can be
   used to adjust the number of operating lamp modules, alarm any
   accidental breakdown of the lamps, and trigger auto-cleaning of the
   quartz sleeves, thus having potential applications to open-channel and
   enclosed UV disinfection facilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The dense geomorphic clinoptilolite membranes reported in our previous
   work {[}1] were chemically modified by cation exchange with groups IA
   (Li+, Na+ and K+) and IIA (Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+) metal ions. It was found
   that hydrogen and CO2 permeances through the modified membranes were
   very sensitive to the type, size and charge of the extra-framework
   cations. H-2 permeance through the clinoptilolite membranes decreased as
   the exchanged cation size increased and was correlated to the channel
   blockage by the exchanged cations. CO2 permeance was more related to the
   chemical properties of the exchanged cations than their sizes.
   Significant improvements of H-2/CO2 selectivity from 5.8 to 34 and 5.8
   to 13 for the Li and Ca exchanged forms of geomorphic clinoptilolite
   membranes respectively were obtained at the high temperature of 300
   degrees C. Strong temperature dependence of H-2 and CO2 permeances
   observed with these two ion-exchanged membranes suggests activated
   diffusion of H-2 and CO2 through the membrane. The high H-2/CO2
   selectivity for Ca and Li ion-exchanged membranes might be predominantly
   attributed to the suppression of CO2 adsorption and the clinoptilolite
   framework structure changes due to the high ionic potential of the extra
   framework cations (Li and Ca) during the thermal dehydration process.

Abstract = {{Polymers offer many advantageous physical properties as structural
   materials for MEMS and microfluidics. Additionally, polymers support
   rapid and inexpensive fabrication methods. Patterning metals on polymer
   microstructures is, however, much more challenging than doing so on
   conventional substrates such as silicon or glass. As a result, metal
   layers within polymeric devices are typically fabricated on
   non-polymeric substrates, and the polymer layers are then fabricated on
   top, which greatly constrains the variety of structures that can be
   built. A wider range of devices could be fabricated if there was a
   reliable method for producing and patterning stable metal films on a
   photo-polymer. Lab-on-chip (LOC) systems in particular would benefit
   from low-cost, corrosion-resistant, thermally stable metal films
   embedded in polymer structures. To date, however, there have been no
   demonstrations that combine all of these characteristics. We present
   here a method for patterning a film of aluminum on the photopolymer KMPR
   and treating the film to stabilize its resistivity. We demonstrate the
   production and stability of the films and demonstrate that they are
   suitable for use as heaters and/or temperature sensors at temperatures
   up to 165 degrees C - well beyond the required temperatures for mainstay
   LOC functions such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). (C) 2013

Title = {{Microstructure evolution in undercooled Al-8 wt\%Fe melts: Comparison
   between terrestrial and parabolic flight conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{556}},
Pages = {{243-251}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Al-8 wt\%Fe, a hypereutectic alloy, was studied under electromagnetic
   levitation (EML) solidification conditions in both terrestrial and
   reduced gravity conditions. The latter was carried out on the A300
   aircraft using the TEMPUS facility. The solidified samples were
   characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction techniques. The
   results are interpreted in the light of the temperature-time
   measurements taken in situ during the solidification process in the EML.
   It is shown that both samples experienced some undercooling for the
   solidification of the primary Al-Fe intermetallic phase, which is likely
   AlmFe. The solidification path continues with the nucleation and growth
   of Al13Fe4 followed by primary alpha-Al. These last two phases do not
   seem to show any measureable undercooling and recalescence events.
   Finally, the metastable AlxFe (where x = 5) nucleates starting with the
   formation of eutectic. This metastable intermetallic continues the
   eutectic growth as Al13Fe4. The morphology differences of the
   intermetallics growing under terrestrial and reduced gravity conditions
   are clear with acicular morphology for the former and a star like
   morphology for the latter. The primary alpha-Al has a clear strong
   textured structure in the reduced gravity sample, while a weak one is
   observed in the terrestrially processed sample. The difference in
   texture is attributed to the weaker fluid flow occurring in the droplet
   under reduced gravity conditions while the difference in the morphology
   of the primary intermetallic is attributed to the higher cooling rate
   experienced by the reduced gravity sample compared to that for the
   terrestrially processed sample. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of salt, water, and temperature on the cross-linking of
   peptones with glutaraldehyde were studied. At low reaction temperatures,
   amine groups from peptones form Schiff bases with carbonyl groups of
   glutaraldehyde. The resulting C=N bond is weak and can be easily broken
   by heat or dissolution in water. As the reaction temperature is
   increased, the more stable C-N bond is formed. A network with low water
   solubility and significantly improved thermal stability is produced. The
   presence of salt (sodium chloride) increases the miscibility of peptones
   and glutaraldehyde solution but also increases the water solubility of
   the final product. The presence of water also has a dual effect. Water
   acts as a medium to disperse peptones into glutaraldehyde and is also a
   hydrogen source to drive the reaction forward. However, water is a
   byproduct of the reaction. Its presence suppresses the reaction from the
   standpoint of thermodynamic equilibrium, and it must therefore be driven
   off (by heat).}},

Abstract = {{One of the major issues in current oil sands waste management is the
   lack of a direct link between long-term mine plans and the quantity of
   the tailings produced downstream. This research is focused on developing
   a link between the oil sands' long-term mine plans and the final
   composite tailings (CT) produced downstream. The objective is to assist
   in making the oil sands production process comply with the regulations
   set by the Alberta Energy Resources and Conservation Board (Directive
   074). A series of mass-balance relations between the ore tonnage and the
   final CT tonnage was developed. This was followed by implementing the
   mass-balance relations with a case study and reporting the CT production
   schedule from the long-term mine plan. To capture the uncertainties
   associated with the CT production process, a stochastic simulation model
   was developed. Finally, sensitivity analysis was carried out to capture
   the sensitivity of the CT tonnages produced to the fluctuations of the
   stochastic input variables. The link between the long-term mine schedule
   and tailings management plan helps mine planners to set a dyke
   construction schedule and raise the dyke height in each period in
   accordance with the volume of tailings produced. This research
   illustrates the uncertainties associated with the amount of CT produced
   over the mine life. Understanding these uncertainties will lead to
   improved and sustainable mining and waste management practices in oil
   sands mining industry.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research is to study how management system
   standards can be integrated into a single system in organisations from
   the chemical industry. Data for this study include a survey carried out
   in 76 organisations, registered with, at a minimum, both the ISO 9001
   and ISO 14001 standards for quality and environmental management, 17 of
   which were from the chemical industry. Additionally, six case studies
   are illustrated, revealing the process of integration of three chemical
   and three non-chemical organisations. The first conclusion to be drawn
   from this study is that organisations seem to prefer integration over
   keeping their management systems (MSs) separated, with these MSs
   evolving towards a state of complete integration. Although there are no
   significant differences between chemical and non-chemical firms
   regarding the benefits and difficulties of integration, the interviews
   and survey answers illustrated a number of benefits experienced by the
   companies from operating one integrated system, such as synergism
   promotion and cost savings for the firm, as well as a reduction of the
   time spent when managing the systems. However, some difficulties, such
   as the lack of human resources and the lack of employees' motivation,
   also arose during the integration process.}},

Abstract = {{The sub-zero treatment can improve mechanical properties and wear
   resistance of many metallic materials and the improvement is largely
   affected by the sub-zero treatment condition. In this study, samples of
   W9Mo3Cr4V (W9) high speed steel (HSS) were treated at various sub-zero
   temperatures before and after tempering, respectively. The main
   objective of this work is to investigate the effect of the sub-zero
   treatment condition on mechanical properties and wear resistance of the
   W9 HSS and correlate it to variations in microstructure. Microstructures
   of the treated samples were characterized with electron microscopy (SEM
   and TEM), and corresponding properties, including hardness, impact
   toughness and wear resistance, were evaluated. It was demonstrated that
   the mechanical properties of the cryogenically treated samples were
   superior to those of conventionally treated ones. The cryogenically
   treated samples with subsequent tempering performed better than
   cryogenically treated samples that experienced prior tempering. The
   lower temperatures for sub-zero treatment were more effective in
   improving the mechanical properties. The life of W9 HSS taps in cutting
   30CrMnTi steel was assessed, which showed a trend similar to that
   observed during wear testing. Efforts are made to clarify possible
   mechanisms responsible for the improvements. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide corrosion is one of the important degradation mechanism
   for carbon steel pipelines in the oil sands, oil and gas industries.
   Such type of corrosion has attracted considerable attention due to the
   increased tendency to inject CO2 into oil wells to reduce the viscosity
   of oil for increased production. When erosion is involved, the synergy
   of corrosion and erosion can significantly accelerate the failure of
   steel pipelines. It has been noticed that CO2 corrosion of carbon steel
   is influenced by the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in solution. Since
   DO level in the sections of pipeline at distance from inlets can be
   considerably lowered due to the oxidation of substances in the
   transported solutions, the damage to pipelines caused by
   erosion-corrosion varies in different sections. In this study,
   erosion-corrosion of a pipeline steel (X65) in aqueous slurries
   containing silica sand and CO2 at different dissolved oxygen (DO) levels
   was investigated. It was demonstrated that the damage to the steel was
   increased when CO2 was blown into the slurry. However, when CO2 was
   blown at a much higher pressure, which significantly reduced the DO
   level of the slurry, the weight loss was lower than that in open air
   without CO2, indicating that the dissolved oxygen considerably enhanced
   the CO2 corrosion and the erosion-corrosion synergy. Thus, CO2 could
   play a more destructive role in the vicinity of pipeline inlets.
   Besides, the destructive effect of CO2 on the steel was stronger at
   lower slurry velocities. Efforts were made to clarify relevant
   mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, Mg-3Al-1Zn alloys containing small amounts of yttrium (<4

   of as-cast alloys in a 3.5\% NaCl solution was investigated by
   electrochemical polarization testing and their corrosive wear
   resistances in the same solution were evaluated using a pin-on-disc
   tester. Microstructures and worn surfaces of the alloys were examined
   using scanning electron microscopy. It was demonstrated that that adding
   yttrium in Mg-3Al-1Zn alloy introduced Al2Y precipitates and minimized
   the precipitation of Mg17Al12 phase with refined microstructure. The
   wear resistance of Mg-3Al-1Zn alloy was improved when yttrium was added
   due to the formation of uniformly distributed finer and harder Al2Y
   precipitates. The yttrium addition to Mg-3Al-1Zn alloy also enhanced the
   corrosion resistance, since the galvanic effect of finer and dispersed
   Al2Y precipitates was weaker than that of the coarse Mg17Al12 particles
   and their network. The combination of improved strength and corrosion
   resistance resulting from the Y addition increased the corrosive wear
   resistance of the material. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Low-carbon steel with pearlite-ferrite microstructure has been
   extensively used for oil sands slurry transport. As expected, the carbon
   concentration strongly affects the performance of the steel, which is
   largely attributed to the volume fraction ratio of pearlite to ferrite
   that is governed by the carbon concentration. However, it is often
   noticed in experiments that even a small change in the carbon
   concentration could lead to considerable difference in the erosion
   resistance. Thus, more detailed studies are needed to clarify the
   mechanism responsible for such observed difference in order to tailor
   low-carbon steel more effectively. In this study, using a micro-scale
   dynamic model (MSDM) we conducted computational modeling to investigate
   effects of the volume fraction ratio of pearlite to ferrite and the
   orientation of lamellar cementite on the erosion resistance of
   low-carbon steel in order to better understand the effect of
   microstructure features on the performance of the steel. It was
   demonstrated that the performance of horizontally aligned cementite
   plates (i.e. parallel to sample surface) was inferior to that of
   vertically aligned ones. Higher fraction ratios of pearlite to ferrite
   resulted in increased erosion resistance. Possible mechanisms
   responsible for the observed phenomena were analyzed and discussed. (C)

   in the impact toughness, which limits its applications. Controlling the
   morphology, size and quantity of carbides is an approach to achieve the
   optimal combination of wear resistance and impact toughness. In this
   work, we modified CADI by adding nano ceria to tailor the morphology,
   size and quantity of carbides and investigated effects of the added nano
   ceria on mechanical properties and abrasion resistance of the CADI. It
   was demonstrated that carbides were refined by the nano ceria, which
   improved the toughness of the CADI in addition to raised hardness. The
   abrasive wear resistance of the material was correspondingly enhanced
   with the change in hardness, largely benefiting from the variations in
   the volume fraction and size of carbides. However, only a small amount
   of nano ceria was effective; the benefits of nano ceria diminished if
   excessive nano ceria was added. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The so-called high-entropy alloys have attracted increasing interest. An
   originally defined high-entropy alloy contains more than five elements
   without an apparent host element, and each element has its concentration
   in the range of 5-35\%. This concept challenges the conventional
   principle used in developing alloys. High-entropy alloys are usually
   nanostructured and show high strength, excellent resistance to
   high-temperature creep, and high resistances to wear. Using this
   concept, the authors previously modified high-Cr cast irons (HCCIs) by
   adding mixtures of various carbide-forming elements, and noticed that
   such tailored HCCIs possessed high sliding wear resistance but performed
   less impressively when impact force was involved. Based on these
   observations, we modified the high-entropy concept and tailored a
   commercial white cast iron as a base alloy, Fe-27Cr-2.5C-0.8Si, by
   alloying with a small amount of B, V, Nb, and W to form several new
   alloys or hybrid HCCIs. Hardness and toughness of the alloys were
   measured. Compared to the base alloy, these alloys showed much higher
   sliding wear resistances. However, air-jet solid-particle erosion tests
   showed that the performance of these modified alloys was similar to that
   of the base alloy during high-speed solid-particle erosion, indicating
   that high-entropy alloys possess significantly enhanced sliding wear
   resistance due to elevated hardness but may not be very effective in
   resisting erosion when impact force is involved, which is limited by
   their reduced toughness. The advantages and disadvantages of
   high-entropy alloys are generally discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Ultra-fine grained WC-Co composites possess higher hardness or strength
   and wear resistance, compared to their coarse counterparts. However,
   abnormal grain growth of ultra-fine WC particles often occurs during the
   traditional pressureless liquid sintering, which substantially impairs
   the mechanical properties and erosion resistance of the material. Thus,
   controlling the abnormal grain growth becomes one of the key issues in
   fabricating ultra-fine grained cemented carbides. In this study,
   ultra-fine grained WC-Co composites containing different amounts of
   ceria nano-particles were prepared by spark plasma sintering and effects
   of the nano-ceria on mechanical properties and erosion behavior of the
   WC-Co composites were studied. The results demonstrated that trace
   nano-ceria addition effectively suppressed the abnormal grain growth of
   WC, leading to uniform and fine microstructures. Such ultra-fine grained
   WC-Co composites have both improved hardness and fracture toughness,
   resulting in enhanced resistance to high-speed solid-particle erosion.
   However, when the added nano-ceria was more than 0.1 wt\%, Co pools
   started to form, which lowered the material density, hardness and
   toughness and consequently the erosion resistance. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Erosion and corrosive wear in hydrotransport lines in the Fort McMurray
   Athabasca Oil Sands Industry have been an ongoing issue since industry
   startup 45 years ago. Material performance is highly dependent on
   specific conditions along the pipelines, which makes the material
   selection for optimum wear performance difficult. Carbon steel (CS),
   chrome carbide overlaid CS, dual phase stainless steel, urethane lined
   CS, as well as high chromium cast iron have been effectively used at
   specific locations to optimize the pipeline life and cost. This paper
   will suggest an explanation as to the material loss mechanisms that come
   into play and why different materials perform better in certain
   locations in the field. A comparison between common lab tests for wear
   and field performance will be discussed. The material degradation rate
   is dependent on the pressure, size of the transported material, density,
   temperature of the mixture, velocity, distance pumped as well as the
   water chemistry. Pipe geometry also has a great effect. Erosion and
   corrosion are the two main degradation mechanisms encountered in the
   hydrotransport piping systems. Understanding the interaction between
   these variables as well as the performance of different piping materials
   allows the optimization of the costs of handling these slurries by
   minimizing unscheduled downtimes and maximizing productive time.
   Interpreting lab results and the wear mechanisms involved are important
   for effective selection of improved materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Hypereutectic high Cr cast irons (HCCIs) possess high resistance to
   wear, benefiting from their high volume fraction of hard carbides.
   However, the primary carbides are usually coarse, rendering the
   materials less tough and thus negatively influencing their resistance to
   wear, especially when impact force is involved. Refining the
   microstructure of hypereutectic HCCIs has been demonstrated an effective
   approach to improve the performance of HCCIs during wear processes.
   Previously we demonstrated that adding Ti to a hypereutectic HCCI
   resulted in the formation of fine TiC, which consumed carbon and thus
   shifted the carbon concentration in the remaining liquid to one
   corresponding to the eutectic state. As a result, microstructure of the
   HCCI was refined without the formation of primary carbides while still
   retaining high volume fraction of carbides. The wear resistance of the
   modified HCCI was markedly improved. In the present work, we added
   several other carbide-forming elements, V, Nb, B, and Mo, to a
   hypereutectic HCCI, respectively, and evaluated the effectiveness of
   each element in improving the wear resistance of the HCCI. The amount of
   each added element was adjusted in order to have the HCCI in slightly
   hypereutectic, eutectic, and hypoeutectic states, respectively. Optimal
   ranges of the added elements were thus determined based on the degree of
   microstructure refinement and corresponding wear resistance.
   Microstructure characterization was carried out using scanning electron
   microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction
   technique. Micromechanical properties and wear resistance were evaluated
   using microindenter and pin-on-disc tester, respectively. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with the problem of fault detection (FD) for
   networked control systems with discrete and infinite distributed delays
   subject to random packet losses and non-linear perturbation. Both
   sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator packet losses are

   utilising an observer-based fault detection filter (FDF) as a residual

   packet losses is formulated as an H-infinity model-matching problem.
   Attention is focused on designing the FDF in the closed-loop system
   setup such that the estimation error between the residuals and filtered
   faults is made as small as possible and at the same time the closed-loop

Abstract = {{Accuracy and efficiency of alarm systems are of paramount importance in
   safe operations of industrial processes. Accuracy is measured by false
   and missed alarm rates (probabilities); while efficiency relates to the
   detection delay and complexity of the technique used. Moving average
   filters are often employed in industry for improved alarm accuracy. Can
   one do better than moving average filters? The following two problems
   are studied in this paper: First, given both normal and abnormal
   statistic distributions, how to design an optimal alarm filter (of fixed
   complexity) for best alarm accuracy, minimizing a weighted sum of false
   and missed alarm rates? Second, in what cases are moving average filters
   optimal? For the first problem, design of optimal linear FIR alarm
   filters is studied, and a numerical optimization based procedure is
   proposed. For the second problem, a sufficient condition is given under
   which the moving average filters are optimal.
   Note to Practitioners-In industrial alarm systems, a main problem is
   that the number of alarms operators receive is much higher than they can
   handle. Our paper was motivated by this problem. In order to reduce the
   alarm count without sacrificing accuracy and swiftness, techniques such
   as deadbands, delay timers, and filters are commonly used. In our work,
   an optimal filter design method is introduced to improve the
   performance. We present an efficient algorithm to search for optimal
   linear filters. An optimal performance curve is also introduced to
   illustrate the performance. We provide some mild conditions under which
   the moving average filter is optimal; the conditions can be tested by
   some well-developed statistical tests, thus removing the necessity to
   optimize linear filter parameters.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Flooding of alarms is a very crucial problem in process industries. An
   alarm flood makes an operator ineffective of taking necessary actions,
   and often risking an emergency shutdown or a major upset. In this work,
   the flooding of alarms is discussed based on the standards presented in
   ISA 18.2. A new analysis method is proposed to investigate similar alarm
   floods from the historic alarm data and group them on the basis of the
   patterns of alarm occurrences. A case study on real industrial alarm
   data is also presented to demonstrate the utility of the proposed
   analysis.
   Note to Practitioners-In an industrial plant, alarms are designed to
   inform the operator about any fault or abnormality in the operation.
   However, alarm systems are not always designed, implemented, and
   maintained properly. This usually results in an excessive number of
   enunciated alarms, most of which are false or nuisance. Specifically,
   during a plant upset, operators receive far more alarms that they can
   handle (hundreds or even thousands of alarms in a short period of time).
   This is known as an alarm flood or alarm shower. Our study shows that in
   some cases, alarm floods follow similar patterns. As a result by
   studying and classifying flood patterns, it is possible to find the root
   cause of an abnormality based on the history of the plant and previous
   similar floods. This allows the operator to react to a plant upset at
   the early stages of or even before an alarm flood.}},

Abstract = {{Particle mass, mobility, volatile mass fraction, effective density, mass
   concentration, mass-mobility exponent, and particle morphology were
   measured from soot generated from a premixed flame (McKenna burner) and
   an inverted diffusion flame over a range of equivalence ratios. It was
   found that the mass fraction of volatile material on the soot from the
   McKenna burner could be up to 0.83 at a high equivalence ratio, but
   there was no measurable volatile material on the soot from the inverted
   burner. The inverted burner can produce soot at different mass-mobility
   exponents, ranging from 2.23 to 2.54, over a range of global equivalence
   ratios of 0.53-0.67, while the mass-mobility exponent ranges from 2.19
   to 2.99 for fresh soot and 2.19 to 2.81 for denuded soot for the McKenna
   burner at equivalence ratios of 2.0-3.75. Transmission electron
   microscopy analysis of inverted burner soot shows that a range of
   particle morphologies is present at a given global equivalence ratio,
   likely due to different local equivalence ratios and flame conditions in
   the diffusion flame. Primary particle diameter tends to increase with
   aggregate size, which could contribute to the mass-mobility exponent
   being well above 2. Copyright 2013 American Association for Aerosol

Abstract = {{Torsional vibration signals are theoretically free from the amplitude
   modulation effect caused by time variant vibration transfer paths due to
   the rotation of planet carrier and sun gear, and therefore their
   spectral structure are simpler than transverse vibration signals. Thus,
   it is potentially easy and effective to diagnose planetary gearbox
   faults via torsional vibration signal analysis. We give explicit
   equations to model torsional vibration signals, considering both
   distributed gear faults (like manufacturing or assembly errors) and
   local gear faults (like pitting, crack or breakage of one tooth), and
   derive the characteristics of both the traditional Fourier spectrum and
   the proposed demodulated spectra of amplitude envelope and instantaneous
   frequency. These derivations are not only effective to diagnose single
   gear fault of planetary gearboxes, but can also be generalized to detect
   and locate multiple gear faults. We validate experimentally the signal
   models, as well as the Fourier spectral analysis and demodulation
   analysis methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a hierarchical nanoarchitecture wherein distinct
   chromophores are deterministically placed at two different types of
   sites in a nanoporous metal oxide framework. One chromophore, namely
   Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium(III) (Alq(3)), is embedded in the 1-2
   nm sized nanovoids of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) and another
   chromophore (carboxyfluorescein or pyrenebutyric acid) is anchored in
   the form of a monolayer to the surface of the walls of the cylindrical
   nanopores (similar to 20 nm in diameter) of AAO. We found the
   luminescence maximum to occur at 492 nm, blueshifted by at least 18 nm
   from the value in solutions and thin films. The excited state decay of
   Alq(3) molecules in nanovoids was found to be biexponential with a fast
   component of 338 ps and a slower component of 2.26 ns, different from
   Alq(3) thin films and solutions. Using a combination of steady state and
   time-resolved luminescence studies, we found that efficient Forster-type
   resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Alq(3) in the nanovoids to the
   carboxyfluorescein monolayer could be used to pump the emission of
   surface-bound chromophores. Conversely, the emission of
   nanovoid-confined Alq(3) could be pumped by energy transfer from a
   pyrenebutyric acid monolayer. Such intra-nanoarchitecture interactions
   between chromophores deterministically placed in different spatial
   locations are important in applications such as organic light emitting
   diodes, chemical sensors, energy transfer fluorescent labels, light
   harvesting antennas and organic spintronics.}},

Abstract = {{Exploitation of anodically formed self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays in
   mass-manufactured, disposable biosensors, rollable electrochromic
   displays and flexible large-area solar cells would greatly benefit from
   integration with transparent and flexible polymeric substrates. Such
   integration requires the vacuum deposition of a thin film of titanium on
   the desired substrate, which is then anodized in suitable media to
   generate TiO2 nanotube arrays. However the challenges associated with
   control of Ti film morphology, nanotube array synthesis conditions, and
   film adhesion and transparency, have necessitated the use of substrate
   heating during deposition to temperatures of at least 300 degrees C and
   as high as 500 degrees C to generate highly ordered open-pore nanotube
   arrays, thus preventing the use of polymeric substrates. We report on a
   film growth technique that exploits atomic peening to achieve high
   quality transparent TiO2 nanotube arrays with lengths up to 5.1 mu m at
   room temperature on polyimide substrates without the need for substrate
   heating or substrate biasing or a Kauffman ion source. The superior
   optical quality and uniformity of the nanotube arrays was evidenced by
   the high specular reflectivity and the smooth pattern of periodic
   interferometric fringes in the transmission spectra of the nanotube
   arrays, from which the wavelength-dependent effective refractive index
   was extracted for the air-TiO2 composite medium. A fluorescent
   immunoassay biosensor constructed using 5.1 mu m-long transparent
   titania nanotube arrays (TTNAs) grown on Kapton substrates detected
   human cardiac troponin I at a concentration of 0.1 mu g ml(-1).}},

Title = {{Buckling of a thin, viscous film in an axisymmetric geometry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{By adapting the Foppl-von Karman equation, which describes the
   deformation of a thin elastic membrane, we present an analysis of the
   buckling pattern of a thin, very viscous fluid layer subject to shear in
   an axisymmetric geometry. A linear stability analysis yields a
   differential eigenvalue problem, whose solution, obtained using spectral
   techniques, yields the most unstable azimuthal wave-number, m(star).
   Contrary to the discussion of Slim et al. {[}J. Fluid Mech. 694, 5-28
   (2012)], it is argued that the axisymmetric problem shares the same
   degeneracy as its rectilinear counterpart, i.e., at the onset of
   instability, m(star) is indefinitely large. Away from this point,
   however, a comparison with analogue experimental results is both
   possible and generally favorable. In this vein, we describe the
   laboratory apparatus used to make new measurements of m(star), the phase
   speed and the wave amplitude; note that no prediction concerning the
   latter two quantities can be made using the present theory. Experiments
   reveal a limited range of angular velocities wherein waves of either
   small or large amplitude may be excited. Transition from one to the
   other regime does not appear to be associated with a notable change in
   m(star). (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The effect on process performance of adding increasing proportions of
   biodiesel waste glycerin (BWG) to municipal wastewater sludge (MWS) was
   studied using two 1300 L pilot-scale digesters under mesophilic
   conditions at 20 days SRT. The highest proportion of BWG that did not
   cause a process upset was determined to be 23\% and 35\% of the total
   1.04 kg VS/(m(3) d) and 2.38 kg COD/(m(3) d) loadings, respectively. At
   this loading, the biogas and methane production rates in the test
   digester were 1.65 and 1.83 times greater than of those in the control
   digester which received only MWS, respectively. The COD and VS removal
   rates at this loading in the test digester were 1.82 and 1.63-fold those
   of the control digester, respectively. Process instability was observed
   when the proportion of BWG in the test digester feed was 31\% and 46\%

Abstract = {{This paper primarily intends to develop a GIS (geographical information
   system)-based data mining approach for optimally selecting the locations
   and determining installed capacities for setting up distributed biomass
   power generation systems in the context of decentralized energy planning
   for rural regions. The optimal locations within a cluster of villages
   are obtained by matching the installed capacity needed with the demand
   for power, minimizing the cost of transportation of biomass from
   dispersed sources to power generation system, and cost of distribution
   of electricity from the power generation system to demand centers or
   villages. The methodology was validated by using it for developing an
   optimal plan for implementing distributed biomass-based power systems
   for meeting the rural electricity needs of Tumkur district in India
   consisting of 2700 villages. The approach uses a k-medoid clustering
   algorithm to divide the total region into clusters of villages and
   locate biomass power generation systems at the medoids. The optimal
   value of k is determined iteratively by running the algorithm for the
   entire search space for different values of k along with demand-supply
   matching constraints. The optimal value of the k is chosen such that it
   minimizes the total cost of system installation, costs of transportation
   of biomass, and transmission and distribution. A smaller region,
   consisting of 293 villages was selected to study the sensitivity of the
   results to varying demand and supply parameters. The results of
   clustering are represented on a GIS map for the region. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This study examined the occlusion of two polyaromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) (pyrene and phenanthrene) in asphaltene precipitates. To test for
   occlusion inside the nanoaggregates, a toluene solution of asphaltene
   and each of these aromatic compounds was allowed to equilibrate and mix
   for 2 days to enable penetration into the asphaltene nanoaggregates and
   then the asphaltenes were precipitated with n-pentane, filtered, washed,
   and dried. To test for trapping and adsorption outside the
   nanoaggregates during precipitation, a solution of asphaltene in toluene
   was mixed with a solution of aromatic compound in toluene and n-pentane,
   giving immediate precipitation, then allowed to equilibrate overnight,
   then filtered, washed, and dried. The PAHs in the asphaltene
   precipitates were determined quantitatively by gas chromatography using
   a high-temperature simulated distillation instrument. Pyrene and
   phenanthrene, which are normally soluble in the toluene n-pentane
   solutions, were detected in the asphaltene precipitates at up to 6 wt \%
   concentration. Trapping of PAHs outside of the nanoaggregates during
   precipitation gave 7-14 times less of the PAHs in the solid precipitate.
   This study shows that asphaltene aggregates can interact significantly
   with PAHs. The results are consistent with the presence of open porous
   asphaltene nanoaggregates in solutions, such as toluene.}},

Abstract = {{The bulk phase behavior of heavy oil + alkane mixtures and the behavior
   of the asphaltenes that they contain are topics of importance for the
   design and optimization of processes for petroleum production,
   transport, and refining and for performing routine saturates, aromatics,
   resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) analyses. In prior studies, partial phase
   diagrams and phase behavior models for Athabasca vacuum residue (AVR)
   comprising 32 wt \% pentane asphaltenes + n-alkanes were reported. For
   mixtures with pentane, observed phase behaviors included single-phase
   liquid as well as liquid-liquid, liquid-liquid-vapor, and
   liquid-liquid-liquid-vapor regions. Dispersed solids were detected under
   some conditions as well but not quantified. In this work, small-angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS) is used to study nanostructured materials in
   liquid phases present in AVR + npentane mixtures from 50 to 170 C at
   mixture bubble pressure. The investigation focuses on the impact of the
   transition from a single AVR-rich liquid to co-existing pentane-rich and
   AVR-rich liquids on the nanostructure and the nanostructures most
   resistant to aggregation as the pentane composition axis is approached.
   Background scattering subtraction was performed using global mixture
   composition. The robustness of this assumption with respect to values
   obtained for coefficients appearing in a two level Beaucage unified
   equation fit is demonstrated. The nanostructured material is shown to
   arise at two length scales from 1 to 100 wt \% AVR. Smaller
   nanostructures possess mean radii less than 50 A, while the larger
   nanostructures possess mean radii greater than 250 A. The addition of
   pentane to the AVR causes an increasingly large fraction of the large
   and small nanostructures to grow in size. Only nanostructures resistant
   to aggregation remain in the pentane rich phase as the 0 wt \% AVR axis
   is approached. Step changes in aggregation identified from changes in
   average radius of gyration, scattering coefficients, and surface/volume
   ratios arise at the liquid-vapor to liquid-liquid-vapor transition
   (similar to 40 wt \% pentane) and within the liquid-liquid-vapor region
   (similar to 90 wt \% pentane). The temperature is shown to have a
   limited effect on the mean size and structure of the nanostructured
   material present, irrespective of global composition.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical building blocks that comprise petroleum asphaltene
   molecules were determined by thermal cracking of samples under
   conditions that minimized alterations to aromatic and cycloalkyl groups.
   Favorable hydrogenation conditions that used tetralin as a
   hydrogen-donor solvent and an iron-based catalyst allowed asphaltenes
   derived from different crude oils to yield approximately 50-60 wt \%
   distillates (<538 degrees C fraction), with coke yields below 10 wt \%,
   and reach conversions of the vacuum residue fraction between 65 and 75
   wt \%. Products in a wide range of boiling points, from naphtha to heavy
   material in the vacuum residue range, were observed by simulated
   distillation. Quantitative recovery of the cracked products, with mass
   balances above 96\%, and characterization of the distillate fraction by
   gas chromatography field ionization time-of-flight high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (GC-FI-TOF HR MS) provided information on the abundance of
   building blocks, including saturates, 1-3-ring aromatics, 4+-ring
   aromatics, and nitrogen- and sulfide-containing molecules. Samples of
   asphaltenes from different geological basins exhibited a remarkable
   similarity in the yields of building blocks, with paraffins and 1-3-ring
   aromatics as the most abundant species. The diversity of molecules
   identified in the distillate products from the cracking of asphaltenes
   suggests a high degree of heterogeneity and complexity of asphaltene
   molecules, built up by smaller fragments attached to each other by
   bridges. The sum of material remaining in the vacuum residue fraction
   and the yield of coke were in the range of 35-45\% and represent the
   maximum amount of large aromatic clusters present in asphaltenes that
   could not be converted to distillates or gases under the cracking
   conditions used in this study.}},

   atmospheric bottom fraction of a crude oil was blended with an aliphatic
   diluent in different ratios; the S values were measured; and then
   fouling rates were measured on electrically heated stainless-steel 316
   wires in an autoclave reactor. As expected, the less stable the blend,
   the greater the rate and extent of fouling. The most severe fouling
   occurred with the unstable asphaltenes. Scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) imaging of the foulant illustrates very different textures, with
   the structure becoming more porous with lower stability. Under
   cross-polarized light, the coke shows the presence of mesophase in the
   foulant layer. These data suggest a correlation between the fouling rate
   at high-temperature furnace conditions and the stability index of the
   crude oil.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we present a case study on a Wyoming well with known asphaltene
   deposition issues as a result of natural depletion. Field deposits and
   crude oil from the same well were collected for analysis. Compositional
   differences between field deposits, lab-generated capillary deposits,
   and C-7-precipitated asphaltenes were determined by Fourier transform
   ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), and all three
   samples show similar trends in composition, displayed as plots of
   aromaticity versus carbon number. An enrichment of highly condensed
   aromatic molecules for the field deposit is detected with both ultrahigh
   resolution mass spectrometry and thermal cracking experiments and could
   predict asphaltene deposition FT-ICR mass spectral analysis of solvent
   extracted fractions suggest different deposition mechanisms for field
   deposits (slow deposition) compared to rapid precipitation in standard
   asphaltene preparation protocols that contain trapped maltenes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a microfluidic approach to measure liquid
   solvent diffusivity in Athabasca bitumen. The method has three
   distinguishing features: (a) a sharp initial condition enabled by the
   high wettability of the solvent; (b) one-dimensional diffusive transport
   (in the absence of convection) ensured by microscale confinement; and
   (c) visible-light-based measurement enabled by the partial transparency
   of the bitumen at small scales. The method is applied to measure the
   diffusion of toluene into bitumen by imaging transmitted light profiles
   over time, and relating intensities to the mass fractions. Plotting
   toluene mass fraction versus distance/sqrt(time), results in a tight
   superposition of all curves (time-dependent mass fractions)
   demonstrating the diffusion dominated nature of the system and the
   robustness of the method. The diffusion transport equations were solved
   and fit to a constant diffusion coefficient as well as a variety of
   concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient relations found in the
   literature. For intermediate toluene mass fractions (0.2-0.8), a
   constant diffusion coefficient of 2.0 X 10(-10) m(2)/s provides an
   appropriate representation. However, at low toluene mass fractions
   (<0.2), significantly reduced diffusive transport is observed, and
   endpoint analysis indicates diffusion coefficients trending toward 4.3 X
   10(-11) At high toluene mass fractions (>0.8), the values trend toward
   1.5 X 10(-10) m(2)/s. This microfluidic method provides an inexpensive
   and rapid mutual diffusion coefficient evaluation, with significantly
   improved spatial/composition resolution vis-a-vis competing measurement
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{A series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate
   the effect of aliphatic side-chain length on the aggregation behavior of
   a model asphaltene in water. We found that the extent of aggregation has
   a nonmonotonic relationship with the side-chain length. Asphaltene
   molecules with very short or very long side chains can form dense
   aggregates, whereas those with intermediate chain lengths cannot.
   Through analysis of the kinetics and driving forces of the aggregation,
   the role of the side chains in affecting the aggregation behavior was
   elucidated. Long side chains hinder the formation of parallel stacking
   structures of the polyaromatic cores while also favoring aggregation
   through hydrophobic association. The simulation results reported here
   can be used to propose appropriate means to reduce the extent of
   aggregation of asphaltene in the presence of water.}},

Abstract = {{The specific targeting ability of novel breast cancer targeting peptides
   as ligands coupled to polymeric micelles was evaluated in the present
   study. In this context, engineered breast cancer cell targeting
   peptides, denoted as peptide 11 (RGDPAYQGRFL) and peptide 18
   (WXEAAYQRFL), were compared with the lead 12-mer p160 peptide and cyclic
   RGDfK peptide. All four peptides were conjugated individually to
   poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) diblock polymeric
   micelles to obtain targeted carrier systems PM11, PM18, PM 160, and PM
   c-RGD. Physical blending of the peptides 11 and 18 with PEO-b-PCL was
   also done to yield combination micelles, comPM11 and comPM18. The
   structural confirmation of polymer was carried out using H-1 NMR and
   MALDI-TOF, and the size distribution and zeta potential of the micelles
   were determined using dynamic light scattering. Lipophilic cyanine
   fluorescent probe DiI was physically incorporated in the polymeric
   micelles to imitate the hydrophobic drug loaded in the micellar core.
   The cellular uptake of DiI-loaded peptide-containing polymeric micelles
   by MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines, as well as
   HUVEG and MCF10A noncancerous cells, were analyzed using flow cytometry
   and confocal microscopy techniques. Modification of polymeric micelles
   with peptide 11 or 18 led to an increase in micellar uptake specifically
   in breast cancer cells compared to p160, c-RGD modified, or naked
   micelles. The peptide micelle combinations (comPM11 and comPM18)
   displayed better uptake by the cells compared to the covalently
   conjugated PM11 and PM18 micelles; however, the combinations were less
   selective toward cancer cells. The results point to a potential for
   peptides 11- and 18-micelle conjugates as attractive platforms for
   improved performance of a wide range of chemotherapeutic drugs and/or
   imaging agents in cancer therapy and diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the classical DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory,
   the maximum coagulation of fine particle suspensions would be predicated
   to occur at the point of zero charge (pzc) of the particles. Although
   this prediction has been fairly accurate for isotropic particles, the
   mismatch has been frequently reported for suspensions of
   anisotropically-charged or charge-mosaic particles, such as talc.
   Followed by successful preparation of sufficiently smooth talc edge
   surfaces using the ultramicrotome method for the colloidal force
   measurements using atomic force microscope (AFM), the anisotropic
   surface charge properties, i.e., surface charge characteristics of basal
   planes and edge surfaces of talc at different pH values were determined
   by fitting the measured force profiles between the AFM tip and both
   basal plane and edge surfaces to the DLVO theory. The talc basal planes
   were found to carry a permanent negative charge, while the charge on its
   edge surfaces was highly pH-dependent. The AFM-derived surface (Stern)
   potential values of talc basal planes and edge surfaces enable us to
   calculate the interaction energy for various associations between
   different charge-mosaic surfaces. The attractive interaction between
   talc basal planes and edge surfaces was found to dominate the
   rheological behavior. This study clearly demonstrates the necessity of
   determining anisotropic surface charge characteristics to improve the
   understanding of rheological properties and hence to better control
   their process performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three future projections of global municipal water use are established:
   business-as usual (BAU), low technological improvement (Low Tech), and
   high technological improvement (High Tech). A global municipal water
   demand model is constructed using global water-use statistics at the
   country scale, calibrated to the base year of 2005, and simulated to the
   end of the 21st century. Since the constructed water demand model hinges
   on socio-economic variables (population, income), water price, and
   end-use technology and efficiency improvement rates, projections of
   those input variables are adopted to characterize the uncertainty in
   future water demand estimates. The water demand model is linked to the
   Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a global change integrated
   assessment model. Under the reference (BAU) scenario, the global total
   water withdrawal increases from 466 km(3) year(1) in 2005 to 1098 km(3)
   year(1) in 2100, while withdrawals in the High and Low Tech scenarios
   are 437 and 2000 km(3) year(1), respectively.

   in the resultant steel, which may have an adverse effect on the
   mechanical properties. In the present study, detailed microstructural
   characterization, using electron microscopy (both SEM and TEM) and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), of commercial grades of ferrotitanium and
   ferroniobium alloys is carried out to identify the various phases. The
   ferrotitanium alloy was composed of mainly beta-Ti solid solution and a
   Fe-Ti-Al ternary intermetallic. There were minor amounts of alpha-Ti
   solid solution, Ti(CxN1-x) and FeTi. For the ferroniobium alloy, two
   main phases were present, a Nb-rich solid solution and mu-Fe7Nb6. The
   Fe7Nb6 intermetallic phase exhibited two different morphologies, a
   proeutectic form that was slightly Fe-rich and a eutectic form that was
   slightly Nb-rich. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of SA508-4Ni-Cr-Mo
   low carbon alloy steel are elucidated using tensile testing, Charpy
   impact testing, fracture surface analysis and in-situ electrochemical
   noise (EN) technique. The metallographic structures are characterized by
   metallographic microscope combining with transmission electron
   microscope (TEM), and the fracture morphology is characterized by
   scanning electron microscope (SEM). The intercritical heat treatment
   (IHT) is introduced to heat the SA508-4 steel. The experimental
   observations reveal that the metallographic structure of SA508-4 steel
   is fine and uniform after different heat treatment, with martensite and
   lower bainite structures. The strength and toughness of SA508-4Ni-Cr-Mo
   are confirmed higher than that of SA508-3Mn-Ni-Mo steel used for reactor
   pressure vessels (RPV) at present. The IHT decreases the yield strength
   and toughness. EN results show that the noise resistance of SA508-4
   steel decreased with the elevated temperature from 27 to 250 degrees C,
   illustrating the passivity degradation of SA508-4 induced by the
   elevated temperature. (C) The Electrochemical Society of Japan, All

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{On-line estimation plays an important role in process control and
   monitoring. Obtaining a theoretical solution to the simultaneous
   state-parameter estimation problem for non-linear stochastic systems
   involves solving complex multi-dimensional integrals that are not
   amenable to analytical solution. While basic sequential Monte-Carlo
   (SMC) or particle filtering (PF) algorithms for simultaneous estimation
   exist, it is well recognized that there is a need for making these
   on-line algorithms non-degenerate, fast and applicable to processes with
   missing measurements. To overcome the deficiencies in traditional
   algorithms, this work proposes a Bayesian approach to on-line state and
   parameter estimation. Its extension to handle missing data in real-time
   is also provided. The simultaneous estimation is performed by filtering
   an extended vector of states and parameters using an adaptive
   sequential-importance-resampling (SIR) filter with a kernel density
   estimation method. The approach uses an on-line optimization algorithm
   based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to allow adaptation of the SIR
   filter for combined state-parameter estimation. An optimal tuning rule
   to control the width of the kernel and the variance of the artificial
   noise added to the parameters is also proposed. The approach is
   illustrated through numerical examples. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Control loop diagnosis with ambiguous historical operating modes: Part
   1. A proportional parametrization approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{585-597}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Control-loop performance assessment methods have been evolving over the
   past two decades, with many different monitor algorithms being used to
   single out specific problems and determine the operating mode. However,
   a change in operating mode may affect multiple monitors, resulting in
   the possibility of conflicting assessments. Data-driven Bayesian methods
   were previously proposed which use multiple monitors to yield
   probabilistic assessments; however, training data for Bayesian methods
   requires complete knowledge of underlying operational modes. This paper
   proposes an approach based on proportionality parameters theta to
   address the problem of incomplete mode information in the training data;
   values in theta can be used to fill in missing information, and by
   varying theta one can determine the boundaries on a probabilistic
   diagnosis. Two diagnostic approaches are considered: the first type is
   direct probability approach, which can only be applied when historical
   data on the operation mode is sufficient and representative. The second
   type is the likelihood approach which can be applied to more general
   cases, including when the historical data is too limited to adequately
   represent mode frequency. In order to represent mode frequency, the
   likelihood approach takes into account prior probabilities of operating
   modes. The proposed methods are evaluated in two simulated chemical
   processes. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   grating. We give a detailed analysis of quenching and design the

   of the losses in the metal. Our work should help motivate experiments in

Abstract = {{A constrained periodic multiple-sensor scheduling problem is considered
   in this paper. For each sensor, constraints on dwell time and activation
   times are imposed. At each time instant, only one sensor can update its
   measurement with the estimator; and the objective is to minimize the
   average state estimation error. An approximation framework is proposed
   to calculate the objective function, which transforms the original
   scheduling problem into an Approximate Optimal Scheduling Problem
   (AOSP). An upper bound on the approximation error is presented to
   evaluate the performance of the framework. To solve the AOSP, a
   necessary condition is first proposed on the optimal schedules. When no
   constraints on activation times exist, a dynamic programming based
   algorithm is devised to identify the optimal schedule with polynomial
   computational complexity. When activation-time constraints exist, we
   show that the AOSPs can be solved by solving traveling salesman
   problems. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed results. (C)

Abstract = {{Three protease-resistant bioorganic 304 stainless steel surfaces were
   created through the reaction of synthetic peptides consisting of the
   D-enantiomeric isomer (D-K122-4), the retro-inverso D-enantiomeric
   isomer (RI-K122-4), and a combination of the two peptides (D + RI) of
   the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PilA receptor binding domain with steel
   surfaces. The peptides used to produce the new materials differ only in
   handedness of their three-dimensional structure, but they reacted with
   the steel to yield materials that differed in their surface electron
   work function (EWF) while displaying an identical chemical composition
   and equivalent surface adhesive force properties. These surfaces allowed
   for an assessment of the relative role of surface EWF in initial biofilm
   formation. We examined the ability of various bacteria (selected strains
   of Listeria monogtogenes, L. innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and S.
   epidermidis) to initiate biofilm formation. The D-K1224 generated
   surface displayed the lowest EWF (classically associated with greater
   molecular interactions and more extensive biofilm formation) but was
   observed to be least effectively colonized by bacteria (>50\% decrease
   in bacterial adherence of all strains). The highest surface EWF with the
   lowest surface free energy (RI-K122-4 generated) was more extensively
   colonized by bacteria, with the binding of some strains being equivalent
   to unmodified steel. The D + RI generated surface was least effective in
   minimizing biofilm formation, where some strains displayed enhanced
   bacterial colonization. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that the D and
   RI peptides displayed similar but clearly different binding patterns,
   suggesting that the peptides recognized different sites on the steel,
   and that differential binding of the peptides to the steel surfaces
   influences the binding of different bacterial strains and species. We
   have demonstrated that stainless steel surfaces can be easily modified
   by peptides to generate surfaces with new physiochemical properties. The
   D-K122-4-modified surface substantially decreases biofilm formation
   compared to the RI-K122-4 and D + RI surfaces. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{The kinetics of ozone inactivation of infectious prion protein (PrPSc,
   scrapie 263K) was investigated in ozone-demand-free phosphate-buffered
   saline (PBS). Diluted infectious brain homogenates (IBH) (0.01\%) were
   exposed to a predetermined ozone dose (10.8 +/- 2.0 mg/liter) at three
   pHs (pH 4.4, 6.0, and 8.0) and two temperatures (4 degrees C and 20
   degrees C). The inactivation of PrPSc was quantified by determining the
   in vitro destruction of PrPSc templating properties using the protein
   misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) assay and bioassay, which were
   shown to correlate well. The inactivation kinetics were characterized by
   both Chick-Watson (CW) and efficiency factor Hom (EFH) models. It was
   found that the EFH model fit the experimental data more appropriately.
   The efficacy of ozone inactivation of PrPSc was both pH and temperature
   dependent. Based on the EFH model, CT (disinfectant concentration
   multiplied by contact time) values were determined for 2-log(10),
   3-log(10), and 4-log(10) inactivation at the conditions under which they
   were achieved. Our results indicated that ozone is effective for prion
   inactivation in ozone-demand- free water and may be applied for the
   inactivation of infectious prion in prion-contaminated water and
   wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the bactericidal mechanisms
   of Ag-doped multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanoparticles
   (Ag-0/MWCNTs) to Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. The contributions of silver
   ion dissolution, reactive species, and direct contact on bacteria
   inactivation were systematically determined. The relatively higher
   survival rate of bacteria exposed to 0.02 mg L-1 Ag+ ions (the maximum
   concentration of Ag+ ions dissolved from Ag-0/MWCNTs) suggested that the
   antibacterial property of Ag-0/MWCNTs was not caused by silver ion
   dissolution. The effects of each reactive species ((OH)-O-center dot,
   H2O2, O-center dot(2)-, h(+), and e(-)) on the disinfection process were
   investigated by using multiple scavengers, and the results showed that
   (OHb)-O-center dot, (OHs)-O-center dot, and h(+) play important roles in
   bactericidal actions. The significance of (OHb)-O-center dot,
   (OHs)-O-center dot, and h(+) in the disinfection process was further
   confirmed in the partition systems combined with scavenger. The
   antibacterial effects of these reactive species mainly arose through
   direct contact of the nanocomposites with the bacteria. The effects of
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and natural organic matter
   (NOM) on the inactivation of bacteria were also investigated. The lower
   antibacterial effect observed for EPS-rich bacteria relative to EPS-poor
   bacteria demonstrated the protective effects of EPS in the disinfection
   system. The decreased bacterial toxicity effect acquired by the addition
   of humic acid (as the model NOM) in the disinfection system demonstrated
   the influence of NOM on the bacterial toxicity of nanocomposites, where
   the sorption of NOM onto the surface of the nanocomposites contributed
   to the decreased antibacterial effects. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Web today enables consumers and vendors to conduct business almost

   study the differences in privacy-sensitive decisions made by website
   operators (which can be expected to vary between cultures) as one
   particular example of these differing assumptions. In particular, we
   seek to understand whether new norms of behavior may be emerging as
   online vendors recognize the damage privacy invasions do to consumers'
   trust. We present a large-scale empirical study of privacy-sensitive
   actions across cultures on the Internet. Our study is based on an
   automated analysis of P3P documents posted on the 100,000 most popular
   websites. We find that the adoption of P3P, as well as specific company
   policies, vary across cultural dimensions. The analysis also suggests
   that discrepancies exist between concerns for information privacy and

Pages = {{42-49}},

Abstract = {{The application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a basis for new
   generation of rock failure criteria has been extended to polyaxial state
   of stresses. A comprehensive strength database including the results of
   254 polyaxial tests on six different rock types is collected, and for
   each rock type the data are randomly divided into two subsets of
   training and test sets. Following the optimization of architecture and
   configuration of ANNs, the training data are used for training the
   networks to predict the value of major principal stress at failure from
   the values of minor and intermediate principal stresses. The same
   training data are also used to obtain the parameters of two selected
   conventional failure criteria, namely the Modified Wiebols-Cook and
   Rafiai criteria. Then, the test data are used to compare the accuracy of
   the different failure criteria. It is observed that in all cases, the
   ANN-based failure criterion leads to more accurate results, and the
   average value of root mean squared error for this criterion is about 50
   and 20\% less than those of the Modified Wiebols-Cook and Rafiai
   criteria, respectively. Subsequently, the explicit formulation of the
   ANN-based criterion as an equivalent Mohr-Coulomb criterion with
   stress-dependent parameters is presented. Finally, the formulation is
   incorporated into a numerical code which is used to simulate the
   polyaxial tests included in the strength database. Excellent agreement
   between the expected and simulated values of strength shows that the
   ANN-based failure criterion can be implemented in numerical simulations.

Abstract = {{Variable speed limit (VSL) can be used on freeways to manage traffic
   flow with the goal of improving capacity. To achieve this objective, it
   is necessary that both speed and density dynamics be represented
   accurately. In this study, to deeply understand the effectiveness of VSL
   control, an analytical model was developed to represent drivers'
   response to updated speed limits and macroscopic speed dynamical change
   with respect to changeable speed limits. Specifically, to model the
   freeway links having VSL control, the fundamental diagram (FD) was
   replaced with the VSL control variable in the relaxation term of the
   METANET. This modification led to the speed control variable appearing
   linearly, which is preferable for online computation. The density
   dynamics are based on the cell transmission model (CTM), which is
   introduced to estimate the transition flow among successive links with
   some practical constraints. It also offers flexibility in designing
   active bottleneck in which there is a capacity drop once feeding flow
   exceeds its capacity. To exploit this benefit, a modification was
   introduced in the FD of the density dynamics. A VSL control strategy was
   proposed that explicitly considers traffic characteristics at active
   bottleneck and its upstream-downstream segments. It can control traffic
   flow into any type of active bottleneck. Then, the proposed traffic
   dynamics with the control strategy are implemented in a freeway corridor
   using the model predictive control (MPC) approach. The analysis was
   carried out in the calibrated microsimulation model, VISSIM, within a
   scenario in which shock waves were present. The microsimulation model
   functions as a proxy for the real-world traffic system. This study
   reveals that, in terms of mobility, VSL is mostly effective during
   congestion periods. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000507. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In previous research, we successfully cryopreserved intact human
   articular cartilage on its bone base with high chondrocyte viability
   using a vitrification protocol that entailed sequential exposure to
   several cryopreserving agents (CPAs) at lowering temperatures resulting
   in a high final concentration of CPA. The CPA must be removed from the
   cartilage at warming due to its toxicity to cells in the cryopreserved
   tissue and the post-transplant adjacent tissues. The current experiment
   explores the relationship between removal solution volume and time
   required for complete removal of CPA from bone-cartilage samples.
   Osteochondral dowels of 10 mm diameter from five patients undergoing
   total knee arthroplasty were vitrified using our protocol resulting in
   6.5 M CPA within the matrix. In the primary experiment, the warmed
   dowels were immersed in 10 mL of X-VIVO for 30 min and this was repeated
   5 times (the last wash being 5 min only). Removal solution osmolality
   was recorded at various times and compared to controls of pure X-VIVO.
   Changes in removal solution osmolality over time were normalized to
   tissue volume. In a secondary experiment, the procedure was repeated
   using double the volume of removal solution (20 mL X-VIVO).
   Results showed a rapid change in the osmolality of the removal solution
   indicating a rapid efflux of CPA from cartilage. The efflux rate
   decreased with time and during subsequent immersions until equilibrium
   was reached during the 4th immersion indicating effectively complete
   removal of CPA. Doubling the amount of removal solution demonstrated the
   effective removal of CPAs by the third immersion.
   The results of this study yield a practical relationship between the
   amount of removal solution and the time and number of immersions
   required to remove CPA from the transplantable tissue. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The following reactions:
   H2S + H2SO4 -> SO2 + S + 2H(2)O
   S + O-2 -> SO2
   2SO(2) + 4H(2)O + 2I(2) -> 2H(2)SO(4) + 4HI
   4HI -> 2H(2) + 2I(2)
   form a H2S chemical splitting cycle that converts 1 mol H2S into 2 mol
   of H-2. This makes it possible to provide hydrogen in upgrading the
   Canadian oil sands bitumen from processing its waste product H2S. To
   engineer the chemistry, process design and experiments on reactions and
   separations are under investigation. In this paper, efforts have been
   made in order to have reactions 1, 3 and 4 be conducted at ambient
   temperatures and in fluid medium, thus minimizing side reactions,
   corrosiveness and other process difficulties and making the separations
   of products easier. The results show that the separation of the elemetal
   sulfur from the spent sulfuric acid after reaction 1 can be done by
   phase separation, that using the I-2-toluene solution can make the
   Bunsen reaction (reaction 3) take place below the melting point of
   iodine, and that the direct electrolysis of HI solution from the product
   of reaction 3 leads to the production of H-2 at room temperature through
   reaction 4. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The economic and competitive pressures have made it imperative for
   organizations to focus on third party or outsourcing to reduce costs and
   improve operating efficiencies. The thrust of global economy drives the
   organizations to outsource process, parts, and labor, virtually anywhere
   in the world and get the desired combination of low cost and high
   quality. However, ineffective utilization of shipment practices in
   supply chain prevents to achieve the anticipated outsourcing benefits.
   In this research, a three-stage inventory model is developed to address
   the outsourcing issues with different shipment policies between
   manufacturer, exporter, and assembly point for any manufacturing
   industry. The model provides a measure for establishing an optimal
   balance between two conflicting objectives viz. net costs involved and
   the transportation discounts with consideration of holding cost at all
   the points in the supply chain. Owing to inherent computational
   complexities of the problem with higher dimensions, various
   deterministic approaches practically fail. Proposed work, therefore,
   utilizes a nature-inspired evolutionary algorithm, namely particle swarm
   optimization, to solve the problem. This paper applies enhanced particle
   swarm optimization, a variant of particle swarm optimization for
   solution purpose. Furthermore, the practical benefits and implications
   of the proposed model are demonstrated. The results obtained delineate
   efficacy to handle the fluctuations in the possible shipment options and
   simultaneously deciding the optimal shipment policies.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nano-reinforcements on fracture behaviour of bulk epoxy
   nanocomposites and mode-I interlaminar fracture toughness of
   filament-wound basalt fibre-reinforced laminates was studied. Fracture
   energy of the bulk epoxy nanocomposites significantly increased with
   acrylic tri-block-copolymer addition but remained unchanged with
   incorporation of nanoclay. Delamination fracture toughness was not
   influenced by the presence of nanoparticles in the matrix. Decreasing
   fibre volume fraction, on the other hand, significantly improved
   interlaminar fracture energy. Rigid fibres in these composites constrict
   the stress field ahead of the crack-tip. Hence, increasing resin content
   enhanced composite delamination energy by increasing the capacity for
   matrix deformation. Interlaminar crack propagation through the composite
   was observed to occur mainly by interfacial failure and matrix cracking.

Title = {{A molecular dynamics simulation study on the effect of lipid

Abstract = {{Polycations have been explored as non-viral carriers for effective
   delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Modifying polycations such as
   polyethylenimine (PEI) with lipid substitution was found to improve the
   siRNA delivery efficiency of polycationic carriers. However, the role of
   such lipid modification is not clear and remains to be probed at the
   atomistic level. In this work, we elucidate the role of lipid
   modification through a series of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
   on siRNA complexation mediated by a native PEI and four analogous
   obtained by different lipid modifications. The lipid modification does
   not affect PEI's capability of neutralizing the siRNA charge, neither
   does it affect the polyion bridging which plays an important role in
   siRNA complexation. Significant linkages among the lipid modified PEIs
   via association of lipid side-groups are observed and this results in
   more stable and compact PEI/siRNA polyplexes. The lipid associations
   between short lipids form and break frequently while the lipid
   associations between long lipids are more stable. For PEIs modified with
   short lipids, increasing the lipid substitution level results in more
   compact and stable siRNA structure. For PEIs modified with long lipids,
   increasing the lipid substitution does not change the amount of PEI
   linkage via lipid association, and has a reverse effect on compacting
   siRNA structure due to increased steric hindrance brought by the lipid
   association on individual PEIs. The simulation results generally
   correlate well with experimental data and suggest a framework of
   designing and systematic evaluation of polycation-based siRNA carriers
   using molecular dynamics simulations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   was discussed. The results showed that liquid viscosity and fabric
   surface property determined the impact penetration. Impermeable fabrics
   showed better protection than permeable fabrics. Increasing penetration
   resistance improved thermal protection of a permeable fabric. Liquid
   thermal diffusivity, mass transfer rate and total amount affected heat
   transfer through the fabric to skin simulant. The findings will provide

Abstract = {{Niobium in the form of a ferroniobium alloy is added during the
   steel-making process to improve the mechanical properties of steel, but
   it may contain phase(s) with high melting temperatures that may be slow
   to melt or dissolve. It has been suggested that these phases lead to the
   presence of coarse Nb-rich particles in the resultant steel, which may
   adversely affect the mechanical properties. In the present study,
   electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were
   used to identify phases and microstructural evolution of a commercial
   grade ferroniobium alloy. The ferroniobium alloy was composed of two
   main phases, that is, Nb-rich solid solution and mu phase (Fe7Nb6). The
   mu phase (Fe7Nb6) was formed as a result of three reactions and
   exhibited three different morphologies based on their formation
   temperatures (proeutectic intermetallic, eutectic intermetallic and
   eutectoid intermetallic). The intermetallic that formed via the eutectic
   reaction was slightly Nb-rich and was heavily faulted. The Nb-rich
   eutectic portion of the Fe-Nb binary-phase diagram was also modified
   based on the DSC results to incorporate the effect of impurities in
   commercial alloys. On the basis of solidification study, the estimated
   cooling rate for the as received ferroniobium alloy was 10 K/min.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence rate of the classical Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature (GCQ)
   rule for wireless performance as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio

   GCQ rule is thus adopted. The nodes and weights are then computed from a

   accurate than the classical GCQ over the entire SNR range. Especially at

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a concept of a granular neural network and
   develop its comprehensive design process. The proposed granular network
   is formed on the basis of a given (numeric) neural network whose
   structure is augmented by the formation of granular connections (being
   realized as intervals) spanned over the numeric ones. Owing to its
   simplicity of the underlying processing, the interval connections become
   an appealing alternative of information granules to clarify the main
   idea. We introduce a concept of information granularity and its
   quantification (viewed as a level of information granularity). Being
   treated as an essential design asset, the assumed level of information
   granularity is distributed (allocated) among the connections of the
   network in several different ways so that certain performance index
   becomes maximized. Due to the high dimensionality nature of some
   protocols of allocation of information granularity and the nature of the
   allocation process itself, single-objective versions of particle swarm
   optimization is considered a suitable optimization vehicle. As we are
   concerned with the granular output of the network, which has to be
   evaluated with regard to the numeric target of data, two criteria are
   considered; namely, coverage of numeric data and specificity of
   information granules (intervals). A series of numeric studies completed
   for synthetic data and data coming from the machine learning and StatLib
   repositories provide a useful insight into the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm.}},

Volume = {{101}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the present in vitro study was to investigate
   cardiomyocyte functions, specifically their adhesion and proliferation,
   on injectable scaffolds containing RNT (rosette nanotubes) and CNF
   (carbon nanofibers) in a pHEMA (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate))
   hydrogel to determine their potential for myocardial tissue engineering
   applications. RNTs are novel biocompatible nanomaterials assembled from
   synthetic analogs of DNA bases guanine and cytosine that self-assemble
   within minutes when placed in aqueous solutions at body temperatures.
   These materials could potentially improve cardiomyocyte functions and
   solidification time of pHEMA and CNF composites. Because heart tissue is
   conductive, CNFs were added to pHEMA to increase the composite's
   conductivity. Our results showed that cardiomyocyte density increased
   after 4 h, 1 day, and 3 days with greater amounts of CNFs and greater
   amounts of RNTs in pHEMA (up to 10 mg mL1 CNFs and 0.05 mg mL1 RNTs).
   Factors that may have increased cardiomyocyte functions include greater
   wettability, conductivity, and an increase in surface nanoroughness with
   greater amounts of CNFs and RNTs. In effect, contact angles measured on
   the surface of the composites decreased while the conductivity and
   surface roughness increased as CNFs and RNTs content increased. Lastly,
   the ultimate tensile modulus decreased for composites with greater
   amounts of CNFs. In summary, the properties of these injectable
   composites make them promising candidates for myocardial tissue
   engineering applications and should be further studied. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{In this study, polynomial-based radial basis function neural networks
   are proposed as one of the functional components of the overall face
   recognition system. The system consists of the preprocessing and
   recognition module. The design methodology and resulting procedure of
   the proposed P-RBF NNs are presented. The structure helps construct a
   solution to high-dimensional pattern recognition problems. In data
   preprocessing part, principal component analysis (PCA) is generally used
   in face recognition. It is useful in reducing the dimensionality of the
   feature space. However, because it is concerned with the overall face
   image, it cannot guarantee the same classification rate when changing
   viewpoints. To compensate for these limitations, linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA) is used to enhance the separation between different
   classes. In this paper, we elaborate on the PCA-LDA algorithm and design
   an optimal P-RBF NNs for the recognition module.
   The proposed P-REF NNs architecture consists of three functional modules
   such as the condition part, the conclusion part, and the inference part
   realized in terms of fuzzy ``if-then{''} rules. In the condition part of
   fuzzy rules, the input space is partitioned with the use of fuzzy
   clustering realized by means of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. In
   the conclusion part of rules, the connection weight is realized through
   three types of polynomials such as constant, linear, and quadratic. The
   coefficients of the P-RBF NNs model are obtained by fuzzy inference
   method forming the inference part of fuzzy rules. The essential design
   parameters (including learning rate, momentum, fuzzification
   coefficient, and the feature selection mechanism) of the networks are
   optimized by means of differential evolution (DE). The experimental
   results completed on benchmark face datasets - the AT\&T, and Yale
   datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PCA-LDA
   combined algorithm compared with other algorithms such as PCA, LPP,
   2D-PCA and 2D-LPP. A real time face recognition system realized in this
   way is also presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The rapidly increasing pace and continuously evolving reliability
   requirements of new products have made life cycle reliability assessment
   of new products an imperative yet difficult work. While much work has
   been done to separately estimate reliability of new products in specific

   throughout all life cycle stages. We present a Bayesian model updating
   approach (BMUA) for life cycle reliability assessment of new products.
   Novel features of this approach are the development of Bayesian
   information toolkits by separately including ``reliability improvement
   factor{''} and ``information fusion factor{''}, which allow the
   integration of subjective information in a specific life cycle stage and
   the transition of integrated information between adjacent life cycle
   stages. They lead to the unique characteristics of the BMUA in which
   information generated throughout life cycle stages are integrated
   coherently. To illustrate the approach, an application to the life cycle
   reliability assessment of a newly developed Gantry Machining Center is
   shown. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   by both the capillary forces from a liquid droplet located between the
   DCB and the adhesion forces between the solids. The DCB is modeled using
   both a beam theory that accounts for geometrical nonlinearity and the
   linearized beam theory. This model rigorously couples DCB deformation,
   capillary forces, meniscus movement and adhesion, and reveals four
   dimensionless parameters that govern the adhesion problem. How changes

Abstract = {{Autonomous helicopter flight provides a challenging control problem. In
   order to evaluate control designs, an experimental platform must be
   developed in order to conduct flight tests. However, the literature
   describing existing platforms focuses on the hardware details, while
   little information is given regarding software design and control
   algorithm implementation. This paper presents the design,
   implementation, and validation of an experimental helicopter platform
   with a primary focus on a software framework optimized for controller
   development. In order to validate the operation of this platform and
   provide a basis for comparison with more sophisticated nonlinear
   designs, a PID controller with feedforward gravity compensation is
   derived using the generally accepted small helicopter model and tested
   experimentally.}},

Abstract = {{Fast and accurate selective harmonic detection has crucial value for
   many power system harmonic compensation systems. The existing detection
   methods are known to have a few drawbacks, such as long delay time,
   sensitivity to grid frequency variation, and difficulty to achieve zero
   steady-state error. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper
   proposes a selective harmonic detection system based on the three-phase
   cascaded delayed signal cancellation phase-locked loop. The system can
   be flexibly configured to detect any individual harmonic from the source
   with various background harmonics. It also features very short transient
   and excellent adaptability under small and considerable frequency
   variations, as verified by comprehensive experimental results. Finally,
   this paper provides guidance on how to tailor the detection system for
   different applications and a solution to address the practical
   implementation issues.}},

Title = {{String-like cooperative motion in homogeneous melting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Despite the fundamental nature and practical importance of melting,
   there is still no generally accepted theory of this ubiquitous
   phenomenon. Even the earliest simulations of melting of hard discs by
   Alder and Wainwright indicated the active role of collective atomic
   motion in melting and here we utilize molecular dynamics simulation to
   determine whether these correlated motions are similar to those found in
   recent studies of glass-forming (GF) liquids and other condensed,
   strongly interacting, particle systems. We indeed find string-like
   collective atomic motion in our simulations of ``superheated{''} Ni
   crystals, but other observations indicate significant differences from
   GF liquids. For example, we observe neither stretched exponential
   structural relaxation, nor any decoupling phenomenon, while we do find a
   boson peak, findings that have strong implications for understanding the
   physical origin of these universal properties of GF liquids. Our
   simulations also provide a novel view of ``homogeneous{''} melting in
   which a small concentration of interstitial defects exerts a powerful
   effect on the crystal stability through their initiation and propagation
   of collective atomic motion. These relatively rare point defects are
   found to propagate down the strings like solitons, driving the
   collective motion. Crystal integrity remains preserved when the
   permutational atomic motions take the form of ring-like atomic
   exchanges, but a topological transition occurs at higher temperatures
   where the rings open to form linear chains similar in geometrical form
   and length distribution to the strings of GF liquids. The local symmetry
   breaking effect of the open strings apparently destabilizes the local
   lattice structure and precipitates crystal melting. The crystal defects
   are thus not static entities under dynamic conditions, such as elevated
   temperatures or material loading, but rather are active agents
   exhibiting a rich nonlinear dynamics that is not addressed in
   conventional ``static{''} defect melting models. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) was applied to
   investigate the adsorption characteristics of polyacrylamide-based
   polymers (PAMs) on anisotropic basal planes of kaolinite. Kaolinite
   basal planes were differentiated by depositing kaolinite nanoparticles
   (KNPs) on silica and alumina sensors in solutions of controlled pH
   values. Adsorption of an in-house synthesized organic inorganic
   Al(OH)(3)-PAM (Al-PAM) as an example of cationic hybrid PAM and a
   commercially available partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (MF1011) as
   an example of anionic PAM was studied. Cationic Al-PAM was found to
   adsorb irreversibly and preferentially on tetrahedral silica basal
   planes of kaolinite. In contrast, anionic MF1011 adsorbed strongly on
   aluminum-hydroxy basal planes, while its adsorption on tetrahedral
   silica basal planes was weak and reversible. Adsorption study revealed
   that both electrostatic attraction and hydrogen-bonding mechanisms
   contribute to adsorption of PAMs on kaolinite. The adsorbed Al-PAM layer
   was able to release trapped water overtime and became more compact,
   while MF1011 film became more dissipative as backbones stretched out
   from kaolinite surface with minimal overlapping. Experimental results
   obtained from this study provide clear insights into the phenomenon that
   governs flocculation-based solid-liquid separation processes using
   multicomponent flocculants of anionic and cationic nature,}},

Abstract = {{Specificity of the class ha bacteriocin Leucocin A (LeuA), an
   antimicrobial peptide active against Gram-positive bacteria, including
   Listeria monocytogenes, is known to be dictated by the C-terminal
   amphipathic helical region, including the extended hairpin-like
   structure. However, its specificity when attached to a substrate has not
   been investigated. Exploiting properties of LeuA, we have synthesized
   two LeuA derivatives, which span the amphipathic helical region of the
   wild-type LeuA, consisting of 14- (14AA LeuA, CWGEAFSAGVHRLA) and
   24-amino acid residues (24AA LeuA, CSVNWGEAFSAGVHRLAN-GGNGFW). The
   peptides were purified to >95\% purity, as shown by analytical RP-HPLC
   and mass spectrometry. By including an N-terminal cysteine group, the
   tailored peptide fragments were readily immobilized at the gold
   interfaces. The resulting thickness and molecular orientation,
   determined by ellipsometry and grazing angle infrared spectroscopy,
   respectively, indicated that the peptides were covalently immobilized in
   a random helical orientation. The bacterial specificity of the anchored
   peptide fragments was tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative
   bacteria. Our results showed that the adsorbed 14AA LeuA exhibited no
   specificity toward the bacterial strains, whereas the
   surface-immobilized 24AA LeuA displayed significant binding toward
   Gram-positive bacteria with various binding affinities from one strain
   to another. The 14AA LeuA did not show binding as this fragment is most
   likely too short in length for recognition by the membrane-bound
   receptor on the target bacterial cell membrane. These results support
   the potential use of class ha bacteriocins as molecular recognition
   elements in biosensing platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Using a chirped pulse probe technique, we have obtained single-shot
   measurements of temporal evolution of ac conductivity at 1.55 eV (800
   nm) during electron energy relaxation in nonequilibrium warm dense gold
   with energy densities up to 4.1 MJ/kg (8 x 10(10) J/m(3)). The results
   uncover important changes that have been masked in an earlier
   experiment. Equally significant, they provide valuable tests of an ab
   initio model for the calculation of electron heat capacity, electron-ion
   coupling, and ac conductivity in a single, first principles framework.
   While measurements of the real part of ac conductivity corroborate our
   theoretical temperature-dependent electron heat capacity, they point to
   an electron-ion coupling factor of similar to 2.2 x 10(16) W/m(3) K,
   significantly below that predicted by theory. In addition, measurements
   of the imaginary part of ac conductivity reveal the need to improve
   theoretical treatment of intraband contributions at very low photon

   polarization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a theory to delineate the consequences of
   finite solvent polarization in electric double layer interaction or the
   osmotic pressure between two similar or oppositely charged surfaces. We
   use previously published Langevin-Bikerman equations to calculate this
   electric double layer interaction force or the osmotic pressure between
   the charged surfaces. The osmotic pressure between oppositely charged
   surfaces is found to be much larger than that between similarly charged
   surfaces, and for either case, the influence of solvent polarization
   ensures a larger pressure than that predicted by the Poisson-Boltzmann
   (PB) model. We derive distinct scaling relationships to explain the
   increase of the pressure as a function of the separation between the
   surfaces, the solvent polarizability, and the number density of water
   molecules. Most importantly, we demonstrate that our theory can
   successfully reproduce the experimental results of interaction force
   between similar and oppositely charged surfaces, by accounting for the
   large under-prediction made by the corresponding PB model. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A novel device was designed to measure drainage dynamics of thin liquid
   films confined between a solid particle, an immiscible liquid droplet,
   and/or gas bubble. Equipped with a bimorph force sensor, a
   computer-interfaced video capture, and a data acquisition system, the
   newly designed integrated thin film drainage apparatus (ITFDA) allows
   for the direct and simultaneous measurements of force barrier, true film
   drainage time, and bubble/droplet deformation under a well controlled
   external force, receding and advancing contact angles, capillary force,
   and adhesion (detachment) force between an air bubble or oil droplet and
   a solid, a liquid, or an air bubble in an immiscible liquid. Using the
   diaphragm of a high-frequency speaker as the drive mechanism for the air
   bubble or oil droplet attached to a capillary tube, this newly designed
   device is capable of measuring forces over a wide range of hydrodynamic
   conditions, including bubble approach and retract velocities up to 50
   mm/s and displacement range up to 1 mm. The results showed that the
   ITFDA was capable of measuring hydrodynamic resistance, film drainage
   time, and other important physical parameters between air bubbles and
   solid particles in aqueous solutions. As an example of illustrating the
   versatility, the ITFDA was also applied to other important systems such
   as interactions between air bubble and oil droplet, two air bubbles, and
   two oil droplets in an aqueous solution.}},

Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3610-3627}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the behavior of confined fluid in the gap
   between a sphere and a flat plate by examining the curve of free energy
   of the system versus size of the new phase. Four possible situations
   corresponding to new phase formation out of confined liquid or vapor at
   pressures above or below the saturation pressure are studied. Using
   surface thermodynamics, the feasible shape of the meniscus
   (concave/convex), the possibility of phase transition, as well as the
   number and the nature (unstable/stable) of equilibrium states have been
   determined for each of these four situations. The effects of equilibrium
   contact angle, separation distance of confinement surfaces, and sphere
   size have been studied. We show that the number and nature of
   equilibrium states, along with the effect of different parameters in
   these four possible situations, can be well described under two
   categories of new phase formation with (a) concave or (b) convex
   meniscus. Our results reveal that in the sphere-plate gap, stable
   coexistence of the liquid and vapor phases is only possible when the
   meniscus is concave (which corresponds to either capillary condensation
   or capillary evaporation), and when the sphere and plate are separated
   by a distance less than a critical amount (where that critical amount is
   always less than the Kelvin radius). With convex menisci, no stable
   coexistence of liquid and vapor phase is possible.}},

Title = {{Oxygen profiles in biofilms undergoing endogenous respiration}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{220}},
Pages = {{452-458}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of oxygen consumption related to oxygen distribution in
   biofilms is crucial to understand what is really happening in the
   biofilm endogenous metabolism. In this article, mature biofilms were
   taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant for lab-scale
   experiments. A pH 7 buffer solution was used as influent instead of
   wastewater, indicating the absence of an external input of substrate.
   Oxygen distribution was measured in the next approximately 130 h at
   different locations in the biofilm. Two distinct trends in oxygen
   profiles in the biofilm were observed during endogenous respiration. In
   the first period under starved condition, oxygen penetrated more and
   more deeply in the biofilm with time, which is related to the smaller
   endogenous oxygen uptake rate. This phenomenon agrees with the
   traditional endogenous respiration theory developed in activated sludge
   systems. However, opposite trends were observed as the time passed by,
   where oxygen penetration became shallower again. A diffusion-reaction
   model concerning the generation and utilization of electron-donor
   substrate during endogenous respiration was proposed and agreed well
   with the changes in the measured oxygen profiles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{531}},
Pages = {{277-283}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The present study reports the effect of fabrication conditions and
   environmental conditions, such as anodization voltage and aging period,
   on the wetting of zirconium dioxide nanotube (ZrNT) surfaces. Comparing
   with intact zirconium foil, which was inherently less hydrophilic,
   possessing an approximate contact angle of 60-70 degrees, the as-formed
   ZrNT surfaces were much hydrophilic with an approximate contact angle of
   18 degrees. However, the hydrophilicity of the surfaces exhibited a
   decrease when the nanotubular opening diameters decreased while
   maintaining the nanotubular layer thickness. This phenomenon was
   attributed to the balance of capillary force and force generated by
   compressed air in the ZrNTs. The annealing treatment further increased
   the hydrophilic property of the ZrNTs. In addition, it was found that
   the wettability of ZrNTs, when aged in air over a period of 105 days,
   demonstrated a decrease in hydrophilic characteristics and exhibited, to
   some extent, an increase in hydrophobic characteristics. It was believed
   that the surface wettability was able to be changed due to the
   decreasing content of hydroxyl groups in ambient atmosphere. This work
   can provide guidelines for improving the structural and environmental
   conditions responsible for changing surface wettability of ZrNT surfaces
   for biomedical application. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents the behaviors of a liquid bridge when being
   compressed and stretched in a quasi-static fashion between two solid
   surfaces that have contact angle hysteresis (CAR). A theoretical model
   is developed to obtain the profiles of the liquid bridge given a
   specific separation between the surfaces. Different from previous
   models, both contact lines in the upper and lower surfaces were allowed
   to move when the contact angles reach their advancing or receding
   values. When the contact angles are between their advancing and receding
   values, the contact lines are pinned while the contact angles adjust to
   accommodate the changes in separation. Effects of CAH on both asymmetric
   and symmetric liquid bridges were analyzed. The model was shown to be
   able to correctly predict the behavior of the liquid bridge during a
   quasi-static compression/stretching loading cycle in experiments.
   Because of CAR, the liquid bridge can have two different profiles at the
   same separation during one loading and unloading cycle, and more
   profiles can be obtained during multiple cycles. The maximum adhesion
   force generated by the liquid bridge is found to be influenced by the
   CAR of surfaces. CAR also leads to energy cost during a loading cycle of
   the liquid bridge. In addition, the minimum separation between the two
   solid surfaces is shown to affect how the contact radii and angles
   change on the two surfaces as the liquid bridge is stretched.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a new class of optical Fabry-Perot-based ultrasound
   detectors using low acoustic impedance glancing angle deposited (GLAD)
   films is demonstrated. GLAD is a single-step physical vapor-deposition
   (PVD) technique used to fabricate porous nanostructured thin films.
   Using titanium dioxide (TiO2), a transparent semiconductor with a high
   refractive index (n = 2.4), the GLAD technique can be employed to
   fabricate samples with tailored nano-porosity, refractive index
   periodicities, and high Q-factor reflectance spectra. The average
   acoustic impedance of the porous films is lower than bulk materials
   which will improve acoustic coupling, especially for high acoustic
   frequencies. For this work, two filters with high reflection in the
   C-band range and high transparency in the visible range (similar to
   80\%) using GLAD films were fabricated. A 23 mu m Parylene C layer was
   sandwiched between these two GLAD films in order to form a GLAD Fabry
   Perot Interferometer (GLAD-FPI). A high speed tunable continuous
   wavelength C-band laser was focused at the FPI and the reflection was
   measured using a high speed photodiode. The ultrasound pressure
   modulated the optical thickness of the FPI and hence its reflectivity.
   The fabricated sensor was tested using a 10 MHz unfocused transducer.
   The ultrasound transducer was calibrated using a hydrophone. The minimum
   detectable acoustic pressure was measured as 80 +/- 20 Pa and the -3dB
   bandwidth was measured to be 18 MHz. This ultra-sensitive sensor can be
   an alternative to piezoelectric ultrasound transducers for any
   techniques in which ultrasound waves need to be detected including
   ultrasonic and photoacoustic imaging modalities. We demonstrate our
   GLAD-FPI for photoacoustic signal detection in optical-resolution
   photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM). To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the first time that a FPI fabricated using the GLAD method has been used
   for ultra-sensitive ultrasound detection. (c) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we assess the validity of two alternative tube-load
   models for describing the relationship between central aortic and
   peripheral arterial blood pressure (BP) waveforms in humans. In
   particular, a single-tube (1-TL) model and a serially connected two-tube
   (2-TL) model, both terminated with a Windkessel load, are considered as
   candidate representations of central aortic-peripheral arterial path.
   Using the central aortic, radial and femoral BP waveform data collected
   from eight human subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass graft with
   cardiopulmonary bypass procedure, the fidelity of the tube-load models
   was quantified and compared with each other. Both models could fit the
   central aortic-radial and central aortic-femoral BP waveform pairs
   effectively. Specifically, the models could estimate pulse travel time
   (PTT) accurately, and the model-derived frequency response was also
   close to the empirical transfer function estimate obtained directly from
   the central aortic and peripheral BP waveform data. However, 2-TL model
   was consistently superior to 1-TL model with statistical significance as
   far as the accuracy of the central aortic BP waveform was concerned.
   Indeed, the average waveform RMSE was 2.52 mmHg versus 3.24 mmHg for
   2-TL and 1-TL models, respectively (p < 0.05); the r(2) value between
   measured and estimated central aortic BP waveforms was 0.96 and 0.93 for
   2-TL and 1-TL models, respectively (p < 0.05). We concluded that the
   tube-load models considered in this paper are valid representations that
   can accurately reproduce central aortic-radial/femoral BP waveform
   relationships in humans, although the 2-TL model is preferred if an
   accurate central aortic BP waveform is highly desired.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that it is necessary to use a minimum of six
   accelerometers to determine the general motion of a rigid body. Using
   this minimum number of accelerometers generally requires that a
   nonlinear differential equation be solved for the angular velocity and
   that the estimate of angular velocity that is obtained from the solution
   of this equation be used in the calculation of the specific force at a
   point. This paper serves two main purposes. First it discusses, for the
   first time, the geometric conditions that must be satisfied by an
   arrangement of six accelerometers so that it is possible, in principle,
   to determine the motion of the body to which they are attached. Second,
   a special class of minimal accelerometer configurations that yields
   angular acceleration as a linear combination of accelerometer
   measurements is identified, and a design methodology for this special
   class is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The signed directed graph (SDG) model can be considered as a qualitative
   model to describe the variables and their cause-effect relations in a
   continuous process. Such models can allow one to obtain the fault
   propagation paths using the method of graph search. In this way, the
   authors can use SDGs to model and analyse the propagation of faults in
   large-scale industrial systems. However, with increasing system scales,
   the time requirements of a graph search method would be too onerous.
   This can be alleviated by transforming a single-layer SDG model into a
   hierarchical model to improve search efficiency. The hierarchical model
   would be composed of three layers: the top layer would consist of
   independent sub-systems; the middle layer would have control systems
   configuration and the bottom layer would have all the variables. The
   possible root causes of faults can then be searched in this model, layer
   by layer according to the initial response of the system. The efficacy
   of the proposed approach is illustrated by application to a four-tank
   system and a generator system in a power plant. The methodology
   presented here can also be used in process hazard analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In the diagnosis of skin melanoma by analyzing histopathological images,
   the detection of the melanocytes in the epidermis area is an important
   step. However, the detection of melanocytes in the epidermis area is
   difficult because other keratinocytes that are very similar to the
   melanocytes are also present. This paper proposes a novel computer-aided
   technique for segmentation of the melanocytes in the skin
   histopathological images. In order to reduce the local intensity
   variant, a mean-shift algorithm is applied for the initial segmentation
   of the image. A local region recursive segmentation algorithm is then
   proposed to filter out the candidate nuclei regions based on the domain
   prior knowledge. To distinguish the melanocytes from other keratinocytes
   in the epidermis area, a novel descriptor, named local double ellipse
   descriptor (LDED), is proposed to measure the local features of the
   candidate regions. The LDED uses two parameters: region ellipticity and
   local pattern characteristics to distinguish the melanocytes from the
   candidate nuclei regions. Experimental results on 28 different
   histopathological images of skin tissue with different zooming factors
   show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance.}},

Abstract = {{The simulation of counter-current capillary imbibition displacement in a
   fractured porous medium is performed using a two-color Lattice Boltzmann
   Model (LBM). The kerosene-water interface development is studied at the
   pore-scale, and the saturation profiles are compared with core-scale
   experimental results by Hatiboglu and Babadagli (2008). An additional
   simulation is performed for a relatively larger porous system, which
   displays a relatively stable saturation growth. A relative permeability
   curve is obtained for the counter-current displacement process and it is
   compared with the corresponding co-current situation. The relative
   permeability of non-wetting (oleic) phase shows a concave nature i.e.,
   initial increase followed by a subsequent decrease. Such a trend can be
   explained by the fact that the resident oil is displaced more easily in
   the initial water saturation stages until the peak of the relative
   permeability curve, after which the presence of water hinders further
   displacement of the trapped oil. Further, counter-current relative
   permeability curves are obtained for different values of equilibrium
   contact angles and interfacial tensions. The model can be used as a
   basis for further LBM counter-current simulations and to study the
   qualitative and quantitative nature of this physical process. Likewise,
   the relative permeability curves obtained can be useful data and
   provides qualitative insights in the simulation of waterflooding in
   naturally fractured reservoirs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{One of the major causes of failure in cancer chemotherapy is multidrug
   resistance (MDR), where cancer cells simultaneously become resistant to
   different anticancer drugs. Over-expression of membrane efflux pumps
   like P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that recognizes different chemotherapeutic
   agents and transports them out of the cell, plays a major role in MDR.
   The shortcoming of P-gp inhibitors in clinic has been attributed to
   their non-specific action on P-gp and/or non-selective distribution to
   non-target organs that leads to intolerable side effects by the P-gp
   inhibitor at doses required for P-gp inhibition upon systemic
   administration. Another major issue is the reduced elimination of P-gp
   substrates (e.g. anticancer drugs) and intolerable toxicities by
   anticancer drugs when co-administered with P-gp inhibitors. To overcome
   these shortcomings, new generation of P-gp inhibitors with improved
   specificity for P-gp have been developed. More recently, attention has
   been paid to the use of drug delivery systems primarily to restrict P-gp
   inhibition to tumor and reduce the non-selective inhibition of P-gp in
   non-target organs. This review will provide an overview and update on
   the status of P-gp inhibition approaches and the role of drug delivery
   systems in overcoming P-gp mediated MDR.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the issues associated with the development of
   data-driven models as well as model update strategy for soft sensor
   applications. A practical yet effective solution is proposed. Key
   process variables that are difficult to measure are commonly encountered
   in practice due to limitations of measurement techniques. Even with
   appropriate instruments, some measurements are only available through
   off-line laboratory analysis with typical sampling intervals of several
   hours. Soft sensors are inferential models that can provide continuous
   on-line prediction of hidden variables; such models are capable of
   combining real-time measurements with off-line lab data. Due to the
   prevalence of plant-model mismatch, it is important to update the model
   using the latest reference data. In this paper, parameters of
   data-driven models are estimated using particle filters under the
   framework of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms. A Bayesian
   methodology for model calibration strategy is formulated. The proposed
   framework for soft sensor development is applied to an industrial
   process to provide on-line prediction of a quality variable. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In process plants, alarms are configured to notify operators of any
   abnormalities or faults. However, in practice a majority of raised
   alarms are false or nuisance and create problems for operators as they
   face an increasing number of alarms to handle. Adding delay-timers is a
   simple technique that can reduce this problem and is widely exercised in
   industry. In this work we propose a generalized delay-timer framework
   where instead of consecutive n samples in the conventional case, n(1)
   out of n consecutive samples (n(1) <= n) are considered to raise an
   alarm. For the generalized delay-timer, three important performance
   indices, namely, the false alarm rate (FAR), the missed alarm rate (MAR)
   and the expected detection delay (EDD), are calculated using Markov
   processes. Moreover, the performance and sensitivity of generalized
   delay-timers are compared with conventional delay-timers. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This work presents algorithms for improved fixed-time performance of
   Lyapunov-based economic model predictive control (LEMPC) of nonlinear
   systems. Unlike conventional Lyapunov-based model predictive control
   (LMPC) schemes which typically utilize a quadratic cost function and
   regulate a process at a steady-state, LEMPC designs very often dictate
   time-varying operation to optimize an economic (typically non-quadratic)
   cost function. The LEMPC algorithms proposed here utilize a shrinking
   prediction horizon with respect to fixed (but potentially large)
   operation period to ensure improved performance, measured by the desired
   economic cost, over conventional LMPC by solving auxiliary LMPC problems
   and incorporating appropriate constraints, based on the LMPC solution,
   in their formulations at various sampling times. The proposed LEMPC
   schemes also take advantage of a predefined Lyapunov-based explicit
   feedback law to characterize their stability region while maintaining
   the closed-loop system state in an invariant set subject to bounded
   process disturbances. The LEMPC algorithms are demonstrated through a
   nonlinear chemical process example. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the context of process industries, outlying observations mostly
   represent a large random error resulting from irregular process
   disturbances, instrument failures, or transmission problems. Statistical
   analysis of process data contaminated with outliers may lead to biased
   parameter estimation and plant-model mismatch. The problem of process
   identification in the presence of outliers has received great attention
   and a wide variety of outlier identification approaches have been
   proposed. However, there is a great need to seek for more general
   solutions and a robust framework to deal with different types of
   outliers. The main objective of this work is to formulate and solve the
   robust process identification problem under a Bayesian framework. The
   proposed solution strategy not only yields maximum a posteriori
   estimates of model parameters but also provides hyperparameters that
   determine data quality as well as prior distribution of model
   parameters. Identification of a simulated continuous fermentation
   reactor is considered to show the effectiveness and robustness of the
   proposed Bayesian framework. The advantages of the method are further
   illustrated through an experimental case study of a pilot-scale
   continuous stirred tank heater. (C) 2012 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{The purification of different components of air, such as oxygen,
   nitrogen, and argon, is an important industrial process. Pressure swing
   adsorption (PSA) is surpassing the traditional cryogenic distillation
   for many air separation applications, because of its lower energy
   consumption. Unfortunately, the oxygen product purity in an industrial
   PSA process is typically limited to 95\% due to the presence of argon
   which always shows the same adsorption equilibrium properties as oxygen
   on most molecular sieves. Recent work investigating the adsorption of
   nitrogen, oxygen and argon on the surface of silver-exchanged Engelhard
   Titanosilicate-10 (ETS-10), indicates that this molecular sieve is
   promising as an adsorbent capable of producing high-purity oxygen.
   High-purity oxygen (99.7+\%) was generated using a bed of Ag-ETS-10
   granules to separate air (78\% N-2, 21\% O-2, 1\% Ar) at 25 degrees C

Abstract = {{This paper describes the mechanical response of lightweight mortars
   subjected to impact loading in flexure. Expanded perlite aggregate with
   a bulk density of 64 kg/m(3) was used at between 0 and 8 times by volume
   of Portland cement to yield a range of mortars with density between 1000
   and 2000 kg/m3. Some specimens were reinforced with a polypropylene
   microfibre at 0.1\% volume fraction and the dynamic fracture toughness
   was evaluated by means of an instrumented drop-weight impact system.
   Companion tests were carried out in compression under quasi-static
   loading to standardise the mixes. The compressive strength and elastic
   modulus scale as the cube of the relative density, defined as the ratio
   of the density of the mortar to that of Portland cement paste. Whereas
   the flexural strength and fracture toughness were both linearly
   proportional to the relative density of the mortar under quasi-static
   loading, there was an increase in their sensitivity to relative density
   at higher loading rates. Contrary to what is seen in regular concrete,
   fibre reinforcement led to an increase in the stress-rate sensitivity of
   flexural strength in lightweight mortars. For the same impact velocity,
   the stress-rates experienced by a specimen was strongly influenced by
   its density. While the stress-rate sensitivity of flexural strength
   dropped with a decrease in the mix density, that of the fracture
   toughness was consistently higher for the lighter mixes. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The idea of a multi-coating has been used extensively in the design of
   invisibility cloaks in which the objective is to achieve
   near-invisibility of a particular structure. To this end, this paper is
   concerned with the internal stress field of an elastic inclusion of
   arbitrary shape bonded to the surrounding matrix through multiple
   coatings when the matrix is subjected to remote uniform anti-plane
   stresses. For any number of intermediate coatings, we identify
   non-elliptical shapes of the inclusion leading to an internal uniform
   stress field. The problem is solved analytically for an inclusion of
   arbitrary shape with two coatings, and iteratively for an inclusion of
   arbitrary shape with three or more coatings. Our results indicate that
   the shape of an inclusion permitting an internal uniform stress field
   can essentially be arbitrary when the number of the coatings is
   sufficiently large.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced survival mechanisms of malignant cells in combination with
   elevated levels of drug transporters can sustain an undesirable
   resistance against drug therapy. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery
   against targets involved in aberrant mechanisms is a promising approach
   and we hypothesize that simultaneous silencing of multiple targets could
   prove more advantageous than common approach to silence individual
   targets. To explore this approach, we targeted anti-apoptotic proteins
   myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) and survivin along with the efflux pump
   P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Polymeric
   siRNA delivery was employed for this purpose by using small
   polyethylenimine (PEI) substituted with lipids. While silencing Mcl-1
   caused similar to 90\% cell death in wild-type cells, this effect was
   less significant in P-gp over-expressing cells. An additive effect for
   Mcl-1 and P-gp silencing was evident in the latter cells, where
   simultaneous silencing of these targets created a significantly higher
   effect compared with silencing each individual target. Prolonged
   exposure of wild-type cells to doxorubicin (DOX) resulted in
   upregulation of P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein, survivin and
   Mcl-1. Dual silencing of P-gp and Mcl-1 again resulted in an additive
   effect in resistance-induced cells, which displayed an increased
   dependency on Mcl-1 for survival. Cytotoxic effect of DOX was also
   enhanced in resistance-induced cells after silencing Mcl-1. We conclude
   that polymer-mediated siRNA delivery can silence multiple targets
   simultaneously and reverse drug resistance. Cancer Gene Therapy (2013)

Title = {{Influence of climate change mitigation technology on global demands of

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Globally, electricity generation accounts for a large and potentially
   growing water demand, and as such is an important component to
   assessments of global and regional water scarcity. However, the current
   suite-as well as potential future suite-of thermoelectric generation
   technologies has a very wide range of water demand intensities, spanning
   two orders of magnitude. As such, the evolution of the generation mix is
   important for the future water demands of the sector. This study uses
   GCAM, an integrated assessment model, to analyze the global electric
   sector's water demands in three futures of climate change mitigation
   policy and two technology strategies. We find that despite five- to
   seven-fold expansion of the electric sector as a whole from 2005 to
   2095, global electric sector water withdrawals remain relatively stable,
   due to the retirement of existing power plants with water-intensive
   once-through flow cooling systems. In the scenarios examined here,
   climate policies lead to the large-scale deployment of advanced,
   low-emissions technologies such as carbon dioxide capture and storage
   (CCS), concentrating solar power, and engineered geothermal systems. In
   particular, we find that the large-scale deployment of CCS technologies
   does not increase long-term water consumption from hydrocarbon-fueled
   power generation as compared with a no-policy scenario without CCS.
   Moreover, in sensitivity scenarios where low-emissions electricity
   technologies are required to use dry cooling systems, we find that the
   consequent additional costs and efficiency reductions do not limit the
   utility of these technologies in achieving cost-effective whole-system
   emissions mitigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The relationship between the cell size and the amount of carbide

Abstract = {{Statement of problem. A new elastomeric impression material, a vinyl
   polyether silicone, has been commercially introduced. Its dimensional
   stability at different pouring times has not been reported.
   Purpose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dimensional
   stability of vinyl polyether silicone (VPES) impressions as a function
   of delayed-pouring time for up to 2 weeks after performing a recommended
   clinical disinfection procedure.
   Material and methods. The 3 medium-body impression materials tested were
   EXA'lence 370, Imprint 3, and Impregum Penta soft. Impressions of a
   cylindrical metal model, which served as a control, were made and poured
   in a Type V stone after being disinfected in 2.5\% buffered
   glutaraldehyde solution. Die diameter and anteroposterior and cross-arch
   measurements on each cast were made and compared to direct measurements
   of the control with a digital micrometer. The linear dimensional changes
   were compared and analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test (alpha=.05).
   Results. Considering the absolute values for the mean percentage
   dimensional change, VPES cast measurements were below 1.0\% (P<.001),
   with the majority being minimal (<= 0.34\%) at all pour times.
   Measurements of the casts were larger than those of the control in all
   but one specimen. The percentage dimensional changes of the individual
   die diameters were higher than those. of the anteroposterior and
   cross-arch linear measurements. Casts produced from VPES impressions had
   similar dimensional changes to those of VPS at 1 week of storage and
   similar changes to those of PE at 2 weeks of storage. The behavior of
   VPES impressions varied from being the most accurate at immediate-pour
   to gradually exhibiting higher dimensional changes as time progressed.
   Conclusions. Casts produced from a disinfected regular set VPES
   (EXA'lence 370 monophase) demonstrated excellent dimensional stability
   at different pour time and were comparable to the tested VPS and PE
   impression materials. (J Prosthet Dent 2013;109:172-178)}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on steel plate shear walls (SPSWs) and current design
   codes have focused principally on achieving highly ductile behavior
   through stringent detailing requirements. As such, the system is
   generally considered to be economical only in high-seismic regions.
   However, lower demands in other regions may permit the use of more
   economical options. This paper describes a proposed concept for SPSWs
   that meets the intent of capacity design, while greatly improving
   competitiveness in seismic regions where maximum ductility is not
   required. A large-scale, 2-story SPSW specimen was tested to evaluate
   the associated performance. The wall had standard double-angle
   beam-to-column shear connections and was tested under vertical gravity
   load concurrent with reversing lateral loads at each floor level. The
   specimen survived 25 lateral load cycles, 18 of which were in the
   inelastic range. The test results indicated that excellent performance
   can be expected in low-seismic regions, despite significantly reduced
   costs, compared with traditional designs. The shear wall showed stable
   performance at large lateral deformation ratios with high levels of
   ductility and energy dissipation capacity. DOI:

Abstract = {{To address the speeding problem in residential areas, the City of
   Edmonton initiated a pilot project to reduce the posted speed limit from
   50 km/h to 40 km/h within six residential communities. This paper
   investigates the community perceptions of traffic safety within the six
   pilot communities in two phases: prior to project initiation (pre-pilot)
   and following the end of the project (post-pilot). This objective was
   accomplished by analyzing the results of two random dialing telephone
   surveys comprising 300 residents each. A preliminary analysis showed
   compatible demographic configurations for the two samples and confirmed
   that the residents were aware of both the posted speed limits and the
   adopted speed management controls. For the confirmatory factor analysis
   (CFA), a two-group (pre-pilot and post-pilot) three-factor model was
   used to assess the residents' perceptions of the speeding behavior
   (Speeding), their concerns about traffic safety issues (Concerns), and
   their perceptions of traffic safety (Safety). Comparing the CFA results
   of the post-pilot survey versus those of the pre-pilot survey, it was
   evident that there was a significant decrease in Speeding and Concerns
   accompanied by a significant increase in Safety. A structural equations
   model (SEM) was also fitted to the data in order to assess the impact of
   Speeding and Concerns on Safety. The results showed that Concerns
   increase significantly with Speeding, and that both factors have
   significant negative impacts on Safety. However, while the impact of
   Concerns on Safety was direct, that of Speeding on Safety was largely
   indirect (i.e., mediated through Concerns). Overall, the multivariate
   analysis has demonstrated that the pilot project was successful in
   improving the residents' perceptions of traffic safety in their
   community. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Extraction of fuzzy rules from fuzzy decision trees: An axiomatic fuzzy
   sets (AFS) approach}},
Journal = {{DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{1-25}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a new type of coherence membership function
   to describe fuzzy concepts, which builds upon the theoretical findings
   of the Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory. This type of membership
   function embraces both the factor of fuzziness (by capturing subjective
   imprecision) and randomness (by referring to the objective uncertainty)
   and treats both of them in a consistent manner. Furthermore we propose a
   method to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier using coherence
   membership functions. Given the theoretical developments presented
   there, the resulting classification systems are referred to as AFS
   classifiers. The proposed algorithm consists of three major steps: (a)
   generating fuzzy decision trees by assuming some level of specificity
   (detailed view) quantified in terms of threshold; (b) pruning the
   obtained rule-base; and (c) determining the optimal threshold resulting
   in a final tree. Compared with other fuzzy classifiers, the AFS
   classifier exhibits several essential advantages being of practical
   relevance. In particular, the relevance of classification results is
   quantified by associated confidence levels. Furthermore the proposed
   algorithm can be applied to data sets with mixed data type attributes.
   We have experimented with various data commonly present in the
   literature and compared the results with that of SVM, KNN, C4.5, Fuzzy
   Decision Trees (FDTs), Fuzzy SLIQ Decision Tree (FS-DT), FARC-HD and
   FURIA. It has been shown that the accuracy is higher than that being
   obtained by other methods. The results of statistical tests supporting
   comparative analysis show that the proposed algorithm performs
   significantly better than FDTs, FS-DT, KNN and C4.5. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nine oral airway replicas of children 6-14 years old were used for
   measuring deposition of 0.5-6.3 mu m diameter particles during

   a given particle size and inhalation flow rate, deposition in the

   2013. First published December 5, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00821.2012.-In
   animals, the recovery of motoneuron excitability in the months following
   a complete spinal cord injury is mediated, in part, by increases in
   constitutive serotonin (5-HT2) and norepinephrine (alpha(1)) receptor
   activity, which facilitates the reactivation of calcium-mediated
   persistent inward currents (CaPICs) without the ligands serotonin and
   norepinephrine below the injury. In this study we sought evidence for a
   similar role of constitutive monoamine receptor activity in the
   development of spasticity in human spinal cord injury. In chronically
   injured participants with partially preserved sensory and motor
   function, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram facilitated
   long-lasting reflex responses (spasms) previously shown to be mediated
   by CaPICs, suggesting that in incomplete spinal cord injury, functional
   descending sources of monoamines are present to activate monoamine
   receptors below the lesion. However, in participants with motor or
   motor/sensory complete injuries, the inverse agonist cyproheptadine,
   which blocks both ligand and constitutive 5-HT2/alpha(1) receptor
   activity, decreased long-lasting reflexes, whereas the neutral
   antagonist chlorpromazine, which only blocks ligand activation of these
   receptors, had no effect. When tested in noninjured control participants
   having functional descending sources of monoamines, chlorpromazine was
   effective in reducing CaPIC-mediated motor unit activity. On the basis
   of these combined results, it appears that in severe spinal cord injury,
   facilitation of persistent inward currents and muscle spasms is mainly
   mediated by the activation of constitutive 5-HT2 and alpha(1) receptor
   activity. Drugs that more selectively block these constitutively active
   monoamine receptors may provide better oral control of spasticity,
   especially in motor complete spinal cord injury where reducing
   motoneuron excitability is the primary goal.}},

   spinal sensory pathways. Loss or reduction of descending sources of
   serotonin and norepinephrine after spinal cord injury (SCI) and the
   subsequent reduction of 5-HT1/alpha(2) receptor activity contributes, in
   part, to the emergence of excessive motoneuron activation from sensory
   afferent pathways and the uncontrolled triggering of persistent inward
   currents that depolarize motoneurons during muscle spasms. We tested in
   a double-blind, placebo-controlled study whether facilitating 5-HT1B/D
   receptors with the agonist zolmitriptan reduces the sensory activation
   of motoneurons during an H-reflex in both noninjured control and spinal
   cord-injured participants. In both groups zolmitriptan, but not placebo,
   reduced the size of the maximum soleus H-reflex with a peak decrease to
   59\% (noninjured) and 62\% (SCI) of predrug values. In SCI participants
   we also examined the effects of zolmitriptan on the cutaneomuscular
   reflex evoked in tibialis anterior from stimulation to the medial arch
   of the foot. Zolmitriptan, but not placebo, reduced the long-latency,
   polysynaptic component of the cutaneomuscular reflex (first 200 ms of
   reflex) by similar to 50\%. This ultimately reduced the triggering of
   the long-lasting component of the reflex (500 ms poststimulation to end
   of reflex) known to be mediated by persistent inward currents in the
   motoneuron. These results demonstrate that facilitation of 5-HT1B/D
   receptors reduces sensory transmission in both monosynaptic and
   polysynaptic reflex pathways to ultimately reduce long-lasting reflexes
   (spasms) after SCI.}},

Abstract = {{The exceptional strength and distinct deformation physics exhibited by
   pure ultrafine-grained and nanocrystalline metals in comparison to their
   microcrystalline counterparts have been ascribed to the dominant
   influence of grain boundaries in accommodating plastic flow. Such
   grain-boundary-mediated mechanisms can be augmented by additional
   strengthening in nanocrystalline alloys via solute and precipitate
   interactions with dislocations, although its potency is a function of
   the changes in the elastic properties of the alloyed material. In this
   study, we investigate the elastic and plastic properties of Al1-xMox
   alloys (0 <= x <= 0.32) by tensile testing of sputter-deposited
   freestanding thin films. Isotropic elastic constants and strength are
   measured over the composition range for which three microstructural
   regimes are identified, including solid solutions, face-centered cubic
   and amorphous phase mixtures and body-centered cubic (bcc)/amorphous
   mixtures. Whereas the bulk modulus is measured to follow the rule of
   mixtures over the Mo composition range, the Young's and shear moduli do
   not. Poisson's ratio is non-monotonic with increasing Mo content,
   showing a discontinuous change at the onset of the bcc/amorphous
   two-phase region. The strengthening measured in alloyed thin films can
   be adequately predicted in the solid solution regime only by combining
   solute strengthening with a grain boundary pinning model. The
   single-step co-sputtering procedure presented here results in diversity
   of alloy compositions and microstructures, offering a promising avenue
   for tailoring the mechanical behavior of thin films. (C) 2012 Acta

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of opportunistic channel sensing and access
   in cognitive radio networks when the sensing is imperfect and a
   secondary user can access up to a limited number of channels at a time
   is investigated. Primary users' statistical information is assumed to be
   unknown, and therefore, a secondary user needs to learn the information
   online during channel sensing and access process, which means learning
   loss, also referred to as regret, is inevitable. For each channel, the
   busy/idle state is independent from one slot to another. In this
   research, the case when all potential channels can be sensed
   simultaneously is investigated first. The channel access process is
   modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem with side observation. And
   channel access rules are derived and theoretically proved to have
   asymptotically finite regret. Then the case when the secondary user can
   sense only a limited number of channels at a time is investigated. The
   channel sensing and access process is modeled as a bi-level multi-armed
   bandit problem. It is shown that any adaptive rule has at least
   logarithmic regret. Then we derive channel sensing and access rules and
   theoretically prove that they have logarithmic regret asymptotically and
   with finite time. The case when the busy/idle states of a channel are
   correlated over slots is also investigated. And a channel sensing and
   access rule with logarithmic regret is derived. The effectiveness of the
   derived rules is validated by simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific cost prediction is the foundation for formulating a business
   plan, which helps enterprises to determine the target costs and to
   control the operating costs. In today's world, quantitative methods are
   crucial for prediction purposes in cost management. On the basis of
   studying some typical methods of cost prediction, we propose a cost
   prediction method based on an improved fuzzy model. Firstly, owning to
   the inefficiency of existing fuzzifier, such that it is difficult to
   determine the number of fuzzy rules, we present an improved fuzzy
   c-means (FCM) fuzzifier to solve this problem referring to
   ``granulation-degranulation{''} strategy and sample error function.
   Secondly, a fuzzy model based on the improved FCM fuzzifier is
   constructed through combining Takagi-Sugen-Kang fuzzy inference system.
   The algorithm of the improved fuzzy model is also realized by this
   study. Finally, through a series of experimental analyses for steel
   number product and steel class product of certain machinery enterprise,
   the results have demonstrated that the proposed method has the better
   prediction accuracy, which can be used effectively and practically in
   real-world cost prediction.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the temperature distribution of the surfaces of several
   substrates under an impinging gas jet from a cold spray nozzle was
   determined. A low-pressure cold-gas dynamic spraying unit was used to
   generate a jet of hot compressed nitrogen that impinged upon flat
   substrates. Computer codes based on a finite differences method were
   used to solve a simplified 2D temperature distribution equation for the
   substrate to produce nondimensional relationships between the surface
   temperature and the radius of the impinging fluid jet, the axial
   velocity of the cold spray nozzle, the substrate thickness, and the
   heating time. It was found that a single profile of the transient
   nondimensional maximum surface temperature could be used to estimate the
   dimensional maximum surface temperature, regardless of the value of the
   compressed gas temperature. It was found further that, as the thermal
   conductance of the substrate increased, the maximum surface temperature
   of the substrate beneath the gas jet decreased. Heat exchange between
   the substrate and the compressed gas jet during motion of the nozzle to
   produce heat conduction within the substrate was characterized by the
   nondimensional Pecl,t number. It was found that lower Pecl,t numbers
   produced higher temperatures within the substrate. The close agreement
   of the numerical results with the experimental results suggests that the
   nondimensionalized results may be applied to a wide range of conditions
   and materials.}},

Abstract = {{Films of titanium nitride were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   over a range of temperatures from 120 degrees C to 300 degrees C, and
   their deposition rates were characterized by ellipsometry and
   reflectometry. The stress state of the films was evaluated by
   interferometry using a wafer bowing technique and varied from
   compressive (-18 MPa) to tensile (650 MPa). The crystal structure of the
   films was assessed by x-ray diffraction. The grain size varied with
   temperature in the range of 2-9 nm. The chemical composition of the
   films was ascertained by high-resolution x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and showed the presence of O, Cl, and C contaminants. A
   mildly tensile (250 MPa) stressed film was employed for the fabrication
   (by electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching) of doubly
   clamped nanoresonator beams. The resonance frequency of resonators was
   assayed using an interferometric resonance testing apparatus. The
   devices exhibited sharp mechanical resonance peaks in the 17-25MHz
   range. The uniformity and controllable deposition rate of ALD films make
   them ideal candidate materials for the fabrication of ultranarrow (<50
   nm) nanobeam structures. (C) 2013 American Vacuum Society.

   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
   was spray cast to form highly flexible transparent electrodes for
   forward- and inverted-mode organic solar cells (OSCs). A multiple
   solvent ink containing ethylene glycol was developed, and a
   post-deposition annealing step contributed to a high conductivity of
   1070 +/- 50 S cm(-1). Sheet resistance and transmission at a wavelength
   of 550 nm were controlled within 24-259 Omega square(-1) and 71-95\%,
   respectively, which are amongst the best-reported combined
   characteristics. Forward-mode OSCs with spray coated PEDOT:PSS anodes
   yielded a power conversion efficiency of 3.2\%. Mechanical bending and
   stretching tests demonstrated that the flexibility of these PEDOT:PSS
   layers were far superior to that of ITO: elastic moduli were reduced by
   more than an order of magnitude, and the resistance increased far more
   slowly under both uniaxial stretching and bending to progressively
   smaller radii of curvature. With these experiments, the minimum radii of
   curvature and maximum uniaxial strains at which acceptable performance
   is maintained were investigated. Collectively, our results illustrate a
   promising future for the scalable printing of low-cost PEDOT:PSS-based
   flexible transparent electrodes. Crown (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-aspect-ratio microstructures have been found, in the literature, to
   collapse due to capillary forces of liquids. In this paper, mathematical
   models are developed to study the collapse of a microstructure
   represented by a double cantilever beam (DCB) with a liquid droplet
   located at the free end. Formulations are presented using the classical
   Bernoulli-Euler beam theory as well as an analysis that accounts for
   geometrical nonlinearity. The models introduce rigorous coupling between
   the DCB deformation, the capillary forces, and the meniscus position,
   and have predicted interesting nonlinear behaviors that previous models
   could not. Parameters governing the capillary collapse of the DCB are
   identified, and their influence is discussed. A single dimensionless
   number that controls the condition for collapse is proposed and
   validated against numerical results. Comparison between the linear and

Abstract = {{In this work we present the optimization of zinc oxide (ZnO) film
   properties for a thin-film transistor (TFT) application. Thin films, 50
   +/- 10 nm, of ZnO were deposited by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) under
   a variety of growth conditions. The oxygen pressure, laser fluence,
   substrate temperature and annealing conditions were varied as a part of
   this study. Mobility and carrier concentration were the focus of the
   optimization. While room-temperature ZnO growths followed by air and
   oxygen annealing showed improvement in the (002) phase formation with a
   carrier concentration in the order of 10(17)-10(18)/cm(3) with low
   mobility in the range of 0.01-0.1 cm(2)/V s, a Hall mobility of 8
   cm(2)/V s and a carrier concentration of 5x10(14)/cm(3) have been
   achieved on a relatively low temperature growth (250 A degrees C) of
   ZnO. The low carrier concentration indicates that the number of defects
   have been reduced by a magnitude of nearly a 1000 as compared to the
   room-temperature annealed growths. Also, it was very clearly seen that
   for the (002) oriented films of ZnO a high mobility film is achieved.}},

Pages = {{823-827}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The resolution enhancement of laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) is
   investigated through the pre-patterning of Cr on the donor substrate. 85
   nm dots are first patterned on a microscope slide, and an 800 nm
   wavelength and 130 fs pulse laser with a beam waist of similar to 9 mu m
   is used to transfer the Cr dots to an acceptor substrate. The threshold
   fluence is found to be similar to 0.15 the threshold fluence of a
   similar continuous film, which is thought to be due to the fact that no
   force is needed to tear away Cr from the film itself, unlike in a
   continuous film experiment. Since the volume of the material limits the
   transfer feature sizes instead of the laser parameters, as in a
   continuous film system, minimum transferable feature diameters are
   significantly lower compared to the continuous film case. Also, the
   transferred feature diameters are not dependent on the laser parameters,
   so the diameters are consistent across a wide range of fluences. The
   force per unit area generated by the laser at threshold fluence is
   estimated to be similar to 3 GPa, which is consistent with previous
   results in the literature. The simplified model that our pre-patterned
   Cr LIFT experiment represents would make it an ideal case for
   benchmarking molecular dynamics simulations of femtosecond laser
   ablation.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{47-58}},

Abstract = {{For the first time, the concept of embedded thermal elements as an
   anti-icing system for polymer composite airfoils used in wind turbine
   blades and aircraft wing structures is proposed, and developed
   experimentally and numerically. A manufacturing technique was developed
   to implement the electro-thermal anti-icing system in the form of
   discrete constantan thermal elements with a specific pattern inside the
   composite airfoil. Thermography was used to understand the surface
   temperature distribution of the composite airfoil surface in cold (dry)
   and icing (wet) condition tests. Two composite airfoil samples with two
   different thermal elements' patterns were made to study the effect of
   wires' spacing on the airfoils' surface temperature distribution, and
   the effectiveness of the thermal elements' pattern for icing mitigation.
   Thermal elements of the anti-icing systems were energized by using two
   different power schemes to determine and adjust the required power to
   have an ice free composite airfoil, and adjust the amount of power
   consumption. A numerical thermal analysis was performed to determine the
   power threshold in the anti-icing system to prevent thermal degradation
   of the polymer composite. Thermal modeling was also used to explain some
   of the experimental observations. Experimental data and thermal analysis
   are in a good agreement, indicating the feasibility of using thermal
   elements as anti-icing system for surface heating in order to prevent
   ice accretion on polymer composite airfoils. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   dispersion profiles. Comparison between our SPIONs@PRs hybrid
   nano-compound and the commercial SPION compound, Endorem (R), showed a
   higher transverse relaxivity for SPIONs@PRs. In vitro MRI experiments
   showed that our SPIONs@PRs produces better negative contrast compared to

   proved unsuccessful. The acidic fraction of NAs is fluorescent but the
   basic fraction of NAs is not fluorescent, implying that aromatic acids
   in NAs give rise to the fluorescent signals. The concentrations of NAs
   in oil sands process water were measured by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), fluorescence spectrophotometry and ultra high
   performance liquid chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry
   (UPLC-TOF/MS). Commercial Merichem and Kodak NAs are the best standards
   to use when measuring NAs concentration with FTIR and fluorescence
   spectrophotometry. In addition, the NAs concentrations measured by
   fluorescence spectrophotometry are about 30times higher than those
   measured by FTIR and UPLC-TOF/MS. The findings in this study underscore
   the limitation of fluorescence spectrophotometry in the measurement of
   NAs.}},

Abstract = {{Different lines of evidence suggest an abnormal cerebral energy
   metabolism as being critical to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
   However, it is unknown as to whether levels of creatine (Cr) would be
   involved in these anomalies. The study involved 33 unmedicated first
   episode psychosis patients and 41 healthy controls. Proton magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was performed at 3 T using a long TE
   (TE/TM/TR of 240/27/3000 ms) such that within the total phosphocreatine
   (PCr) plus Cr signal (tCr240), mainly Cr was detectable. The target
   region was an 18 cm3 prefrontal volume. A negative association was found
   between age of patients and tCr240 levels referenced to internal water,
   with 20\% of the variance in tCr240 accounted for by Age. A secondary
   finding revealed 16\% reduction of tCr240 levels in patients, solely
   when comparing participants older than the median age of patients. No
   association existed between tCr240 levels and clinical variables. These
   findings support previous data reporting abnormalities in brain creatine
   kinase isoenzymes involved with the maintenance of energy pools in
   schizophrenia. The implications of using a long TE are discussed in
   terms of the relative proportions of Cr and PCr within the tCr240
   signal, and of potential group differences in T2 times. Magn Reson Med,

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigate single phase fluid flow through
   microchannels with integrated micropillars to calculate the pressure
   drop and flow resistance. The microchannels, which contain micropillars
   arranged in square and staggered arrangement, are fabricated in silicon
   substrate using standard photolithography and deep reactive ion etching
   (DRIE) techniques. The DRIE technique results in precise and accurate
   fabrication with smooth and vertical wall profiles. Pressure drop
   measurements are performed on microchannels with integrated micropillars
   under creeping flow regime over a range of water flow rates from 50 to
   600 mu l/min. It is observed that the pressure drop varies linearly with
   increasing flow rates. Flow resistance ( ) is calculated using the
   pressure drop values and is found to be decreasing as the Darcy number
   () increases. In general, the square arrangement of pillars offers
   higher resistance to flow than their staggered counterparts. It is
   observed that the existing theoretical models fail to accurately predict
   the permeability of the microchannel with integrated micro-pillars,
   particularly for cases where the micropillars have smooth and accurate
   geometric conformity, as obtained in the microfabricated structures used

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has recently seen
   increased use in the design of pharmaceutical inhalers. The use of CFD
   in the design of inhalers is made difficult by the complex nature of
   aerosol generation. At present, CFD has provided valuable insight into
   certain aspects of inhaler performance, though limitations in
   computational power have prevented the full implementation of numerical
   methods in the design of inhalers.
   Areas covered: This review examines the application of CFD in the design
   of aerosol drug delivery technologies with a focus on pressurized
   metered-dose inhalers (pMDI), nebulizers and dry powder inhalers (DPIs).
   Challenges associated with the application of CFD in inhaler design are
   discussed along with relevant investigations in the literature.
   Discussions of discrete element modeling (DEM) and the simulation of
   pharmaceutical aerosol dispersion are included.
   Expert opinion: The extreme complexity of coupled fluid and aerosol
   dynamics associated with aerosol generation has somewhat limited the use
   of CFD in inhaler design. Combined CFD-DEM simulations provide a useful
   tool in the design of DPIs, though aerosol generation in pMDIs and
   nebulizers has eluded CFD modeling. The most beneficial use of CFD
   typically occurs when concurrent CFD and experimental analyses are
   performed, significantly enhancing the knowledge provided by experiment
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an SU-8 surface micromachining process using
   amorphous silicon as a sacrificial material, which also incorporates two
   metal layers for electrical excitation. SU-8 is a photo-patternable
   polymer that is used as a structural layer for MEMS and microfluidic
   applications due to its mechanical properties, biocompatibility and low
   cost. Amorphous silicon is used as a sacrificial layer in MEMS
   applications because it can be deposited in large thicknesses, and can
   be released in a dry method using XeF2, which alleviates release-based
   stiction problems related to MEMS applications. In this work, an SU-8
   MEMS process was developed using alpha-Si as a sacrificial layer. Two
   conductive metal electrodes were integrated in this process to allow
   out-of-plane electrostatic actuation for applications like MEMS switches
   and variable capacitors. In order to facilitate more flexibility for
   MEMS designers, the process can fabricate dimples that can be conductive
   or nonconductive. Additionally, this SU-8 process can fabricate SU-8
   MEMS structures of a single layer of two different thicknesses. Process
   parameters were optimized for two sets of thicknesses: thin (5-10 mu m)
   and thick ( 130 mu m). The process was tested fabricating MEMS switches,
   capacitors and thermal actuators.}},

Title = {{Nonlinear disturbance observer design for robotic manipulators}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{253-267}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Robotic manipulators are highly nonlinear and coupled systems that are
   subject to different types of disturbances such as joint frictions,
   unknown payloads, varying contact points, and unmodeled dynamics. These
   disturbances, when unaccounted for, adversely affect the performance of
   the manipulator. Employing a disturbance observer is a common method to
   reject such disturbances. In addition to disturbance rejection,
   disturbance observers can be used in force control applications.
   Recently, research has been done regarding the design of nonlinear
   disturbance observers (NLDOs) for robotic manipulators. In spite of good
   results in terms of disturbance tracking, the previously designed
   nonlinear disturbance observers can merely be used for planar serial
   manipulators with revolute joints {[}Chen, W. H., Ballance, D. J.,
   Gawthorp, P. J., O'Reilly, J. (2000). A nonlinear disturbance observer
   for robotic manipulators. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,
   47 (August (4)), 932-938; Nikoobin, A., Haghighi, R. (2009).
   Lyapunov-based nonlinear disturbance observer for serial n-link
   manipulators. Journal of Intelligent \& Robotic Systems, 55 (July
   (2-3)), 135-153]. In this paper, a general systematic approach is
   proposed to solve the disturbance observer design problem for robotic
   manipulators without restrictions on the number of degrees-of-freedom
   (DOFs), the types of joints, or the manipulator configuration. Moreover,
   this design method does not need the exact dynamic model of the serial
   robotic manipulator. This method also unifies the previously proposed
   linear and nonlinear disturbance observers in a general framework.
   Simulations are presented for a 4-DOF SCARA manipulator to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed disturbance observer design method.
   Experimental results using a PHANToM Omni haptic device further
   illustrate the effectiveness of the design method. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{An operational approach to an induction machine is presented that uses
   an open winding connected to a dual inverter system. A floating
   capacitor inverter bridge boosts the fundamental voltage available to
   the machine and arbitrarily sets the operating power factor of the main
   inverter bridge connected to the dc battery power source. During
   operation, the motor current charges the floating bridge dc capacitor
   voltage to a naturally stable dc voltage level and the ac voltage
   delivered to the machine is the resultant sum of the two inverter bridge
   voltages. Machine voltage boosting is then achieved by adjusting the
   fundamental phase angle difference between the two inverters to control
   the charge stored in the floating bridge capacitors. With the floating
   bridge providing reactive voltage support and therefore boosting the
   available supply voltage to the induction machine, there are two main
   outcomes: minimization of the supply current required for operation
   beyond the base speed of the electric machine, and supply voltage
   regulation of the drive system. Experimental results are used to verify
   the operation of the floating bridge arrangement by examining the load
   power factor angle and the phase difference between the two bridges.
   Results are presented for a passive RL load to illustrate the supply
   current reduction at high fundamental frequency operation, and a
   modified 2-hp, 1800-r/min induction to illustrate the dc voltage supply
   droop compensation.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) is produced by the oil sands
   industry in Alberta, Canada. OSPW has acute and chronic effects on
   aquatic organisms, but the suite of effects of OSPW, and mechanisms of
   effects, are not understood. The goal of this study was to use RNA
   sequencing (RNAseq) to quantify abundances of transcripts in livers of
   male fathead minnows exposed to untreated OSPW and ozone-treated OSPW to
   investigate sublethal effects of untreated OSPW and to determine whether
   ozonation imparts toxicity upon OSPW. A reference transcriptome of
   25,342 contigs was constructed from RNA from livers of fathead minnows
   exposed to various experimental conditions. Exposure to untreated OSPW
   resulted in greater abundances of 104 transcripts and lesser abundances
   of 91 transcripts. Oxidative metabolism, oxidative stress, apoptosis,
   and immune function were identified as processes affected by OSPW.
   Exposure to ozone-treated OSPW resulted in greater abundances of 57
   transcripts and lesser abundances of 75 transcripts. However, in
   general, putative pathways for effects of OSPW in fathead minnows
   exposed to untreated OSPW were not identified in minnows exposed to
   ozone-treated OSPW, and pathways by which ozone-treated OSPW might have
   effects were not identified. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Single cells based on yttrium-doped SrTiO3 (YST) infiltrated porous YSZ
   anodes were investigated as an alternative material for sulfur and
   carbon tolerant solid oxide fuel cells. First, a YSZ electrolyte-based
   cell with porous YSZ as the support for electrode materials on both
   sides was prepared. Then electrocatalyst materials were incorporated
   into the porous YSZ: the anode was infiltrated with YST precursor; and
   the cathode with LSM precursor to be heat treated in-situ. Heat
   treatment under reducing conditions was found to successfully eliminate
   the yttrium titanate impurity and to markedly reduce the YST crystal
   size. The results showed that there was an optimum amount of infiltrated
   YST to balance the conductivity and the polarization. Furthermore, the
   maximum power density under dry hydrogen at 900 degrees C was found to
   be 95 mW cm(-2), which is greater than comparable reported values. H2S
   was found to have a promoting effect on the electrochemical performance
   of the fuel cell, particularly under methane. This work suggests that
   the infiltration technique can be successfully used not only to
   eliminate the complications associated with high temperature treatments
   required in conventional YST-YSZ anodes, but also to improve the
   electrochemical performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{397-407}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Thermogravimetry coupled to Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
   (TGA-FTIR) was used to study the effect of nickel ions on heavy oil
   combustion. Mainly, the low temperature oxidation (LTO) process was
   studied by conducting isothermal alpha(0) experiments at three different
   temperatures: 200, 250 and 300 degrees C. The kinetics of the reactions
   was analyzed using the TG results. Nickel ions decreased the activation
   energy of the process from 16.9 kJ/mol to 10.9 kJ/mol. The FTIR spectra
   of the evolved gases were helpful in understanding the effect of nickel
   ions on the quality of LTO products. TGA-FTIR analysis revealed a
   production of different oxygenated compounds, such as phenols,
   carboxylic acids, sulfones and side products such as sulfur dioxide,
   during LTO. According to this analysis, using nickel ions decreased the
   concentration of oxygenated compounds in the evolved gases, and
   increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and water. It also
   decreased the concentration of sulfur dioxide. This effect was more
   promising at higher temperatures. This effect of nickel ions on LTO
   reactions can be of great interest in improving the efficiency of the in
   situ combustion technique used for heavy-oil recovery. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{64-76}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{The stress-strain data from 376 laboratory tests carried out on samples
   of igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks were analyzed to establish
   the onset of microcracking in compression, referred to as the Crack
   Initiation (CI) stress. A statistical approach was used to find the
   geological parameters influencing crack initiation stress. Among various
   rock properties such as grain size and mineralogy, the proportion of the
   hardest constituent mineral were found to correlate with CI stress.
   Foliation induced anisotropy was found to affect the peak strength but
   its effect on CI stress was less pronounced. The CI stress to peak
   stress ratio ranged from 0.42 to 0.47 regardless of the material
   properties in uniaxial compression whereas this ratio ranged from 0.50
   to 0.54 when confined. The crack initiation parameters for the
   Hoek-Brown spalling criterion for igneous rocks can be expressed in
   terms of the CI stress ratio and the tensile strength. A comparison of
   tensile strength from the Brazilian and Direct tension tests showed that
   the Direct tensile strength was approximately 0.77 of the Brazilian

Abstract = {{Concentrating solutes within aqueous microdrops is one of the processes
   that have been investigated recently in microfluidic systems. In order
   to design the process of concentrating solutes within microdrops more

   role. By knowing the equilibrium concentration and size of the drop, the
   magnitude of the driving force toward equilibrium will be determined
   which will help researchers to design such processes more accurately.
   Here, we have investigated the thermodynamic equilibrium of microdrop
   concentrating processes involving two kinds of solutes: glycerol as a
   solute with no solubility limit and sodium chloride as a solute with a
   solubility limit. It is found that the presence of a solubility limit
   affects the equilibrium of the process significantly in terms of trends

   Cells Greatly Increases Gemcitabine Uptake}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Gemcitabine is a hydrophilic clinical anticancer drug that requires
   nucleoside transporters to cross plasma membranes and enter cells.
   Pancreatic adenocarcinomas with low levels of nucleoside transporters
   are generally resistant to gemcitabine and are currently a clinical
   problem. We tested whether transfection of human concentrative
   nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT3) using ultrasound and lipid stabilized
   microbubbles could increase gemcitabine uptake and sensitivity in HEK293
   cells made nucleoside transport deficient by pharmacologic treatment
   with dilazep. To our knowledge, no published data exists regarding the
   utility of using hCNT3 as a therapeutic gene to reverse gemcitabine
   resistance. Our ultrasound transfection system - capable of transfection
   of cell cultures, mouse muscle and xenograft CEM/araC tumors - increased
   hCNT3 mRNA and H-3-gemcitabine uptake by >2,000- and 3,400-fold,
   respectively, in dilazep-treated HEK293 cells. Interestingly, HEK293
   cells with both functional human equilibrative nucleoside transporters
   and hCNT3 displayed 5\% of H-3-gemcitabine uptake observed in cells with
   only functional hCNT3, suggesting that equilibrative nucleoside
   transporters caused significant efflux of H-3-gemcitabine. Efflux assays
   confirmed that dilazep could inhibit the majority of H-3-gemcitabine
   efflux from HEK293 cells, suggesting that hENTs were responsible for the
   majority of efflux from the tested cells. Oocyte uptake transport assays
   were also performed and provided support for our hypothesis. Gemcitabine
   uptake and efflux assays were also performed on pancreatic cancer AsPC-1
   and MIA PaCa-2 cells with similar results to that of HEK293 cells. Using
   the MTS proliferation assay, dilazep-treated HEK293 cells demonstrated
   13-fold greater resistance to gemcitabine compared to dilazep-untreated
   HEK293 cells and this resistance could be reversed by transfection of
   hCNT3 cDNA. We propose that transfection of hCNT3 cDNA using ultrasound
   and microbubbles may be a method to reverse gemcitabine resistance in
   pancreatic tumors that have little nucleoside transport activity which
   are resistant to almost all current anticancer therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Although many indices have been developed to quantify chemical toxicity,
   substantial shortcoming is inherent in most of them, such as observation
   time dependence, insufficient robustness, and no comparison with the
   negative control. To assess the extent of exposure of the tested
   substance, a cytotoxicity assay named AUC(50) was developed to describe
   the time and concentration-dependent cellular responses. By monitoring
   the dynamic cytotoxicity response profile of living cells via the
   xCELLigence real-time cell analysis high-throughput (RTCA HT) system,
   changes in cell number (named cell index, CI) were recorded and analyzed
   subsequently. A normalized cell index (NCI) is introduced to reduce the
   influence of inter-experimental variations. The log-phase of cellular
   growth is considered, which alleviates the cell's spontaneous effect.
   The area between the control line and the assessed time-dependent
   cellular response curve (TCRC) of the tested substance was calculated,
   and the corresponding exponential kill model (concentration-response
   curve) was developed along with exploiting the concept of AUC(50). The
   validation of the proposed method is demonstrated by exposing HepG2 cell
   line to seven chemical compounds. Our findings suggested that the
   proposed AUC-based toxicity assay could be an alternative to the
   traditional single time-point assay, and it has potential to become
   routine settings for evaluating the cell-based in vitro assay.
   Furthermore, the AUC(50) combined with RTCA HT assay can be used to
   achieve a high-throughput screening that conventional cellular assay
   cannot achieve. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates membrane systems for the removal of the extractable
   organic fraction (EOF) from oil sands process-affected water (OSPW).
   Experiments were performed using in-situ integrated membrane units that
   consisted of low pressure-driven membrane (LPM) and high pressure-driven
   membrane (HPM) modules. LPM was prepared with a polysulfone (PSU) phase
   inversion casting process and HPM was fabricated by polyamide (PA)
   thin-film composite (TFC) interfacial polymerization. To change membrane
   physicochemical properties, each membrane was developed with and without
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The MWNTs were modified with
   strong acid to enhance dispersion in an organic solvent. Dispersion of
   the MWNTs and physicochemical properties of the membranes were
   characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic methods. The results
   showed that acid-modified MWNTs developed surface functional groups that
   increased their hydrophilicity, increasing the rejection of hydrophobic
   pollutants, increasing OSPW permeate flux, and significantly reducing
   membrane fouling. The LPM and HPM combinations with MWNTs were tested
   for the optimal organic pollutants removal from OSPW. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   application in biochemical reactors}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{Aqueous channels of foam represent a simplified, natural bioreactor on
   the micro-/nano-scale. Previous studies have demonstrated the
   feasibility and potential application of foams in replicating cellular
   process in vitro, but no research has been performed to establish a
   basis for designing stable and biocompatible foam formulations. Our
   research has been directed specifically to the evaluation of
   ranaspumin-2 (RSN-2), a frog foam nest protein. The strong surfactant
   activity of RSN-2 enabled us to produce foams using low protein
   concentration (1 mg ml(-1)) over a wide pH range (pH >= 3). Importantly,
   the RSN-2 formulation exhibited the best foam stability at a near
   neutral pH condition, which shows a potential for application to various
   biosynthesis applications. Model cellular systems such as liposomes and
   inactivated A/PR/8/34 influenza virus maintained their physicochemical
   stability and full hemagglutination activity, indicating
   biocompatibility of RSN-2 with both cellular membranes and proteins both
   in bulk solution and in foam. Moreover, the addition of RSN-2 did not
   exert any deteriorative effects on bacterial cell growth kinetics. In
   contrast, Tween 20, Triton X-100, and BSA did not show satisfactory
   performance in terms of foamability, foam stability, physicochemcial
   stability, and biochemical stability. Although our study has been
   limited to representative formulations composed of only surfactant
   molecules, a number of unique advantages make RSN-2 a promising
   candidate for in vitro foam biosynthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Soot particles in the atmosphere can be coated with organic or
   nonorganic material, which may affect particle morphology and optical
   properties. The effect of the mass of coating on the morphology of soot
   particles was studied using oleic acid and dioctyl sebacate (DOS)
   coatings. A wide range of coatings were used, with up to 10times as much
   coating as the mass of the soot. It is shown that as the coating mass
   increases the degree of collapsing increases until the coating is so
   large that the soot particle becomes completely contained within a
   spherical droplet of the coating material. Higher amounts of coating
   will not cause further collapse of the particle. The degree of collapse
   is also a function of the initial size of the soot particle but was
   independent of the coating materials tested, which have similar surface
   tensions. A model is presented to predict the change in mobility
   diameter as a function of coating mass ratio. The effect of coating mass
   on effective density, shape factor, and fractal dimension is also
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorite is a layered silicate mineral group of importance in geology,
   agriculture, and in the processing of mineral resources. A more detailed
   analysis of the surface charge of chlorite minerals is important in
   order to improve our fundamental understanding of such particle
   structures and their behavior in suspension. In this study, the
   anisotropic surface charging of chlorite has been established using
   Atomic Force Microscopy surface-force measurements with a silicon
   nitride tip. The surface-charge densities and surface potentials at the
   chlorite basal-plane surfaces and edge surface were obtained by fitting
   force curves with the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theoretical
   model. The results show that at pH 5.6, 8.0, and 9.0 the chlorite
   mica-like face is negatively charged with the isoelectric point (IEP)
   less than pH 5.6. In contrast, the chlorite brucite-like face is
   positively charged in this pH range and the IEP is greater than pH 9.0.
   The surface charging of the chlorite edge surface was found to be
   pH-dependent with the IEP occurring at pH 8.5, which is slightly greater
   than the edge surfaces of talc and muscovite due to the larger content
   of magnesium hydroxide at the chlorite edge surface. Findings from the
   present research are expected to provide a fundamental foundation for
   the analysis of industrial requirements, e.g. collector adsorption,
   slime coating, and particle interactions in the area of
   mineral-processing technology.}},

Abstract = {{Rotating machinery covers a broad range of mechanical equipment and
   plays a significant role in industrial applications. It generally
   operates under tough working environment and is therefore subject to
   faults, which could be detected and diagnosed by using signal processing
   techniques. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is one of the most
   powerful signal processing techniques and has been extensively studied
   and widely applied in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Numerous
   publications on the use of EMD for fault diagnosis have appeared in
   academic journals, conference proceedings and technical reports. This
   paper attempts to survey and summarize the recent research and
   development of EMD in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, providing
   comprehensive references for researchers concerning with this topic and
   helping them identify further research topics. First, the EMD method is
   briefly introduced, the usefulness of the method is illustrated and the
   problems and the corresponding solutions are listed. Then, recent
   applications of EMD to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery are
   summarized in terms of the key components, such as rolling element
   bearings, gears and rotors. Finally, the outstanding open problems of
   EMD in fault diagnosis are discussed and potential future research
   directions are identified. It is expected that this review will serve as
   an introduction of EMD for those new to the concepts, as well as a
   summary of the current frontiers of its applications to fault diagnosis
   for experienced researchers. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study of three heat-treated
   North American wood species (jack pine, birch and aspen) was carried out
   to evaluate chemical modifications occurring on the wood surface during
   artificial weathering for different times. The results suggest that the
   weathering reduces lignin content (aromatic rings) at the surface of
   heat-treated wood, consequently, the carbohydrates content increases.
   This results in surfaces richer in cellulose and poorer in lignin.
   Heat-treated wood surfaces become acidic due to weathering, and the
   acidity increases as the weathering time increases. Three possible
   reasons are given to account for the increase of acidity during
   weathering. The lignin content increases, whereas the hemicelluloses
   content decrease due to heat treatment. Heat-treated woods have lower
   acidity to basicity ratios than the corresponding untreated woods for
   all three species because of the decrease in carboxylic acid functions
   mainly present in hemicelluloses. The wood composition changes induced
   by weathering are more significant compared to those induced by heat
   treatment at wood surface. Exposure to higher temperatures causes more
   degradation of hemicelluloses, and this characteristic is maintained
   during weathering. However, the wood direction has more effect on
   chemical composition modification during weathering compared to that of
   heat treatment temperature. The heat-treated jack pine is affected most
   by weathering followed by heat-treated aspen and birch. This is related
   to differences in content and structure of lignin of softwood and
   hardwood. The use of XPS technique has proved to be a reliable method
   for wood surface studies. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The performance assessment of linear time-invariant batch processes when
   iterative learning control (ILC) is implemented has been discussed.
   Previous literatures show that conventional performance assessment
   cannot be directly applied to batch processes due to the nature of batch
   operations. Chen and Kong have suggested a new method to assess the
   control performance of batch processes using optimal ILC as the
   benchmark. In their work, ILC controllers are assumed to affect either
   stochastic or deterministic performance but without considering their
   interaction. This work elaborates the controllers effects on both
   stochastic and deterministic control performance of batch processes. It
   is shown that the optimal solution based on the minimum variance control
   law has a trade-off between deterministic and stochastic performance,
   which can be shown by a trade-off curve. Furthermore, a method is
   proposed to estimate this curve from routine operating data, against
   which the performance of ILC controllers can be assessed. Simulation
   studies are conducted to verify the proposed method. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Reaction of smectites with iron in aerobic conditions at 75 degrees C}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{26-36}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The stability of six dioctahedral smectites with different crystal
   chemistry was studied in the presence of iron to simulate the possible
   reactions of clay minerals in contact with Fe canister in a nuclear
   waste repository. The batch experiments were performed at 75 degrees C
   for 35 days in air. The reaction products were examined by XRD, QXRD,
   FTIR, BWA analyses and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The reaction of bentonites
   with metal iron led to the consumption of iron and the formation of
   magnetite and 7-angstrom phyllosilicate. The original smectites were
   partially transformed from Al-rich to Fe-bearing. Appearance of the
   dioctahedral-trioctahedral domains in the octahedral sheets of smectites
   resulted in the partial destabilization and/or partial dissolution of
   the smectite structure indicated by the increase of the layer charge,
   splitting of the smectite particles and partial disruption of the
   smectite layers. Benefits of NIR spectroscopy were found in
   identification of FeMgOH and FeFeOH groups, which were not recognized in
   the MIR region of reacted iron-bentonite mixtures due to overlapping
   with other absorption bands. The comparison of the present study with
   the paper of Osacloj et al. (2010) showed that smectites reacted
   differently with iron in air and nitrogen atmosphere. In the aerobic
   conditions more iron was consumed and less amount of magnetite was
   formed. The distinct experimental conditions (aerobic versus anaerobic)
   had the greatest effect on the layer charge and thickness of the
   smectite particles. Less pronounced changes of the layer charge and
   thickness of the smectite particles were observed for the iron-bentonite
   mixtures reacted in the aerobic conditions. It indicated that smectite
   destabilization was inhibited in the aerobic conditions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Recent Drop Weight Tear Test (DWTT) showed that dynamic fracture

   FEA and experimental results shows that the present FEA can well
   describe high-speed fracture of the standard and modified DWTT of API
   X80 line pipe steel. The relation between CZM fracture energy,
   steady-state CTOA and steady-state fracture speed are investigated
   through two groups of FEA simulations designed for standard and modified
   DWTT. Our FEA results show that both CZM fracture energy and
   steady-state CTOA decrease with steady-state fracture speed, and two

   translocate through this nanochannel, reliable fingerprint changes in
   conductance are observed. Compared with other well-studied biological
   pores, the phi29 nanochannel has a larger cross-sectional area, which
   enables the translocation of dsDNA. Furthermore, specific amino acids
   can be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis within the large cavity
   of the channel to conjugate receptors that are able to bind specific
   ligands or analytes for desired applications. The lipid
   membrane-embedded nanochannel system has immense potential

Abstract = {{A new approach for enhancing the dispersibility of respirable powders
   containing poorly soluble pharmaceutical actives is demonstrated.
   Budesonide was spray-dried with leucine from an ethanol-water cosolvent
   feedstock. For near-azeotropic cosolvent ratios, leucine was enriched on
   the surface of the particles relative to the bulk composition, and the
   particles showed a low-density morphology. Partial encapsulation of
   budesonide was accomplished. The dispersibility and manufacturability of
   the powder were greatly improved relative to powders made from
   budesonide alone. Fine particle fractions from a passive dry powder
   inhaler exceeded 80\%. The particle size was in a suitable range for
   respiratory drug delivery (mass mean aerodynamic diameter between 2 and
   3 pm). These results demonstrate that leucine can be used in
   ethanol-water cosolvent systems to design respirable particles with high
   dispersibility and good manufacturability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{To examine the effects of the ozonation process (as an oxidation
   treatment for water and wastewater treatment applications) on microbial
   biofilm formation and biodegradability of organic compounds present in
   oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), biofilm reactors were operated
   continuously for 6 weeks. Two types of biofilm substrate materials:
   polyethylene (PE) and polyvinylchloride (PVC), and two types of
   OSPW-fresh and ozonated OSPWs-were tested. Endogenous microorganisms, in
   OSPW, quickly formed biofilms in the reactors. Without ozonation, the
   bioreactor (using endogenous microorganisms) removed 13.8\% of the total
   acid-extractable organics (TAO) and 18.5\% of the parent naphthenic
   acids (NAs) from fresh OSPW. The combined ozonation and biodegradation
   process removed 87.2\% of the OSPW TAO and over 99\% of the OSPW parent
   NAs. Further UPLC/HRMS analysis showed that NA biodegradability
   decreased as the NA cyclization number increased. Microbial biofilm
   formation was found to depend on the biofilm substrate type. (C) 2012

Title = {{Passenger Traffic Characteristics of Service Facilities in Rail Transit
   Stations of Shanghai}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE}},

Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{223-229}},

Abstract = {{The configuration of service facilities, such as ticket vending
   machines, staffed ticket booths, automatic fare gates, and escalators,
   is an important issue for the plan and design of rail transit stations.
   Reasonable configuration of service facilities is based on a good
   understanding of the passenger traffic characteristics of such service
   facilities, which are affected by passenger characteristics, station
   types, and facility performance. To study the passenger traffic
   characteristics of service facilities, five stations are selected in
   Shanghai, and their passenger traffic data are collected and analyzed.
   In this study, the results indicate that service-time frequencies of
   ticket vending machines and staffed ticket booths follow Weibull
   distribution and exponential distribution, respectively, and that the
   headway of passengers passing the automatic fare gate under ideal
   conditions follows normal distribution. According to the service time
   and headway distributions of ticket-selling facilities and automatic
   fare gates, the derived capacities of ticket vending machines, staffed
   ticket booths, and automatic fare gates are 137, 186, 253, 368, and 1;
   500 passengers/h, respectively. In addition, theoretical analysis and
   field survey of escalators show that escalator capacity is between 4,700
   and 5; 200 passengers/h/m. It is found that the capacities of
   ticket-selling facilities and escalators in this study are far lower
   than those in China's design codes. The capacity of automatic fare gates
   in this study is a little lower than that in China's code; however, it
   is a little greater than that from the corresponding U.S. capacity

Abstract = {{Motivated by the potential of using room temperature ionic liquids
   (RTILs) as electrolytes to replace traditional aqueous electrolytes for
   Zn-anode secondary batteries, Zn/Zn(II) redox reactions have been
   studied in four aprotic RTILs based on pyrrolidinium ({[}Pyrr](+)) and
   imidazolium ({[}Im](+)) cations, and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
   ({[}TFSI](-)) and dicyanamide ({[}DCA](-)) anions. Cyclic voltammetry
   results suggest a smaller overpotential for Zn redox in {[}Im](+) cation
   based and {[}DCA](-) anion based RTILs than in {[}Pyrr](+) and
   {[}TFSI](-) based RTILs. Potentiodynamic polarization experiments
   indicate a strong dependence of the electrode reaction mechanism for the
   Zn species on the RTIL anions. In {[}TFSI](-) based RTILs, Zn2+ ions are
   the electroactive species, with the electrode reaction being a
   single-step, two-electron transfer process. In {[}DCA](-) based RTILs,
   two-step, single-electron reactions account for the electrode mechanism.
   The exchange current densities derived from Tafel analysis for the Zn
   species in the four RTILs are greater than 10(-3) mA/cm(2), with the
   {[}Im](+) cation based RTIL possessing the highest value of 9.9 x 10(-3)
   mA/cm(2). The results obtained will assist in obtaining a better
   understanding of the electrochemical behavior of Zn in RTILs, shedding
   light on the development of RTILs for Zn-anode secondary batteries. (C)

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes exist in the form of a colloidal dispersion in crude oils
   and solvents. Even in a good solvent such as toluene, asphaltene
   aggregates persist at the nanoscale. In this study, the impact of
   Rayleigh scattering on the apparent absorption of visible radiation by
   asphaltene aggregates in solution was assessed. Recent work with a
   stirred diaphragm diffusion cell indicates that membranes with pore
   sizes less than 5 nm are capable of removing the species responsible for
   the absorption of visible light with wavelengths >550 nm. A further
   analysis of the spectra of the whole asphaltene samples in toluene
   indicates that the absorbance of visible light with wavelengths >600 nm
   follows a lambda(-4) dependence for asphaltenes from a range of sources
   over a wide range of concentration. This functional dependence is
   consistent with Rayleigh scattering, rather than a mixture of colored
   components or chromophores. Rayleigh scattering equations were combined
   with experimental visible spectra to estimate the average nanoaggregate
   sizes, which were in a very good agreement with the sizes reported in
   the literature by other methods. Various additives, solvents, and
   ultrasound and heat treatments were employed in an attempt to completely
   disaggregate the asphaltene nanoaggregates in solution at room
   temperature. None of the treatments eliminated nanoaggregration, but
   some treatments increased absorption due to formation of larger
   aggregates, as confirmed by acoustic spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to develop a finite element based
   atomistic model to study the stability of graphene monolayers with
   respect to dimensional as well as geometrical parameters. A linear
   finite element approach was adopted for the numerical analysis to
   characterise the buckling strength of graphene under the influence of
   compressive loading. The developed atomistic model was based on the
   assumption that graphene can be modelled as a space frame structure, in
   which bond interactions between `C-C' atoms were assumed to behave like
   structural beams. The proposed model was found to be less numerically
   intensive with fewer degrees of freedom in comparison to other numerical
   techniques. During the numerical analysis it was established that
   graphene in a `zig-zag' geometrical configuration has greater strength
   against buckling in comparison to an `arm-chair' configuration. Buckling
   strength of graphene sheets was ascertained to decrease significantly
   with increasing length-to-width aspect ratio. The curvature of graphene
   monolayers was found to have a significant effect on sheet stability as
   well, that is, curved profiles provide enhanced stability against
   buckling.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of a micro-groove to prevent the spreading of HFE-7100 fluid
   (C4F9OCH3) having low surface tension (gamma = 13.6 mN/m) on a surface
   is studied. In this study, micro-grooves were made around square
   openings of a plate made of either polycarbonate or 316 stainless steel.
   To verify effectiveness of micro-grooves to stop the spread of HFE-7100,
   experiments were done under non-saturated and saturated conditions.
   Under non-saturated conditions the micro-grooves on both materials
   confined the liquid up to apparent angle of 55 +/- 5A degrees due to the
   edge effect. Saturated gas-vapor mixture with vapor mass fraction of w
   (v) = 88\% and w (v) = 97\% did not significantly influence the
   confinement of the liquid by the micro-groove. This result is promising
   for application of micro-grooved plates in CIMEX experiment planned for
   ISS.}},

Abstract = {{One design heuristic used to determine the just suspended speed, N-js,
   for mixed slurries assumes that the mixture N-js is dominated by the
   particle phase with the maximum N-js. This approach does not incorporate
   the effect of the second solid phase. Two new models are proposed to
   predict the mixture N-js: the power model and the momentum model. These
   models determine the mixture N-js using the sum of the power or the sum
   of the momentum required to suspend the individual solid phases. The
   models were tested using experimental data for two impellers, a Lightnin
   A310 impeller and a 45 degrees pitched-blade turbine. A range of
   off-bottom clearances, and six mixtures of solids up to 27 wt\% solids
   loading completed the data set. The power model accurately predicts
   mixture N-js for both impellers over the full range of clearances and up
   to 27 wt\% mixtures. (c) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{Snow collected from roadways in northern climates is not pristine and
   may contain sand or gravel, deicing agents, litter, and airborne
   pollutants. Although fate and transport of contaminants in snowmelt has
   been studied under laboratory conditions, it is unknown whether the same
   mechanisms apply to a heterogeneous snow pile. This case study sought to
   identify and quantify organic species in snow pile meltwater in
   Edmonton, Canada, and estimate the total potential hydrocarbon loading
   bound to sediment. Analysis of meltwater and sediment samples revealed
   that most hydrocarbons were present in sediments, with meltwater
   containing low concentrations (<1 mg L-1) of F2 (>C10-C16) and F3
   (>C16-C34) fraction hydrocarbons. Sediments showed detectable levels of
   F2 and F3 hydrocarbons in similar to 21\% of the samples tested, with
   concentrations ranging from approximately 600 to 7; 800 mg . kg(-1),
   with average F3 concentrations (the main source of hydrocarbons) well
   below Canadian guidelines for most samples. The estimated total
   hydrocarbon loading of the snow pile studied was similar to 5.1 t of
   hydrocarbons. Findings are anticipated to be of value in the
   establishment of water quality monitoring programs, environmental policy
   and strategies involving the treatment, disposal, or reuse of residual
   snow pile sediments. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000606. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Foodborne diseases are a major health concern that can have severe
   impact on society and can add tremendous financial burden to our health
   care systems. Rapid early detection of food contamination is therefore
   relevant for the containment of food-borne pathogens. Conventional
   pathogen detection methods, such as microbiological and biochemical
   identification are time-consuming and laborious, while immunological or
   nucleic acid-based techniques require extensive sample preparation and
   are not amenable to miniaturization for on-site detection. Biosensors
   have shown tremendous promise to overcome these limitations and are
   being aggressively studied to provide rapid, reliable and sensitive
   detection platforms for such applications. Novel biological recognition
   elements are studied to improve the selectivity and facilitate
   integration on the transduction platform for sensitive detection.
   Bacteriophages are one such unique biological entity that show excellent
   host selectivity and have been actively used as recognition probes for
   pathogen detection. This review summarizes the extensive literature
   search on the application of bacteriophages (and recently their receptor
   binding proteins) as probes for sensitive and selective detection of
   foodborne pathogens, and critically outlines their advantages and
   disadvantages over other recognition elements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the partitioning and bioaccumulation of ten target
   metals (Cr-53, Mn, Co, Ni-60, Cu-65, Zn-66, As, Sr-88, Mo-95 and Ba)
   from oil sands tailings pond water (TPW) by indigenous Parachlorella
   kessleri. To determine the role of extracellular and intracellular
   bioaccumulation in metal removal by P. kessleri, TPW samples taken from
   two oil sands operators (Syncrude Canada Ltd. and Albian Sands Energy
   Inc.) were enriched with nutrient supplements.
   Results indicate that intracellular bioaccumulation played the main role
   in metal removal from TPW; whereas extracellular bioaccumulation was
   only observed to some extent for Mn, Co, Ni-60, Cu-65, Sr-88, Mo-95 and
   Ba. The FTIR scan and titration of functional groups on the cell surface
   indicated low metal binding capacity by indigenous P. kessleri. However,
   it is believed that the dissolved cations and organic ligand content in
   TPW (such as naphthenic acids) may interfere with metal binding on the
   cell surface and lower extracellular bioaccumulation. In addition, the
   total bioaccumulation and bioconcentration factor (BCF) varied during
   the cultivation period in different growth regimes. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the question of whether a single-coated,
   non-elliptical inclusion can be designed in such a way as to satisfy the
   harmonic condition of Bjorkman and Richards (the so-called `harmonic
   inclusion'). The minimization of stress concentration arising from both
   the internal and external stress fields of the inclusion is accomplished
   in the sense that the internal stress field is uniform and hydrostatic
   while the first invariant of the external stress field in the matrix
   remains constant. The inclusion is taken to be perfectly bonded to the
   coating at the inclusion-coating interface while the coating matrix
   interface is assumed to be inhomogeneously imperfect of the spring-layer
   type. It is found that only a coated hypotrochoidal inclusion can be
   made harmonic and only in the case when the coating and the matrix have
   different Poisson's ratios and the matrix is subjected to a uniform
   remote isotropic field. Both exact and approximate solutions are
   derived. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pipeline hydro-transportation has a significant potential to replace
   truck transportation of agricultural biomass for production of fuels and
   chemicals. Apart from several operating parameters, biomass particles'
   shape and size are key factors affecting biomass slurry (water-feedstock
   mixture) mechanical and chemical properties. Using an image processing
   approach and ImageJ software, a user-coded plugin was developed to
   process sample images, measure particle dimensions, and analyse the
   particle size distributions and corresponding parameters of knife-milled
   wheat straw and corn stover, which had been pre-classified into four
   nominal size groups. Particle surface roughness and its degradation
   during pumping time were also investigated. Investigation of the
   particle aspect ratio confirmed not only the minor importance of the
   ``width parameter{''}, but also the significance of the fibrous nature
   of the test material in pipeline transportation. It was also observed
   that, the errors involved in nominal sizing brought about noticeable
   under- and over-estimation of the real dimensions of the particles.
   Amongst three size distribution functions of Rosin-Rammler,
   Gaudin-Schuhmann, and log-normal studied, the Rosin-Rammler equations
   were fitted with least error in all the scenarios. Comparison of
   Rosin-Rammler approach and size guide number model indicated that for
   the case of fibrous materials, the size guide number model was more
   reliable than the Rosin-Rammler approach. Finally, the impact of
   particle shape and size on biomass slurry mechanical behaviour was
   analysed. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The corrosion behaviour of Zr in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
   solutions with various concentrations (0-4 g L-1) of albumin was studied
   by electrochemical techniques and surface analysis. Addition of albumin
   to PBS solutions moved the open circuit potential (OCP) to less nobler
   direction. OCP, polarization resistance and impedance increased and the
   corrosion current decreased over immersion duration. At early stages of
   immersion, the resistance was increased with the concentration of
   albumin because of the high adsorption kinetics of albumin on metal.
   After the long term immersion, the resistance in PBS without albumin was
   higher than PBS with albumin owing to the anodic dissolution effect of
   albumin on metal. According to the analysis of effective capacitances, a
   normal distribution of time-constants was proposed to estimate the
   surface film on Zr. A corrosion mechanism of Zr in PBS with different
   albumin was proposed based on electrochemical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Heat-treated wood is value added product which attracted the attention
   of consumers due its dark brown color which is of interest for
   decorative purposes. But this dark brown color fades when subjected to
   outdoor environment turning to grayish white color along with formation
   of small cracks and checks on the surface. In order to prevent the color
   change, an effort has been put forward for developing new coatings. The
   acrylic polyurethane coating with bark extract with or without lignin
   stabilizer proved to be very effective in protecting the surface of
   heat-treated jack pine. In this study, the interaction of these coatings
   with heat-treated jack pine surface was investigated and the results
   were compared with those of industrially available Laurentide coating.
   The capillary penetration was found to be the most important phenomenon
   in wood-coating interaction. The results revealed that capillary
   penetration rate was highly dependent on different additives used as
   well as surface tension and viscosity of the coatings. Two different
   models were used to evaluate volume change of the coating drop with time
   which is the indication of capillary action during wetting on
   heat-treated jack pine. Influence of mechanical surface treatment also
   plays an important role in wetting phenomenon of wood coating
   irrespective of wood grain direction. Water penetration through coatings
   is very important for wood discoloration during aging. Therefore,
   measurement of contact angle between water and coated/heat-treated wood
   system gave insight to water penetration at different aging times.
   Furthermore, the degradation at wood-coating interface was studied using
   a fluorescence microscope which did not reveal any degradation at the
   interface for coating containing bark extract and coating containing
   bark extract together with lignin stabilizer. The results of this study
   give an insight into high performance of acrylic polyurethane containing
   bark extracts alone or together with lignin stabilizer against color
   change of heat-treated jack pine. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Electric power plants account for approximately half the global
   industrial water withdrawal. Although continued electric-sector
   expansion is probable, significant variations in water intensity by
   electricity technology and cooling system type make its effects on water
   demands uncertain. Using GCAM, an integrated assessment model of energy,
   agriculture, and climate change, we establish lower-, median-, and
   upper-bound estimates for current electric-sector water withdrawals and
   consumption in 14 geopolitical regions, and compare them with available
   estimates. We then explore water use for electricity to 2095, focusing
   on uncertainties in water withdrawal and consumption intensities, power
   plant cooling system changes, and adoption rates of water-saving
   technologies. Results reveal a probable decrease in the water withdrawal
   intensity with capital stock turnover, but a corresponding increase in
   consumptive use, for which technologies under development may
   compensate. At a regional scale, water use varies significantly based on
   the existing capital stock and its evolution over the century. (c) 2012

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes an algorithm that has been developed to process
   field data from two upward looking sonars, one high (546 kHz) and one
   low (235 kHz) frequency, a 2 MHz current profiler and a monitoring
   station, to measure surface ice characteristics on the North
   Saskatchewan River in the north east of Edmonton, AB, Canada, during the
   2009/2010 freeze-up season. The algorithm used to calculate pans/rafts
   drafts and lengths, and the surface ice concentration is described. The
   validity and the accuracy of this technique were tested and computed
   surface ice conditions are presented. For the purpose of examining the
   effects of hydrometeorological conditions on measured pan
   characteristics, the freeze-up period was divided into three distinct
   stages depending on the measured surface ice concentration. Pan/raft
   drafts were found to range from 0.1 to 1.0 m and pan/raft lengths from
   0.6 to 8.0 m. The sonar proved to be very accurate in detecting the
   exact surface ice conditions locally above the sonar beam. However,
   interpretation of the results can sometimes be challenging, especially
   when physical processes such as bridging affect local ice conditions.
   Therefore, additional visual observations (e.g. time lapse photography)
   of surface ice conditions are recommended to aid in the interpretation
   of sonar measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes frazil ice events detected using upward looking
   sonars, one high (546 kHz) and one low (235 kHz) frequency, during the
   2009/2010 freeze-up field deployment on the North Saskatchewan River,
   Edmonton, AB, Canada. The field acoustic data have been processed to
   compute time series of the depth averaged volume backscatter strength,
   S-vd (dB). A review of three scattering models: the sphere, prolate
   spheroid, and disk models, together with their formulation, assumptions
   and limitations are presented. Estimation methods for the concentrations
   and sizes from S-vd (dB) using scattering models are discussed. The
   applicability of the three scattering models to measuring suspended
   frazil ice was investigated using laboratory data reported by Ghobrial
   et al. (2012a). It was found that the laboratory measured concentrations
   were in a good agreement with concentrations estimated with these
   scattering models. It was also found that the disk model is the most
   applicable because it provides more realistic particle sizes. In total,
   eight frazil events were detected with the sonars during the field
   deployment. Preliminary linkages between the meteorological (air and
   water temperatures) and surface ice conditions measured at the site, and
   the duration and magnitude of the detected frazil events are presented.
   Both the laboratory results and the disk scattering model were used to
   estimate frazil ice concentration and sizes from the field data.
   Concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 0.05\% and disk radii between
   0.13 and 0.21 mm have been estimated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Mercury emission control technology in the combustion flue gas of
   coal-fired power plants has been under intensive development, but none
   has been implemented commercially because of the high cost. Treatment of
   coal before combustion provides an alternative option for Hg emission
   control. In this study, samples of one anthracite, one lignite and three
   bituminous coals were investigated to determine the feasibility of
   pre-combustion Hg emission control. Density separation,
   temperature-programmed pyrolysis, HNO3 extraction and sequential
   selective extraction (SSE) were used to determine the occurrence and
   speciation of mercury in the different types of coal. The results showed
   that the characteristic temperature range for Hg release is <150 degrees
   C for Hg-0, 150-250 degrees C for HgCl2/organic-bound Hg, 250-400
   degrees C for HgS/silicate-bound Hg, and 400-600 degrees C for
   pyrite-bound Hg. HNO3 extraction and sink-float were found to be
   effective for the removal of pyrite-bound Hg and then the coal can be
   pyrolysed at 400 degrees C to remove other forms of Hg. (C) 2010

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-183}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although Random Testing (RT) is low cost and straightforward, its
   effectiveness is not satisfactory. To increase the effectiveness of RT,
   researchers have developed Adaptive Random Testing (ART) and
   Quasi-Random Testing (QRT) methods which attempt to maximize the test
   case coverage of the input domain. This paper proposes the use of
   Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT) to address this problem.
   Accordingly, a test case generation method, namely, Random Border CVT
   (RBCVT), is proposed which can enhance the previous RT methods to
   improve their coverage of the input space. The generated test cases by
   the other methods act as the input to the RBCVT algorithm and the output
   is an improved set of test cases. Therefore, RBCVT is not an independent
   method and is considered as an add-on to the previous methods. An
   extensive simulation study and a mutant-based software testing
   investigation have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   RBCVT against the ART and QRT methods. Results from the experimental
   frameworks demonstrate that RBCVT outperforms previous methods. In
   addition, a novel search algorithm has been incorporated into RBCVT
   reducing the order of computational complexity of the new approach. To
   further analyze the RBCVT method, randomness analysis was undertaken
   demonstrating that RBCVT has the same characteristics as ART methods in
   this regard.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle and gas-phase emission factors are presented for a
   liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) passenger vehicle and are compared to
   gasoline operation. A bi-fuel LPG-gasoline vehicle certified for use on
   either fuel was used as the test vehicle so that a direct comparison of
   the emissions could be made based on fuel choice. These values were
   considered along with previous studies to determine the relative change
   in particulate emissions due to fuel choice over a wide range of
   vehicles and operating conditions. The vehicle examined in this study
   was tested on a chassis dynamometer for both steady-state and transient
   conditions. Transient test cycles included the US FTP72 driving cycle,
   Japanese driving cycle and modified Indian driving cycle while
   steady-state tests were done at vehicle speeds ranging from 10-90 km/hr
   in various transmission gears. Exhaust particle size distributions were
   measured in real-time using a differential mobility spectrometer
   (DMS50), and particle number and particle mass emission factors were
   calculated. For both fuels, the majority of the particles ranged from 5
   to 160 nm in terms of particle diameter, with typically more than 85\%
   of the particles in the nucleation mode (between 550 nm). In most cases,
   the vehicle produced a greater fraction of larger (accumulation mode)
   particles when fuelled on LPG. Using the data in the literature as well
   as the data in the current study, gasoline fuel produces 4.6 times more
   particles in terms of number and 2.1 times more particles in terms of
   mass.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Aerosolized chemotherapy has been recognized as a potential
   treatment for lung cancer. The challenge of providing sufficient
   therapeutic effects without reaching dose-limiting toxicity levels
   hinders the development of aerosolized chemotherapy. This could be
   mitigated by increasing drug-delivery efficiency with a noninvasive
   drug-targeting delivery method. The purpose of this study is to use
   direct numerical simulations to study the resulting local enhancement of
   deposition due to magnetic field alignment of high aspect ratio
   particles.
   Methods: High aspect ratio particles were approximated by a rigid
   ellipsoid with a minor diameter of 0.5 mu m and fluid particle density
   ratio of 1,000. Particle trajectories were calculated by solving the
   coupled fluid particle equations using an in-house micro-macro grid
   finite element algorithm based on a previously developed fictitious
   domain approach. Particle trajectories were simulated in a
   morphologically realistic geometry modeling a symmetrical terminal
   bronchiole bifurcation. Flow conditions were steady inspiratory air flow
   due to typical breathing at 18 L/min. Deposition efficiency was
   estimated for two different cases: {[}1] particles aligned with the
   streamlines and {[}2] particles with fixed angular orientation
   simulating the magnetic field alignment of our previous in vitro study.
   Results: The local enhancement factor defined as the ratio between
   deposition efficiency of Case {[}1] and Case {[}2] was found to be 1.43
   and 3.46 for particles with an aspect ratio of 6 and 20, respectively.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that externally forcing local alignment of
   high aspect ratio particles can increase local deposition considerably.}},

Abstract = {{Bovine serum albumin (BSA) has an extraordinary property to carry
   biomolecules. An experimental study on the wettability of BSA is
   presented in this study. The variations in the surface tension and the
   equilibrium contact angle with the change in BSA concentration are also
   reported. The surface tension and the contact angle are measured with
   pendant and sessile drop techniques, respectively. A nonlinear decrement
   in the surface tension with the increment in the BSA concentration is
   observed. An equilibrium contact angle of a BSA solution with particular
   concentration is determined by studying the hysteresis in the contact
   angle from dynamic contact angle measurements. The needle-in-drop
   technique is used to study the hysteresis of the contact angle. It is
   observed that the obtained surface tension and the equilibrium contact
   angle vary with the BSA concentration. In this reported study, for the
   considered combination of the BSA concentration and solid surface, the
   liquid drop does not recede as the drop volume decreases, which
   represents nonreceding contact angle condition. The increment in the
   contact angle with the increment in the BSA concentration is observed.
   Finally, it is observed that the inclusion of the proteins not only
   changes the surface tension but also changes the contact angle.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a field-test verified method for continuous tracking
   of voltage-dependent load model parameters. The basic idea is to use the
   natural or automatic movement of the under load tap changer (ULTC) as
   the source of voltage disturbance. Load parameters are estimated from
   each taping activity. While the idea of using manual ULTC tapping
   disturbances for load parameter estimation is not new, this paper has
   demonstrated, through laboratory tests and field measurements, that load
   parameters can be estimated from the automatic ULTC movements. Since a
   ULTC often has many movements in any given day, the load parameters can
   be collected in a consistent, frequent, and predictable manner and,
   consequently, online estimation and tracking of load parameters becomes
   feasible. The paper presents the implementation of the proposed method
   and its field measurement experiences, especially the characteristics of
   tap movements and the associated load responses. Experiments and a large
   number of field measurements presented in this paper have shown that the
   proposed method is a practical and effective method for determining load

Abstract = {{A new formulation is required to provide a proper power flow analysis in
   islanded microgrids taking into consideration their special philosophy
   of operation. In this paper, a novel and generic three-phase power flow
   algorithm is formulated for islanded microgrids. The algorithm is novel
   since it adapts the real characteristics of the islanded microgrid
   operation; i.e., 1) some of the distributed generation (DG) units are
   controlled using the droop control methods and their generated active
   and reactive power are dependent on the power flow variables; 2) the
   steady-state system frequency is considered as one of the power flow
   variables. The proposed algorithm is generic, where the features of
   distribution systems, i.e., three-phase feeder models, unbalanced loads
   and load models have been taken in consideration. Further, all possible
   operation modes of DG units (droop, PV, or PQ) have been considered. The
   problem has been formulated as a set of nonlinear equations. A globally
   convergent Newton-trust region method has been proposed to solve this
   set of nonlinear equations. The proposed algorithm is a helpful tool to
   perform accurate steady state studies of the islanded microgrid.
   Different case studies have been carried out to test the effectiveness
   and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The present study explored the cellular uptake dynamics, the subcellular
   location and the internalization mechanisms of gold nanoparticles (GNPs)
   and glucose-capped GNPs (Glu-GNPs). The cancer radiotherapy-enhancing
   effects of GNPs were also evaluated. We synthesized the GNPs and
   Glu-GNPs by the seeding technique. The effects on cellular uptake and
   the radiosensitizing effect induced by GNPs and Glu-GNPs at lower doses
   were investigated using two human cancer cell lines (HeLa and MCF-7).
   The intracellular location of the nanoparticles was analyzed by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Analysis of cellular apoptosis
   following GNP-based radiotherapy was performed by flow cytometry and
   TUNEL assay. Cancer cells took up more Glu-GNPs than naked GNPs and the
   uptake curve showed size- and cell-dependent uptake. GNPs were mainly
   located in the cytoplasm and endocytosis is the mechanism behind the
   internalization of GNPs and Glu-GNPs. Lower doses of GNPs and Glu-GNPs
   still enhanced the killing effect using X-ray irradiation, although the
   apoptotic rate was not altered. The results presented in this study
   provide evidence that Glu-GNPs may have a bright future in
   tumor-targeted diagnosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The Sn-rich eutectic alloy (90 wt\% Sn) in the Au-Sn system offers a
   potentially cheaper alternative to the Au-rich eutectic alloy (20 wt\%
   Sn) for optoelectronic and microelectromechanical systems device
   packaging and may be applicable as a Pb-free solder for microelectronic
   packaging. A simple electrodeposition method was utilized to fabricate
   Sn-rich, Au-Sn solder films, including the eutectic composition for this
   purpose. The electrolyte consisted of a solution of Sn chloride and
   ammonium citrate. Gold was added to the electrolyte in the form of
   either a Au nanoparticle (< 20 nm) suspension, prepared with Na citrate,
   or by directly adding Au powder (500-800 nm particles). The resultant
   suspensions were used to electrodeposit eutectic and near-eutectic alloy
   films. Uniform thicknesses and compositions were obtained with the
   latter approach, i.e., direct addition of Au powder. Gold content in the
   deposits increased with increasing Au particle loading in the
   electrolyte and increasing current density. Room temperature aging led
   to the formation of AuSn4 at the Au particle-Sn matrix interface. Reflow
   of deposits with near-eutectic compositions resulted in the formation of
   the two eutectic phases, Sn and AuSn4.}},

Abstract = {{A centrifugally cast 20Cr32Ni1Nb stainless steel manifold in service for
   16 years at temperatures ranging from 1073 K to 1123 K (800 A degrees C

   microscopy (SEM), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), auger electron
   spectroscopy (AES), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Nb(C,N), M23C6, and the
   silicide G-phases (Ni16Nb6Si7) were all identified in a conventional
   SEM, while the nitride Z-phase (CrNbN) was observed only in AES. M23C6,
   Z-phase and G-phase were characterized in XRD. Thermodynamic equilibrium
   calculations using ThermoCalc Version S, with the TCS Steel and
   Fe-alloys Database (TCFE6), and Thermotech Ni-based Superalloys Database
   (TTNI8) were validated by comparing experimental phase fraction results
   obtained from both EPMA and AES. A computational study looking at
   variations in the chemical composition of the alloy, and how they affect
   phase equilibria, was investigated. Increasing the nitrogen
   concentration is shown to decrease G-phase formation, where it is
   replaced by other intermetallic phases such as Z-phase and pi-phase that
   do not experience liquation during pre-weld annealing treatments.
   Suppressing G-phase formation was ultimately determined to be a function
   of minimizing silicon content, and understabilizing the Nb/(C + 6/7N)
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the synthesis, characterization and use of a composite
   material made of a renewable source and metallic nanoparticles for
   biosensing applications. Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) is a product
   isolated from natural cellulose fibers, which is of approximately 100 nm
   long and 10 nm wide in size. We augmented the surface area and tailored
   the chemical affinity of NCC by optimally dressing it with gold
   nanoparticles (AuNPs). The deposition of AuNPs on NCC was controlled by
   using cationic polyethylenimine (PEI) at different pHs. AuNPs were
   thiol-functionalized using different linkers prior to enzyme
   immobilization. The enzyme (glucose oxidase or GOx) was conjugated on
   the composite by carbodiimide coupling, and subsequent activation of
   linker-carboxylic acid group. Our results showed that GOx was attached
   to the surface of the NCC nanocomposite. Moreover, the amount of GOx
   loaded onto the support depended on the length of the thiol-linker used.
   The lower value (20.3 mg/mg of support) was obtained with the longer
   thiol-linker (11 carbon chain) compared to 25.2 mg/mg of support for the
   smaller thiol-linker (3 carbon chain).}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite (HA) depositions on metallic biomedical implants have
   been widely applied to generate bioactive surfaces in simulated
   biological environments. Meanwhile, highly ordered TiO2 nanotubular
   arrays obtained via anodization have attracted increasing interest for
   biomedical applications. However, capability to grow HA coating on TiO2
   nanotubular arrays at room temperature remains problematic. In this
   study, we applied a precalcification treatment on anodic TiO2
   nanotubular arrays to examine the formation of HA coating in simulated
   biological fluid. The as-formed TiO2 nanotubular arrays on titanium were
   immersed in boiling saturated Ca(OH)(2) solutions for up to 40 min. The
   specimens readily grew HA once immersed in the simulated biological
   fluid (SBF) after 4 days immersion. The carbonated HA coating was formed
   with more than 5 mu m thickness after 12 days of immersion while only a
   few calcium phosphate particles were observed on annealing TiO2
   nanotubular arrays immersed in the same solution for the same duration.
   This treatment dramatically improved efficiency for promoting HA
   formation on anodic TiO2 nanotubular arrays without high temperature

Title = {{Detection of melanocytes in skin histopathological images using radial

Abstract = {{In the diagnosis of skin melanoma by analyzing histopathological images,
   the detection of the melanocytes in the epidermis area is an important
   step. However, the detection of the melanocytes from the epidermis area
   is difficult because other keratinocytes that are very similar to the
   melanocytes are also present. This paper proposes a novel computer-aided
   technique for detection of the melanocytes in the epidermis area of skin
   histopathological images. An adaptive threshold technique is first
   applied to segment all the keratinocytes in the image. In order to
   distinguish the melanocytes from other keratinocytes, a novel technique
   based on radial line scanning is proposed to estimate the halo region of
   the melanocytes. Based on the estimated halo region of all the nuclei,
   an area ratio of estimated halo region and the nuclei is used to detect
   the melanocytes from all the keratinocytes. Experimental results on 40
   different histopathological images of skin tissue containing 341
   melanocytes show that the proposed technique provides a superior
   performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have successfully delivered FITC and FITC-Dextran (70, 250 kDa) into
   canola protoplasts by centrifuging cells with different amounts of
   microbubbles at variable centrifuge speed. The efficiency is around
   90\%, while cell viability remains high. Confocal microscopy images show
   that both FITC and FITC-Dextran are scattered inside the cytoplasm and
   the cell nucleus. Pores are observed on canola protoplast cell membranes
   and cell walls when centrifuged with microbubbles, while the membrane of
   cells centrifuged alone remain intact and smooth. We hypothesize that
   the collision between the microbubbles and cells or the bursting of
   microbubbles are the main reasons for the formation of these pores.
   Biomaterials can diffuse into the cells once the pathway is created. (c)

Abstract = {{In this research, tubes consisting of a co-extruded dense YSZ
   electrolyte (similar to 10 mu m) and porous NiO-YSZ anode (similar to
   200 mu m) were modified with different cathodes and anode infiltration
   to investigate the effects on both power and thermal cycling tolerance.
   Type of cathode (produced by infiltration of LSM into a porous YSZ
   matrix or by hand-painting of an LSM YSZ ink), the type of pore former
   used in the cathode (graphite or poly (methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and
   the infiltration of the anode (no infiltration, or with infiltration
   steps using a co-precipitated SDC (Samaria doped ceria) mixture, or
   Ni-SDC mixture) were investigated as variables. The overall aim of this
   work is to produce cells that are more tolerant to thermal cycling,
   without sacrificing power density.
   Testing at 750 degrees C with 20 mL/min of dry hydrogen shows that anode
   infiltration has a particularly advantageous effect on performance,
   raising the peak power and reducing the degradation in peak power seen
   after aggressive cycling (100 degrees C/min heating and cooling rates).
   Cell power can be improved by LSM infiltration into a porous YSZ layer
   when the thickness of the YSZ layer is optimised and there is sufficient
   LSM. Infiltrated cells with cathode thicknesses of 20-40 mu m functioned
   better than those 10-15 mu m thick despite having a similar LSM/YSZ
   weight ratio. This may be due to the additional reaction zone available
   as a result of the higher LSM mass, suggesting that the reaction zone
   extends beyond 15 mu m from the electrolyte. LSM and SDC infiltrated
   fine particles (50-100 nm) show good distribution and connectivity in
   the cathode and anode of the cells respectively. When PMMA is used as
   the pore former in the porous YSZ matrix, a slightly better cell
   performance is obtained compared with graphite as the pore former.
   Monitoring the power variation is found to be a more reliable tool than
   open circuit voltage (OCV) measurements for studying the effect of
   thermal cycling on cell stability. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Speciation of complex mixtures of trace explosives presents a formidable
   challenge for sensors that rely on chemoselective interfaces due to the
   unspecific nature of weak intermolecular interactions. Nanomechanical
   infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides higher selectivity in molecular
   detection without using chemoselective interfaces by measuring the
   photothermal effect of adsorbed molecules on a thermally sensitive
   microcantilever. In addition, unlike conventional IR spectroscopy, the
   detection sensitivity is drastically enhanced by increasing the IR laser
   power, since the photothermal signal comes from the absorption of IR
   photons and nonradiative decay processes. By using a broadly tunable
   quantum cascade laser for the resonant excitation of molecules, we
   increased the detection sensitivity by one order of magnitude compared
   to the use of a conventional IR monochromator. Here, we demonstrate the
   successful speciation and quantification of picogram levels of ternary
   mixtures of similar explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylene
   trinitramine (RDX), and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)) using

   signalling constellations including quaternary phase shift keying,
   eight-phase shift keying and sixteen quadrature amplitude modulation.
   The authors construct DC-free codes for these signalling alphabets and
   present their spectral performance. They show that, similar to DC-free
   codes for baseband systems, the variance of the running digital sum
   remains a good indicator of spectral performance and that Justesen's
   relationship between the sum variance and cut-off frequency holds.}},

Abstract = {{Considering a symmetric Gaussian multi-way relay channel (MWRC) with K
   users, this work compares two transmission strategies, namely one-way
   relaying (OWR) and multi-way relaying (MWR), in terms of their
   achievable rates. While in OWR, only one user acts as data source at
   each time and transmits in the uplink channel access, users can make
   simultaneous transmissions in MWR. First, we prove that for MWR,
   lattice-based relaying ensures a gap less than 1/2(K-1) bit from the
   capacity upper bound while MWR based on decode-and-forward (DF) or
   amplify-and-forward (AF) is unable to guarantees this rate gap. For DF
   and AF, we identify situations where they also have a rate gap less than
   1/2(K-1) bit. Later, we show that although MWR has higher relaying
   complexity, surprisingly, it can be outperformed by OWR depending on K
   and the system SNR. Summarily speaking, for large K and small users'
   transmit power, OWR usually provides higher rates than MWR.}},

Title = {{Concurrent neuromechanical and functional gains following
   upper-extremity power training post-stroke}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Repetitive task practice is argued to drive neural
   plasticity following stroke. However, current evidence reveals that
   hemiparetic weakness impairs the capacity to perform, and practice,
   movements appropriately. Here we investigated how power training (i.e.,
   high-intensity, dynamic resistance training) affects recovery of
   upper-extremity motor function post-stroke. We hypothesized that power
   training, as a component of upper-extremity rehabilitation, would
   promote greater functional gains than functional task practice without
   deleterious consequences.
   Method: Nineteen chronic hemiparetic individuals were studied using a
   crossover design. All participants received both functional task
   practice (FTP) and HYBRID (combined FTP and power training) in random
   order. Blinded evaluations performed at baseline, following each
   intervention block and 6-months post-intervention included: Wolf Motor
   Function Test (WMFT-FAS, Primary Outcome), upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer
   Motor Assessment, Ashworth Scale, and Functional Independence Measure.
   Neuromechanical function was evaluated using isometric and dynamic joint
   torques and concurrent agonist EMG. Biceps stretch reflex responses were
   evaluated using passive elbow stretches ranging from 60 to 180 degrees/s
   and determining: EMG onset position threshold, burst duration, burst
   intensity and passive torque at each speed.
   Results: Primary outcome: Improvements in WMFT-FAS were significantly
   greater following HYBRID vs. FTP (p = .049), regardless of treatment
   order. These functional improvements were retained 6-months
   post-intervention (p = .03).
   Secondary outcomes: A greater proportion of participants achieved
   minimally important differences (MID) following HYBRID vs. FTP (p =
   .03). MIDs were retained 6-months post-intervention. Ashworth scores
   were unchanged (p > .05).
   Increased maximal isometric joint torque, agonist EMG and peak power
   were significantly greater following HYBRID vs. FTP (p < .05) and
   effects were retained 6-months post-intervention (p's < .05). EMG
   position threshold and burst duration were significantly reduced at fast
   speeds (>= 120 degrees/s) (p's < 0.05) and passive torque was reduced
   post-washout (p < .05) following HYBRID.
   Conclusions: Functional and neuromechanical gains were greater following
   HYBRID vs. FPT. Improved stretch reflex modulation and increased
   neuromuscular activation indicate potent neural adaptations.
   Importantly, no deleterious consequences, including exacerbation of
   spasticity or musculoskeletal complaints, were associated with HYBRID.
   These results contribute to an evolving body of contemporary evidence
   regarding the efficacy of high-intensity training in neurorehabilitation
   and the physiological mechanisms that mediate neural recovery.}},

Title = {{Model development for prediction and mitigation of dissolved oxygen sags
   in the Athabasca River, Canada}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{443}},
Pages = {{403-412}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Northern rivers exposed to high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) loads
   are prone to dissolved oxygen (DO) sags in winter due to re-aeration
   occurring within limited open water leads. Additionally, photosynthesis
   is reduced by decreased daylight hours, inability of solar radiation to
   pass through ice, and slower algal growth in winter. The low volumetric
   flow decreases point-source dilution while their travel time increases.
   The Athabasca River in Alberta, Canada, has experienced these sags which
   may affect the aquatic ecosystem. A water quality model for an 800 km
   reach of this river was customized, calibrated, and validated
   specifically for DO and the factors that determine its concentration.
   After validation, the model was used to assess the assimilative capacity
   of the river and mitigation measures that could be deployed. The model
   reproduced the surface elevation and water temperature for the seven
   years simulated with mean absolute errors of <15 cm and <0.9 degrees C
   respectively. The ice cover was adequately predicted for all seven
   winters, and the simulation of nutrients and phytoplankton primary
   productivity were satisfactory. The DO concentration was very sensitive
   to the sediment oxygen demand (SOD), which represented about 50\% of the
   DO sink in winter. The DO calibration was improved by implementing an
   annual SOD based on the BOD load. The model was used to estimate the
   capacity of the river to assimilate BOD loads in order to maintain a DO
   concentration of 7 mg/L, which represents the chronic provincial
   guideline plus a buffer of 0.5 mg/L. The results revealed the maximum
   assimilative BOD load of 8.9 ton/day at average flow conditions, which
   is lower than the maximum permitted load. In addition, the model
   predicted a minimum assimilative flow of about 52 m(3)/s at average BOD
   load. Climate change scenarios could increase the frequency of this low
   flow. A three-level warning-system is proposed to manage the BOD load
   proactively at different river discharges. Other mitigation options were
   explored such as upgrading the wastewater treatment of the major BOD
   point source and oxygen injection in the effluents. The model can be
   used as a management tool with updated SOD values to forecast the DO in
   low flow years and evaluate mitigation measures. As well, the
   methodology presented here can be applied to manage other ice-covered
   rivers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Due to the antimicrobial properties and the widespread use of Ag
   nanoparticles (NPs) in commercial products, the prevalent Ag NPs in
   waste streams can decrease the effectiveness of biological wastewater
   treatments. To determine the effects of Ag NPs on the complex microbial
   communities present in activated sludge, detailed knowledge of the Ag
   NPs toxicity on microorganism communities is necessary. Experiments were
   performed to determine the effects of 1 mg/L Ag NPs on microbial
   communities in activated sludge. Activated sludge samples with and
   without gravity settling were compared to evaluate the impact of
   activated sludge flocs structure on the response of microbial
   communities to Ag NPs. The effects of Ag NPs on the entire microbial
   community in activated sludge were analyzed using 165 rRNA gene based
   polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (PCR-DGGE). The results suggest that certain microbial species in the
   intact activated sludge were highly sensitive to Ag NPs treatment,
   although no reduction in cell culturability was detected through
   heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs) during the 24 h Ag NPs treatment.
   Conversely, one log unit reduction in the HPCs with no microbial
   community structure changes was observed for unsettled activated sludge
   flocs (intact activated sludge treated by 3 h gravity-settling) after 24
   h Ag NPs treatment. This study strongly suggests that Ag NPs can impact
   the activated sludge microbial community and cell culturability
   depending on the physical structure of the activated sludge flocs, the
   spatial distribution of microorganisms in activated sludge flocs, and
   the community structures in the activated sludge. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{101-109}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{A low-cost, low-pressure cold spray unit was used to fabricate tungsten
   carbide (WC)-based metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings. A sintered and
   crushed WC-based powder was mixed with nickel powder, forming various
   compositions of mechanical blends. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   coupled with image analysis, Vickers micro-hardness, and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the coatings. Image analysis
   was used to determine the WC content in the coating and the mean free
   path between the reinforcing particles. The WC content in the coating
   increased as the WC content in the powder blend increased. Each coating
   fabricated by the various mechanical blend compositions had a
   non-homogeneous distribution of the hard WC reinforcing particles
   embedded in the nickel matrix. However, as the WC content in the powder
   increased, the coating porosity decreased and the WC deposition
   efficiency increased. An inversely proportional relationship between
   hardness and mean free path between the reinforcing WC particles was
   observed, where a decrease in mean free path led to an increase in
   hardness. The hardness of each MMC coating was predicted using the rule
   of mixtures (ROM) method and compared to the experimental hardness
   values. However, the ROM method did not completely describe the
   strengthening mechanism of the MMC coatings because densification,
   plastic deformation, and adiabatic shear instability played a role,
   especially for the coatings with a lower WC content. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We report the fabrication, characterisation, and electro-catalytic
   activity of <0.3 mg cm(-2) platinum deposits onto similar to 500 nm long
   nickel nanopillar substrates (Ni-NP) synthesised by glancing angle
   deposition (GLAD). This is the first reported study of GLAD-based Pt-Ni
   electro-catalysts and the first alcohol oxidation study on any GLAD
   based electro-catalyst. The Pt was deposited onto Ni-NP via either 1) an
   unconventional, self-limiting, relatively high current density
   galvanostatic deposition, with a Pt counter electrode as the source of
   Pt, or 2) via a conventional potentiostatic deposition from Pt salts
   dissolved in acidic electrolytes. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and
   Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) confirm the
   successful deposition of Pt onto Ni-NP, while Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM) shows that the nanopillar morphology is preserved but
   the Pt morphology is significantly different between the two methods.
   The galvanostatic procedure resulted in a conformal Pt deposition over
   the entire surface of the Ni-NP. The conventional procedure appeared to
   be mass-transfer limited, with most of the Pt being deposited on the
   tops of the Ni-NP. Cyclic voltammetry in 1 M KOH shows an enhancement of
   the surface area of the catalysts upon Pt deposition and corroborates
   the presence of Pt on the Ni-NP surface. Both prepared catalysts show
   high electro-catalytic activity towards 2-propanol oxidation in the KOH
   electrolyte at 60 degrees C. The activity enhancement below 300 mV vs.
   RHE (RHE = reversible hydrogen electrode) was attributed to the combined
   activity of the Pt and Ni components in the catalysts. At higher
   potentials, a bifunctional mechanism was suggested. Finally, a
   geometric/composition effect may be at work in the traditionally
   deposited catalyst, and requires further investigation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{One of the current practices for measuring heat flux during flash fire
   testing, forest fires, and other industrial cases focuses on the use of
   semi-infinite models to predict the heat flux during exposure through
   surface temperature measurements on simulated skin sensors. For short
   time frames, these models can be shown to have acceptable accuracy.
   However, when considering longer time exposures at reduced heat fluxes,
   such as with firefighters in a forest fire, the accuracy of these models
   could be brought into question. A one-dimensional, finite length scale,
   transient heat conduction model was developed using a Green's function
   approach on a rectangular sensor. The model was developed using
   transient temperature boundary conditions to avoid the use of
   complicated radiation and convection conditions at each boundary. For
   comparison, a semi-infinite model utilizing the same boundary condition
   on the exposed face was solved using both the Laplace transform method
   and Green's function method. Experimental data was obtained during
   exposure to a cone calorimeter. All measurements were taken for a
   minimum duration of 2 min. This temperature data was used to develop
   appropriate curves for the boundary conditions and validate the
   analytical models. It was found that the temperature obtained from the
   one-dimensional transient heat conduction model based on Green's
   functions agreed well with the experimental results over longer exposure
   times, and with reduced error when compared with the semi-infinite
   model. This suggests that modeling the problem on a finite-length scale
   will produce more accurate or more conservative temperature and heat
   flux results over extended periods of exposure in high heat load
   applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregation of DNA molecules induced by cationic polymers is of
   importance to applications in gene delivery. In this work, we performed
   a series of umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations to
   calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) between two DNA molecules in
   the presence of polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules using the weighted
   histogram analysis method. The distance between the centers of mass of
   the two DNAs was chosen as the reaction coordinate, and the location and
   depth of the global minimum in the PMF curve were used to gauge the
   compactness and stability of the formed aggregate. The effects of PEI to
   DNA charge ratio (N/P charge ratio) and protonation state of the PEI
   were investigated. The DNA aggregation was found to be more favorable at
   higher PEI/DNA charge ratios and higher PEI protonation ratios. As
   compared with small multivalent ions, PEIs give rise to stronger DNA
   attraction even with an N/P charge ratio at which the DNAs are
   overneutralized. The effect of changing the protonation ratio on the
   compactness of the aggregate is more prominent than changing the N/P
   charge ratio, while the depth of the PMF well is more strongly
   influenced by the N/P charge ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Over the course of this coming century, global electricity use is
   expected to grow at least five fold and if stringent greenhouse gas
   emissions controls are in place the growth could be more than seven fold
   from current levels. Given that the electric power sector represents the
   second largest industrial use of water and given growing concerns about
   the nature and extent of future water scarcity driven by population
   growth and a changing climate, significant concern has been expressed
   about the electricity sector's use of water going forward. In this
   paper, the authors demonstrate that an often overlooked but absolutely
   critical issue that needs to be taken into account in discussions about
   the sustainability of the electric sector's water use going forward is
   the tremendous turn over in electricity capital stock that will occur
   over the course of this century; i.e., in the scenarios examined here
   more than 80\% of global electricity production in the year 2050 is from
   facilities that have not yet been built. The authors show that because
   of the large scale changes in the global electricity system, the water
   withdrawal intensity of electricity production is likely to drop
   precipitously with the result being relatively constant water
   withdrawals over the course of the century even in the face of the large
   growth in electricity usage. The ability to cost effectively reduce the
   water intensity of power plants with carbon dioxide capture and storage
   systems in particular is key to constraining overall global water use.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to operate a grid-connected induction
   machine such that reactive power may be supplied to the grid. Using the
   principle of series voltage injection, two control approaches are
   presented. The first control approach is suitable for systems with
   steady loads and allows the reactive power flow to be dynamically
   controlled. The second control approach may be applied to systems with
   variable loads and results in operation with a leading power factor The
   principle of operation is demonstrated using an induction machine with a
   three-phase converter and floating DC link inserted into the circuit at
   the Y-point. The converter is controlled to inject 3-phase voltages at
   the motor Y-point to introduce a phase-shift between the motor winding
   voltage and the grid voltage. As the magnitude of the injected voltage
   is adjusted, the phase angle of the machine current can be shifted to be
   less lagging, in phase with or leading the grid voltage. The paper
   presents the theory behind the approach together with simulations and
   experimental results. The results demonstrate reactive power supply to
   the grid.}},

Abstract = {{For high-power current-source drive systems, due to the limited dc choke
   size and low converter switching frequency, the distortion of dc-link
   current cannot be ignored. The distorted dc-link current will introduce
   interharmonics in the grid side and the motor side through the rectifier
   and the inverter, and may give rise to the system resonance at certain
   motor speeds. In this paper, the harmonics interaction in high-power PWM
   current-source drive systems is investigated, and a method for the
   system resonance estimation is proposed. The investigation and proposed
   resonance estimation method is verified through both simulations and
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{DC bus voltage control is an important task in the control of a dc
   microgrid or hybrid ac/dc microgrid system. To improve the dc bus
   voltage control dynamics, traditional approaches are mainly based on
   feeding forward the load or source power. However, in the microgrid
   system with distributed dc sources and loads, the traditional
   feedforward based methods need remote measurement or communications. In
   this paper, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) based dc bus voltage
   control is proposed, which does not need the remote measurement or
   communication with a true ``plug-and-play{''} feature. Based on this
   observer, a novel dc bus voltage control scheme with
   pulse-width-modulation (PWM) dead-time compensation is developed. The
   proposed method can suppress the transient fluctuations of dc bus
   voltage, and improve the power quality in such a hybrid microgrid
   system. The performance of the presented control strategy has been
   successfully verified in a 30 kVA dc subgrid including battery energy
   storage system, photovoltaic power generation system and a dc load.}},

Abstract = {{A controller is described for a 3-phase PMSM that uses an open winding
   and a dual inverter drive with a floating bridge. The drive has a
   voltage boosting function that: extends the high-speed range of the
   PMSM; operates the main inverter bridge at unity power factor above the
   base speed; compensates for battery voltage fluctuations. The main
   features of the controller presented are: (a) coordinated control of the
   two inverters to supply the motor with the demand voltage and frequency;
   (b) the floating bridge dc capacitor voltage can be regulated and its
   output voltage used to boost the machine terminal voltage when required;
   (c) the motor speed is controlled via torque control is independent of
   the floating bridge dc voltage control. Simulation results are used to
   clarify the motor-drive characteristics in the speed range extension
   region. Experimental results show that a significant speed range
   extension is achievable even when using a PMSM with a very low
   inductance.}},

Abstract = {{Power switches in many DC/AC inverter designs are hard switched, which
   generates EMI noise and losses in the inverter. A relatively low
   switching frequency may be used to increase the inverter efficiency;
   however, this imposes a compromise in the size of the inverter
   components. In this paper, switching losses have been minimized by
   incorporating Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) in a full-bridge topology, at
   switch turn-on and an adaptive Variable Dead-time Control at switch
   turn-off. Since the soft switching technique is based on control
   algorithms, there is no additional cost and size involved with the use
   of any extra auxiliary circuits. Further, the size of the output filter
   is reduced without increasing the switching frequency, by connecting
   multiple grid-tied inverters in parallel. This interleaving technique
   also improves the quality of the current fed into the utility grid. The
   proposed method was implemented on a 250W micro-inverter prototype to
   validate the superior performance of the proposed concept and to compare
   the experimental results with those of the existing methods of soft
   switching.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simple and adaptive thermoacoustic sensor was designed
   to measure Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS). Compared to other
   thermoacoustic sensor designs, our novelty lies in (i) integrating an
   ultrasound medium layer during the measurement to simplify the
   complicated set-up procedures and (ii) taking the effect of ambient
   temperatures into design consideration. After measuring temperature
   increases with various ambient temperatures under different ultrasound
   intensities, a relationship among ultrasound intensities, ambient
   temperatures and coefficients of temporal temperature changes was
   calculated. Our improved design has made the sensor easy to operate and
   its performance more accurate and consistent than the thermoacoustic
   sensor designs without considering ambient temperatures. In all, our
   improved design greatly enhances the thermoacoustic sensor in practical
   ultrasound calibration.}},

Abstract = {{In the diagnosis of various brain disorders by analyzing the brain
   magnetic resonance images (MRI), the segmentation of corpus callosum
   (CC) is a crucial step. In this paper, we propose a fully automated
   technique for CC segmentation in the T1-weighted midsagittal brain MRIs.
   An adaptive mean shift clustering technique is first used to cluster
   homogenous regions in the image. In order to distinguish the CC from
   other brain tissues, area analysis, template matching, in conjunction
   with the shape and location analysis are proposed to identify the CC
   area. The boundary of detected CC area is then used as the initial
   contour in the Geometric Active Contour (GAC) model, and evolved to get
   the final segmentation result. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed technique overcomes the problem of manual initialization in
   existing GAC technique, and provides a reliable segmentation
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{We address the beamforming problem for maximizing the sum rate of a
   multi-operator two-way relay (TWR) network subject to the constraint on
   the total relay transmit power. This scenario is also known as relay
   sharing for multi-way relaying or TWR for multiple operators. The relay
   is assumed to be equipped with multiple antennas, and it uses the
   amplify-and-forward relaying strategy. It is shown that the
   corresponding optimization problem can be represented as a difference of
   convex functions (DC) programming problem which is NP-hard in general.
   Nevertheless, we develop an efficient polynomial time algorithm to solve
   the problem approximately. The performance comparison of the proposed
   polynomial time DC (POTDC) inspired algorithm to the existing
   state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
   outperforms the existing algorithms especially in the case of
   non-symmetric networks.}},

Abstract = {{With the growing amount of renewable energy sources being connected to
   the grid, issues concerning the power quality are becoming increasingly
   important. This is due to the distributed nature of these power sources
   and to their higher variability when compared to more traditional
   sources. For photovoltaic sources, total harmonic distortion of current
   is one of the main power quality parameter closely related to solar
   irradiance. This work explores this relationship and employs
   computational intelligence techniques in order to predict current
   distortion values. Preliminary results confirm the possibility to
   capture these relationships and predict occurrence of power quality
   issues ahead of time.}},

Abstract = {{Remote monitoring in the arctic is necessary to understand the effects
   of climate change on the cryosphere. The harsh climate makes this
   difficult by limiting access, interfering with equipment, and providing
   minimal environmental energy. Energy harvesting allows some independence
   of remote monitors but requires an energy management strategy to be
   effective. This strategy must regulate the remote monitor's exchange of
   energy for data and be able to balance data requirements with the
   environment's limited energy profile. A simulation is used to compare
   two strategies: the first attempts to maximize data quality at the
   expense of energy security, while the second limits its energy usage to
   selectively improve certain data properties at the expense of others.
   The second strategy is able to collect more data using less energy
   because of its flexibility. In the future, this simulation will be
   experimentally validated and used to explore control strategies for
   various remote monitoring applications.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient design of wireless networks is a challenging task. Recently,
   the concept of cross-layer design in wireless networks has been
   investigated extensively. In this work, we present a cross-layer
   optimization framework, i.e., joint rate control, routing, link
   scheduling and power control for multi-hop time division multiple access
   (TDMA) networks. In particular, we study a centralized controller that
   coordinates the routing process and transmissions of links such that the
   network lifetime is maximized. We show that the aforementioned design
   can be formulated as a mixed integer-linear program (MILP) which has
   worst case exponential complexity to compute the optimal solution.
   Therefore, our main contribution is to propose a computationally
   efficient approach to solve the cross-layer design problem. Our design
   methodology is based on a so-called Difference of Convex functions
   algorithm (DCA) to provide either optimal or near-optimal solutions with
   finite convergence. The numerical results are encouraging and
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. One of the
   advantages of the proposed design is the capability to handle very
   large-scale problems which are the usual scenarios encountered in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying dynamic causal relationships between financial time series
   may help explain market dynamics. The Granger causality (G-causality)
   test is a method to detect linear causal relationships between time
   series. However, there exists significant evidence for nonlinear
   causality between financial time series. Hence, several nonlinear
   extensions of G-causality (NLG-causality) were proposed. Moreover, a new
   method called the coupling spectrum (CS) was recently proposed to find
   the nonlinear causal relationship between two time series. In many
   financial cases, the direction of causality is changing over time. In
   this work, we adapt the NLG-causality and CS methods by using a moving
   window technique to identify possible causality changes over time. We
   compare the performance of the adapted CS and NLG-causality methods on a
   simulated temporal nonlinear causal system and a real data set the stock
   prices of Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corporation. The simulated and
   empirical results show that the CS method is more robust than the
   NLG-causality method and that CS is capable of dealing with time-varying
   nonlinear causality between financial time series.}},

Abstract = {{The use of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as potential
   electrolytes for rechargeable Zn-anode batteries suffers from a
   disadvantage of insufficient conductivity. In this study, water added
   ionic liquids composed of pyrrolidinium/imidazolium cations and
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions were investigated with regard
   to their physicochemical behavior and the response of Zn/Zn(II) redox
   reactions. Peak conductivity was achieved by adding water in the range
   of 2.0-2.5 wt\%. The best kinetic properties for Zn/Zn(II) redox,
   including decreased redox overpotential and on average three times the
   diffusion rate and exchange current density, were also achieved for this
   composition range. Water also affected the morphology of Zn
   electrodeposited from RTILs. Zinc deposits grew from nanocrystalline to
   microcrystalline in scale with poorer adhesion in water added RTILs with
   pyrrolidinium cations. However, Zn deposits obtained from water added
   RTILs with imidazolium cations showed no obvious change in size and

Abstract = {{The electrochemistry of a Zn/Zn(II) couple was studied and compared in
   four kinds of room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs)
   (1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide (BMP-DCA),
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide
   (EMI-TFSI), 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)
   imide (BMP-TFSI) and 1-methyl-1-pentylpyrrolidinium
   bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (MPP-TFSI)), with the aim of
   screening desirable RTILs as replacements for traditional aqueous
   electrolytes for Zn rechargeable batteries. Cyclic voltammetry was used
   to study the reversibility and cyclability of Zn redox in each RTIL. The
   morphology of Zn deposits prepared from each RTIL was characterized by
   scanning electron microscopy. The results show that Zn redox has the
   best cyclability in the DCA-based RTIL, with the Zn deposit morphology
   characterized by finely dispersed rods composed of granular Zn particles
   (similar to 50-100 nm in size). In TFSI-based ionic liquids, the
   Zn/Zn(II) couple reaction had a higher current density than that in the
   DCA-based ionic liquid, implying different electron transfer processes.
   BMP-DCA and EMI-TFSI are promising RTILs worthy of further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Surgery on a freely beating-heart is extremely difficult as the surgeon
   must perform the procedure while following the heart's fast motion.
   However, by controlling a teleoperated robot to continuously follow the
   heart's motion, the surgeon can operate on a seemingly stationary heart.
   The heart's motion is calculated from ultrasound images and thus
   involves a non-negligible delay estimated to be 100 ms that, if not
   compensated for, can cause the robot end-effector (i.e., the surgical
   tool) to collide with and puncture the heart. This research proposes the
   use of a Smith predictor to compensate for this time delay. The results
   suggest that this improves heart motion tracking as the mean absolute
   error, the difference between the surgeon's motion and the distance
   between the heart and surgical tool, and the mean integrated square
   error decreased.}},

   characterization using XRD and TEM observations. These calculations
   provide a useful guide for selecting a glass forming composition
   suitable for diffusion barrier applications for Cu metallization. The
   selected composition was studied as a diffusion barrier in contact with

   up to 550 degrees C, whereupon it dissociates into its constituents

Abstract = {{Ultrasound is capable of transfecting cells with DNA through the process
   of sonoporation. Cell transfection by ultrasound alone is a relatively
   inefficient process but sonicating cells in the presence of microbubbles
   can significantly increase transfection efficiency. Unfortunately,
   microbubbles are relatively large (similar to 3 mu m diameter) and
   cannot leave the vasculature, preventing their direct interaction with
   cancer cells in solid tumors. Perfluorobutane microbubbles can be
   condensed into submicron nanodroplets that may be able to extravasate
   out of the tumor vasculature, potentially allowing these nanodroplets to
   accumulate in tumors. The current study compares microbubbles and
   nanodroplets for their abilities to enhance ultrasound-mediated
   transfection of cultured HEK293 cells. The nanodroplets in the current
   study were almost 6-fold smaller than their corresponding microbubbles
   and could be phase changed back into microbubbles with 400 cycles of 1.7
   mechanical index ultrasound. Given enough cycles of ultrasound, low
   concentrations of nanodroplets (<1\% v/v) were just as effective as
   microbubbles for enhancing ultrasound-mediated transfection of pEGFP-C1
   DNA into HEK293 cells and high concentrations of nanodroplets (>2 \%
   v/v) were 2- to 3-fold more effective than microbubbles for transfecting
   HEK293 cells. The current study supports the use of nanodroplets to
   enhance ultrasound-mediated transfection due to their equivalent or
   greater transfection enhancing abilities as well as their smaller size
   which may allow nanodroplets to accumulate in tumors.}},

   one element and receiving on all elements of an array, then firing
   another transmit element and receiving on all elements until all
   transmit-receive element pairs have been sampled. It offers excellent
   resolution but at the expense of signal-to-noise. To remedy this
   difficulty we propose an aperture encoding scheme that involves firing
   on multiple elements sampled from a Hadamard S-matrix, then applying
   matrix inversion methods to decouple signals to recover the effective
   synthetic aperture imaging set for subsequent image reconstruction.
   Because more than one elements are fired at a time, signal-to-noise is
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{Optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) can produce
   micron-scale, high-resolution images of optically-absorbing
   chromophores. The pressure rise of photoacoustic signals is proportional
   to the Grueneisen parameter, which is temperature dependent. High laser
   repetition-rates may cause overlapping of adjacent laser pulses on
   targets in laser-scanning OR-PAM. When laser-pulse-repetition intervals
   are shorter than thermal relaxation times, the zone of laser-spot
   overlap between pulses can generate higher photoacoustic signal than
   cases where beam-spots do not overlap or in cases where laser
   pulse-intervals are longer than the thermal relaxation time. This is
   because subsequent laser pulses experience higher Grueneisen parameters
   than previous pulses due to temperature rises induced by the previous
   pulses. Here, we present our recent studies on photoacoustic signals
   strength varying with scanning speed and laser-repetition-rate on black
   tape, human hair and rat blood respectively.}},

   and receive. As well, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be compromised
   when transmitting or receiving on only one row or column at a time. A
   new imaging method is proposed for this array architecture using
   capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) which can
   provide two-way focusing in both lateral and elevational directions
   while providing optimal SNR. This method is a variation of synthetic
   aperture imaging wherein the columns active upon transmit and receive
   events are determined by applying a bias to specific columns upon
   transmission and reception in an S-sequence encoded pattern.
   Mathematical derivations of this method are presented and simulations
   are done to compare this imaging method to previously published
   crossed-electrode array imaging schemes, as well as to fully-populated
   2-D phased array imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Proactive optimal Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control is a promising
   solution to improve both the freeway capacity and the travel time.
   Despite this well-recognized fact, most of the previous studies found
   that the VSL control strategy was capable of improving only the freeway
   travel time. This finding hinders the overall mobility benefits from the
   computationally intensive proactive optimal VSL control and its
   credibility compared to the other control strategies those do not
   involve real-time traffic state prediction and optimization. To resolve
   this issue, in this paper, the authors adopt a previously developed
   novel VSL control strategy that explicitly considers traffic
   characteristics at active bottleneck, and its upstream-downstream links.
   Then, the performance of the control strategy has been evaluated within
   a predictive control framework, considering several objective functions
   (including stand-alone objective and combination of multiple
   objectives). Moreover, within the control framework, DynaTAM-VSL has
   been used as a prediction model. To find the optimal values of control
   variable at each control horizon, the authors adopt the multi-start
   Sequential Quadratic Programming, which starts a local solver from
   multiple start points. A sensitivity analysis is performed to see how
   the weight parameters of the partial objectives influence the VSL
   performance, which resolves existing paradoxical results of VSL mobility
   benefits. In addition, the model is simulated for a range of demand
   inputs, and analysis is carried out to see how efficient the VSL control
   is to improve the freeway mobility. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The design of steel pipelines against longitudinal loading induced by
   soil movement and temperature requires an understanding of the strain
   demand induced by the environment in comparison with the strain
   resistance of the pipes. Girth weld flaws have been identified as the
   potential location of failure under longitudinal tensile strains due to
   being the least ductile. Strain based design for the prediction of the
   longitudinal tensile strain capacity of steel pipes have been
   extensively studied by Wang, et al and included in the Canadian
   standards association code of practice CSA Z662.11 {[}1]. The extensive
   track record of tests have culminated into two sets of equations for the
   critical strain in girth welded pipes with surface breaking and buried
   defects as functions of the different pipe and flaw parameters.
   The CSA Z662.11 strain capacity equations were developed using wide
   plate tests with the obvious limitation of the inability to consider the
   effect of the internal pressure of the pipe. However, recent studies by
   Wang et al led to the development of a new set of equations that predict
   the tensile strain capacity for pipes with an internal pressure factor
   of 0.72.
   This paper analyses the two critical strain equations in CSA Z662-11 to
   understand the effect of different girth weld flaw and pipe parameters
   on the expected behavior of pipes. Also the critical strain equations
   developed in {[}2]have been analysed and compared to the equations in
   CSA Z662-11. Using the equations in CSA Z662-11, a 34 and 36 full
   factorial experimental design was conducted for the planar
   surface-breaking defect and the planar buried defect respectively. For
   the case of surface breaking defects the dependence of the tensile
   strain capacity (epsilon(crit)(t)) on apparent CTOD toughness (delta),
   ratio of defect height to pipe wall thickness (eta), ratio of yield
   strength to tensile strength (A) and the ratio of defect length to pipe
   wall thickness (xi) has been studied. epsilon(crit)(t) has been
   evaluated at the maximum, minimum and intermediate values of each
   parameter according to the allowable ranges given in the code which
   resulted in the evaluation of epsilon(crit)(t) for 81 different
   combinations of the parameters. The average value of epsilon(crit)(t) at
   the maximum, minimum and middle value of each parameter has been
   calculated. The visualization of the results showed that eta, delta and
   xi have the most significant effect on epsilon(crit)(t) among the four
   parameters for the case of surface breaking defect.
   Similarly for buried defects the dependence of epsilon(crit)(t) on
   delta, eta, lambda, xi, and the pipe wall thickness (t) has been
   studied. The evaluation of epsilon(crit)(t) for all possible
   combinations of the maximum, intermediate and, minimum values of the 6
   parameters resulted in epsilon(crit)(t) values for 729 different
   combinations. The variation of the average epsilon(crit)(t) over the
   maximum, intermediate and minimum values of the parameters showed that
   delta, psi, xi and eta are the parameters having the greatest effect on
   epsilon(crit)(t) for the case of a buried defect.
   Further investigations could be carried out to determine suitable upper
   and lower bounds for the parameters for which no bounded range is
   defined in the CSA Z662-11 code.}},

Abstract = {{The cold bend pipelines may be affected by the geotechnical movements
   due to unstable slopes, soil type and seismic activities. An extensive
   experimental study was conducted by Sen et al. in 2006 to understand the
   buckling behaviour of cold bend pipes. In their experiments, it was
   noted that one high pressure X65 pipe specimen failed under axial and
   bending loads due to pipe body tensile side fracture which occurred
   after the development of a wrinkle. The behaviour of this cold bend pipe
   specimen under bending load has been investigated numerically to
   understand the conditions leading to pipe body tension side fracture
   following the compression side buckling. Bending load has been applied
   on a finite element model of the cold bend by increasing the curvature
   of it according to the experimental studies conducted by Sen {[}1]. The
   bending loads have been applied on the model with and without internal
   pressure. The distribution of the plastic strains and von Mises stresses
   as well as the load displacement response of the pipe have been compared
   for both load cases. In this way the experimental results obtained by
   Sen {[}1] have been verified. The visualization of the finite element
   analysis results showed that pipe body failure at the tension side of
   the cold bend takes place under equal bending loads only in case of
   combined loading with internal pressure.}},

Abstract = {{As an emerging computing paradigm of information processing, Granular
   Computing exhibits great potential in human-centric decision problems
   such as feature selection and feature extraction, pattern recognition
   and knowledge discovery. Optimization plays an important role in these
   areas. The optimization problems arising in Granular Computing area are
   called granular optimization problems in which information granules are
   treated as information processing units and therefore granules denote
   the related solutions. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been
   demonstrated to be a very competitive algorithm in solving global
   optimization problems. In this paper, we develop a novel PSO variant
   called granular PSO to solve problems of granular optimization. Each
   granule in this study is expressed as a multidimension hyper-box with
   each coordinate being described by an interval. In the proposed granular
   PSO, the velocity and position of a particle is represented by intervals
   rather than single numerical values. The velocity and position update
   strategy is modified accordingly. In granular PSO, the solution space
   search behavior of a particle is realized in granule-to-granule manner
   rather than point-to-point format. We provide experimental simulations
   to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed granular PSO algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Context is fundamental in medical data acquisition, data interpretation,
   and medical reasoning. Thus, explicit contextual information must be an
   integral part of primary data analysis and, also, data-mining process.
   This paper contends that there is a need for an explicit context
   modeling in medical data mining, and it presents a conceptual framework
   for the representation of seven contextual dimensions: pragmatic,
   regulatory, relational, temporal, spatial, source reliability, and
   absent-value semantics. The presented framework is based on two
   underlying approaches: (1) a semiotic approach to represent multiple
   interpretations of concepts and data within specific contexts and (2) a
   fuzzy-logic approach to represent vagueness of concepts and imprecision
   of data, which are characteristic in particular contextual dimensions.
   The authors demonstrate context modeling for data acquisition in
   screening, diagnosis, and for research of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   In particular, this paper describes contextual dimensions for two
   important OSA predictors: large neck circumference and habitual snoring.}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder, especially in
   middle-aged and obese patients. OSA only occurs during sleep, and is a
   condition that may go unnoticed for years. OSA is associated with
   increased risk for hypertension, congestive heart failure and coronary
   artery disease. Furthermore, patients with OSA have higher risk during
   and after anesthesia. While undiagnosed OSA is a hazard for the patient,
   treatment is relatively simple and effective. Therefore, analysis of OSA
   risk factors and early detection of OSA are critical. This paper
   describes a fuzzy model for the screening of OSA. The screening
   questionnaire we are focused on is the STOP-Bang questionnaire. It is
   made up of eight yes or no questions to assess the risk of OSA. The
   problem with this model is that lines of low and high risk are too
   clearly drawn. There are certain predictors and combinations of
   predictors that have a greater weight in assessing the patient's risk.
   Thus, we introduce a fuzzy-logic based model for the screening of OSA.
   This model more accurately assesses the risk of OSA by assigning weights
   to certain predictors that play a greater role in OSA.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy models offer a convenient way to describe complex and nonlinear
   systems. Fuzzy relational equations, viewed as a certain class of fuzzy
   models, play a pivotal role in fuzzy modeling. Their theory supports
   ways in which these equations could be solved and offers a
   characterization of the resulting families of solutions. Assuming that
   the corresponding relational equation or a system of relational
   equations is solvable, the theory provides a suite of analytical
   results. If this essential solvability assumption is not satisfied, we
   have to resort to approximate solutions and optimization techniques. In
   this study, we review several approaches to construct fuzzy relational
   models. Those methods include analytical methods, gradientbased (GB)
   methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution
   (DE). We compare these methods with a hybridization of the different
   techniques, namely PSO-GB and DE-GB. The optimization techniques are
   used to design a fuzzy logic processor (FLP), which employs fuzzy logic
   operations in the realization of this network Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)
   transforms real-world numeric data into fuzzy sets, which are used to
   design the fuzzy model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a growing rule-based fuzzy model and its
   design realized with the aid of fuzzy clustering. The objective of this
   study is to develop a new design methodology concerning incremental
   fuzzy rules formed through fuzzy clustering. The proposed model consists
   of three functional components : (a) The premise part of the fuzzy rules
   involves membership functions designed with the aid of the Fuzzy C-Means
   (FCM) clustering algorithm. (b) The consequent part comprises local
   models (linear functions). The parameters of the local models are
   estimated by running a Weighted Least Square Estimation (WLSE). (c) The
   process of rule growth in the growing part is concerned with a
   refinement of the model where a selected rule is split into two or more
   specialized rules providing a better insight into the system. These new
   rules are formed with the aid of a so-called context-based Fuzzy C-Means
   (C-FCM) clustering. The effectiveness of the proposed rule-based model
   is discussed and illustrated with the aid of some numeric studies

Abstract = {{This study elaborates on a design of a face recognition algorithm
   realized with feature extraction from 2D-LDA and the use of
   polynomial-based radial basis function neural networks (P-RBF NNS). The
   overall face recognition system consists of two modules such as the
   preprocessing part and recognition part. The proposed polynomial-based
   radial basis function neural networks is used as an the recognition part
   of the overall face recognition system, while a data preprocessing
   algorithm presented of 2 dimensional linear discriminant analysis
   (2D-LDA) is exploited to data preprocessing. The essential design
   parameters are optimized by means of differential evolution (DE). The
   experimental results for benchmark face datasets - the Yale and ORL
   database demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of 2D-LDA
   algorithm compared with other approaches such as principal component
   analysis (PCA), and fusion of PCA-LDA.}},

Abstract = {{The operational lifetime of remote monitoring systems can be extended
   using energy harvesting techniques. Environmental energy is limited and
   intermittent so energy management is necessary for effective
   implementation and optimal performance. The objective of remote
   monitoring is to acquire the highest quality data possible within this
   energy-constrained environment. A simulator is used to facilitate the
   exploration and optimization of energy management strategies for
   environmental monitoring stations in the Canadian Arctic. The original
   simulator was designed to facilitate testing and demonstrate proof of
   concept; now that the original simulator has proven effective, the fuzzy
   control system used for energy management within the simulator can be
   improved with data quality in mind. By shifting the focus of the
   controller from the time domain to the state domain, improving the
   detail of the load model, increasing the flexibility of the control
   scheme, and implementing a data-centric approach to the optimization,
   the simulator and its controller can be significantly improved. Future
   work will restructure the fuzzy controller to address these improvements
   and work towards implementing the controller in a practical setting.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering methods are proposed and evaluated as post-processing
   techniques that can model the uncertainty of forecasts provided by
   Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems. These techniques try to
   discover relevant information about forecast uncertainty that is
   inherent in the performance records of the system. We investigate the
   application of Fuzzy C-means clustering as a powerful unsupervised
   learning method to discover fuzzy sets of weather forecast situations
   which represent different forecast uncertainty patterns. These patterns
   are then utilized by different distribution fitting methods to obtain
   statistical prediction intervals which can express the expected accuracy
   of the NWP system output. Three years of weather forecast records in two
   weather stations are used in a set of experiments to empirically study
   the application of the proposed approach. Skills of the probabilistic
   forecasts obtained by these post-processing methods are investigated by
   considering cross fold validation and sampling variations. Results
   demonstrate that the Prediction intervals generated by the proposed
   procedure have a higher skill compared to baseline methods.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis is a spinal deformity sometimes treated
   using a brace. Brace treatment is successful when it prevents
   progression (worsening) of the spinal curve during adolescence. However,
   physicians' understanding of what causes progression is unclear, so a
   method for predicting a braced patient's risk of progression could
   assist physicians in planning treatment. Some such models have been
   proposed, but most are ill-suited for clinical use. We applied
   conditional fuzzy clustering to a dataset of past Scoliosis patients, to
   generate prototypes representative of various treatment outcomes. New
   patients' outcomes were predicted by comparing them to the prototypes.
   This model is 76-81\% accurate, highly interpretable, and easily
   integrated into the clinic's workflow, making it a potentially valuable

Abstract = {{Principal curves, as a nonlinear generalization of principal components,
   are a common tool used in multivariate analysis for ends like
   dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. However, one of the
   difficulties that arise when utilizing this technique is that efficiency
   of existing principal curves algorithms is often low when dealing with
   large data set owing to high computational complexity. In the paper, a
   new method based on the idea of ``information granulation and fuzzy
   sets{''} is proposed to improve efficiency and noise robustness. First,
   large amounts of numerical data are granulated into C interval
   (granular) data based on the fuzzy C-means cluster and two criteria of
   granulation, which significantly reduces the amount of data that is to
   be processed in the later step. Then granular principal curves are
   constructed according to the upper and the lower bounds of the interval
   data. Finally we introduce a quantitative index based on the parameter
   alpha to evaluate the fuzziness of granular principal curves output,
   where alpha is a positive parameter delivering some flexibility when
   optimizing the information granule. A series of numeric studies
   completed for synthetic data set provide a useful insight into the
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Construction labour productivity is a cost efficiency measure of crews
   in producing outputs usually at an activity level. The relationship
   between the factors affecting the efficiency of crews and the achieved
   labour productivity is being studied using various stand-alone modeling
   approaches like regression analysis, neural networks, and fuzzy
   logic-based expert systems. However, the developed models suit only a
   specific context and most importantly, a method for transferring and
   generalizing the knowledge captured in the various models has not yet
   been fully developed. This paper presents the application of a granular
   fuzzy modeling approach for transferring captured knowledge and the
   process of developing a granular generalized construction labour
   productivity model having an improved prediction capability. The
   granular fuzzy model abstracts three construction productivity models
   dealing with industrial welding activities using a case-based reasoning
   approach on clusters of the respective model input data prototypes. The
   performance of the model is evaluated using coverage and specificity
   plots and different model parameters are optimized}},

   has been proposed as an alternative to traditional DES when dealing with

   coefficients of the FCM are optimized by means of the PSO.

Abstract = {{The study is focused on a problem of accumulating information with
   finite automata. Potentially infinite input data with a given structure
   and exhibiting possible irregularities and abnormalities are considered.
   Irregularities are acceptable exceptions of the given structure while
   abnormalities are unacceptable exceptions of this structure. In the
   paper, analysis of irregularities and abnormalities with usage of
   different types of finite automata are illustrated. We start with
   classical deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata. Then, a
   description of classical finite automata are generalized in terms of
   imperfectness of transition function and input data. The aim of this
   ``work in progress{''} paper is just examples based illustration of
   different types of finite automata applied to potentially infinite time
   series like input data. Presented examples offer some illustrative
   proposals of farther research.}},

   useful in a variety of applications. In this paper, anomalies in time
   series are divided into two categories, namely amplitude anomalies and
   shape anomalies. A unified framework supporting the detection of both
   types of anomalies is introduced. A fuzzy clustering is employed to
   reveal the available structure within time series and a reconstruction
   criterion is used to assign an anomaly score to each subsequence. In the
   case of detecting anomalies in amplitude, the original representation of
   time series is used, while for detecting anomalies in shape an
   autocorrelation representation of time series to capture shape
   information is employed. Experimental studies concerning two real-world
   data sets are reported.}},

Pages = {{50-59}},
Abstract = {{A recent study developed a set of zone-level negative binomial collision
   prediction models to investigate the relationship between various
   transportation and sociodemographic characteristics and overall roadway
   safety. The developed models used data from Metro Vancouver, British
   Columbia, Canada, and considered the effect of Poisson variations and
   heterogeneity (extra variation) on collision occurrence. This study aims
   to evaluate spatial effects on the occurrence of collisions and to check
   whether the inclusion of spatial variables can improve the goodness of
   fit and inference capability of those previously developed prediction
   models. Transit-reliant and application-based collision prediction
   models with spatial correlations were developed by using the WinBUGS
   software. The convergence of the developed models was tested by trace
   plots of the parameter estimated, the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistics,
   and ratios of Monte Carlo errors relative to the standard deviations of
   the estimates. The results showed that incorporation of the spatial
   correlations affected the parameter estimates, the values of dispersion
   parameters and intercepts, and also the t-statistics. The effect of the
   main exposure variable on all of the models for total, severe, and
   property-damage-only collisions was found to be smaller under spatial
   models. The smaller values of the exponents of the main exposure
   variable confirmed the assumption that spatial effects need to be
   considered in collision prediction models to mitigate any potential bias
   associated with model misspecification.}},

   rates and detection delays are considered as important performance
   measures for univariate alarm design. To reduce false and nuisance
   alarms, filtering is widely used in industries. However there has been
   very limited study on performance specifications of various filtering
   methods, and the quantitative relation between filter properties and
   these performance indices are not well known. In this paper we
   investigate the effect of filtering on detection delay as an important
   alarm performance index.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we focus on the state estimation of the parabolic
   stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs) with boundary
   observation. The standard Kalman filter as the optimal estimator with
   assumption of stochastic process features and known variances on state
   and output disturbances can not account for the naturally present
   constraints on the estimated states and state disturbances. Therefore, a
   motivation to explore the moving horizon estimator (MHE) in the
   distributed parameter system setting, comes from the idea to synthesize
   an estimator that provides the best state estimate in a deterministic
   sense when process and measurement disturbances are with unknown
   statistics and when process constraints on states and disturbances are
   present. We explore the parabolic PDEs model with boundary observation,
   and the spectral decomposition approach is employed to yield a finite
   dimensional system, which incorporates low dimensional approximation of
   the original infinite-dimensional system. The boundary moving horizon
   estimator (MHE) combined with Kalman filter is built to reconstruct
   accurately the low dimensional approximation of the PDE state based on
   the noise corrupted boundary observations and estimated bounds arising
   from the infinite-dimensional parabolic PDEs state representation. The
   issue of parabolic PDEs state constraints inclusion in the MHE with
   Kalman filter is demonstrated by relevant simulation study of
   reaction-diffusion parabolic PDEs process with disturbance constraints
   and demonstration of accurate PDE state reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an RF-DC rectifier for radio frequency energy
   harvesting applications. The proposed passive multi-stage RF-DC
   rectifier uses standard PMOS transistors to allow individual bulk
   biasing without the requirement of deep nwell technology. The RF-DC
   conversion circuit is based on passive threshold self-compensated
   topology. A design strategy to enhance the input voltage range and to
   optimize the power conversion efficiency is presented. Designed and
   simulated in IBM 130-nm CMOS technology, the proposed 915-MHz rectifier
   shows improved output voltage and power conversion efficiency compared
   to recent works. When driving a 1-M Omega load, the RF-DC power
   conversion unit is able to supply I-V output with an input power of -22
   dBm (6.3 mu W) and obtains an efficiency of 11.4\% at -16.1 dBm (24.5 mu
   W) while supplying 2-V to the output.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers transition from sinusoidal to relaxation
   oscillations in the RLC-oscillator the frequency of which is tuned by
   the resonator capacitance. The active element of this oscillator is a
   transconductance amplifier with limited output current. When the tuning
   capacitor is large the oscillations are nearly sinusoidal. Diminishing
   the tuning capacitor value one moves smoothly from sinusoidal to
   relaxation oscillations, and when this capacitor is reduced to zero
   value the oscillator becomes an RL-(magnetic) multivibrator. The
   transition is illustrated using two root loci; the first is called the
   placement root-locus, and it describes the location of characteristic
   equation roots when the tuning capacitor changes but the oscillations
   have not started yet. The second root locus is called the dynamical root
   locus, and it represents the periodic movement of the root locations
   within one oscillation period, and the oscillator is in steady-state
   oscillations. The oscillator was realized using a bipolar
   transconductance amplifier and then tested, and smooth transition from
   sinusoidal to relaxation oscillation was confirmed.}},

Abstract = {{Variable frequency drives (VFD) are widely used in industrial
   facilities, however, dynamic models for VFD-motor systems suitable for
   power system dynamic studies are not available. In this paper, a generic
   VFD-motor system modeling technique is proposed for the case that VFDs
   are able to ride through the fault To illustrate the proposed technique,
   a dynamic model for a low voltage 6-pulse voltage source inverter (VSI)
   based drive and induction motor system with voltage per Hz control is
   created. To verify the accuracy of the developed dynamic model, a case
   study is conducted using a sample VFD-motor system, both derived dynamic
   model and detailed switching model for the same system are simulated
   using Matlab/Simulink, and their dynamic responses are compared. It is
   found that there are good agreements between the two models, and thus
   the accuracy of the developed dynamic model is verified. For the case
   that VFDs will trip out of lines, a VFD trip characteristic curve is
   proposed, and a simple screening procedure is recommended for evaluating
   whether the VFD-motor system shall remain in service or trip out of
   lines in power systems dynamic studies.}},

   the last four decades have resulted in massive inventories of fluid fine
   tailings (850 million m(3)) requiring long term storage within fluid

   significant environmental challenge. In lieu of tailings management
   regulations set forth through the Alberta Government and increased
   public awareness, industry has stepped up efforts to improve their
   tailings management practices. These initiatives aim to transform the
   fluid fine tailings into sustainable components of a reclaimable,
   closure landscape. The paper will outline the historic oil sand tailings
   management practices, the geotechnical challenges associated with
   current and planned tailings dewatering technologies, and the research
   initiatives underway at the University of Alberta aimed at resolving
   these geotechnical challenges.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a methodology to compute the empirical eigenfunctions
   for the order-reduction of parabolic partial differential equation (PDE)
   systems with time-varying domain is explored. In this method, a mapping
   functional is obtained, which relates the time-evolution of the solution
   of parabolic PDE with the time-varying domain to a fixed reference
   domain, while preserving space invariant properties of the raw solution
   ensemble. Subsequently, the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is applied to
   the solution ensemble with fixed spatial domain resulting in a set of
   optimal eigenfunctions that capture the most energy of data. Further,
   the low dimensional set of empirical eigenfunctions is mapped
   ({''}pushed-back{''}) on the original time-varying domain by an
   appropriate mapping resulting in the basis for the construction of the
   reduced-order model of the parabolic PDE system with time-varying
   domain. Finally, this methodology is used for the order-reduction of the
   Czochralski crystal growth process model which is a two dimensional
   parabolic PDE system on a time-varying domain with non-trivial geometry.
   The transformations which relate the raw data on the time-varying and
   time-invariant domains are designed to preserve dynamic features of the
   scalar physical property and comparisons among reduced and high order
   fidelity models are provided.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of detecting causality, from routine operating data, is
   reviewed from a system identification perspective. It is shown that even
   simple examples from the literature under Granger causality analysis do
   not have adequate model fit. As an alternative, this study uses the
   system identification platform to capture causality from process data.
   For example, the model inadequacy test is considered an important reason
   to reject a given causal relationship. The rich framework of system
   identification techniques and the choice of models to deal with
   exogenous variables and nonlinearities are shown to be an extremely
   suitable foundation to detect casual relationships. The utility of the
   proposed approach is illustrated by several benchmark examples including
   the analysis of routine operating data in an industrial case study.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study backstepping boundary observer design for a class
   of distributed parameter systems defined in a cylindrical domain with
   prescribed boundary conditions. We show that applying standard PDE
   backstepping boundary observer design results in a hyperbolic PDE with
   four independent variables which is difficult to solve both numerically
   and analytically. By introducing a modified domain structure using
   conformal mapping, we obtain a simplified design process which is
   reduced to solving a two-dimensional PDE for the kernel function.
   Finally, we sketch the complete treatment to solve the partial
   differential equation describing the kernel equation and then perform a
   simulation study to verify the L-2 performance of the designed observer.
   This technique has a direct application in soft-sensor design for
   internal temperature measurement in systems subjected to dynamic heat
   distribution, particularly microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) devices.}},

   including on-demand and reserved instances with various discounts to
   attract different cloud users. A practical problem facing cloud users is
   how to minimize their costs by choosing among different pricing options
   based on their own demands. In this paper, we propose a new cloud
   brokerage service that reserves a large pool of instances from cloud
   providers and serves users with price discounts. The broker optimally
   exploits both pricing benefits of long-term instance reservations and
   multiplexing gains. We propose dynamic strategies for the broker to make
   instance reservations with the objective of minimizing its service cost.
   These strategies leverage dynamic programming and approximate algorithms
   to rapidly handle large volumes of demand. Our extensive simulations
   driven by large-scale Google cluster-usage traces have shown that
   significant price discounts can be realized via the broker.}},

Abstract = {{This In this paper, we introduce a concept of granular fuzzy rule-based
   system, offer a motivation behind its emergence and elaborate on ensuing
   algorithm developments. It is shown that the granularity of the fuzzy
   rules is directly associated with a reduction (compression) process in
   which the number of rules becomes reduced in order to enhance the
   readability (transparency) of the resulting rule base. The retained
   rules are made more abstract (general) by admitting a granular form of
   the fuzzy sets forming their antecedents. In other words, while the
   original rules read as ``if A(i) then B-i{''} their reduced subset comes
   in the form ``if G(A(i)) the B-i{''} with G(.) denoting a certain
   granular extension of the original fuzzy set (which can be realized e.
   g. in the form of interval fuzzy sets, fuzzy sets of type-2 or rough
   fuzzy-sets). It is shown that the optimization of the reduced set of
   rules is realized through an optimal distribution of iformation
   granularity among fuzzy sets forming the conditions of the reduced
   rules. In particular, it is shown that the distribution of information
   granularity, being regarded as an important design asset, is realized
   through a minimization of a certain objective function quantifying how
   well the granular fuzzy set formed by reduced rules set represents
   (covers) all rules. In this study, we use a technique of particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) as a vehicle of forming a subset of rules and the
   optimal allocation of information granulation to construct a granular
   fuzzy rule-based system. In the sequel, we introduce and idea of a
   granular representation of results of inferences realized in fuzzy
   rule-based system.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar using one-dimensional
   transmit arrays has been thoroughly investigated in the literature. In
   this paper, we consider the MIMO radar problem in the context of
   two-dimensional (2D) transmit arrays. In particular, we address the
   problem of transmit beamforming design using 2D arrays with
   symmetrically missing elements. This situation is encountered in
   practice when some of the array elements are assigned for a different
   purpose, e. g., for communication purposes. We cast the transmit
   beamforming problem as an optimization problem that minimizes the
   difference between a desired transmit beampattern and the actual one
   while satisfying constraints such as uniform transmit power across the
   array elements, sidelobe level control, etc. Moreover, different
   transmit beams can be enforced to have rotational invariance with
   respect to each other, a property that enables efficient computationally
   cheap 2D direction finding at the receiver. Semi-definite relaxation is
   used to recast the optimization problem as a convex one that can be
   solved efficiently using the interior point optimization methods.
   Simulations are used to validate the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate distributed beamforming and power allocation for a
   single-antenna two-way relay network, which consists of multiple,
   parallel amplify-and-forward relays. The goal is to maximize the smaller
   of the two signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) while maintaining the total
   transmit power in each time slot below a predefined threshold. While
   related previous studies have assumed that the two transceivers know
   perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the entire
   network, in this paper, each transceiver only knows its own channel to
   the relays and the second-order-statistics (SOS) of the channel gains
   from the other transceiver to the relays. We develop optimal and
   sub-optimal solutions. The optimal one requires eigenvalue decomposition
   and iteratively exhaustive search, while the sub-optimal one uses a
   Taylor series approximation, but gives a near-optimal solution with
   significantly low computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A time domain methodology is proposed for the harmonic state estimation
   (HSE) in power systems based on parallel Kalman filter (PKF) algorithm
   implemented on a graphical processing unit (GPU). The output variable
   measurements to be used by the HSE are taken from the simulation of the
   harmonics propagation in the power system. The time domain HSE solution
   process is based on the application of the PKF algorithm to estimate the
   waveforms for nodal voltages and line currents with various sources of
   harmonics, time-varying harmonics and inter-harmonics. The results
   obtained with the PKF to solve the HSE are validated against the
   transient program PSCAD/EMTDC. The PKF algorithm is implemented using
   the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform and the CUDA
   Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (CUBLAS) library on a NVIDIA GPU card.
   Case studies show the effectiveness of the PKF to solve the HSE on the

   monitoring of the power system state is a challenging computational
   problem. State estimation is paramount for reliable operation of
   large-scale power systems. Even with modern multi-core processors, the
   large number of computations in state estimation are still a burden on
   time and are highly memory intensive. In this paper the idea of using
   massively parallel graphic processing units (GPUs) for weighted least
   squares (WLS) based state estimation is introduced and executed. The GPU
   is especially designed for processing large data sets. A data-parallel
   implementation of the WLS method is proposed. The speed of the GPU-based
   state estimation for several test systems is compared with a sequential
   CPU-based program. The simulation results show a speed-up of 38 for a

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes and investigates the effect of a voltage-source

   interaction in a series-compensated system with multi-mass synchronous

   constructed by the circuit components and control parameters of a VSC is
   the key element for interactions with the grid. It has been shown that a
   VSC system might introduce negative damping (due to its negative
   resistance) that degrades the system damping from one side, and its
   reactive proprieties might affect (shift) the network resonance
   frequency and alter the damping prolife on the other side. An active
   damping controller is developed to reshape the output impedance of the
   interfacing VSC and minimize its associated negative impact. With little
   modification, the proposed damping technique is also able to damping the
   SSR, in a serie-scompensated system, as a new approach to damping SSR.

Abstract = {{The concept of micro-grid is gaining widespread acceptance in
   distributed power networks. Medium-voltage (MV) micro-grids will be
   subjected to high penetration level of dynamic loads (e. g. line-start
   induction motor (IM) loads). The highly-nonlinear IM dynamics that
   couple the active power, reactive power, voltage and supply frequency
   dynamics challenge the stability of MV droop-controlled micro-grids.
   However, detailed analysis, and more importantly, stabilization of MV
   micro-grids with IM loads are not reported in current literature. To
   fill-out this gap, this paper presents the stability analysis and
   stabilization of MV droop-controlled micro-grids with IM loads. The
   proposed model accounts for the impact of supply frequency dynamics
   associated with the droop-control mechanism to accurately link the
   micro-grid frequency dynamics to the motor dynamics. The complete
   small-signal model is used to assess the impact of the IM dynamics on
   the micro-grid stability as compared to the static load case. To
   stabilize the micro-grid system in the presence of IM loads, a
   two-degree-of-freedom active damping controller is proposed to stabilize
   the newly introduced oscillatory dynamics.}},

   converters (CSCs) interfacing large photovoltaic (PV) systems to the
   utility grid. 1) On the ac side, interactions of the grid impedance with
   the LC ac-side filter might cause uncertain resonant frequency modes. 2)
   On the dc-side, under uncertain characteristics of the PV source
   impedance (e. g. number of PV modules connected and/or uncertainty in
   source circuit parameters), the Nyquist stability criterion might be
   violated due to equivalent source/load impedance mismatch. In this
   paper, the ac-side LC filter dynamics are robustly damped by an improved
   active compensator in the CSC side. More importantly, the dc-side
   interactions are effectively stabilized by proposing active reshaping
   techniques for the dc impedance of the CSC so that the Nyquist stability
   criterion is maintained. Time-domain results under Matlab/Simulink
   environment are provided to validate the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety performance of a
   sample of intersections that had been improved with the implementation
   of certain safety countermeasures targeting right-turn collisions in the
   city of Edmonton, Canada. A full Bayes approach was used to determine
   the effectiveness of the improvements by employing a before-and-after
   design with matched (yoked) comparison groups. Three linear intervention
   models were considered: a multivariate model that modeled treatment
   effects as a gradual change, a similar model with the addition of a jump
   treatment effect, and a univariate model that specifically analyzed
   right-turn collisions. The results indicated that the safety improvement
   program was effective; up to 40\% of right-turn collisions were reduced.
   Despite the small sample size, these reductions were statistically
   significant. The results show the usefulness of the full Bayes technique
   in performing before-and-after evaluations of traffic treatment programs
   and in eliminating the need for a reference population and also in
   allowing for additional types of analysis, including multivariate
   analysis (modeling collisions of different types and severities at the
   same time), temporal effects (for both treatment and long-term trends),
   and greater freedom in the selection of error structure.}},

Abstract = {{Irregular repetition slotted ALOHA is a random access scheme where users
   transmit multiple copies of a packet to the receiver to provide
   time-domain diversity; then, the receiver attempts to iteratively decode
   packets and cancel their interference contribution in other time slots,
   increasing the chance of resolving collisions and decoding more packets.
   This scheme was shown to support larger system loads compared to
   conventional slotted ALOHA. In the original scheme, collision resolution
   between l colliding packets is possible only when l-1 of those packets
   are decoded in prior iterations, which is probable because of the other
   copies of each packet transmitted in other slots. However, although
   asymptotic analysis promises high efficiency of this scheme, the
   analysis relies on the large number of slots participating in the
   iterative collision resolution, which requires large receiver complexity
   and introduces delay. In this paper, we study this scheme for receivers
   capable of decoding multiple colliding packets jointly, which increases
   the chance of decoding more packets under large system loads. Asymptotic
   analysis for this generalized model is provided and it is shown by
   simulations that a multiuser detector supports larger loads for low
   number of slots jointly processed.}},

   Pavements Through Use of Falling Weight Deflectometer Data}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{30-37}},
Abstract = {{Flexible pavements in cold regions with frequent freeze and thaw cycles
   are prone to damage at the start of thawing and during the thaw-recovery
   season every year. In an attempt to limit damage to the pavement, many
   highway agencies enforce a spring road ban (SRB) on secondary roads
   during the thawing period. The Alberta Ministry of Transportation in
   Canada performs an extensive falling weight deflectometer (FWD) test
   program during the spring to enhance SRB decision making. This study
   uses FWD test data from 2000 to 2006 for multiple highway sections in
   Alberta to investigate the seasonal variation in pavement stiffness and
   its effect on pavement mechanistic responses. FWD data were used to
   backcalculate the moduli for the pavement layers, which were then used
   in multilayer elastic models to predict the pavement critical responses
   in thawing versus recovery periods. Asphalt Institute models were used
   to relate the pavement critical responses to fatigue cracking life (N-f)
   and rutting life (N-d) in thawing versus recovery periods. N-f and N-d
   dropped by as much as 80\% for fatigue cracking and 95\% for rutting in
   the thawing period compared with the recovery period. Further analysis
   showed that a 50\% reduction in the load applied during thawing can
   result in an approximately 90\% increase in both N-d and N-f. The
   Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide software was used to
   simulate SRB by reducing the maximum applied load by 50\% in the thawing
   period. The results showed a 50\% increase in pavement life in rutting
   and in top-down and bottom-up fatigue cracking.}},

Title = {{Force-Sensor-Based Estimation of Needle Tip Deflection in Brachytherapy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{A virtual sensor is developed for the online estimation of needle tip
   deflection during permanent interstitial brachytherapy needle insertion.
   Permanent interstitial brachytherapy is an effective, minimally
   invasive, and patient friendly cancer treatment procedure. The
   deflection of the needles used in the procedure, however, undermines the
   treatment efficiency and, therefore, needs to be minimized. Any feedback
   control technique to minimize the needle deflection will require
   feedback of this quantity, which is not easy to provide. The proposed
   virtual sensor for needle deflection incorporates a force/torque sensor,
   mounted at the base of the needle that always remains outside the
   patient. The measured forces/torques are used by a mathematical model,
   developed based on mechanical needle properties. The resulting
   estimation of tip deflection in real time during needle insertion is the
   main contribution of this paper. The proposed approach solely relies on
   the measured forces and torques without a need for any other
   invasive/noninvasive sensing devices. A few mechanical models have been
   introduced previously regarding the way the forces are composed along
   the needle during insertion; we will compare our model to those
   approaches in terms of accuracy. In order to conduct experiments to
   verify the deflection model, a custom-built, 2-DOF robotic system for
   needle insertion is developed and discussed. This system is a prototype
   of an intelligent, hand-held surgical assistant tool that incorporates
   the virtual sensor proposed in this paper.}},

   effectively used in memoryless two-way relay channels (TWRCs) to enhance

   their achievable data exchange rate, for a memoryless TWRC. Our results
   show that unlike memoryless one-way relaying, increasing users' SNR
   benefits AF more than DMF. Another interesting observation is that while
   with DMF a higher data rate is provided for the user whose channel
   condition is better, with AF the situation is the reverse. That is, the
   user with worse channel condition can receive at a higher data rate.
   Further, we find that for a TWRC with asymmetric users' channels, AF can
   take advantage of power back-off at the users, without degrading the
   data rate, to improve the energy efficiency while power back-off is not
   beneficial for DMF.}},

   and its estimation. The outage probability (OP) of the network with
   channel estimation error is also calculated. Then power allocations
   between the source and the relay for different training steps are
   derived based on the total MSE and the OP. The performance of the
   proposed power allocations is simulated and shown to be superior to even
   power allocation.}},

Abstract = {{An important contribution of the Semantic Web is a new format of data
   representation called Resource Description Framework (RDF). In RDF,
   every piece of information is represented as a triple:
   subject-property-object. In general, subjects and objects can be shared
   between multiple RDF triples, and all triples can constitute a densely
   interlinked network. RDF becomes a very popular format of representing
   data on the web. As of September 2012, the last available data, more
   than 31 billions of triples exist on the web.
   In the paper, we propose a system - called T2R - for automatic
   acquisition of syntactic and semantic relations among terms from a plain
   text. These relations are expressed in the form of RDF triples. The
   proposed method is independent of any prior knowledge and domain
   specific patterns, and is applicable to any textual resources. The
   system implementing the approach is capable of identifying grammatical
   structure of an input sentence and analysing its semantics to generate
   meaningful RDF triples. We evaluate this approach by proving the quality
   of our results through case studies.}},

   first extracted from a fingerprint image. In order to distinguish the
   local orientation patterns of genuine SPs from that of spurious SPs, a
   novel technique based on the Discrete Hodge Helmholtz Decomposition
   (DHHD) is proposed to reconstruct a regular orientation field of the
   fingerprint. Based on the regular orientation field, the PI technique is
   then applied to extract the SPs. Experimental results on the public

Abstract = {{In this paper, we adopt a novel efficiency measure, namely, the received
   signal to noise ratio (SNR) per unit power, in relay network design.
   First, limitations of conventional efficiency measures, spectral
   efficiency and energy efficiency, are discussed to motivate the
   SNR-per-unit-power (SNR-PUP) measure. Then for a single-relay network
   which uses amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, we find the optimal relay
   power that maximizes the SNR-PUP for a given transmitter power. The
   average relay power, the SNR-PUP, and the outage probability of the
   proposed design are investigated analytically and numerically, and are
   compared with the conventional design where the relay power is fixed. We
   also consider a general multi-relay network and use gradient-ascent
   method for the SNR-PUP maximization. Our results show that with the same
   average relay transmit power, the proposed design is superior not only
   in the SNR-PUP but also in the outage probability for both single and
   multi-relay networks.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional steel rebars are widely used in reinforced concrete
   structures. They have numerous mechanical advantages such as high
   stiffness, strength and low cost as well as their wide-spread
   availability. However, they also present some disadvantages, such as low
   chemical resistance to corrosion, and their metallic nature that create
   challenges for structures that require non-magnetic construction. In
   recent years, fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite rebars have been
   developed to address some of the aforementioned shortcomings. Amongst
   the various ways to produce these rebars, some researchers utilized a
   combination of braiding and pultrusion techniques. In this combined
   technique, a unidirectional-continuous fibers core are is encapsulated
   by one or more layers of braided fiber preforms. One of the major
   challenges in broader commercialization of FRP rebars are their
   limitation in continuous, fast and mass production resulting from long
   curing times. Depending on the type of the resin that is used, curing of
   the conventional resins may take up to hours at room temperature. This
   time can be reduced if the curing is done at elevated temperatures in
   autoclaves or ovens; however, this poses considerable problems in terms
   of additional handling, storing and overall production time for these
   rebars. Literature suggests use of electron beam and high frequency
   microwaves for fast curing in composite materials; however, these
   techniques also have shortcomings, such as high costs and potential
   problems with certain fibers (e.g. arcing of carbon fibers),
   respectively.
   This study investigates an alternate fast curing technique for braid
   reinforced FRP rebars using a combination of induction heating and
   ovens. Internal curing resulting from induction heating is accomplished
   using small diameter metallic wires embedded into the core of the rebars
   during manufacturing, which reduces internal cracking.
   In-line ovens contribute to curing from outside towards the middle of
   the core. The induction heating and ovens system is used in-parallel
   with the production line for the rebars resulting in fast production
   speeds. This paper reports on the Finite Element Analysis prediction of
   the fast curing process using a MATLAB (R) program. The program
   calculates parameters such as curing fraction, required power to run the
   induction units, and line-speed of the production process. The program
   will be used to predict the curing as well as to avoid shrinkage
   cavities during the process, and it will also enable continuous
   production of these rebars for commercial applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an improved time series approach for anomaly detection,
   localization and quantification using output-only data is presented. It
   was shown in previous studies conducted by the authors that this
   methodology was able to detect, locate and quantify the changes in the
   mass, damping and stiffness parameters in a numerical model for
   noise-free conditions accurately. In this paper, the approach is
   extended for damage identification when artificial noise is added to the
   data. This approach is mainly based on the idea that the changes in the
   structural properties of an infrastructure can be related to the change
   in free vibration response (displacement, velocity and acceleration) of
   the structure. In this approach, the sensors of a structure are first
   categorized into different clusters according to their locations. Then,
   ARX models (Auto-Regressive models with eXogenous input), where only
   output data under free vibration are used, are created for different
   sensor clusters. Building these ARX models for baseline and damaged
   structures, the location and degree of the anomaly can be identified on
   the basis of the changes in the coefficients in the models. In order to
   verify the approach, it is applied to a numerical structural model
   representing a laboratory specimen. The results show that the change of
   mass, stiffness and damping for noisy conditions can be identified
   separately by using this approach even if these changes occur
   simultaneously.}},

   previous tests carried out to help estimate the undrained shear strength
   of the ground and the implications of distinct joint sets within the

Abstract = {{The high content of inorganic species in water used to extract bitumen
   from the Alberta oil sands and in the groundwater below the oil sands is
   an increasing environmental concern. These water matrices require
   treatment before they can be reused or safely discharged. Desalination
   of the oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) and groundwater, or basal
   depressurization water (BDW), can be accomplished with deionization
   techniques such as electrodialysis (ED). In order to achieve the
   effective ED treatment, OSPW and BDW were pretreated with
   coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation to remove solid species and
   turbidity. We demonstrated that a conductivity range for industrial
   reuse of OSPW and BDW can be achieved with the ED treatment and showed
   the possibility of applying ED in the oil sands industry. A continuous
   ED system that reuses the diluate stream as a source for the concentrate
   stream was designed. The cost of a hypothetical ED water treatment plant
   in Fort McMurray, Alberta, was estimated to be C\$10.71 per cubic meter
   of treated water.}},

Abstract = {{Since a linear motor with high thrust density and low thrust ripple is
   desired for many industrial applications, in this paper, a design
   methodology is proposed to achieve these objectives. A slotted permanent
   magnet linear synchronous motor (SPMLSM) which inherently offers the
   highest force density among various types of linear motors is selected
   for analysis and optimization procedure. An analytical model is derived
   for the SPMLSM by solving Maxwell's equations for calculating the
   magnetic field and force. Motor dimensions are then optimized using the
   analytical model and genetic algorithm, where the increase of force
   density and the reduction of thrust ripple are considered as the
   optimization target. In this study, to reach a higher optimal point in
   the multidimensional search space of the machine design, cogging force
   caused by slot effect is initially neglected in the model. Subsequently,
   pole-shifting is applied to the optimal model to eliminate cogging force
   and satisfy design objectives. Finally, the effectiveness of the
   proposed technique to enhance motor performance is investigated by a
   time-stepping transient finite-element method. The results show an
   improvement in the performance of optimized motor.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a robust moving horizon estimation scheme augmented by an
   auxiliary nonlinear observer is proposed for nonlinear systems with
   bounded model uncertainties. Specifically, an auxiliary deterministic
   nonlinear observer that asymptotically tracks nominal system state is
   taken advantage of to calculate a confidence region that contains the
   actual system state taking into account the effects of bounded model
   uncertainties at every sampling time. This region is then used to design
   a constraint on the state estimates in the proposed moving horizon
   estimation. The proposed design brings together deterministic and
   optimization-based observer design techniques. First, the proposed
   moving horizon estimation scheme is proved to give bounded estimation
   errors in the case of bounded model uncertainties. Second, the proposed
   approach provides another option to compromise the effects of errors in
   arrival cost approximations and can be used together with different
   arrival cost approximation techniques to further improve the state
   estimate.}},

Abstract = {{Small helicopter control is a topic of wide interest. The generally
   accepted model includes the effect of so-called Small Body Forces (SBF)
   which couple the rotational inputs to the translational dynamics. The
   SBF include the tail rotor thrust and the lateral forces due to the main
   rotor flapping which are used to force the rotational dynamics. Since
   the SBF render the model non-minimum phase, it has become customary in
   the literature to neglect their effect in order to design a model-based
   control with rigorously defined performance guarantees. We present a
   control design which directly compensates the influence of the tail
   rotor component of the SBF on the translational dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore modelling and regulation techniques for
   temperature and crystal growth control in an industrially important
   process of Czochralski crystal growth. First, a geometrical model for
   both crystal growth and radius evolution dynamics is developed and a
   controller is designed based on an input-output linearization to
   regulate and track a desired reference crystal radius. The pulling based
   regulated crystal radius control provides a time-varying shape
   (geometry) evolution of the underlying time-varying partial differential
   equation describing the crystal temperature dynamics. A low dimensional
   time-varying parabolic PDE model obtained by Galerkin method is used for
   regulation of the triple point temperature (melt-solid-encapsulant
   intersection). The coupling among finite-dimensional crystal radius and
   triple point temperature regulation is given by the perturbation in the
   crystal growth parameters and it is induced by possible solid-melt
   interface temperature fluctuations. We provide a unified regulation
   framework for such a complex coupled system of crystal growth and
   temperature regulation in order to improve operational and economic
   features associated with the Czochralski crystal growth process.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a state estimator is dependent on the accuracy of the
   process model used. Since processes undergo various changes as time
   progresses, it is essential to adapt the model parameters to reflect the
   change in process conditions and maintain the accuracy of the model
   predictions. In several cases, it may be necessary to account for the
   physical bounds on the states and parameters while computing their
   estimates. In this work, a constrained dual ensemble Kalman filter
   (C-EnKF) for state and parameter estimation is proposed to construct the
   state and parameter estimates that are consistent with their physical
   limits. The efficacy of the proposed dual C-EnKF is demonstrated on two
   simulation case studies. The results obtained demonstrate that the
   proposed approach tracks parameter changes with reasonable accuracy,
   while maintaining the state and parameter estimates within their
   physical limits.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this work is to design a coordinated distributed
   model predictive control (CDMPC) architecture for nonlinear systems
   using the price-driven coordination method. One fundamental assumption
   of this work is that a centralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme
   can be designed based on successive linearization of the nonlinear
   system that is able to asymptotically stabilize the closed-loop system
   at the origin and the coordination schemes strives to get to the very
   same performance via adding a coordinator level to the existing
   decentralized structure. In other words, the coordinator and the
   distributed MPCs exchange information and calculate the optimal future
   input trajectories iteratively. In order to deploy the price-driven
   coordination algorithm developed by Marcos {[}1], which is applicable to
   linear or linearized systems, the alkylation process of benzene used as
   a case study was successively linearized around the operating points.
   The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can be
   successfully applied to nonlinear systems using a successive
   linearization strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Data-driven process monitoring has been extensively discussed in both
   academia and industry because of its applicability and effectiveness.
   One of the most applied techniques is the principal component analysis
   (PCA). Recently a new technique called principal component pursuit (PCP)
   is introduced. Compared to PCA, PCP is more robust to outliers. In this
   paper, the application of the PCP technique to process monitoring is
   thoroughly discussed from training data preprocessing to residual signal
   post-filtering. A new scaling preprocessing step is proposed to improve
   quality of data matrices in the sense of low coherence. A residual
   generator and a post-filter suitable for PCP generated process models
   are also provided. The post-filtered residual represents the fault
   signal, which makes the fault detection, isolation and reconstruction
   procedures simple and straightforward. A numerical example is provided
   to describe and illustrate the PCP-based process modeling and monitoring
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a promising concept
   for combustion engines to reduce both emissions and fuel consumption. In
   HCCI engines, a homogeneous air-fuel mixture auto-ignites due to
   compression, which is unlike traditional spark ignition or diesel
   engines where ignition is started with either a spark or fuel injection.
   HCCI combustion control is a challenging issue because there is no
   direct initiator of combustion in these engines. Variable Valve Timing
   (VVT) is one effective way to control the combustion timing in HCCI
   engines. VVT changes the amount of trapped residual gas and the
   effective compression ratio both of which have a strong effect on
   combustion timing. In order to control HCCI combustion, a physics based
   control oriented model is developed that includes the effect of trapped
   residual gas on combustion timing. The control oriented model is
   obtained by model order reduction of complex chemical kinetic reaction
   mechanisms. This method allows different fuels to be incorporated using
   a standard methodology and fills the gap between complex models with
   highly detailed chemical kinetics and simple black box models that have
   been used in model based control. The control oriented model is used to
   develop ignition timing PI control using simulation. The PI control
   modulates the trapped residual gas using variable valve timing as the
   actuator. The results indicate that the controller can track step
   changes in HCCI combustion timing.}},

Abstract = {{A Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) testbed design for small unmanned
   helicopters is described. The testbed provides a safe and low-cost
   platform to implement control algorithms and tune the control gains in a
   controlled environment. Specifically, it allows for testing the
   robustness of the controller to external disturbances by emulating the
   hover condition. A 6-DOF nonlinear mathematical model of the helicopter
   has been validated in real flight tests. This model is implemented in
   real-time to estimates the states of the helicopter which are then used
   to determine the actual control signals on the testbed. A damping system
   with a negligible parasitic effect on the dynamics of the helicopter
   around hover is incorporated into the testbed design to minimize the
   structural stress on the fuselage in the case of controller failure or a
   subsystem malfunction. Three experiments including the longitudinal,
   lateral and heading control tests are performed. Experimental results
   show that the HIL testbed allows for designing a controller which is
   robust to the external disturbances, and achieves an accuracy of +/- 2cm
   in the position control along the longitudinal and lateral axes in
   hover, and that of +/- 1deg around the yaw axis on the heading
   trajectory tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Approaches to helicopter UAV control often use the main and tail rotor
   thrusts, and the main rotor flapping angles as inputs. However,
   servomotors control the helicopter's four physical inputs which are the
   main rotor cyclic and collective pitch, and the tail rotor collective
   pitch. Helicopter models which treat the physical input are generally
   intractable for model-based control. We propose and identify a physical
   input model which is algebraically simple and therefore suitable for use
   in control design. The proposed model includes the vehicle's velocity to
   improve its accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed Generators (DGs) provide a number of advantages for
   utilities. So, they become very common these days. However, DGs can also
   negatively impact some aspects of distribution system such as
   Overcurrent (O.C.) protection. DGs are known to contribute fault
   currents to their interconnected power system. As a result, there is a
   concern that the DGs may affect the coordination of O.C. protection in a
   distribution system. This may cause miscoordination among O.C. devices,
   nuisance tripping and relay's reach reduction (desensitization). This
   paper presents the findings on the contributions of a certain type of
   DGs, Induction-Machine DG (IMDG), to fault currents and assessing its
   impacts on the O.C. protection coordination.}},

Abstract = {{The increased penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) into the
   energy mix of many developed nations is important for reduction of our
   dependence on fossil fuels and for mitigating the contribution of power
   generation to climate change. However, it also brings new challenges
   associated with RES intermittency and the limited predictability of
   their availability. In addition, energy from many types of RES has high
   variability that can negatively affect the quality of power in the grid
   they are connected to. To ensure that power quality remains within
   acceptable limits, operational thresholds of important power quality
   parameters are specified by many national and international regulatory
   bodies. Examples of such parameters include system voltage, frequency,
   power factor, harmonic distortion, voltage unbalance and long and
   short-term flicker. Although devices that allow control of these
   parameters exist, the magnitude and time of their response may not be
   sufficient for many common operational conditions. In this contribution,
   we propose to enhance the capability of such devices through prediction
   of quality parameters of power produced by photovoltaic power plants.}},

Abstract = {{Directional and stream data are common in many research fields. Wind
   speed and direction are the most important variables for effective wind
   energy utilization. It is also well known, that wind significantly
   influences the current-carrying capacity of overhead power transmission
   lines. This shows the importance of knowing the annual wind direction
   distribution for specific locations, e. g. where wind farms or power
   transmission lines are situated.
   In this paper, a new method of wind direction distribution determination
   is presented. The statistical model is composed of a finite mixture of
   circular von Mises distributions. Parameters of the model are estimated
   using the heuristic search method of genetic algorithms. The quality of
   computed distribution is evaluated by Pearson's chi-squared test. The
   entire proposed procedure is tested using a case study. The results show
   that the model composed of a finite mixture of von Mises distribution
   corresponds to the input data with high significance level.}},

Abstract = {{In modern large-scale systems, fast distributed resource allocation and
   utility maximization are becoming increasingly important. Traditional
   solutions to such problems rely on primal/dual decomposition and
   gradient methods, whose convergence is sensitive to the choice of the
   stepsize and may not be sufficient to satisfy the requirement of
   large-scale real-time applications. We propose a new iterative approach
   to distributed resource allocation in coupled systems. Without
   complicating message-passing, the new approach is robust to parameter
   choices and expedites convergence by exploiting problem structures. We
   theoretically analyze the asynchronous algorithm convergence conditions,
   and empirically evaluate its benefits in a case of cloud network
   resource reservation based on real-world data.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Fish entrainment occurs when individuals are displaced from reservoirs
   to downstream waters by way of water diversion through turbines or other
   water release structures. While much effort has been put into
   quantifying and reducing entrainment of downstream migrating salmonids,
   considerably less research has focused on fish that are residents in
   reservoirs and in many cases are the top piscivores in these systems. We
   used 2 yr of acoustic telemetry data on adult bull trout Salvelinus
   confluentus and burbot Lota lota tagged in Kinbasket Reservoir (British
   Columbia, Canada) to investigate entrainment vulnerability by measuring
   forebay use and entrainment rates. Our results revealed that (1) adult
   bull trout and burbot made little use of the forebay; (2) bull trout
   used the forebay more and had higher rates of entrainment than burbot;
   and (3) both forebay use and entrainment varied among seasons. Bull
   trout used the forebay more intensively and were mostly entrained in the
   fall and winter. Limited forebay use and entrainment data for burbot
   suggest that they are more vulnerable to entrainment in the fall. These
   findings should be generally applicable for adult bull trout and burbot

   help managers and industry to make informed decisions on how to mitigate
   and compensate for entrainment.}},

Abstract = {{This study used non-intrusive, optical-based measurement techniques in a
   parametric study of a flash atomized jet. The bench scale water spray
   was operated at pressure ratios ranging from 6.80 to 17.0 and degrees of
   superheat of 20-80 C. The nozzle used was an axisymmetric,
   converging-diverging design with a throat diameter of 0.8 mm. This broad
   range of parameters allowed for the evaluation of the influence of the
   operating conditions on the spray characteristics. Long exposure images
   were used in order to measure the spreading angle of the flashing jet
   which varied from 10 to 50, while phase Doppler Particle analyzer
   measurements were used in order to measure the radial profiles of the
   droplet velocities and diameters. The spray produced consistent droplet
   mean diameters of approximately 3 mu m and centerline velocities from 25
   to 35 m/s. The results indicate that the characteristics of a flashing
   spray operating at high degrees of superheat are robust with respect to
   changes in the operating pressure}},

Title = {{Mass Transfer from Metallic Contaminants during a Three-Week

Journal = {{COMPOST SCIENCE \& UTILIZATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{The trace metal content of municipal solid waste (MSW) compost
   represents a potential environmental concern. In this research, the
   effect of the composting environment on the corrosion of typical metal
   contaminant types found in the organic fraction of MSW was investigated.
   Selection of contaminants was based upon their trace metal content and
   their prevalence in MSW. For instance, galvanized nails and Zn-plated
   screws both contain the trace metal zinc on a steel base, stainless
   steel flat washers contain chromium, copper wires and brass screws have
   a high copper content, and light bulb tails contain tin and lead content
   in the foot contact. A synthetic feedstock created to have a low trace
   metal content was used. Selected contaminants were exposed to a
   three-week thermophilic composting process, under either low (4.5. to
   5.5) or high (8 to 9) pH conditions. The weight loss of each contaminant
   was determined using a corrosion weight loss method. Characterization of
   corrosion conditions and products was accomplished using a scanning
   electron microscope with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer
   attachment (SEM-EDX), an x-ray diffractometer, a gas chromatograph, and
   an ion chromatograph. The metal composition of each contaminant was
   determined through SEM-EDX analysis. All contaminants showed higher
   weight losses in the low pH environment, which suggests that the
   corrosion rate was accelerated under acidic composting conditions. A
   high mass transfer rate of zinc from the galvanized nails and Zn-plated
   screws was observed, which suggests that these might be important
   contributors to the zinc content in MSW composts. Copper wires and brass
   screws exhibited moderate mass transfer rates of copper and zinc. Low
   amounts of trace metals were transferred from the stainless steel flat
   washers and light bulb tail contacts.}},

Abstract = {{A novel family of metal oxides of chemical formula Ba2Ca(1-x
   -y)M(x+z)Nb(1-z+ y)O6-delta (M = Mn, Fe and Co) was developed as mixed
   ion and electronic conductors (MIECs) for application in solid oxide
   fuel cells (SOFCs). Investigated samples were synthesized by a ceramic
   method at 1400 degrees C in air and characterized using powder X-ray
   diffraction (PXRD), selected area electron diffraction (SAED),
   thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), dilatometry, chemical
   titration and electrochemical ac impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The
   Rietveld analysis of PXRD and SAED support the formation of ordered
   double perovskite-type structure with space group Fm3m and chemical
   stability in 5000 ppm H2S/H-2 at 600 degrees C. Iodometric titration
   shows the valences of Mn and Co were 2+ and 3+, while Fe shows 3+ and 4+
   states. SEM reveals that the porosity of the samples is highly affected
   by dopants. The thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the asprepared
   samples are very comparable to the oxide conducting Y-doped
   ZrO2-Ba2Ca0.79Co0.5Nb0.71O6-delta exhibits the total conductivity of 3.7
   x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 816 inverted perpendicular C in air. The trend in
   the conductivity of Ba2Ca(1-x -y)M(x+z)Nb(1-z+y)O6-delta could be
   correlated to the reduction of the dopants and the subsequent loss of
   oxide ions at elevated temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the operation and control of a cage induction
   machine generator developed to enable control of the reactive power
   delivered to the utility grid. The topology consists of an open winding
   induction machine connected to a 3-phase voltage source converter bridge
   using a floating dc-link capacitor. Reactive VAR control is achieved by
   injecting a voltage in series with the machine windings (series voltage
   injection). This technique contrasts with many existing schemes that
   inject current into the grid (parallel current injection); e.g. STACOMS,
   capacitors or synchronous machines. Two essential control elements are
   described: the regulation of the floating bridge capacitor voltage; the
   nature of the voltage injection required to control the grid reactive
   power flow as the induction machine generator power fluctuates.
   Operation of the proposed system is demonstrated by dynamic simulation.
   The system is shown to be controllable and stable during changes to the
   mechanical torque.}},

Title = {{Complexity Reduction in the Use of Evolutionary Algorithms to Function
   Optimization: A Variable Reduction Strategy}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Discovering and utilizing problem domain knowledge is a promising
   direction towards improving the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms
   (EAs) when solving optimization problems. We propose a knowledge-based
   variable reduction strategy (VRS) that can be integrated into EAs to
   solve unconstrained and first-order derivative optimization functions
   more efficiently. VRS originates from the knowledge that, in an
   unconstrained and first-order derivative optimization function, the
   optimal solution locates in a local extreme point at which the partial
   derivative over each variable equals zero. Through this collective of
   partial derivative equations, some quantitative relations among
   different variables can be obtained. These variable relations have to be
   satisfied in the optimal solution. With the use of such relations, VRS
   could reduce the number of variables and shrink the solution space when
   using EAs to deal with the optimization function, thus improving the
   optimizing speed and quality. When we apply VRS to optimization
   problems, we just need to modify the calculation approach of the
   objective function. Therefore, practically, it can be integrated with
   any EA. In this study, VRS is combined with particle swarm optimization
   variants and tested on several benchmark optimization functions and a
   real-world optimization problem. Computational results and comparative
   study demonstrate the effectiveness of VRS.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent advances in active transportation and demand management,
   variable speed limits (VSLs) have been identified as an active traffic
   management strategy for improving freeway mobility and safety. Several
   heuristic VSL strategies have been proposed and evaluated. This paper
   proposes a model predictive VSL control strategy and evaluates its
   safety and mobility impacts. The strategy uses second-order traffic flow
   models to predict the traffic state and to provide a speed for
   optimizing corridor operational performance. A sensitivity analysis of
   the VSL update frequency and the safety constraints for the VSL strategy
   was performed to determine the best scenario in terms of safety and
   mobility. A stretch of Whitemud Drive, an urban freeway corridor in
   Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was selected as the study area. The proposed
   VSL strategy was implemented in the microsimulation platform with a
   special software module. A real-time collision prediction model was
   developed for the same study area by using a matched case-control
   logistic regression technique to estimate the collision probability for
   each scenario. The results indicated that the proposed VSL control
   strategy can improve safety by approximately 50\% and mobility by
   approximately 30\%. A VSL update frequency of 5 min and a maximum speed
   difference of 10 km/h between successive time steps yielded the best
   performances. This finding can be useful for field implementation of VSL
   control.}},

Abstract = {{tIn this paper, a novel control scheme is proposed to guarantee global
   asymptotic stability of bilateral teleoperation systems that are subject
   to time-varying time delays in their communication channel and

   concerning control of nonlinear bilateral teleoperation systems under
   time-varying time delays to the case where the local and the remote
   robots' control signals pass through saturation or similar
   nonlinearities that belong to a class of systems we name sandwich linear
   systems. We call the proposed method nonlinear proportional plus damping
   (nP+D). The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is
   established using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional under conditions on
   the controller parameters, the actuator saturation characteristics, and
   the maximum values of the time-varying time delays. The controller is
   experimentally validated on a pair of 3-DOF PHANToM Premium 1.5A robots,
   which have limited actuation capacity, that form a teleoperation system
   with a varying-delay communication channel.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a criterion for absolute stability of a general
   class of three-port networks. Trilateral haptic systems, which have
   recently found many interesting applications, can be modeled as
   three-port networks. Traditionally, existing criteria (Llewellyn's
   criterion) have facilitated the stability analysis of bilateral haptic
   systems modeled as two-port networks. If the same criteria were to be
   used for stability analysis of a three-port network, its third port
   would need to be assumed known for it to reduce to a two-port network.
   However, this is restrictive because, according to the definition of
   absolute stability, all three terminations of the three-port network
   must be allowed to be arbitrary (while passive).
   In this paper, extending Llewellyn's criterion, we present closedform
   necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute stability of a general
   class of three-port networks -the three terminations need to be passive
   but are otherwise arbitrary. To this end, we first find a symmetrization
   condition under which a general asymmetric impedance (or admittance)
   matrix Z(3 x 3) has an equivalent symmetric counterpart Z(eq); this
   Z(eq) models a reciprocal three-port network with the same stability
   characterization as the general nonreciprocal three-port network modeled
   by Z. Then, based on the equivalence of passivity and absolute stability
   for the equivalent reciprocal network, an absolute stability condition
   for the original nonreciprocal network is derived. To show how the
   resulting absolute stability criterion can be utilized at the system
   design stage, we have applied it to the problem of designing controllers
   for triple-user collaborative haptic virtual environment systems. The
   validity of the resulting absolute stability conditions have been
   verified via simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Trilateral haptic systems can be modeled as three-port networks.
   Analysis of coupled stability of a three-port network can be
   accomplished in either the passivity or the absolute stability
   frameworks assuming all three ports are connected to passive but
   otherwise unknown terminations. This paper first reviews our recent
   results in terms of passivity and absolute stability criteria for
   general three-port networks-both criteria are founded on the properties
   of a positive-real Hermitian matrix. Next, we show that the absolute
   stability criterion is less conservative than the passivity criterion
   and that the two criteria become the same when the trilateral system is
   represented by a reciprocal immitance matrix. Then, to show how the two
   criteria may be utilized at the system design stage, we apply them to
   the problem of designing controllers for a dual-user haptic
   teleoperation system. Using the two criteria, controllers are then
   designed and compared in terms of conservatism and performance in
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional approaches for stability analysis of bilateral
   teleoperation systems assume that the human operator does not inject
   energy into the system and behaves in a passive manner. Does this
   assumption hold for various tasks the human operator may execute in a
   teleoperation context? To answer this question, in this paper we measure
   the endpoint impedance (inertia, viscosity, and stiffness) of the human
   arm during two tasks: (1) relaxed grasping of a haptic device while the
   device imposes position perturbations, and (2) rigid grasping of a
   haptic device (posture maintenance) while the device imposes force
   perturbations. The human arm impedance is identified as a 2 x 2 transfer
   function matrix and assessed for passivity over the frequency range
   characteristic of human motion. Our results agree with previous findings
   that the relaxed human arm behaves as a passive system. However, whether
   the rigid arm behaves as an active or passive system is found to depend
   on the magnitude of the force perturbations. We discuss why the
   passivity of the human operator is task dependent.}},

Abstract = {{A bilateral teleoperation system includes a human operator and an
   environment, which make the system stability analysis complicated due to
   their unknown, time-varying and nonlinear nature. Unable to have exact
   models for the human operator and the environment, it is typically
   assumed that they are passive but otherwise arbitrary. In this paper,
   through a set of experiments, first we show that a human operator's
   relaxed arm is strictly passive while voluntary motions of the human
   operator's arm involve non-passive characteristics. Then, we adjust the
   passivity assumption of the human operator's arm ( by tightening it for
   an input-strictly-passive arm and relaxing it for a non-passive arm) in
   order to enable a more precise stability analysis of the teleoperation
   system. Inspired by Llewellyn's absolute stability criterion, a powerful
   stability analysis approach is developed to investigate the stability of
   a two-port network when it is coupled to an input-strictly-passive or a
   non-passive termination. Although this new stability criterion is
   applicable to any two-port network system, we apply it to a
   position-error-based bilateral teleoperation system as a case study.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy sets (membership functions) are numeric constructs. In spite of
   the underlying semantics of fuzzy sets (which is inherently linked with
   the higher level of abstraction), the membership grades and processing
   of fuzzy sets themselves emphasize the numeric facets of all pursuits
   stressing the numeric nature of membership grades and in this way
   reducing the interpretability and transparency of results. In this
   study, we advocate an idea of a granular description of membership
   functions where instead of numeric membership grades, introduced are
   more interpretable granular descriptors (say, low, high membership,
   etc.). Granular descriptors are formalized with the aid of various
   formal schemes available in Granular Computing, especially sets
   (intervals), fuzzy sets, and shadowed sets. We formulate a problem of a
   design of granular descriptors as a certain optimization task, elaborate
   on the solutions and highlight some areas of applications.}},

Abstract = {{While the production, transport and refining of oils from the oilsands
   of Alberta, and comparable resources elsewhere is performed at
   industrial scales, numerous technical and technological challenges and
   opportunities persist due to the ill defined nature of the resource. For
   example, bitumen and heavy oil comprise multiple bulk phases,
   self-organizing constituents at the microscale (liquid crystals) and the
   nano scale. There are no quantitative measures available at the
   molecular level. Non-intrusive telemetry is providing promising paths
   toward solutions, be they enabling technologies targeting process
   design, development or optimization, or more prosaic process control or
   process monitoring applications. Operation examples include automated
   large object and poor quality ore during mining, and monitoring the
   thickness and location of oil water interfacial zones within separation
   vessels. These applications involve real-time video image processing.
   X-ray transmission video imaging is used to enumerate organic phases
   present within a vessel, and to detect individual phase volumes,
   densities and elemental compositions. This is an enabling technology
   that provides phase equilibrium and phase composition data for
   production and refining process development, and fluid property myth
   debunking. A high-resolution two-dimensional acoustic mapping technique
   now at the proof of concept stage is expected to provide simultaneous
   fluid flow and fluid composition data within porous inorganic media.
   Again this is an enabling technology targeting visualization of diverse
   oil production process fundamentals at the pore scale. Far infrared
   spectroscopy coupled with detailed quantum mechanical calculations, may
   provide characteristic molecular motifs and intermolecular association
   data required for fluid characterization and process modeling. X-ray
   scattering (SAXS/WAXS/USAXS) provides characteristic supramolecular
   structure information that impacts fluid rheology and process fouling.
   The intent of this contribution is to present some of the challenges and
   to provide an introduction grounded in current work on non-intrusive
   telemetry applications - from a mine or reservoir to a refinery!}},

Abstract = {{A dual pwm inverter drive operating an open-winding induction motor can
   be an attractive motor-drive system when operated from a dc battery
   source. Operating one of the inverters using a floating dc-link
   capacitor provides two main functions: reactive voltage support for the
   main bridge connected to the dc battery voltage source; voltage boosting
   to increase the motor terminal voltage. The latter feature eliminates
   the requirement to use a separate dc-dc converter to provide a voltage
   boost. The resultant drive system can provide several benefits such as:
   lowering the average battery current by operating the main bridge at
   unity power factor; improving the motor torque and efficiency over a
   wide operating speed range; compensation for battery voltage
   fluctuations; lowering the motor harmonic losses; elimination of
   common-mode circulating currents. This paper describes a pwm control
   scheme for the two inverters to regulate the floating bridge capacitor
   voltage over the entire dynamic speed range of the motor, whilst also
   providing the desired motor demand voltage. Experimental results are
   used to verify both the operation of the motor-drive system and the
   regulation of the floating capacitor voltage. Experimental results using
   an induction motor load confirm the practical feasibility of the
   motor-drive system.}},

Abstract = {{The common-mode voltage (CMV) produced from a converter system is a
   source of many problems. E. g. in the motor drive system, CMV might
   appear at the neutral point of the motor stator windings with respect to
   the ground and induce destructive bearing current. Reduced common-mode
   voltage space vector modulation (RCMV SVM) methods have been proposed in
   both voltage source converter (VSC) and current source converter (CSC)
   systems. The available RCMV SVMs reduce the CMV by avoiding the use of
   zero-state vectors. However, this will lead to some negative effects,
   such as shrink of modulation index range, increase of switching
   frequencies, and power quality performance deterioration, etc. In this
   paper, a RCMV SVM method for CSCs is proposed. It has almost the same
   harmonic performance compared to the conventional SVMs by allowing the
   use of zero-state vectors, but with much lower CMV. The effectiveness of
   the proposed RCMV SVM for CSCs is verified in an experimental prototype.}},

Abstract = {{To address the load sharing problem in islanding microgrids, this paper
   proposes an improved approach which regulates the distributed generation
   (DG) unit interfacing virtual impedance at fundamental and selected
   harmonic frequencies. In contrast to the conventional virtual impedance
   control where only a line current feed-forward term is added to the DG
   voltage reference, the proposed virtual impedances at fundamental and
   harmonic frequencies are realized using DG line current and point of
   common coupling (PCC) voltage feed-forward terms, respectively. With
   this modification, the mismatched DG feeder impedances can be properly
   compensated, resulting in accurate reactive and harmonic power sharing
   at the same time. In addition, this paper shows that the microgrid PCC
   harmonic voltages can be mitigated by reducing the magnitude of DG unit
   equivalent harmonic impedance. Finally, an improved proportional plus
   resonant voltage controller is developed to ensure accurate power
   sharing and PCC harmonic voltage compensation without using any
   fundamental/harmonic component detections.}},

Abstract = {{In order to utilize DG unit interfacing converters to actively
   compensate distribution system harmonics, this paper proposes an
   enhanced current control approach. It seamlessly integrates system
   harmonic mitigation capabilities with the primary DG power generation
   function. As the proposed current controller has two well decoupled
   control branches to independently control fundamental and harmonic DG
   currents, phase-locked loops (PLL) and system harmonic component
   extractions can be avoided during system harmonic compensation.
   Moreover, a closed-loop power control scheme is also employed to derive
   the fundamental current reference. The proposed power control scheme
   effectively eliminates the impacts of steady-state fundamental current
   tracking errors in the DG units. Thus, an accurate power control is
   realized even when the harmonic compensation functions are activated.
   Experimental results from a single-phase DG unit validate the
   correctness of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report a novel electrochemical
   sensor designed to detect the corrosion of metal cans used for beverage
   packaging.
   Design/methodology/approach - Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS) and electrochemical noise (EN) were performed to detect the
   corrosion degree of beverage cans that had been stored for 1 month
   (named s1), 3 months (named s2), 27 months (named s3) and 43 months
   (named s4).
   Findings - The EIS results showed that the EIS plot of s1 samples had
   not developed to a characteristic of two time-constants, indicating that
   the coating showed good protective performance. The EIS plots of s2, s3
   and s4 showed characteristics of two time-constants, indicating that the
   organic coatings of s2, s3, and s4 had lost their protective
   performance. EN results showed that quantities and amplitudes of
   transient peaks increased with the increasing storage time, indicating
   that an increasing degree of local corrosion occurred within the cans. A
   corrosion process for beverage cans is discussed and can be considered
   in three stages.
   Originality/value - The designed electrochemical sensor was successfully
   applied to detect the performance of beverage cans and, further,
   provided scientific proof to evaluate the shelf life of metal cans for
   packaging.}},

Abstract = {{To become a competitor to replace CMOS-electronics for next-generation
   data processing, signal routing, and computing, nanoplasmonic circuits
   will require an analogue to electrical vias in order to enable vertical
   connections between device layers. Vertically stacked nanoplasmonic
   nanoring resonators formed of Ag/Si/Ag gap plasmon waveguides were
   studied as a novel 3-D coupling scheme that could be monolithically
   integrated on a silicon platform. The vertically coupled ring resonators
   were evanescently coupled to 100 nm x 100 nm Ag/Si/Ag input and output
   waveguides and the whole device was submerged in silicon dioxide. 3-D
   finite difference time domain simulations were used to examine the
   transmission spectra of the coupling device with varying device sizes
   and orientations. By having the signal coupling occur over multiple
   trips around the resonator, coupling efficiencies as high as 39\% at
   telecommunication wavelengths between adjacent layers were present with
   planar device areas of only 1.00 mu m(2). As the vertical signal
   transfer was based on coupled ring resonators, the signal transfer was
   inherently wavelength dependent. Changing the device size by varying the
   radii of the nanorings allowed for tailoring the coupled frequency
   spectra. The plasmonic resonator based coupling scheme was found to have
   quality (Q) factors of upwards of 30 at telecommunication wavelengths.
   By allowing different device layers to operate on different wavelengths,
   this coupling scheme could to lead to parallel processing in stacked
   independent device layers.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that nanometer-scale TiN coatings deposited by atomic
   layer deposition (ALD), and to a lesser extent by magnetron sputtering,
   will significantly improve the electrochemical cycling performance of
   silicon nanowire lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes. A 5 nm thick ALD
   coating resulted in optimum cycling capacity retention (55\% vs. 30\%
   for the bare nanowire baseline, after 100 cycles) and coulombic
   efficiency (98\% vs. 95\%, at 50 cycles), also more than doubling the
   high rate capacity retention (e. g. 740 mA h g(-1) vs. 330 mA h g(-1),
   at 5 C). We employed a variety of advanced analytical techniques such as
   electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), focused ion beam analysis
   (FIB) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate the origin
   of these effects. The conformal 5 nm TiN remains sufficiently intact to
   limit the growth of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which in
   turn both improves the overall coulombic efficiency and reduces the
   life-ending delamination of the nanowire assemblies from the underlying
   current collector. Our findings should provide a broadly applicable
   coating design methodology that will improve the performance of any
   nanostructured LIB anodes where SEI growth is detrimental.}},

Abstract = {{Particle filters have become an increasingly useful tool for recursive
   Bayesian state estimation, especially for non-linear and non-Gaussian
   problems. Despite the large number of papers published on particle
   filters in recent years, one issue that has not been addressed to any
   significant degree is the robustness. This paper presents a
   deterministic approach that has emerged in the area of robust filtering,
   and incorporates it into particle filtering framework. In particular, an
   ellipsoidal set membership approach is used to define a feasible set for
   particle sampling that contains the true state of the system, and makes
   the particle filter robust against unknown but bounded uncertainties.
   Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is more robust than
   the regular particle filter and its variants such as the extended Kalman

Abstract = {{Accuracy of process measurements is critical in process operation and

   instruments may introduce bias or gross error resulting in abnormal
   process operation and poor control performance. Timely identification of
   these biased instruments and rectifying them have a great impact on
   process control performance. In this paper, two new probabilistic
   methods based on Expectation Maximization are proposed for detecting
   biased instruments as well as detecting the abnormal time point.
   Performances of the proposed EM based algorithms are compared with
   Bayesian algorithm. Simulation results show the power and efficiency of
   EM in gross error detection especially when the priors are chosen

Abstract = {{Measurement of initial imperfections of energy pipes and incorporating
   them in analytical models has been a major focus of research in the
   pipeline industry as well as at the University of Alberta. Researchers
   at the University of Alberta have devised various techniques to measure
   initial imperfection of pipes prior to testing. The analytical
   imperfection models developed based on these techniques have proven to
   be effective in predicting pipe behavior. These techniques, however, are
   time consuming, error prone to some extent, and yield limited data, in
   addition to their limitations regarding the size of the pipes that can
   be measured. The objective of the current study is to overcome the
   limitations of the previous measurement techniques by utilizing advanced
   surface profiling technology. A high accuracy 3D laser scanner is used
   to create three dimensional models of energy pipes. Commercially
   available reverse engineering and inspection software is used to measure
   the different geometric attributes of the pipes that are of interest.
   This new technique enables us to overcome the previous limitations by
   acquiring data in the field at a faster rate and creating high
   resolution point clouds. The actual pipe surfaces are compared with the
   model of a perfect cylinder of uniform nominal diameter. It is possible
   to locate the axes of the scanned pipes and use these axes as references
   for measurements. Outer diameter variation, thickness variations, weld
   geometry variations and deviations from a perfect cylinder are measured.
   Results indicate that the deviations from a perfect cylinder can be used
   to describe the pattern of radii variations around the perimeter of the
   pipes. When described with respect to the seam weld location, distinct
   patterns of radii variations were identified. Thickness variations
   showed identical behavior in all the pipes when viewed with respect to
   the seam weld location.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrostatic testing is a key method for managing SCC in oil and gas
   pipelines. Benefits are achieved by eliminating defects above a critical
   size for the hydrotest pressure and hence achieving a post-test period
   without operating failure. Other benefits are related to temporary
   growth retardation after hydrotest because of crack tip blunting.
   Conversely, benefits of such a test could be offset by stable flaw
   growth in the previously dormant population and growth of cracks during
   hydrostatic loading. Although this type of growth behaviour has been
   previously analyzed, it was only assessed from tests in air, which
   neglects the effects of corrosive environments.
   Recent research has shown that crack growth can occur during hydrotests
   at much smaller crack dimensions than those originally analyzed. The
   adverse effect of hydrotesting is negligible if it initiates crack
   growth only on large-size cracks that are near the final stage of
   pipeline life. However, benefits of hydrotest would become uncertain if
   hydrostatic loading induces crack growth when crack dimensions are
   relatively small. This reduction in pipeline remaining lifetime by
   hydrostatic testing can be significant considering the fact that several
   hydrotests may be performed in the lifetime of a pipeline. Although
   hydrotests would usually re-condition the crack tip so that a lower
   crack growth rate can be expected for a limited time, it is questionable
   whether the reduced growth rate would compensate for the loss of life
   because of the crack growth during hydrotesting. Therefore, the overall
   benefits of hydrotesting must be evaluated from the viewpoint of life
   extension and pipeline safety.
   Effects of hydrostatic tests in this investigation were analyzed based
   on two competing morphological conditions at the crack tip before,
   during and after hydrostatic testing, that is, crack tip blunting and
   crack tip sharpening. Crack tip sharpening is related to the hydrogen
   effects and mechanisms of cyclic loading, while the crack tip blunting
   is attributed to low temperature creep of the pipeline steels. From the
   investigation, strategies aimed at achieving maximum crack remediation
   are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Coating disbondment on pipelines is a common phenomenon that leads to
   exposure of the pipeline metal to ground water solutions, promoting a
   corrosive environment which is associated with stress corrosion cracking
   (SCC). This investigation tracks the corrosion behavior of X-65 steel at
   different coating disbondments at Open Circuit Potential (OCP)
   conditions through weight loss tests, as well as SEM analysis. For the
   weight loss test, X-65 coupons were placed into a vertical coupon holder
   with varying gap sizes between the coupons and the shielding (2 mm 5 mm,
   and 10 mm) simulating the coating disbondment. The results of the tests
   suggest that the corrosion rate inside the gap is dependent on the mass
   transfer rate of CO2. For larger gaps, the corrosion rate inside the gap
   decreases almost linearly with position (highest at the top of the
   disbondment) and is dependent on the iron carbonate film deposition. For
   smaller gaps (<= 5 mm) a galvanic effect was observed between the
   coupons at the top of the disbondment (anodic) which showed a high
   degree of general corrosion, and the coupons at the bottom of the
   disbondment (cathodic) which had very low corrosion rates. The
   experimental observations were related to the corrosion scenarios found
   in the field. Cathodic protection strategies with respect to the
   geometry of disbondment are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article compares the effects of Co doping on phase structures and

   electrochemical measurements in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) employing
   H2S-containing H-2 as fuel. The Co-doped LST (LSCT) with a perovskite
   structure was synthesized via a solid state approach, achieving
   excellent phase purity and refined particle size. The catalytic activity
   and electrochemical performance are significantly improved by
   introducing Co. A maximum power density of 300 mW cm(-2) was achieved at
   900 degrees C with 5000 ppm H2S-H-2 in a fuel cell having a 300 mu m
   thick YSZ electrolyte. Trace amounts of metallic Co nanoparticles with
   sizes typically no larger than 10 nm in diameter were detected on the
   LSCT surface after reduction in H-2 at 900 degrees C. The nano-sized Co
   clusters could reduce the anode polarization resistance, as well as
   improve the cell performance, compared with undoped LST anodes. The LSCT
   anode catalyst was electrochemically stable in 5000 ppm H2S-H-2 during
   the test time at high operating temperature. The LSCT anode catalyst

Title = {{Drop deposition on under-liquid low energy surfaces}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{31}},
Pages = {{7437-7447}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new technique for non-intrusive drop
   deposition on under-liquid low energy surfaces. This technique addresses
   the limitations of the conventional drop deposition method, in which a
   needle holding the drop is brought in close proximity to the solid
   substrate, and the drop gets deposited on the solid by detaching from
   the needle spontaneously owing to the favorable drop-substrate surface
   energy. Therefore, for low energy surfaces, irrespective of whether such
   surfaces are in air or under liquid, the fact that the drop-substrate
   surface energy is much smaller than the drop-needle surface energy,
   there are extreme difficulties in depositing the drop by getting it
   removed from the needle. In our proposed method, we address this
   limitation for the special case of under-liquid low energy surfaces.
   Under-liquid systems provide two distinct interfaces: first the
   surface-liquid interface where the drop is to be deposited and the
   second the liquid-fluid interface at the location where the liquid
   column ends. We achieve this non-intrusive, substrate-independent drop
   deposition method by depositing the drop from this liquid-fluid
   interface, by using the (un) favorable spreading behavior of the drop at
   this interface. Massive upsurge in use of low-energy under-liquid
   surfaces, requiring a correct estimation of the corresponding surface
   energy, makes our proposed technique extremely important and
   technologically significant.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon polaritons have become a contender for next-generation
   optical computing with their superior subwavelength modal confinement
   and nonlinearity over conventional photonics. Gap plasmon waveguides,
   also known as metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides, have been shown to
   have one of the best balances in the inherent trade-off between
   confinement (< 200nm) and propagation length (several microns) among
   plasmonic waveguide geometries. There is great interest in introducing
   gain into these plasmonic systems to compensate for their innate short
   propagation lengths. To this end, we present an electrically pumped
   Ag/HfO2/In0.485Ga0.515As/HfO2/Ag metal-insulatorsemiconductor-
   insulator-metal (MISIM) amplifier design for loss-compensation in
   nanoplasmonic interconnects at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.55
   mu m. Finite difference time domain simulations utilizing the full rate
   equations were used to study the signal gain experienced upon
   transmission through the device. The direct bandgap semiconductor gain
   medium In0.485Ga0.515As was modeled as a four level laser system with
   homogeneous broadening. The effect of varying critical amplifier
   dimensions, namely the HfO2 spacer layer thickness and the width of the
   In0.485Ga0.515As core, on the amplifier's performance was studied. A 3
   mu m long linear amplifier is shown to be capable of restoring a 500
   GHz, 500 fs FWHM pulse train after 150 mu m of propagation through a
   nanoplasmonic interconnect network without significant pulse distortion
   at a pump current density of 36.6 kA/cm(2), or 1 mA total current. This
   pump current is shown to cause acceptable levels of device heating. A
   periodic arrangement of such devices could therefore be used to
   indefinitely increase the effective propagation length of a signal.}},

Abstract = {{Oblique incidence reflectometry (OIR) is an established technique for
   estimation of tissue optical properties, however, a sensing footprint of
   a few transport mean-free paths is often needed when
   diffusion-regime-based algorithms are used. Smaller-footprint probes
   require improved light-propagation models and inversion schemes for
   diffuse reflectance close to the point-of-entry but might enable
   micro-endoscopic form factors for clinical assessments of cancers and
   pre-cancers. In this paper we extend the phase-function corrected
   diffusion-theory presented by Vitkin et al. (Nat. Comm 2011) to the case
   of pencil beams obliquely incident on a semi-infinite turbid medium. The
   model requires minimal computational resources and offers improved
   accuracy over more traditional diffusion-theory approximations models
   when validated against Monte Carlo simulations. The computationally
   efficient nature of the models may lend themselves to rapid fitting
   procedures for inverse problems.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that silicon nanowire (SiNW) Li-ion battery anodes that
   are conformally coated with TiO2 using atomic layer deposition (ALD)
   show a remarkable performance improvement. The coulombic efficiency is
   increased to similar to 99\%, among the highest ever reported for SiNWs,
   as compared to 95\% for the baseline uncoated samples. The capacity
   retention after 100 cycles for the nanocomposite is twice as high as
   that of the baseline at 0.1 C (60\% vs. 30\%), and more than three times
   higher at 5 C (34\% vs. 10\%). We also demonstrate that the
   microstructure of the coatings is critically important for achieving
   this effect. Titanium dioxide coatings with an as-deposited anatase
   structure are nowhere near as effective as amorphous ones, the latter
   proving much more resistant to delamination from the SiNW core. We use
   TEM to demonstrate that upon lithiation the amorphous coating develops a
   highly dispersed nanostructure comprised of crystalline LiTiO2 and a
   secondary amorphous phase. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)
   combined with bulk and surface analytical techniques are employed to
   highlight the passivating effect of TiO2, which results in significantly
   fewer cycling-induced electrolyte decomposition products as compared to
   the bare nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{While traditional reliability models have focused on systems with binary
   states, recent research verifies that multistate degradation models are
   more appropriate structures to model degradation mechanisms,
   particularly for mechanical devices. This paper focuses on developing a
   condition-based replacement policy using online inspection data, which
   is one of the main problems in prognostic and health management of
   mechanical devices. This problem is addressed for a type of mechanical
   device with a multistate degradation process. In addition, one of the
   practical challenges in failure data analysis using inspection data
   called interval censoring is addressed. A control-limit policy is
   presented through a cost-based optimization model, which can be used to
   determine when to replace a degraded device. The application of the
   proposed model is demonstrated using a case study on a bearing shell's
   wear process.}},

Abstract = {{The demand for a system is sometimes available only for a finite time
   horizon. It thus becomes necessary to schedule maintenance activities
   during a given planning horizon such that the desired system performance
   is maintained and the available resources are optimally allocated. In
   this paper, a mathematical model is proposed for periodically planning
   preventive maintenance activities for a system comprising multiple
   components. Due to resource limitations, it may not be possible to
   perform all desired maintenance options; hence, a selective maintenance
   approach is used to find the components to be maintained and maintenance
   actions to be performed on the selected components. An imperfect
   maintenance based hybrid model is considered here which includes age
   reduction as well as hazard adjustment after maintenance. Due to the
   high dimension of the solution domain, evolutionary approach is used to
   solve the problem. The optimal number of intervals is found under
   reliability and maintenance time constraints. During each maintenance
   break, the optimal maintenance option is selected for each component
   such that the overall cost of maintenance and possible failures for the
   entire planning horizon is minimized. It is also found that considering
   one interval at a time will incur higher cost.}},

Abstract = {{Different areas of engineering, particularly separation process
   technology, deal with one-dimensional, nonstationary processes that
   under reasonable assumptions, namely negligible dispersion effects and
   transport resistances, are described by mathematical models consisting
   of systems of first-order partial differential equations. Their behavior
   is characterized by continuous or discontinuous composition (or thermal)
   fronts that propagate along the separation unit. The equilibrium theory
   (i.e., the approach discussed here to determine the solution to these
   model equations) predicts this with remarkable accuracy, despite the
   simplifications and assumptions. Interesting applications are in
   adsorption, chromatography and ion-exchange, distillation, gas
   injection, heat storage, sedimentation, precipitation, and dissolution
   waves. We show how mathematics can enlighten the engineering aspects,
   and we guide the researcher not only to reach a synthetic understanding
   of properties of fundamental and applicative interest but also to
   discover new, unexpected, and fascinating phenomena. The tools presented
   here are useful to teachers, researchers, and practitioners alike.}},

Abstract = {{The Au-Sn binary phase diagram shows that there are two eutectic alloy
   compositions. The first one is at similar to 30 at\% Sn (Au-rich) with a
   melting point of 280 degrees C and the second composition is at similar
   to 94 at\% Sn (Sn-rich) with an eutectic temperature at 217 degrees C.
   This paper summarizes work that demonstrates that both eutectic alloys
   can be electrodeposited from electrolytes that are non-toxic and
   environmentally friendly. The Au-rich eutectic alloy is electrodeposited
   as alternating layers of Au5Sn and AuSn, while the Sn-rich eutectic
   alloy is electrodeposited as sequential Au5Sn and Sn layers. In both
   cases, the entire electrodeposition process is achieved using a single
   solution, for each eutectic composition, without exposing the sample to
   air during electrodeposition. Each phase composition is attained by
   varying the current density only. The microstructure of as-deposited and
   reflowed solders is characterized and confirmed using X-ray diffraction

Abstract = {{The oxygen reduction reaction remains the main contributor to
   performance loss in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. A major challenge
   facing researchers is the development of a kinetic model that is simple
   and yet can accurately predict reaction rates at arbitrary electrode
   potentials. Recently, the double-trap intrinsic kinetic model was
   proposed. The model assumes that the overall reaction is comprised of
   four intermediate reactions and two intermediate adsorbed species. The
   model has been shown to predict the commonly observed doubling of the
   Tafel slope. This work shows that the previously proposed model has
   several limitations such as underpredicting Tafel slopes at low
   overpotentials and predicting unrealistic oxygen reaction orders. The
   model is therefore extended to account for backward reactions that had
   previously been assumed to be insignificant and an advanced,
   constrained, multi-variable parameter estimation is performed to
   determine new kinetic parameters. Using the extended model, the computed
   Tafel slopes and oxide coverages are in close agreement with
   experimental data from the literature. The kinetic model shows that the
   observed high coverages at low overpotentials are due to the oxidation
   of water, that the oxygen reaction order is dependent on the applied
   potential, and that the ORR is predominantly adsorption limited. (C)

Abstract = {{Small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) based therapeutics have
   gained substantial attention due to their specific and efficient gene
   knockdown efficacies in the presence of effective cargo vectors.
   Nanogels are identified as non-toxic, blood compatible carriers, which
   are shown to possess high siRNA loading efficacies and show stimuli
   responsive (controlled) release, hence providing optimum gene knockdown
   abilities. Carbohydrate-based cationic nanogels are the most studied
   vectors. In this study, we report the synthesis of degradable,
   thermo-responsive cationic glyconanogels via the reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization approach. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which highlights the
   use of tailor-made thermo-responsive and degradable cationic
   glyconanogels for siRNA delivery. These cationic glyconanogels are
   loaded with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) specific siRNA and
   the complexes are studied for their net size and charge. The cellular
   uptake of glyconanogel-siRNA complexes is studied in Hela cells in the
   presence and absence of serum proteins. Finally, gene knockdown
   efficacies and cell viabilities of the complexes are evaluated in Hela
   cells at varying w/w ratios. The siRNA loaded cationic glyconanogels
   show effective gene knockdown efficacies in Hela cells in the presence
   and absence of serum proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a biomarker protein and an indicator of
   relapse in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Treatment of diseases and
   conditions like MS may be time sensitive, and deflection cantilevers are
   a promising platform for real-time measurement of biomarker proteins.
   Additionally, linking procedures have a substantial effect on the
   sensitivity of deflection cantilever measurements. Therefore, successful
   detection of IFN-gamma using three different linking procedures is
   presented. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to confirm the
   efficacy of the linking procedures before they were implemented on
   cantilever deflection arrays. The steady state change in surface stress
   due to IFN-gamma binding was determined to be 0.16 +/- 0.09, -0.11 +/-
   0.04 and -0.08 +/- 0.06 N/m for the glutaraldehyde, Prolinker B and
   1-ethyl-3-{[}3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride
   (EDC)/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) linking procedures,
   respectively. Furthermore, R-2 values near 1 indicate good correlation
   between an exponential model for antibody-antigen binding and cantilever
   deflection. Steady state deflection of 667.3 +/- 0.1, -452.0 +/- 0.0,
   and -406.2 +/- 0.2 nm and rate constants of 0.4582 +/- 0.0003, 0.4737

Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{1096-1102}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Nanostructured SiO2 thin films fabricated via glancing angle deposition
   on interdigitated electrodes were used as room temperature alcohol
   sensors. Both frequency dependent capacitance and impedance were used to
   analyze sensor response to methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol,
   and 1-butanol. Sensor responsivity was examined across the entire
   percent vapour saturation range for the same set of alcohols and the
   detection limit for ethanol, as an example, was derived. The response
   and recovery times for ethanol were determined from a pulse test and the
   responsivity curves, giving values of 66 s and 76 s, respectively.
   Sensor lifetime was examined for the same set of alcohols with and
   without irradiation from a UV-LED. We observed that sensor aging for the
   detection of ethanol and 1-butanol was greatly reduced under irradiation
   from the UV-LED whereas the UV-LED had little effect on aging for
   methanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol. Using the frequency dependent
   responsivity curves of our sensors, we developed an algorithm that
   enables a single sensor to distinguish between methanol, ethanol and
   2-propanol in a blind protocol test. In five out of seven trials, the
   algorithm successfully identified both the alcohol and concentration
   thereby demonstrating room temperature single sensor selectivity. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. We investigated elemental strontium and/or bisphosphonate drug
   incorporation upon the compositional and biomechanical properties of
   vertebral bone, in a rat model of Osteoporosis secondary to ovariectomy.
   Methods. Six month old female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and divided
   into untreated OVX-Vehicle, OVX-RIS (Risedronate bisphosphonate {[}BP]
   treated), OVX-SrR (Strontium Ranelate {[}Protos (R)] treated),
   combination OVX-RIS+SrR, and sham-operated controls. After 16 weeks of
   treatment, rats were euthanized and lumbar vertebra were dissected.
   Micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT), Electron Probe Micro-Analysis
   (EPMA), mechanical testing in compression and nano-indentation testing
   were then undertaken to evaluate bone morphometry, elemental
   composition, material properties and strength. Results. Bone Volume was
   significantly reduced in the OVX-Vehicle (133 +/- 10mm(3)) compared with
   OVX-RIS (169 +/- 22mm(3)), OVX-SrR (145 +/- 2mm(3)), and OVX-RIS+SrR
   (172 +/- 8mm(3)). EPMA mapped elemental Sr deposition to the periosteal
   surface of cortical bone (50-100 mu m thick), endosteal trabecular
   surfaces (20 mu m thick), as well as to both vertebral growth plates.
   The atomic ratios of (Ca+Sr)/P were significantly reduced with SrR
   treatment (2.4\%-6.6\%), indicating Sr incorporation into bone mineral.
   No significant differences were measured in vertebral bone reduced
   modulus by nano-indentation. Conversely, all BP-dosed groups had
   significantly increased structural bone strength. Conclusions. Thus, we
   conclude that BP drugs dominate the conservation of trabecular geometry
   and structural strength in OP rats, whereas Sr drugs likely influence
   bone volume and material composition locally.}},

Abstract = {{2-Methacryloyloxyethyl-phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymers are zwitterionic
   in character and are widely used in a range of biomedical devices. The
   availability of facile polymerization approaches has allowed the
   synthesis of well-defined MPC polymers, which are now used as delivery
   carriers for in vitro and in vivo applications. Although
   biocompatibility testing has extensively been performed on insoluble
   MPC-based materials, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports
   on the hemocompatibility of soluble MPC polymers. Therefore, in this
   work, linear and hyperbranched MPC polymers of varying molecular weights
   are synthesized via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer
   (RAFT) polymerization. The polymers produced are studied for their blood
   compatibility, as a function of their molecular weights and structures
   (linear versus hyperbranched). The hemocompatibility studies including
   clot formation, complement and platelet activation, and hemolysis
   indicate that linear and hyperbranched MPC polymers are blood
   compatible. The remarkable difference in erythrocyte aggregation in the
   presence of linear and branched MPC polymers indicates the importance of
   the branched polymer architecture.}},

Abstract = {{We present a review on a special class of photoconductive (PC) terahertz
   (THz) dipole emitters based on fractal geometry. A comprehensive study
   of these superior THz antenna designs that are able to emit higher THz
   radiation power and detect lower THz radiation signal levels than the
   traditional THz PC antennas is performed. It is shown that the presented
   fractal PC THz emitters operate in a plasmonic regime. This concept is
   applicable to all fractal geometries such as Sierpinski and Apollonian
   fractals. In addition, the effect of self-similar geometry on radiation
   properties of fractal PC THz emitters is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents multi-rate parameter and state estimation methods
   for the induction motor. Based on multi-rate control theory and the
   extended Kalman filter (EKF) theory, a multi-rate EKF algorithm
   including input and output algorithms is proposed for load torque
   estimation in the induction motor. The methods are implemented in
   real-time on PC-cluster node which acts as the controller for an
   induction motor experimental set-up. Rotor time constant is a sensitive
   variable in indirect field-oriented control method. A multi-rate model
   reference adaptive system (MRAS) is proposed to estimate the rotor time
   constant in order to guarantee the high-performance control of induction
   motor. Experimental result verified the effectiveness of the algorithms.
   Simulations compare the multi-rate EKF algorithm with the traditional
   single-rate EKF algorithm performance to show improved performance of
   load torque estimator. The comparison between the traditional MRAS and
   the multi-rate MRAS shows the superiority of the proposed method, with a
   satisfactory accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Porous chromium oxide (Cr2O3) ceramics were prepared by oxidizing highly
   porous chromium carbides that were obtained by a reactive sintering
   method, and were evaluated at temperatures ranging from 375 degrees C to
   625 degrees C in supercritical water (SCW) environments with a fixed
   pressure of 25-30 MPa. Reactive element yttrium was introduced to the
   porous oxide ceramic by adding various amounts of yttria of 5, 10 and 20
   wt.\%, respectively, prior to reactive sintering. The exposure in SCW
   shows that the porous chromium oxide is quite stable in SCW at 375
   degrees C. However, the stability decreased with increasing temperature.
   It is well known that chromium oxide can be oxidized to soluble chromium
   (VI) species in SCW when oxygen is present. Adding yttria increases the
   stability of chromium oxide in SCW environments. However, adding yttria
   higher than 5 wt.\% increased the weight loss of porous chromium oxide
   samples because of the direct dissociation of Y2O3 in SCW. (C) 2012

Title = {{On Enthalpies of Solution of Athabasca Pentane Asphaltenes and

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{66-74}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The analysis and prediction of asphaltene precipitation behaviors and
   asphaltene-diluent interactions are typically treated from either a
   solution thermodynamics or a colloid perspective. The polydispersity and
   multiphase nature of asphaltenes allows for portions of these materials
   to exhibit both behaviors concurrently at fixed global composition. In
   the current work, this duality is explored using solution calorimetry.
   Measurements were performed for Athabasca pentane asphaltenes and
   asphaltene fractions in pure diluents (toluene, tetrahydrofuran,
   quinoline, 1-methylnaphthalene) and in diluents where impurities were
   intentionally added. Reported values for the enthalpy of solution in the
   data set range from -16 to +10 J/g of asphaltenes. The observed changes
   in both the magnitude and sign of the enthalpy of solution values with
   global composition at fixed temperature and with temperature at fixed
   composition are interpreted qualitatively based on enthalpies of
   sorption (negative), enthalpies of phase transition (positive), and
   enthalpies of mixing (negative or positive). Quantitation of the
   asphaltene fractions potentially present as colloidal particles, as an
   asphaltene-rich liquid or as dissolved species in a diluent remains a
   subject for future study.}},

   buoyancy-driven rise through pure or salty water at neutral pH exhibit a
   cascade partial-coalescence phenomenon upon soft collision with

   of pure toluene, n-heptane, and their mixtures (heptol), and for
   moderate-strength electrolytes, the cascade partial-coalescence process
   continues until a critical droplet size is reached. We infer that this
   outcome is due to the oil-water interface being electrically charged and

   lower-and upper-bounds for the absolute value of the electrical

Abstract = {{We focus on the development of a Lyapunov-based economic model
   predictive control (LEMPC) method for a class of switched nonlinear
   systems for which the mode transitions take place according to a
   prescribed switching schedule. In contrast to steady-state operation of
   conventional model predictive control (MPC) methods which use a
   quadratic objective function in their formulations, LEMPC utilizes a
   general (non-quadratic) cost function which may directly address
   economic considerations and may lead to time-varying closed-loop
   operation. Appropriate stabilizability assumptions for the switched
   nonlinear system are made and suitable constraints are imposed on the
   proposed LEMPC formulation to guarantee closed-loop stability of the
   switched nonlinear system and ensure satisfaction of the prescribed
   switching schedule policy while dictating time-varying operation that
   optimizes the economic cost function. The proposed control method is
   demonstrated through a chemical process example described by a switched
   nonlinear system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   pool fires}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{786-791}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fuel burning rate, flame height and temperature distributions within the
   liquid phase of a methanol pool fire were measured to investigate the
   impacts of altering the pool's liquid-side boundary conditions. The
   conditions changed were the temperature at the bottom of the pool and
   the material used for the pool walls (either quartz or aluminum). These
   materials were chosen for their different thermal conductivities, which
   affect one of the pathways for heat transfer from the flame to the pool.
   The experiments were conducted under steady state and quiescent ambient
   conditions. It was observed that the burning rate increased linearly
   with increasing the bottom boundary temperature, and that the aluminum
   pool was significantly more sensitive to this parameter than the quartz
   pool. Due to the coupling between burning rate and flame area, the flame
   height showed similar behavior to boundary temperature and pool wall
   material variations. For either type of wall materials, the temperature
   distribution showed a vertical structure of two distinct layers with one
   layer being nearly uniform and the other having a relatively steep
   gradient. The arrangement of these layers was unexpectedly opposite for
   the different wall materials. For the aluminum vessel the pattern was
   thermally well-mixed in the lower part of the pool and the steep
   temperature gradient near the surface, while for the quartz pool the
   thermally well-mixed region was at the top. These observations lead to
   proposing the existence of non-1-D fluid motion in regions of high
   convective heat transfer from the walls. Irrespective of the underlying
   mechanism, these differing temperature distributions suggested that the
   liquid phase is not as simple as what has been typically modeled in the
   literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Robots are becoming increasingly relevant to neurosurgeons, extending a
   neurosurgeon's physical capabilities, improving navigation within the
   surgical landscape when combined with advanced imaging, and propelling
   the movement toward minimally invasive surgery. Most surgical robots,
   however, isolate surgeons from the full range of human senses during a
   procedure. This forces surgeons to rely on vision alone for guidance
   through the surgical corridor, which limits the capabilities of the
   system, requires significant operator training, and increases the
   surgeon's workload. Incorporating haptics into these systems, ie,
   enabling the surgeon to ``feel{''} forces experienced by the tool tip of
   the robot, could render these limitations obsolete by making the robot
   feel more like an extension of the surgeon's own body. Although the use
   of haptics in neurosurgical robots is still mostly the domain of
   research, neurosurgeons who keep abreast of this emerging field will be
   more prepared to take advantage of it as it becomes more prevalent in
   operating theaters. Thus, this article serves as an introduction to the
   field of haptics for neurosurgeons. We not only outline the current and
   future benefits of haptics but also introduce concepts in the fields of
   robotic technology and computer control. This knowledge will allow
   readers to be better aware of limitations in the technology that can
   affect performance and surgical outcomes, and ``knowing the right
   questions to ask{''} will be invaluable for surgeons who have purchasing
   power within their departments.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of their striking diversity, numerous tasks and architectures
   of intelligent systems such as those permeating multivariable data
   analysis (e.g., time series, spatio-temporal, and spatial dependencies),
   decision-making processes along with their underlying models,
   recommender systems and others exhibit two evident commonalities. They
   promote (a) human centricity and (b) vigorously engage perceptions
   (rather than plain numeric entities) in the realization of the systems
   and their further usage. Information granules play a pivotal role in
   such settings. Granular Computing delivers a cohesive framework
   supporting a formation of information granules and facilitating their
   processing. We exploit an essential concept of Granular Computing: an
   optimal allocation of information granularity, which helps endow
   constructs of intelligent systems with a much-needed conceptual and
   modeling flexibility.
   The study elaborates in detail on the three representative studies. In
   the first study being focused on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
   used in decision-making, we show how an optimal allocation of
   granularity helps improve the quality of the solution and facilitate
   collaborative activities (e.g., consensus building) in models of group
   decision-making. The second study concerns a formation of granular logic
   descriptors on a basis of a family of logic descriptors Finally, the
   third study focuses on the formation of granular fuzzy neural networks
   architectures aimed at the formation of granular logic mappings.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Variable speed limit (VSL) can be used on freeways to manage traffic
   flow with the goal of improving capacity. To achieve the objective, this
   study proposes a novel VSL control strategy that explicitly considers
   the fundamental diagrams (FDs) at active bottleneck, and its
   upstream-downstream segments. To deeply understand the effectiveness of
   the VSL control, an analytical model based on the cell transmission
   model (CTM) is developed. Two modifications in the FD are proposed to
   model: (1) active bottleneck in which there is a capacity drop once
   feeding flow exceeds its capacity; and (2) variable free-flow speeds for
   the cells operated with VSL control. To allow these modifications, the
   local demand-supply approach is adopted to change the boundary condition
   of the CTM. As part of the VSL control algorithm, the proposed VSL
   control model is implemented in a North American urban freeway corridor
   with the model predictive control approach. This simulation study
   reveals that, in terms of traffic mobility, VSL is mostly effective
   during congestion periods.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and detailed in situ determination of fluence rate (FR)
   distributions in ultraviolet (UV) reactors with multiple lamps is
   important in validating mathematical models for the purpose of
   estimating the fluence (UV dose) delivery. In this study, the FR
   distributions in a practical multiple-lamp UV reactor were determined
   experimentally for waters with various transmittances (at 254 nm) using
   a micro-fluorescent silica detector. Three lamp configurations were
   investigated through detailed FR distribution measurements along the
   reactor axis, a radial direction, and a certain arc in a plane
   perpendicular to the reactor axis. The results showed that the
   mathematical model (UVCalc (R) versions 2A and 3) FR predictions agreed
   reasonably well with the experimental data. A shadowing effect was found
   not only in totally-blocked regions, but also in partially-blocked
   regions. Reflection from the reactor wall exhibited a strong influence
   when the UV lamps were placed near the reactor wall. In addition,
   certain effects were measured quantitatively, such as a shadowing effect
   (the model over-predicted by about 8\% in the shadow region) and a
   reflection effect from lamp/sleeve pairs (the model under-predicted by
   about 7-9\% for the local FRs and about 2\% for the radius-weighted
   average FR). A semi-closed `loop' formed by the three lamps and their
   sleeves appeared to induce a reflection enhancement. This study has
   potential applications toward the improvement of mathematical models and
   the optimization of UV reactor design. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   process with fixed density is analyzed. Largely ignored in the
   literature, this assumption leads to more realistic results, as in a
   typical practical scenario neither the number of relays nor their
   distances from the source and destination are known. An exact expression
   for the outage probability of this cooperative system for general fading
   environments and different types of relaying is derived. The expression
   is then simplified under an assumption that the radius of the relay
   deployment region is sufficiently large, and specialized to additive
   white Gaussian noise (no fading), Rayleigh fading and severe
   (half-Gaussian) fading environments. Simple and tight upper and lower
   bounds on the outage probability are also derived. Simulation results
   validate the theoretical analyses and verify the accuracies of the
   proposed bounds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the resonance problem in a parallel-inverter-based
   grid-interactive microgrid. Unlike the single grid-connected inverter
   system where the resonance frequency is mainly fixed by the inverter
   output LCL filter parameters, the parallel-inverter-based
   grid-interactive microgrid system presents a more challenging picture
   where inverter interactions will excite complex resonances at various
   frequencies. As a result, line currents of inverters can be severely
   distorted even when the control schemes and filter circuits are properly
   designed based on the single-inverter model. This paper first develops a
   microgrid model using discrete time-domain closed-loop Norton's
   equivalent circuit. Multiple resonances can then be evaluated with the
   developed model. To improve the microgrid power quality, this paper also
   designs a virtual-harmonic-resistance-based active damping method. The
   proposed damping method can be seamlessly incorporated into the
   conventional deadbeat control scheme through the direct control
   reference modification. Therefore, the active damping method is able to
   address both the transient and steady-state resonances within the
   deadbeat current control bandwidth. Simulation and experimental results
   are provided to validate the correctness of the developed resonance
   modeling and active damping methods.}},

Abstract = {{We have proposed a new canonical-isokinetic ensemble for efficient
   sampling of conformational space in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
   which leads to the optimised isokinetic Nose-Hoover (OIN) chain
   algorithm for atomic and molecular systems. We applied OIN to multiple
   time step (MTS) MD simulations of the rigid and flexible models of water
   to demonstrate its advantage over the standard canonical, isokinetic and
   canonical-isokinetic ensembles. With the stabilising effect of OIN
   thermostatting in MTS-MD, gigantic outer time steps up to picoseconds
   can be employed to accurately calculate equilibrium and conformational
   properties. Furthermore, we developed the atomic version of OIN for
   MTS-MD of a biomolecule in a solvent potential of mean force obtained at
   sequential MD steps by using the molecular theory of solvation, aka
   three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the
   Kovalenko-Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH). The solvation forces are obtained
   analytically by converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral equations once per
   several OIN outer time steps, and are calculated in between by using
   solvation force-coordinate extrapolation (SFCE) in the subspace of
   previous successive solutions to 3D-RISM-KH. For illustration, we
   applied the multiscale OIN/SFCE/3D-RISM-KH algorithm to a fully flexible
   model of alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution. Although the
   computational rate of solvent sampling in OIN/SFCE/3D-RISM-KH is already
   20 times faster than standard MD with explicit solvent, further
   substantial acceleration of sampling stems from making solute evolution
   steps in a statistically averaged potential of mean force obtained from
   3D-RISM-KH. The latter efficiently samples the phase space for essential
   events with rare statistics such as exchange and localisation of solvent
   and ligand molecules in confined spaces, pockets and at binding sites of
   the solute macromolecule, as distinct from MD with explicit solvent
   which requires enormous computational time and number of steps in such
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{Although the multivariate structure of traffic accidents has been
   recognized in the safety literature for over a decade now, univariate
   identification and ranking of hotspots is still dominant. The present
   paper advocates the use of multivariate identification and ranking of
   hotspots based on statistical depth functions, which are useful tools
   for non-parametric multivariate analysis as they provide center-out
   ordering of multivariate data. Thus, a depth-based multivariate method
   is proposed for the identification and ranking of hotspots using the
   full Bayes (FB) approach. The proposed method is applied to a sample of
   236 signalized intersections in the Greater Vancouver Area. Various
   multivariate Poisson log-normal (MVPLN) models were used for data
   analysis. For each model, the FB posterior estimates were obtained using
   the Markov Chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and several
   goodness-of-fit measures were used for model selection. Using a depth
   threshold of 0.025, the proposed method identified 26 intersections
   (11\%) as potential hotspots. The choice of a depth threshold is a
   delicate decision and it is suggested to determine the threshold
   according to the amount of funding available for safety improvement,
   which is the usual practice in univariate hotspot identification (HSID).
   Also, the results show that the performance of the proposed multivariate
   depth-based FB HSID method is superior to that of an analogous method
   based on the depths of accident frequency (AF) in terms of sensitivity,
   specificity and the sum of norms (lengths) of Poisson mean vectors. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the application of full Bayes multivariate
   linear intervention models to evaluate the impact of the Signal Head
   Upgrade Program in the City of Surrey, British Columbia. The program was
   implemented by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) and
   is aimed at reducing the number of collisions by improving signal
   visibility. Specific improvements include: upgrading signal lens size,
   installing new backplates, adding reflective tapes to existing
   backplates, and installing additional signal heads. The evaluation
   utilizes full Bayes multivariate linear intervention models with a
   multiple regression links representing time, treatment, and interaction
   effects as well as the traffic volumes effects. The models were utilized
   to determine the safety impacts of the program on each combination of
   collision severity and collision time of occurrence (i.e.
   severe/day-time, severe/night-time, PDO/day-time, PDO/night-time) in the
   City of Surrey. The results indicated the effectiveness of the program
   in improving the safety of the treated intersections as there were
   reductions in all types of collisions at the treated sites after the
   improvement. However, such reductions were statistically significant
   only for night-time severe collisions and day-time PDO collisions. (C)

Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{76-90}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Buoyancy driven flow between two finite zones containing fluid of
   slightly different density is investigated. The two zones are connected
   through a common rectangular doorway spanning the channel width so that
   a two-layer exchange flow develops once the barrier is removed. In the
   zone that initially contained dense fluid, a buoyant plume of light
   fluid mixes with the dense fluid leading, over time, to the development
   of non-trivial ambient density stratification. Meanwhile, dense fluid
   flows as a gravity current into the zone that initially contained light
   fluid. This gravity current reflects from the end wall and propagates
   back toward the opening in the form of an internal bore. When the bore
   reaches the opening the dynamics of the exchange flow (and consequently
   the source conditions of the buoyant plume) are substantially altered.
   Such dynamics are modeled using elements of gravity current, internal
   bore and plume theory. The flow dynamics of the two zones are linked
   using two-layer exchange flow theory whereby a maximal exchange flow
   rate is prescribed only before the bore reaches the opening. The
   velocity and density jump across the first front decrease substantially
   once the exchange flow becomes sub-maximal. Depending on the geometrical
   parameters, the terminal elevation of the first front may lie above, at
   or below the top of the opening; here, we focus on the former scenario.
   Experiments have been carried out to validate the model. The comparison
   between theory and experiment plus the application of the research to
   architectural fluid mechanics is discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Novel coarse-to-fine dual scale technique for tuberculosis cavity
   detection in chest radiographs}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Although many lung disease diagnostic procedures can benefit from
   computer-aided detection (CAD), current CAD systems are mainly designed
   for lung nodule detection. In this article, we focus on tuberculosis
   (TB) cavity detection because of its highly infectious nature.
   Infectious TB, such as adult-type pulmonary TB (APTB) and HIV-related
   TB, continues to be a public health problem of global proportion,
   especially in the developing countries. Cavities in the upper lung zone
   provide a useful cue to radiologists for potential infectious TB.
   However, the superimposed anatomical structures in the lung field hinder
   effective identification of these cavities. In order to address the
   deficiency of existing computer-aided TB cavity detection methods, we
   propose an efficient coarse-to-fine dual scale technique for cavity
   detection in chest radiographs. Gaussian-based matching, local binary
   pattern, and gradient orientation features are applied at the coarse
   scale, while circularity, gradient inverse coefficient of variation and
   Kullback-Leibler divergence measures are applied at the fine scale.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms
   other existing techniques with respect to true cavity detection rate and
   segmentation accuracy.}},

   Permeability}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{54-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Relative permeabilities for three-phase flow are commonly predicted from
   two-phase-flow measurements using empirical models. These empirical
   models are usually tested against available steady-state data. However,
   the oil flow is transient during various production stages {[}e.g., gas
   injection after waterflood and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)].
   Hence, there is a need to test the empirical models against
   unsteady-state or transient data.
   We compare two sets of three-phase oil-permeability data measured during
   tertiary gasflood. The first data set, which was recently published
   (Dehghanpour et al. 2011a), is measured during transient
   gravity-drainage experiments, and will be detailed further here. The
   second set was measured by Oak et al. (1990) during steady-state
   corefloods. We compare the two data sets with the corresponding
   two-phase permeability curves, and observe different qualitative
   behaviours. The comparison indicates that during steady-state tertiary
   gasflood, the presence and flow of water restrict the oil flow, while
   during transient tertiary gasflood, water-saturation drop enhances the
   oil flow. We test the performance of well-known empirical models further
   in predicting the two data sets, and explain how Stone I and
   saturation-weighted interpolation (SWI) should be used to usefully
   predict oil permeability during a three-phase tertiary displacement.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Effective diagnosis of damage levels is important for condition based
   preventive maintenance of gearboxes. One special characteristic of
   damage levels is the inherent ordinal information among different
   levels. Retaining the ordinal information is therefore important for
   diagnosing damage levels. Classification, a machine learning technique,
   has been widely adopted for automated diagnosis of gear faults. However,
   classification cannot keep the ordinal information because the damage
   levels are treated as nominal variables. This paper employs ordinal
   ranking, another machine learning technique, to preserve the ordinal
   information in automated diagnosis of damage levels. As to ordinal
   ranking, feature selection is important. However, most existing feature
   selection methods are for classification, which are not suitable for
   ordinal ranking. This paper designs a feature selection method for
   ordinal ranking based on correlation coefficients. A diagnosis approach
   based on ordinal ranking and the proposed feature selection method is
   then introduced. This method is tested on diagnosis of artificially
   created surface damage levels of planet gear teeth in a planetary
   gearbox. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed
   diagnosis approach. The advantages of using ordinal ranking for
   diagnosing gear damage levels are also demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Measurement of bi-materials interface bonding strength is crucial for
   the design and application of structures with two or more materials
   since bi-material interface debonding is one of the major modes of
   failures for these structures. However, accurate determination of the
   interface bonding strength is not an easy task due to the discontinuity
   of material properties at the interface. There may exist a stress
   singularity at the edges of bi-material interface, where the debonding
   usually initiates from. A new specimen design that can eliminate the
   stress singularity is proposed. In practical applications, the interface
   failure often occurs under the actions of combined interface normal and
   shear stresses. Therefore, a biaxial normal-shear bonding strength
   envelope is required for practical applications. This paper presents a
   new experimental method integrated with finite element analysis and an
   iterative algorithm to determine the interface strength envelope between
   aluminum and epoxy polymer materials, in which the former is considered
   as an elastic isotropic material and the latter as a linear viscoelastic
   material. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical-mechanical, 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation (3D
   reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure) is
   promising as an essential part of multiscale methodology for chemical
   and biomolecular nanosystems in solution. 3D-RISM-KH explains the
   molecular mechanisms of self-assembly and conformational stability of
   synthetic organic rosette nanotubes (RNTs), aggregation of prion
   proteins and beta-sheet amyloid oligomers, protein-ligand binding, and
   function-related solvation properties of complexes as large as the
   Gloeobacter violaceus pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (GLIC) and
   GroEL/ES chaperone. Molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann (generalized
   Born) surface area {[}MM/PB(GB)SA] post-processing of molecular dynamics
   (MD) trajectories involving SA empirical nonpolar terms is replaced with
   MM/3D-RISM-KH statistical-mechanical evaluation of the solvation
   thermodynamics. 3D-RISM-KH has been coupled with multiple time-step
   (MTS) MD of the solute biomolecule driven by effective solvation forces,
   which are obtained analytically by converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral
   equations at outer time-steps and are calculated in between by using
   solvation force coordinate extrapolation (SFCE) in the subspace of
   previous solutions to 3D-RISM-KH. The procedure is stabilized by the
   optimized isokinetic Nose-Hoover (OIN) chain thermostatting, which
   enables gigantic outer time-steps up to picoseconds to accurately
   calculate equilibrium properties. The multiscale OIN/SFCE/3D-RISM-KH
   algorithm is implemented in the Amber package and illustrated on a fully
   flexible model of alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution, exhibiting the
   computational rate of solvent sampling 20 times faster than standard MD
   with explicit solvent. Further substantial acceleration can be achieved
   with 3D-RISM-KH efficiently sampling essential events with rare
   statistics such as exchange and localization of solvent, ions, and
   ligands at binding sites and pockets of the biomolecule. 3D-RISM-KH was
   coupled with ab initio complete active space self-consistent field
   (CASSCF) and orbital-free embedding (OFE) Kohn-Sham (KS) density
   functional theory (DFT) quantum chemistry methods in an SCF description
   of electronic structure, optimized geometry, and chemical reactions in
   solution. The (OFE)KS-DFT/3D-RISM-KH multi scale method is implemented
   in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) package and extensively
   validated against experiment for solvation thermochemistry,
   photochemistry, conformational equilibria, and activation barriers of
   various nanosystems in solvents and ionic liquids (ILs). Finally, the
   replica RISM-KH-VM molecular theory for the solvation structure,
   thermodynamics, and electrochemistry of electrolyte solutions sorbed in
   nanoporous materials reveals the molecular mechanisms of sorption and
   supercapacitance in nanoporous carbon electrodes, which is drastically
   different from a planar electrical double layer.}},

Abstract = {{Brushless doubly fed reluctance machines (BDFRMs) are a class of
   machines that may be controlled using a power converter that has a
   rating lower than the total power rating of the machine. The attractive
   properties of these machines have, in the past, been offset by low power
   density and efficiency when compared to other types of machines. Recent
   advances have shown that, when well designed, these machines are, in
   fact, capable of operation at high torque density and efficiency.
   However, little guidance on how to design these machines is available in
   the literature. This paper presents analytical approaches to design a
   BDFRM with desirable qualities and the use of time-stepped
   finite-element analysis to validate the results of the design process.}},

Title = {{An idealized geometry that mimics average infant nasal airway deposition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{137-148}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An idealized geometry of the infant nasal airways is developed with the
   goal of mimicking the average inertial filtration of aerosols by the
   nasal passages. Paramount geometrical features of 10 previously
   published nasal replicas of infants aged 3-18 months have been
   considered in creating the idealized version. Simplifications are made
   to features that do not significantly influence deposition but that make
   the airway unnecessarily convoluted. A series of overall deposition
   measurements have been carried out in the idealized replica over a range
   of particle sizes and breathing patterns. Deposition data for the
   idealized geometry are compared with those from 10 in vitro subjects.
   Satisfactory agreement between deposition in the idealized and real
   geometries suggests that the idealized version can characterize average
   deposition in the real airways. The present idealized airway could be
   useful as a reference geometry in experimental and theoretical studies
   of aerosol delivery through infant nasal airways. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) coated with the pH responsive
   poly(2-(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) shells have been
   synthesized in different sizes using surface-initiated atom transfer
   radical polymerization (ATRP). A mixture of the PDEAEMA functionalized
   SiNPs (20 and 128 nm) was found to efficiently change the surface
   property of a substrate. The surface properties were investigated at
   different ratios of functionalized SiNPs. Moreover, fluorescent-doped
   SiNPs with PDEAEMA were also prepared to study the adsorption/desorption
   behavior of the SiNPs on the substrates at different pHs. A Surface
   Forces Apparatus (SFA) was used to measure the interactions between
   PDEAEMA surfaces in aqueous solutions of different pHs, and the
   force-distance profiles directly indicate that the intermolecular
   interactions of PDEAEMA are pH sensitive. At pH < pK(a) (similar to 7.3)
   steric repulsion dominates while at pH >= pK(a) the hydrophobic
   attraction between PDEAEMA molecules plays a critical role in their

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS}},

Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{31-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Inversion of seismic data is commonly used in the quantitative
   estimation of acoustic properties of reservoirs. Locally varying
   anisotropy (LVA) is incorporated in the Bayesian formulation of the
   inverse problem to impose spatial constraints in the lateral continuity
   of the acoustic properties. Unlike elastic anisotropy used to define the
   directional dependence of elastic properties, locally varying anisotropy
   in this context describes the heterogeneity of elastic properties using
   scale lengths associated to the directions of maximum and minimum
   temporal/spatial continuity. This approach favors a multiple trace-based
   inversion to provide geologically consistent estimates of the model
   parameters at the seismic scale especially in geological formations that
   display complex nonlinear features such as channels or folds. The
   proposed method uses covariances obtained through quantitative modeling
   of the spatial statistics of the elastic parameters. The computation of
   spatial correlation uses anisotropic distances between locations within
   the geological formation. A synthetic validation of the method using a
   least squares approach shows an improvement in the inference of acoustic
   impedances from seismic data when nonlinear geological features are
   present. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prevention of deep tissue injury through muscle contractions induced by

   Appl Physiol 114: 286-296, 2013. First published November 21, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00257.2012.-Deep tissue injury (DTI) is a
   severe medical complication that commonly affects those with spinal cord
   injury. It is caused by prolonged external loading of the muscles,
   entrapping them between a bony prominence and the support surface. The
   entrapment causes excessive mechanical deformation and increases in
   interstitial pressure, leading to muscle breakdown deep around the bony
   prominences. We proposed the use of intermittent electrical stimulation
   (IES) as a novel prophylactic method for the prevention of DTI. In this
   study, we assessed the long-term effectiveness of this technique in pigs
   that had received a partial spinal cord injury that paralyzed one
   hindlimb. The pigs recovered for 2 wk postsurgery, and subsequently,
   their paralyzed limbs were loaded to 25\% of their body weights 4 h/day
   for 4 consecutive days each week for 1 mo. One group of pigs (n = 3)
   received IES during the loading, whereas another group (n = 3) did not.
   DTI was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postmortem
   histology. In the group that did not receive IES, MRI assessments
   revealed signs of tissue damage in 48\% of the volume of the loaded
   muscle. In the group that did receive IES, only 8\% of the loaded muscle
   volume showed signs of tissue damage. Similar findings were found
   through postmortem histology. This study demonstrates, for the first
   time, that IES may be an effective technique for preventing the
   formation of DTI in loaded muscles after spinal cord injury.}},

Abstract = {{Among consumers, heat-treated wood recently gained more importance due
   its attractive darker color along with several other advantages such as
   improved biological resistance, dimensional stability, and thermal
   insulating properties. However, exposure to the exterior environment
   drastically changes the attractive darker color of this product. From
   dark brown, it becomes almost white. For this reason, development of a
   nontoxic transparent coating which can protect the heat-treated wood
   from photodegradation is very important. Addition of UV stabilizers (UV
   absorbers, HALS, antioxidant) is necessary for transparent coatings in
   order to filter the harmful UV/VIS radiation. In this present study, the
   effectiveness of natural antioxidants, extracted from conifer barks or
   needles from trees in protecting the color of wood, as additives to
   acrylic polyurethane coating is examined. Also, their UV/VIS absorption
   capacities and semi-quantitative component analyses have been presented.
   The toxicity of these new products was also evaluated on human normal
   skin cells due to ever increasing environmental legislation. The
   chemical modification of acrylic polyurethane coating containing conifer
   bark and needle extract were examined by ATR-FTIR analysis. Promising
   results were obtained for these natural antioxidants which showed very
   high UV absorption characteristics and antioxidant activity.}},

Abstract = {{A common assumption in geostatistics is that the underlying joint
   distribution of possible values of a geological attribute at different
   locations is stationary within a homogeneous domain. This joint
   distribution is commonly modeled as multi-Gaussian, with correlations
   defined by a stationary covariance function. This results in attribute
   maps that fail to reproduce local changes in the mean, in the variance
   and, particularly, in the spatial continuity. The proposed alternative
   is to build local distributions, variograms, and correlograms. These are
   inferred by weighting the samples depending on their distance to
   selected locations. The local distributions are locally transformed into
   Gaussian distributions embedding information on the local histogram. The
   distance weighted experimental variograms and correlograms are able to
   adapt to local changes in the direction and range of spatial continuity.
   The automatically fitted local variogram models and the local Gaussian
   transformation parameters are used in spatial estimation algorithms
   assuming local stationarity. The resulting maps are rich in
   nonstationary spatial features. The proposed process implies a higher
   computational effort than traditional stationary techniques, but if data
   availability allows for a reliable inference of the local distributions
   and statistics, a higher accuracy of estimates can be achieved.}},

Title = {{Safety performance functions using traffic conflicts}},
Journal = {{SAFETY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{160-164}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that traffic conflicts provide useful insight
   into the failure mechanism that leads to road collisions while being
   more frequent and of minor social cost. However, the relationship
   between collisions and conflicts must first be established in order to
   use traffic conflicts as surrogates to collisions for safety analysis.
   To investigate the relationship between conflicts and collisions, a
   two-phase model is proposed where a lognormal model is employed in the
   first phase to predict conflicts using traffic volume, area type
   (urban/suburban) and some geometric-related variables as covariates. In
   the second phase, a conflicts-based negative binomial (NB) safety
   performance function (SPF) is then employed to predict collisions. The
   proposed model was applied to a dataset corresponding to 51 signalized
   intersections in British Columbia. The results show that a significant
   proportional relationship exists between conflicts and collisions where
   the moderating effects of conflicts on collisions are non-linear with
   decreasing rates. The scaled deviance and Pearson chi(2) goodness of fit
   measures indicated that the proposed NB model has adequately fitted the
   data. The finding that conflicts can be used to represent collisions
   calls for further research on the countermeasures needed to reduce
   conflicts as effective means for decreasing collision frequency. Apart
   from the traffic- and geometric-based traditional countermeasures, new
   driving-behavior-based measures should be devised that would hopefully
   have a downward influence on collisions. Crown Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Single-crystal indium tin oxide (ITO) nanotrees with engineered trunk
   and branch orientations are grown using a recently reported technique
   combining vapor-liquid-solid growth and glancing angle deposition
   (AILS-GLAD). In this work, three unique capabilities of VLS-GLAD are
   demonstrated for the first time: (i) nanotrees are aligned without
   epitaxy, (ii) branches can be placed on select faces of the nanotree
   trunk, and (iii) branch orientation can be modified along the height of
   nanotrees. VLS-GLAD uses a collimated obliquely incident vapor flux to
   place material on desired growth surfaces, resulting in preferential
   branch growth on the sides of the nanotree trunk exposed to the flux at
   the time of nucleation. Dynamic control of the azimuthal orientation of
   the flux relative to a growing nanotree enables the preferential
   orientation of branches to be modulated along the height of the
   nanotree, which we have demonstrated with both continuous and discrete
   substrate rotation schemes. An electron diffraction investigation
   confirms that the nanotrees can be considered as a single crystal, with
   continuity of the crystal structure across the trunk-branch interface.
   Crystal texture of the films is characterized by X-ray diffraction pole
   figures. By limiting the flux to discrete positions, the films develop
   both out-of-plane and in-plane crystal alignment (biaxial texture). We
   interpret the in-plane orientation as the result of competitive growth,
   which leads to evolutionary selection of similarly oriented structures.
   Control over in-plane nanotree crystal alignment and height-dependent
   branch orientation should increase the achievable complexity in
   three-dimensional nanowire architectures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the characterization and design of a static random

   incorporates a single-electron (SE) turnstile and an SE transistor/MOS

   previous cells, the hybrid circuit is utilized to sense (measure) on a
   voltage basis the presence of at least an electron as stored in memory,
   while the turnstile enables the SE transfer in and out of the storage
   node. The two memory operations (read and write) are facilitated by
   utilizing these hybrid circuits; moreover, the proposed SRAM cell shows
   compatibility with MOSFET technology. HSPICE simulation shows that the
   proposed SRAM cell operates correctly at 45 and 32 nm with good
   performance in terms of propagation delay, signal integrity, area,
   stability, and power consumption. The extension of the aforementioned
   hybrid design to a ternary content addressable memory cell is also

Abstract = {{This paper proposes deriving regional intensity-duration-frequency (IDF)
   curves for Edmonton, Canada, based on the scaling property of
   precipitation data using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD).
   Selected sets of annual maximum precipitation data were decomposed by
   the EEMD to intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and the scaling property
   was investigated. Next, representative scale exponents were extracted.
   The results show that quantiles derived from general extreme value (GEV)
   probability distribution (PD) with parameters derived by the
   probability-weighted moment (PWM) are more accurate than those derived
   from the extreme value type I (EVI) PD with parameters derived by the
   method of moment (MOM), whose underestimation of rainfall intensity
   becomes obvious for high return period (greater than 25 years) and short
   duration (less than 1 h). The results also show that for Edmonton,
   generally three of four IMFs of the precipitation data showed a simple
   scaling property, and regional IDF curves derived from the scaling IDF
   and EEMD approach predict accurate storm intensities for rain-gauging
   sites at both the calibration and validation stages, but there could be
   errors associated with predicted storms of high return periods (100

Abstract = {{Encouraged by the remarkable productivity improvements in the
   manufacturing sector, the construction industry has a long history of
   trying to garner the benefits of manufacturing technologies. Whereas
   industrialized construction methods, such as modular and manufactured
   buildings, have evolved over decades, core techniques used in
   prefabrication plants vary only slightly from those employed in
   traditional site-built construction. The objective of this research was
   to develop and implement a production system for the effective
   application of lean tools in building components prefabrication. To
   overcome the prevalent skepticism among middle management, the lean
   journey started with a pilot project involving one production line. Over
   a six-month period, lean tools such as 5S (sort, straighten, shine,
   standardize, and sustain), standardized work, takt time planning,
   variation management, and value stream mapping were implemented to a
   communication shelter production line. The implementation successfully
   won the support of the middle managers and established the foundation
   for expanding lean practices to other parts of the factory and applying

Abstract = {{The potential for oil exploration on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf
   warrants determination of an efficient method to clean up an oil spill.
   Traditional spill response equipment may not be practical in an Arctic
   environment due to the presence of ice, which would act to prevent
   proper deployment of equipment. Additionally, the areas proposed for oil
   exploration lack the infrastructure and support networks necessary to
   stage a response to a large oil spill due to their remoteness. These
   difficulties make it necessary to explore alternative means of oil spill
   cleanup. In situ burning is one method that may be particularly
   well-suited for Arctic and sub-Arctic environments due to the minimal
   amount of equipment required to achieve an efficient burn, i.e. high
   mass loss. The Arctic and sub-Arctic environments add an additional
   level of complexity by introducing a spill medium (ice) that is highly
   unstable at elevated temperatures. Our experiments sought to calculate
   the mass loss rates of oil mixtures to determine the efficiency with
   which they burn within ice channels of varying widths. An average mass
   loss rate of 0.06 g/s was recorded which translates to efficiencies of
   10\%. The dominant factor contributing to low mass loss rates was the
   melting of the channel walls which resulted in the critical thickness of
   the oil to be reached sooner. Based on the findings, in situ burning
   would not be a viable means of oil spill cleanup. Instead, it may be
   preferred to use in situ burning in conjunction with mechanical cleanup
   techniques. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems are state-of-the-art
   atmospheric models that can provide forecasts of various weather
   attributes. These forecasts are used in many applications as critical
   inputs for planning and decision making. However, NWP systems cannot
   supply any information about the uncertainty of the forecasts as their
   immediate outputs. In this paper, we investigate the application of
   Fuzzy C-means clustering as a powerful soft computing technique to
   discover classes of weather situations that follow similar forecast
   uncertainty patterns. These patterns are then utilized by distribution
   fitting methods to obtain Prediction Intervals (PIs) that can express
   the expected accuracy of the NWP system outputs. Three years of weather
   forecast records were used in a set of experiments to empirically
   evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach and the accuracy of
   the computed PIs. Results confirm that the Pis generated by the proposed
   post-processing procedure have a higher skill compared to baseline
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a method for modeling the transient radiated

   The proposed method is able to analytically model the angle-dependent

   an antenna to its transient radiated fields, and the incident transient
   fields to its output pulse. This method needs to estimate the antenna's
   aperture field distribution from time-domain antenna measurements. Using
   the proposed method, the received pulses from three different antennas-a
   ridged-horn, a dielectric loaded horn, and a Vivaldi antenna-are modeled
   and compared with the measured received pulses. A comparison of pulse
   shape, amplitude, and energy shows very good agreement. Different input
   pulses are also examined for the experimental evaluation of the proposed
   method. The method allows designers to analytically estimate the antenna
   effect on transmitted pulse enabling the inclusion of pulse distortion
   by the antenna into the ultra-wideband transceiver design.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of fuzzy information granules including the estimation
   of their membership functions play a significant role in fuzzy system
   design as well as in the design of fuzzy rule based classifiers
   (FRBCSs). However, although linguistic terms are fundamental elements in
   the process of elucidating expert's knowledge, the problem of linguistic
   term design along with their fuzzy-set-based semantics has not been
   fully addressed, since term-sets of attributes have not been interpreted
   as a formalized structure. Thus, the essential relationship between
   linguistic terms, as syntax, and the constructed fuzzy sets, as their
   quantitative semantics, or in other words, the problem of the natural
   semantics of terms behind the linguistic literal has not been addressed.
   In this paper, we introduce the problem of the design of optimal
   linguistic terms and propose a method of the design of FRBCSs which may
   incorporate with the design of linguistic terms to ensure that the
   presence of linguistic literals are supported not only by data but also
   by their natural semantics. It is shown that this problem plays a
   primordial role in enhancing the performance and,the interpretability of
   the designed FRBCSs and helps striking a better balance between the
   generality and the specificity of the desired fuzzy rule bases for fuzzy
   classification problems. A series of experiments concerning 17 Machine
   Learning datasets is reported. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces the ``order of magnitude scaling{''} (OMS)
   technique, which permits for the first time a simple computer
   implementation of the scaling (or ``ordering{''}) procedure extensively
   used in engineering. The methodology presented aims at overcoming the
   limitations of the current scaling approach, in which dominant terms are
   manually selected and tested for consistency. The manual approach cannot
   explore all combinations of potential dominant terms in problems
   represented by many coupled differential equations, thus requiring much
   judgment and experience and occasionally being unreliable. The research
   presented here introduces a linear algebra approach that enables
   unassisted exhaustive searches for scaling laws and checks for their
   self-consistency. The approach introduced is valid even if the governing
   equations are nonlinear, and is applicable to continuum mechanics
   problems in areas such as transport phenomena, dynamics, and solid
   mechanics. The outcome of OMS is a set of power laws that estimates the
   characteristic values of the unknowns in a problem (e.g., maximum
   velocity or maximum temperature variation). The significance of this
   contribution is that it extends the range of applicability of scaling
   techniques to large systems of coupled equations and brings objectivity
   to the selection of small terms, leading to simplifications. The
   methodology proposed is demonstrated using a linear oscillator and
   thermocapillary flows in welding. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006839]}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous TaN (x) thin films (14 and 62 nm) were deposited by reactive

   detailed electron microscopy and elemental depth profiling on samples
   annealed in 5 \%H-2/95 \%N-2 gas for 30 min at various temperatures
   ranging from 300 to 900 A degrees C. Amorphous TaN (x) thin films
   crystallized at 600 A degrees C to hexagonal Ta2N by a polymorphous
   transformation. Depending on film thickness, polycrystalline Ta2N
   diffusion barriers were effective up to 700-800 A degrees C. Failure
   occurred by diffusion of Cu to the Si/TaN (x) interface to form Cu3Si
   particles followed by outdiffusion of Si and formation of Cu3Si and
   TaSi2 precipitates on the outer surface. The TaN (x) barriers were
   integrated in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices (Cu/10 nm TaN (x) /26 nm
   SiO2/Si) to evaluate their electrical failure after
   bias-temperature-stress (BTS) testing using capacitance-voltage and
   current-voltage measurements. The shift in flat-band voltage and the
   leakage current were monitored before and after BTS. The electrical test
   results were compared with compositional and morphological information

Abstract = {{The AJAX paradigm encodes data exchange XML formats. Recently, JSON has
   also become a popular data exchange format. XML has numerous benefits
   including human-readable structures and self-describing data. However,
   JSON provides significant performance gains over XML due to its light
   weight nature and native support for JavaScript. This is especially
   important for Rich Internet Applications (RIA). Therefore, it is
   necessary to change the data format from XML to JSON for efficiency
   purposes. This paper presents a refactoring system (XtoJ) to safely
   assist programmers migrate existing AJAX-based applications utilizing
   XML into functionally equivalent AJAX-based applications utilizing JSON.
   We empirically demonstrate that our transformation system significantly
   improves the efficiency of AJAX applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All
