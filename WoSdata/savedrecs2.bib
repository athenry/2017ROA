Abstract = {{Helium ion microscopy has recently emerged as a potent tool for the
   in-situ modification and imaging of nanoscale devices. For example;
   finely focused helium ion beams have been used for the milling of pores
   in suspended structures. We here report the use of helium ion milling
   for the post-fabrication modification of nanostrings machined from an
   amorphous SiCN material. The modification consisted of milling linear
   arrays of holes along the length of nanostrings. This milling results in
   a slight decrease of resonant frequency while increasing the surface to
   volume ratio of the device. The frequency decrease is attributed to a
   reduction of the effective Young's modulus of the string, which in turn
   reduces the tension the string is under. Such experimental observations
   are supported by the finite element analysis of milled and non-milled
   strings.}},

Abstract = {{The corrosion, corrosive wear and dry sliding wear of nanocomposites,
   are extremely complicated and involve various chemical, physical and
   mechanical factors. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects
   of nanosized SiC content on the hardness, dry sliding wear, corrosion
   and corrosive wear of Al/SiC nanocomposites synthesized by mechanical
   milling cold pressing and hot extrusion. The corrosion resistance of
   these composites in 3\% NaCl solution was investigated by
   electrochemical polarization testing and their dry sliding as well as
   corrosive wear resistance in the same solution was evaluated using a
   pin-on-disc tester. The microstructures of the samples and their worn
   surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy. It was shown
   that the dry sliding wear and corrosion resistance of these
   nanocomposites were improved with the increase of SiC content. It was
   concluded that due to the lubrication effect of the solution, both the
   friction coefficient and frictional heat that might soften the material
   were reduced. In addition, the improved strength of the nanocomposites
   combined with their better corrosion resistance contributed to their
   increased corrosive wear resistance, compared with the base alloy. The
   prominent wear mechanism in the unreinforced alloy was adhesive wear, in
   the Al/SiC nanocomposites, the wear mechanism changed to abrasive.}},

Abstract = {{An application of H-bridges that enable soft start and power factor
   correction of cage induction machines is presented. The proposed power
   electronics employs floating capacitor H-bridges connected in series
   with utility grid and a cage induction motor to provide series voltage
   compensation. Injecting a series voltage in each phase, the proposed
   system can be used to control the motor voltage during starting and
   hence limit the motor starting current. In addition, an algorithm is
   proposed to accurately predict the worst case scenario for bridge dc
   capacitor voltage before motor starting. Thus, a dc capacitor
   overvoltage problem can be avoided. Experimental results show that the
   proposed system can successfully soft start a standard squirrel cage
   induction machine under different modes and load conditions. A simple
   representation of the worst case scenario for dc capacitor voltage
   before motor starting is established.}},

Abstract = {{In a wireless sensor network (WSN), sensors collect data that need to be
   delivered to a base station. This requires that the WSN should be a
   connected network. However, due to possible failures of sensors, a WSN
   might be partitioned into multiple isolated blocks. A solution to
   reconnect the WSN is to deploy mobile relays in the WSN and to schedule
   the mobile relays to positions that can reconnect the isolated blocks.
   In this paper, we target at a mobile relay scheduling (MRS) algorithm
   with the minimal total movement cost such that the partitioned WSN
   becomes connected. We give a definition for boundary sensors of blocks
   and show that, to connect two blocks, fewer mobile relays are used if we
   connect the two blocks through a pair of their boundary sensors. To
   connect a given pair of boundary sensors from two blocks, we derive the
   optimal new positions of mobile relays, which minimize the total energy
   consumption of mobile relays when relaying information between the two
   blocks. To connect a partitioned WSN with multiple isolated blocks, an
   MRS problem is formulated and shown to be NP-complete. Then, a greedy
   MRS algorithm is proposed to select boundary sensor pairs and reconnect
   the WSN by scheduling mobile relays to optimal new positions of
   connecting the selected boundary sensor pairs. Since the selected
   boundary sensors are gateways of blocks and the moved mobile relays
   serve as routers to connect the blocks, any failure of them may
   disconnect the WSN again. Accordingly, another greedy MRS algorithm is
   proposed to reconnect a partitioned WSN such that the reconnected WSN
   can tolerate failure of one gateway or one router. Extensive simulations
   demonstrate that the proposed algorithms have better performance over
   other existing methods in terms of higher success probability and less
   movement cost.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative wireless multicast is investigated, in which a source sends
   multicast messages to a number of users. For a multicast message from
   the source, some users do not successfully receive the message (called
   unsuccessful users). For a successful user (who successfully receives
   the message from the source), we define its worst relaying channel gain
   as the smallest channel gain among its channel gains to all unsuccessful
   users. It is proposed that the successful user whose worst relaying
   channel gain is the highest among the worst relaying channel gains of
   all successful users is selected to serve as a relay. Considering that
   the channels in the system are independent but nonidentically
   distributed Rayleigh fading, we derive a closed-form outage probability
   expression for the proposed scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme
   can achieve full diversity, and thus, having a larger number of users
   can improve the outage performance. Furthermore, we study the time
   allocation strategy that determines the durations used by the source and
   the selected relay for their transmissions, respectively. An approximate
   optimal time allocation is derived. In addition, we also investigate the
   case with relay selection error and the case with mixed Rayleigh/Rician
   fading. Simulation results verify the performance of the proposed
   cooperative multicast scheme and time allocation strategy.}},

Abstract = {{To relieve freeway congestion during peak periods, ramp metering (RM) is
   often implemented to control the input flow from onramps on freeways.
   Many studies focus on proactive coordinated RM controls; however,
   successful implementation of proactive RM control still requires a more
   accurate prediction model and a less complex control algorithm. To this
   end, this study tests a proactive RM approach in micro-simulation, with
   goals to improve network-wide travel time and traffic flow. A
   METANET-based dynamic traffic model was adopted as a prediction model
   within a predictive control framework. The evaluation revealed a 6.50\%
   amelioration in total travel time on the mainline and a 2.52\% reduction
   of total time spent in the network. The applied algorithm was compared
   with the HERO algorithm and implemented in various peak demand
   scenarios. This analysis could lead to efficient and effective field
   applications of proactive coordinated RM control to improve freeway
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{Road pavements in frost-susceptible regions are challenged by frost-thaw
   induced damages. Spring load restriction (SLR) is intended to reduce
   road distresses caused by heavily loaded truck traffic. Winter weight
   premiums (WWP) is applied during early freezing season by increasing the
   maximum allowable axle loads to reduce the economic difficulties that
   trucking industries undergo during thaw season. While there are various
   timelines for applying and removing SLR, this paper reviews three of the
   SLR prediction models along with a WWP computer simulation and verifies
   the calculations based on each method using two years of monitored field
   moisture and temperature data from the fully instrumented integrated
   road research facility (IRRF) test road in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
   The results revealed that two of the methods showed a significantly
   better performance in determining the start and end dates of SLR as
   opposed to the other method. Computer simulations obtained the pavement
   critical depth beyond which traffic loading did not affect the subgrade
   material in early freezing season, and collected data aided in
   estimating the start date of WWP application on the test road. The
   results were in good agreement with the recommendations suggested by

Abstract = {{Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) has been
   proven to be a powerful research tool to investigate in situ
   interactions between nanoparticles and different functionalized surfaces
   in liquids. QCM-D can also be used to quantitatively determine
   adsorption kinetics of polymers, DNA and proteins from solutions on
   various substrate surfaces while providing insights into conformations
   of adsorbed molecules. This review aims to provide a comprehensive
   overview on various important applications of QCM-D, focusing on
   deposition of nanoparticles and attachment-detachment of nanoparticles
   on model membranes in complex fluid systems. We will first describe the
   working principle of QCM-D and DLVO theory pertinent to understanding
   nanoparticle deposition phenomena. The interactions between different
   nanoparticles and functionalized surfaces for different application
   areas are then critically reviewed. Finally, the potential applications
   of QCM-D in other important fields are proposed and knowledge gaps are
   identified. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides insight into the mechanism of femtosecond laser
   nanosurgical attachment of cells. We have demonstrated that during the
   attachment of two retinoblastoma cells using sub-10 femtosecond laser
   pulses, with 800 nm central wavelength, the phospholipid molecules of
   both cells hemifuse and form one shared phospholipid bilayer, at the
   attachment location. In order to verify the hypothesis that hemifusion
   takes place, transmission electron microscope images of the cell
   membranes of retinoblastoma cells were taken. It is shown that at the
   attachment interface, the two cell membranes coalesce and form one
   single membrane shared by both cells. Thus, further evidence is provided
   to support the hypothesis that laser-induced ionization process led to
   an ultrafast reversible destabilization of the phospholipid layer of the
   cellular membrane, which resulted in cross-linking of the phospholipid
   molecules in each membrane. This process of hemifusion occurs throughout
   the entire penetration depth of the femtosecond laser pulse train. Thus,
   the attachment between the cells takes place across a large surface
   area, which affirms our findings of strong physical attachment between
   the cells. The femtosecond laser pulse hemifusion technique can
   potentially provide a platform for precise molecular manipulation of
   cellular membranes. Manipulation of the cellular membrane is an
   important procedure that could aid in studying diseases such as cancer;
   where the expression level of plasma proteins on the cell membrane is
   altered. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation and experimental validation of a hypersonic flat
   plate and isothermal turning wall flow were conducted in the current
   study. The investigation was based on three kinds of grids (Grid1,

   (BL, SA, and SST). Under the same initiation and different turbulence
   models, the convergence process of the friction drag coefficient C-P and
   the Stanton number St of a hypersonic flat plate flow revealed four
   results. First, the flow turbulence effect in the BL model simulation
   was responsive to C-P and St. Second, the SA and SST model simulations
   both reflected the development process of flow turbulence. Third, the
   flow turbulence effect in the SST model simulation did not gradually
   emerge until the laminar flow simulation was sufficient. Moreover, the
   SA model simulation did not exist on such obvious hysteresis. Fourth, by
   comparing C-P and St of a hypersonic flat-plate laminar simulation under
   the three grids, the errors of the calculation results of Grid2 and
   Grid3 were small.}},

Abstract = {{This work is devoted to the development and verification of a new
   intrinsic-based subgrid model for moving char particles gasifying in a
   hot flue gas or syngas environments consisting of CO2/H2O/CO species.
   The distinguishing feature of our model relative to the submodels
   published in the literature is that it takes into account the thermal
   and chemical nonequilibrium between the particle's surface and its
   center. Thus, our model is able to predict temperature and species
   gradients inside the particles. The main focus of the new submodel is to
   demonstrate the crucial role of intrinsic-based heterogeneous reactions
   in the adequate prediction of carbon conversion rates for char particles
   gasification in fixed-bed and fluidized-bed gasifiers. The new model is
   verified against steady-state, particle-resolved computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD)-based, three-dimensional simulations carried out for
   different volume fractions of solid phase in a control volume (CV).
   Acceptable agreement has been demonstrated. Finally, to demonstrate our
   new model's predictions, we carried out several unsteady simulations for
   different ambient temperatures and Reynolds numbers. The importance of
   simultaneous change of char porosity and particles size during
   gasification has been demonstrated for different regimes indicated by
   the Damkohler numbers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method to predict the deflection of a flexible
   needle inserted into soft tissue based on the observation of deflection
   at a single point along the needle shaft.
   We model the needle-tissue as a discretized structure composed of
   several virtual, weightless, rigid links connected by virtual helical
   springs whose stiffness coefficient is found using a pattern search
   algorithm that only requires the force applied at the needle tip during
   insertion and the needle deflection measured at an arbitrary insertion
   depth. Needle tip deflections can then be predicted for different
   insertion depths.
   Verification of the proposed method in synthetic and biological tissue
   shows a deflection estimation error of 2 mm for images acquired at 35 \%
   or more of the maximum insertion depth, and decreases to 1 mm for images
   acquired closer to the final insertion depth. We also demonstrate the
   utility of the model for prostate brachytherapy, where in vivo needle
   deflection measurements obtained during early stages of insertion are
   used to predict the needle deflection further along the insertion
   process.
   The method can predict needle deflection based on the observation of
   deflection at a single point. The ultrasound probe can be maintained at
   the same position during insertion of the needle, which avoids
   complications of tissue deformation caused by the motion of the
   ultrasound probe.}},

   Construction Labor Productivity Models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Construction labor productivity (CLP) is affected by numerous
   context-sensitive influencing variables made up of subjective and
   objective factors, practices, and work sampling proportions (WSPs),
   which cause complex variability. Modeling CLP is challenging because for
   any given context, the complex impacts of multiple variables have to be
   considered simultaneously, without sacrificing accuracy or
   interpretability. Such challenges are addressed in this paper through
   the development of a methodology that explicitly represents context in
   CLP modeling and optimizes context-specific CLP models in order to
   improve accuracy. In addition, interpretable, fuzzy inference system
   (FIS)-based, and context-specific CLP models have been developed for the
   purpose of modeling concrete pouring activity. The performance of the
   context-specific CLP models is then compared with a generic CLP model,
   which is developed by combining the context-specific data sets. The
   results of the investigation showed that the key variables vary between
   the studied contexts and that the respective context-specific models
   have better prediction accuracy than the generic one. This study
   contributes to the body of knowledge in construction project management
   by demonstrating the essential role of context in the CLP model
   development process using context attributes, which provide a useful
   approach for characterizing existing CLP models and facilitate the use
   and adaptation of existing CLP models in new project contexts. In
   addition, this study presents a series of highly interpretable,
   context-specific CLP models to predict labor productivity in various
   building project contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonate reservoirs hold significant reserves of heavy crude oil that
   can be recovered by nonthermal processes. Chemical-enhanced oil recovery
   from oil-wet carbonate reservoirs has focused on the use of surfactants
   to change wettability and enhance imbibition into the matrix; however,
   the fractured nature of carbonate formations makes oil recovery a
   challenging process. Recently, developments in foam/polymer-enhanced
   foam (PEF) injection for heavy oil recovery application have come about,
   but the process of PEF for carbonate reservoirs is still not fully
   understood. This paper introduced a new approach to accessing the heavy
   oil from fractured carbonate reservoirs. foam/PEF was used to decrease
   oil saturation after surfactant flooding. Three types of surfactants
   (nonionic, anionic, and cationic) were used for both surfactant and foam
   flooding. A specially designed fractured micromodel representing a
   porous media system was used to visualize pore-scale phenomena. In
   addition, the static performances of foam/PEF were analyzed in the
   presence of heavy crude oil. The results showed that in both static and
   dynamic studies, the PEF had higher stability than the foam. Nonionic
   surfactant generated the least stable foam in the presence of crude oil.
   Surfactant flooding slightly increased the oil recovery from matrix
   after water injection. This was more evident in the case of cationic
   surfactant with highest imbibition rate. Observation through this study
   proved that stable foam/PEF bubbles can significantly push the injected
   fluid toward untouched parts of the porous media and increased the oil
   recovery. Due to the liquid viscosity enhancement and bubble stability
   improvement, the effectiveness of PEF in heavy oil sweep efficiency was
   much higher than that of conventional foams. PEF bubbles generated an
   additional force to divert surfactant/polymer into the matrix.}},

   the impregnation of progesterone into the PHBV particles at different
   impregnation times. In vitro release tests showed that the half-time of

   produced with impregnation times of 2-32h, was 3-5h, with the higher
   release times generally related to smaller impregnation times.}},

Title = {{Robust Energy Management of a Hybrid Wind and Flywheel Energy Storage
   System Considering Flywheel Power Losses Minimization and Grid-Code

Abstract = {{The maximum power and power ramp rate are important grid codes for
   integrating renewable energy resources in transmission systems. The
   power curtailment regulates the maximum power and ramp rate; however,
   adding an energy storage system (ESS) can time shift surplus wind energy
   instead of curtailing it. The flywheel energy storage system (FESS) has
   the advantages of high efficiency and long lifetime; however, it has
   non-negligible standby losses and its lifetime is reduced exponentially
   as the rotating speed increases. Considering such practical constraints,
   this work presents an energy management system (EMS) for a hybrid power
   system composed of a wind farm with a FESS. The FESS time shifts the
   surplus wind energy to respect the grid codes and reduce wind
   curtailment; meanwhile, the EMS aims at minimizing the FESS standby
   losses and boosting its lifetime using the predicted wind power data.
   The EMS is composed of two controllers. The first controller is a linear
   model predictive controller that defines the long-term FESS power
   set-point. The second controller is a real-time adaptive hysteresis
   controller that compensates for the wind-power prediction error.
   Comparative simulation studies and hardware-in-the-loop test results
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS in reducing the FESS
   losses while respecting the grid integration code constraints.}},

Title = {{Investigating the change in surface acoustic wave velocity due to the
   change in adhesion of a SU-8 thin film using a SU-8/AlN/Si SAW sensor}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND ADHESIVES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the change in surface acoustic wave (SAW) phase
   velocity due to the change in adhesion of a SU-8 thin film using an
   Aluminum Nitride (AlN)/Silicon (Si) SAW sensor. The variation in the
   stress field at the SU-8/AlN interface at different levels of SU-8
   adhesion is also investigated and correlated to the change in SAW phase
   velocity. A theoretical model is developed to determine the change in
   wave dispersion profile due to the change in adhesion of the SU-8 film
   on the surface of the AlN/Si sensor. The interface of the SU-8/AlN
   layers is represented by a layer of massless springs with interface
   stiffness K(N/m(3)). The results illustrate that as the adhesion of the
   SU-8 film weakens on the surface of the AlN/Si SAW sensor the velocity
   dispersion profiles fluctuate. The calculated stress field at the
   SU-8/AlN interface also fluctuates because the weakened interface cannot
   sustain the increased stress due to the confinement of the wave near the
   interface. Therefore, the mode of wave propagation varies between the
   perfect bond case where the SU-8 layer is perfectly bonded to the AlN/Si
   surface and when the SU-8 is completely de bonded. Four SAW sensor
   designs operating in the frequency range of 84-208 MHz are developed to
   measure the shift in the center frequency values and the corresponding
   change in SAW phase velocities due to the change in adhesion of the SU-8
   layer. The adhesion of the SU-8 film on the surface of the AlN/Si SAW
   sensor is changed by using different adhesion layers. The adhesion
   layers used are a gold film and an omnicoat coated gold film. Omnicoat
   is an adhesion promoter used to improve the adhesion of SU-8. The
   results illustrate that as the adhesion of the SU-8 film improves for
   the sensors with omnicoat the wave velocity shifts to a lower value. The
   wave velocity values are fitted with the wave dispersion profiles for
   different values of the interface spring stiffness K. The interface
   spring stiffness values for the SAW sensors with omnicoat coated gold
   and gold films are 8.1 x 10(9) N/m(3) and 7.95 x 10(9) N/m(3),
   respectively. The use of omnicoat improves the adhesion of the SU-8 film
   and corresponds to a higher interface spring stiffness value. The stress
   and displacement fields generated in the SU-8 layer for different values
   of the interface spring stiffness K are plotted. The results illustrate
   that as the adhesion of the SU-8 layer improves the stress transmitted
   to the SU-8 layer increases and the wave is more confined in the SU-8
   layer, which justifies the drop in wave velocity since the Rayleigh wave
   velocity in SU-8 is much lower in comparison to AlN and Silicon; 1166,
   5600, 5000 m/s, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper develops a hybrid simulation approach that integrates a
   dynamic default tree (DFT) and discrete-time Bayesian network (DTBN) to
   support tunnel boring machine (TBM) performance prediction and
   diagnosis. A causal network model consisting of 20 nodes is built to
   simulate shield cutter head failure over time during the TBM operation.
   A total of three indicators, namely, T10, T20, and mean time to failure
   (MTTF), are proposed to transfer the complicated probability
   distribution into a specific and useful number to explicitly measure the
   performance level of system unreliability. One of the tunneling projects
   recently completed in the Wuhan metro system in China has been selected
   as a case study to verify the applicability of the developed approach.
   The results indicate that the developed approach is capable of
   performing not only a feedforward analysis for the estimation of the TBM
   performance, but also feedback analysis, given that a low performance or
   failure is observed. This approach provides a powerful potential
   solution to modeling and analyzing various kinds of system component
   behaviors and interactions in a complex project environment.}},

Abstract = {{Modern networks are typically designed to be survivable for
   single-failure scenarios only. While there does exist some inherent
   dual-failure survivability, resource limitations generally mean dual
   failures are not fully protected or restored; there is some nonzero
   level of unavailability arising due to dual failures. Understanding the
   complexities of dual-failure related availability, therefore, is an
   important issue in network design. There are a number of current
   approaches for evaluating network availability, whether directly, by
   calculating service path unavailability, or indirectly, via several
   widely used availability metrics. However, their performance is not as
   effective as widely believed. After investigating current availability
   methods, this paper proposes a new method to calculate network service
   unavailability. An ILP model framework is also built to qualify the new
   method and evaluate current and new availability analysis methods.
   Experiments are performed on four test-case networks of various
   topologies and scales.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered suspensions of nanosized particles (nanofluids) may be
   characterized by enhanced thermal properties. Due to the increasing need
   for ultrahigh performance cooling systems, nanofluids have been recently
   investigated as next-generation coolants for car radiators. However, the
   multiscale nature of nanofluids implies nontrivial relations between
   their design characteristics and the resulting thermophysical
   properties, which are far from being fully understood. In this work, the
   role of fundamental heat and mass transfer mechanisms governing
   thermo-physical properties of nanofluids is reviewed, both from
   experimental and theoretical point of view. Particular focus is devoted
   to highlight the advantages of using nanofluids as coolants for
   automotive heat exchangers, and a number of design guidelines are
   reported for balancing thermal conductivity and viscosity enhancement in
   nanofluids. We hope that this review may help further the translation of
   nanofluid technology from small-scale research laboratories to
   industrial application in the automotive sector. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A major challenge in the assessment of intersegmental spinal column
   angles during trunk motion is the inherent error in recording the
   movement of bony anatomical landmarks caused by soft tissue artifacts
   (STAs). This study aims to perform an uncertainty analysis and estimate
   the typical errors induced by STA into the intersegmental angles of a
   multisegment spinal column model during trunk bending in different
   directions by modeling the relative displacement between skin-mounted
   markers and actual bony landmarks during trunk bending. First, we
   modeled the maximum displacement of markers relative to the bony
   landmarks with a multivariate Gaussian distribution. In order to
   estimate the distribution parameters, we measured these relative
   displacements on five subjects at maximum trunk bending posture. Then,
   in order to model the error depending on trunk bending angle, we assumed
   that the error grows linearly as a function of the bending angle.
   Second, we applied our error model to the trunk motion measurement of 11
   subjects to estimate the corrected trajectories of the bony landmarks
   and investigate the errors induced into the intersegmental angles of a
   multisegment spinal column model. For this purpose, the trunk was
   modeled as a seven-segment rigid-body system described using 23
   reflective markers placed on various bony landmarks of the spinal
   column. Eleven seated subjects performed trunk bending in five
   directions and the three-dimensional (3D) intersegmental angles during
   trunk bending were calculated before and after error correction. While
   STA minimally affected the intersegmental angles in the sagittal plane
   (<16\%), it considerably corrupted the intersegmental angles in the
   coronal (error ranged from 59\% to 551\%) and transverse (up to 161\%)
   planes. Therefore, we recommend using the proposed error suppression
   technique for STA-induced error compensation as a tool to achieve more
   accurate spinal column kinematics measurements. Particularly, for
   intersegmental rotations in the coronal and transverse planes that have
   small range and are highly sensitive to measurement errors, the proposed
   technique makes the measurement more appropriate for use in clinical
   decision-making processes.}},

Title = {{Regional Flood Frequency Analysis using Support Vector Regression under
   historical and future climate}},

Abstract = {{Regional Flood Frequency Analysis (RFFA) is a statistical method widely
   used to estimate flood quantiles of catchments with limited streamflow
   data. In addition, to estimate the flood quantile of ungauged sites,
   there could be only a limited number of stations with complete dataset
   are available from hydrologically similar, surrounding catchments.
   Besides traditional regression based RFFA methods, recent applications
   of machine learning algorithms such as the artificial neural network
   (ANN) have shown encouraging results in regional flood quantile
   estimations. Another novel machine learning technique that is becoming
   widely applicable in the hydrologic community is the Support Vector
   Regression (SVR). In this study, an RFFA model based on SVR was
   developed to estimate regional flood quantiles for two study areas, one
   with 26 catchments located in southeastern British Columbia (BC) and
   another with 23 catchments located in southern Ontario (ON), Canada. The
   SVR-RFFA model for both study sites was developed from 13 sets of
   physiographic and climatic predictors for the historical period. The Ef
   (Nash Sutcliffe coefficient) and R-2 of the SVR-RFFA model was about 0.7
   when estimating flood quantiles of 10, 25, 50 and 100 year return
   periods which indicate satisfactory model performance in both study
   areas. In addition, the SVR-RFFA model also performed well based on
   other goodness-of-fit statistics such as BIAS (mean bias) and BIASr
   (relative BIAS). If the amount of data available for training RFFA
   models is limited, the SVR-RFFA model was found to perform better than
   an ANN based RFFA model, and with significantly lower median
   CV(coefficient of variation) of the estimated flood quantiles. The
   SVR-RFFA model was then used to project changes in flood quantiles over
   the two study areas under the impact of climate change using the RCP4.5
   and RCP8.5 climate projections of five Coupled Model Intercomparison
   Project (CMIP5) GCMs (Global Climate Models) for the 2041-2100 period.
   The results suggest that due to a projected increase in the mean annual
   precipitation, and rainfall of a given return period, the flood quantile
   is projected to increase by about 7\% for the southeastern BC and 29\%
   for southern ON region in the mid- and late 21st century. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Based on the lifting technique, the lifted state space model and the

   for both identification and control purposes due to the causality
   constraint and the model complexity. To solve this problem, a novel
   model of NUSD systems is proposed by introducing a time-varying backward
   shift operator. The proposed model is more concise in structure and has
   fewer parameters than the lifted models, using which the traditional
   identification methods and control strategies of single-rate systems can
   be easily extended to NUSD systems. The advantages and effectiveness of
   the proposed model are well illustrated by a simulation example. (C)

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{7-14}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The conversion of biomass for the production of liquid fuels can help
   reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are predominantly
   generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. Oxymethylene ethers (OMEs)
   are a series of liquid fuel additives that can be obtained from syngas,
   which is produced from the gasification of biomass. The blending of OMEs
   in conventional diesel fuel can reduce soot formation during combustion
   in a diesel engine. In this research, a process for the production of
   OMEs from woody biomass has been simulated. The process consists of
   several unit operations including biomass gasification, syngas cleanup,
   methanol production, and conversion of methanol to OMEs. The methodology
   involved the development of process models, the identification of the
   key process parameters affecting OME production based on the process
   model, and the development of an optimal process design for high OME
   yields. It was found that up to 9.02 tonnes day(-1) of OME3, OME4, and
   OME3 (which are suitable as diesel additives) can be produced from 277.3
   tonnes day(-1) of wet woody biomass. Furthermore, an optimal combination
   of the parameters, which was generated from the developed model, can
   greatly enhance OME production and thermodynamic efficiency. This model
   can further be used in a techno-economic assessment of the whole biomass
   conversion chain to produce OMEs. The results of this study can be
   helpful for petroleum-based fuel producers and policy makers in
   determining the most attractive pathways of converting bio-resources
   into liquid fuels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A process model was developed to determine the net energy ratio (NER)
   for the production of pellets from steam pretreated agricultural residue
   (wheat straw) and energy crops (i.e., switchgrass in this case). The NER
   is a ratio of the net energy output to the total net energy input from
   non-renewable energy sources into a system. Scenarios were developed to
   measure the effects of temperature and level of steam pretreatment on
   the NER of steam pretreated wheat straw and switchgrass pellets. The
   NERs for the base case at 6 kg h(-1) are 1.76 and 1.37 for
   steam-pretreated wheat straw and switchgrass-based pellets,
   respectively. The reason behind the difference is that more energy is
   required to dry switch grass pellets than wheat straw pellets. The
   sensitivity analysis for the model shows that the optimum temperature
   for steam pretreatment is 160 degrees C with 50\% pretreatment (i.e. 50
   \% steam treated material is blended with the raw biomass and then
   pelletised). The uncertainty results for NER for steam pretreated wheat
   straw and switch grass pellets are 1.62 +/- 0.10 and 1.42 +/- 0.11,

   carbon in ionic liquid supercapacitors}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{161-169}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Carbonized cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) have been employed to improve the
   rate performance of activated carbon (AC) traditionally used in
   supercapacitors. Because of the large amount of surface functionalities,
   CNF form strongly interconnected composite with AC, which turns into a
   free-standing carbon nanofibers/AC film after carbonization. In the
   film, the carbon nanofibers are `welded' on AC particles and integrate
   them into one piece of carbon. The interaction between AC and carbon
   nanofibers, originating from the strong AC-nanocellulose affinity, is
   much stronger than the traditional physically mixed AC/nanocarbon
   composite and also significantly reduces the contact resistance in the
   composite. Conductive atomic force microscope (C-AFM) analysis reveals
   that the network of carbonized CNF possesses markedly better electron
   transport efficiency than the AC particles. When tested as
   supercapacitor electrode at commercial level mass loading, the composite
   film exhibits 2 times slower capacitance fading at high current and 3
   times higher maximum power density than the bare AC. In addition, using
   the nano cellulose, which is derived from renewable resources, increases
   the total electrode cost only by a small margin, thereby making the
   composite a competitive electrode material for electricity storage on a
   large scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this work, an event-based optimal state estimation problem for
   linear-time varying systems with unknown inputs is investigated. By
   treating the unknown input as a process with a non-informative prior,
   the event-based minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is obtained
   in a recursive form. It is shown that for the general time-varying case,
   the closed-loop matrix of the optimal event-based estimator is
   exponentially stable and the estimation error covariance matrix is
   asymptotically bounded for each sample path of the event-triggering
   process. The results are also extended to the multiple sensor scenario,
   where each sensor is allowed to have its own event-triggering condition.
   The efficiency of the proposed results is illustrated by a numerical
   example and comparative simulation with the MMSE estimators obtained
   based on time-triggered measurements. The results are potentially
   applicable to event-based secure state estimation of cyber-physical
   systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   techniques were used to conduct microscopic water flooding experiments.
   A novel classification criterion for residual oil during the water
   flooding process was established as follows: contiguous type, branched
   type, oil film type, columnar type, and droplet type. Correlations
   between the five types of residual oil saturation and water-cut were
   established. Also, the recovery improving potential for different
   production strategies have been investigated by water flooding
   experiments. The relationship between various types of residual oil
   saturation and injection velocity were obtained, with the former
   residual oil saturation decreasing to 16.09\% during the injection
   process when the velocity was increased from 0.05 mL/min to 0.5 mL/min.
   However, with an increase in injection velocity, the saturation of
   contiguous residual oil type decreased first and then stabilized. The
   saturation of branched oil type monotonically decreased, but saturation
   of droplet oil type monotonically increased. Residual oil saturations
   were 22.62\% and 9.69\% before and after altering injection direction,
   respectively, which means residual oil recovery was increased by
   12.93\%. Some places were considered to be `'dead oil regions'' before
   altering injection direction with most of the contiguous and branched
   type residual oil in these areas been displaced out by altering
   injection direction. Altering the injection direction is a more
   effective method of enhancing oil recovery than improving injection
   velocity when the same volume of water is injected. The proposed method
   and prediction correlations were presented in this paper to provide a
   novel means to predict oil recovery and residual oil saturation types
   for water flooding reservoirs, which have strong plane and weak vertical
   heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Efficient mining of class association rules with the itemset constraint}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{73-88}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Mining class association rules (CARs) with the itemset constraint is
   concerned with the discovery of rules, which contain a set of specific
   items in the rule antecedent and a class label in the rule consequent.
   This task is commonly encountered in mining medical data. For example,
   when classifying which section of the population is at high risk for the
   HIV infection, epidemiologists often concentrate on rules which include
   demographic information such as gender, age, and marital status in the
   rule antecedent, and HIV-Positive in the rule consequent. There are two
   naive strategies to solve this problem, namely pre-processing and
   post-processing. The post-processing methods have to generate and
   consider a huge number of candidate CARs while the performance of the
   pre-processing methods depend on the number of records filtered out.
   Therefore, such approaches are time consuming. This study proposes an
   efficient method for mining CARs with the itemset constraint based on a
   lattice structure and the difference between two sets of object
   identifiers (diffset). Firstly, a lattice structure is built to store
   all frequent item sets in the dataset. To reduce memory usage, instead
   of the entire set of object identifiers, the diffset is used. Secondly,
   the lattice is traversed to generate only rules which satisfy the
   itemset constraint. The experimental results show that the proposed
   algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of both the mining time
   and memory usage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   this uniformity depend on the Burgers vector, the location of the screw

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is one of the most common impurities in silicon (Si). To
   investigate the effects of P on the mechanical properties of Si at nano
   or atomic scale, the second-nearest-neighbor Modified Embedded Atom
   Method model (2NN MEAM) potentials for pure P and Si-P binary system are
   developed using genetic algorithm (GA). The reference physical
   properties for the parameterization for pure P include cohesive
   energies, lattice constants, bulk moduli and first order pressure
   derivatives of experimentally-existing phases. The van der Waals
   interactions in P are not considered since it's beyond the description
   of MEAM and it's less important in covalently bonded Si-P compounds. For
   Si-P binary system, cohesive or formation energies, lattice constants
   and elastic constants of typical Si-P structures, properties of point
   defects and P-vacancy pairs are considered. The robustness of the newly
   developed potentials is examined by testing the thermal stability and
   transformation from non-equilibrium to ordered phase. The effects of P
   on the tensile behaviors of bulk Si are demonstrated. Results show that
   phosphorus lowers the fracture threshold and stiffness of bulk Si. (C)

Abstract = {{In the present study, ejecta dynamics techniques are used to investigate
   the ballistic response of shear thickening particle suspensions as a
   means of assessing the particle hardness and the role of interparticle
   friction during penetration. Through particle material variations, the
   role of particle material strength is discussed primarily through the
   ratio of the total lateral to total axial kinetic energy of the ejecta
   field at increasing impact velocities. Two dominant trends are observed
   in the relation between this ratio of kinetic energy and impact
   velocity, which are attributed to the properties of the suspended
   particles. A qualitative model of particle fracture and deformation is
   proposed to account for the experimental observations. The results of
   analytical particle strain estimates and computational discrete element
   modelling of impact ejecta are used to inform the model and discuss the

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the interconnection of current-source converters
   (CSCs) to a very weak grid using the conventional vector control in the

   controllers are proposed and integrated to the outermost control loops
   of the CSC to alleviate the associated negative impacts of the PLL. The
   proposed compensators do not alter the dynamic characteristics of the
   conventional vector control. More importantly, they enable the CSC to
   inject 1.0 per-unit of active power at a unity short-circuit ratio.
   Small-signal stability analysis and controllers design procedures are
   presented in details. The design of the proposed compensators is
   independent of the conventional vector control and hence no extensive

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique is employed

   region of the liquid pool is dominated by a pair of counter-rotating

   of the pool where the flow velocity is uniformly low in value. Also, by
   decreasing the temperature at the bottom of the pool, the size of

Abstract = {{The high penetration level of power electronics interfaced distributed
   generation (DG) systems creates great ancillary services potential
   through the DG interfacing converters, such as the grid unbalanced
   voltage compensation. However, the unbalanced voltage compensation may
   cause adverse effects on the DGs' operation, such as output active power
   oscillation and dc-link voltage variations. Moreover, since the
   compensation is realized through the available rating of DGs'
   interfacing converters, it is equally important to consider the
   effectiveness of control strategy for unbalanced voltage compensation.
   Considering these challenging issues, two grid unbalanced voltage
   compensation strategies for three-phase power electronics interfaced DG
   systems are proposed in this paper. Especially, the first control
   strategy aims at minimizing the DG's active power oscillation and
   reducing the adverse effects of unbalanced voltage compensation on DG's
   operation. The second control strategy focuses on the effectiveness of
   unbalanced voltage compensation by controlling DG's negative sequence
   current to be inphase with the grid negative sequence current.
   Performances of the two proposed control strategies under different grid
   conditions and DG operating conditions are studied, and recommendations
   for appropriate control strategy utilization under various conditions
   are provided. Finally, validity of the proposed strategies is verified
   by both simulations and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, pendant drop techniques and molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulations were employed to investigate the effect of asphaltene
   concentrations on the interfacial tension (IFT) of the oil/water
   interface. Here, oil and asphaltene were represented by, respectively,
   common organic solvents and Violanthrone-79, and two types of
   concentration, i.e., bulk concentration and surface concentration, were
   examined. Correlations between the IFTs from experiments and MD
   simulations revealed that surface concentration, rather than the
   commonly used bulk concentration, determines the reduction of oil/water
   IFTs. Through analyzing the hydrogen bonding, the underlying mechanism
   for the IFT reduction was proposed. Our discussions here not only enable
   the direct comparison between experiments and MD simulations on the IFTs
   but also help with future interfacial studies using combined
   experimental and simulation approaches. The methodologies used in this
   work can be extended to many other oil/water interfaces in the presence
   of interfacially active compounds.}},

   the THz pulse. Additionally, ZGP is shown to have excellent phase
   matching between an optical probe pulse and a THz pulse. For a 1080 mu m
   thick ZGP crystal, this phase matching yields a detection bandwidth 1.3
   times greater than ZnTe and 4.8 times greater than ZnSe and GaP. Thus,
   ZGP has promising applications in THz time-domain spectroscopy.

Abstract = {{The separation of classical, aromatic, oxidized, and heteroatomic
   (sulfur-containing) naphthenic acid (NA) species from unprocessed and
   ozone-treated oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) was performed
   using silver-ion (Ag-ion) solid phase extraction (SPE) without the
   requirement of pre-methylation for NAs. OSPW samples before SPE and SPE
   fractions were characterized using ultra performance liquid
   chromatography ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (UPLC-IM-TOFMS) to corroborate the separation of distinct NA species.
   The mass spectrum identification applied a mass tolerance of +/- 1.5 mDa
   due to the mass errors of NAs were measured within this range, allowing
   the identification of O2S-NAs from O-2-NAs. Moreover, separated NA
   species facilitated the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
   characterization of NA compounds due to the removal of matrix and a
   simplified composition. MS/MS results showed that classical, aromatic,
   oxidized, and sulfur-containing NA compounds were eluted into individual
   SPE fractions. Overall results indicated that the separation of NA
   species using Ag-ion SPE is a valuable method for extracting individual
   NA species that are of great interest for environmental toxicology and
   wastewater treatment research, to conduct species-specific studies.
   Furthermore, the separated NA species on the milligram level could be
   widely used as the standard materials for environmental monitoring of
   NAs from various contamination sites.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiencies of a number of electrochemical devices (e.g., fuel
   cells and metal-air batteries) are mainly governed by the kinetics of
   the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Among all the good ORR catalysts,
   the partially substituted double perovskite oxide (AA'B2O5+delta) has
   the unique layered structure, providing a great flexibility regarding
   the optimization of its electronic structures and physicochemical
   properties. Here, it is demonstrated that the double perovskite oxide,
   i.e., NdBa0.75Ca0.25Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta, is a good ORR catalyst at both
   room and elevated temperatures. Under ambient condition, its half-wave
   potential of ORR in alkaline media is as low as 0.74 V versus RHE; at
   650 degrees C, the cathodic polarization resistance is merely 0.0276
   Omega cm(2) according to a symmetric cell measurement, whereas the solid
   oxide fuel cells using this cathode exhibit a maximum power density of
   1982 mW cm(-2). From various materials characterizations, it is
   hypothesized that its excellent ORR activity is strongly correlated with
   the crystallographic, electronic, and defect structures of the
   materials.}},

Title = {{Investigating Default Mode and Sensorimotor Network Connectivity in
   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative condition
   characterized by degeneration of upper motor neurons (UMN) arising from
   the motor cortex in the brain and lower motor neurons (LMN) in the
   brainstem and spinal cord. Cerebral changes create differences in brain
   activity captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   including the spontaneous and simultaneous activity occurring between
   regions known as the resting state networks (RSNs). Progressive
   neurodegeneration as observed in ALS may lead to a disruption of RSNs
   which could provide insights into the disease process. Previous studies
   have reported conflicting findings of increased, decreased, or unaltered
   RSN functional connectivity in ALS and do not report the contribution of
   UMN changes to RSN connectivity. We aimed to bridge this gap by
   exploring two networks, the default mode network (DMN) and the
   sensorimotor network (SMN), in 21 ALS patients and 40 age-matched
   healthy volunteers. An UMN score dichotomized patients into UMN+ and
   UMN-groups. Subjects underwent resting state fMRI scan on a high field
   MRI operating at 4.7 tesla. The DMN and SMN changes between subject
   groups were compared. Correlations between connectivity and clinical
   measures such as the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R),
   disease progression rate, symptom duration, UMN score and finger tapping
   were assessed. Significant group differences in resting state networks
   between patients and controls were absent, as was the dependence on
   degree of UMN burden. However, DMN connectivity was increased in
   patients with greater disability and faster progression rate, and SMN
   connectivity was reduced in those with greater motor impairment. These
   patterns of association are in line with literature supporting loss of
   inhibitory interneurons.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are disordered regions
   that serve as flexible linkers/spacers in multi-domain proteins or
   between structured constituents in domains. They are different from
   flexible linkers/residues because they are disordered and longer.
   Availability of experimentally annotated DFLs provides an opportunity to
   build high-throughput computational predictors of these regions from
   protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods that
   directly predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering
   predicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder.
   Results: We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a
   first-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method
   outputs propensity to form DFLs for each residue in the input sequence.
   DFLpred uses a small set of empirically selected features that quantify
   propensities to form certain secondary structures, disordered regions
   and structured regions, which are processed by a fast linear model. Our
   high-throughput predictor can be used on the whole-proteome scale; it
   needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single CPU. When assessed on
   an independent test dataset with low sequence-identity proteins, it
   secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal
   0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the
   prediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically
   disordered residues and various combinations of these methods.
   Prediction on the complete human proteome reveals that about 10\% of
   proteins have a large content of over 30\% DFL residues. We also
   estimate that about 6000 DFL regions are long with >= 30 consecutive
   residues.}},

Abstract = {{In liquid phase autoxidation Of hydrocarbons, oxygen availability in the
   liquid phase affects reaction rate and product selectivity. Instead of
   relying on engineering predictions, this work set out to measure in situ
   oxygen availability in the liquid phase under oxidation conditions. This
   was achieved by employing an oxygen sensitive material submersed in the
   liquid and measuring the change in fluorescence decay with a
   fluorometet. Mass transfer coefficients (k(L)) of oxygen in benzene and
   in indan were 3.0 x 10(-6) and 1.3 x 10(-6) +/- 0.1 x 10(-6) m/s,
   respectively, at 50 degrees C and 19.2 kPa O-2 partial pressure. This
   enabled the calculation of the maximum oxygen transfer rate and it
   matched the experimental observations well. Liquid phase oxygen content
   increased until the oxygen transfer rate and the oxygen consumption rate
   were balanced, i.e. reached dynamic equilibrium. At high Oxygen
   consumption rate, the oxygen in the liquid phase was consumed and the
   oxygen consumption rate matched the maximum oxygen transfer rate. These
   changes could be monitored in situ over time during oxidation, It was
   further found that liquid phase oxidation violated key assumptions
   underlying engineering predictions based on the Hatta number. Notably,
   the kinetic constant for oxygen consumption changed with time, oxidation
   did not reach ``steady state{''}, and the relationship between oxygen

Abstract = {{Hydrogen is a key input to industrial processes. In western Canada,
   there is a significant demand for hydrogen for industrial purposes, both
   to upgrade bitumen and as a chemical agent. The key driver for this
   research is the need to assess options for the energy industry to lower
   its carbon footprint by using hydrogen produced from renewable sources.
   The environmental impacts associated with hydrogen production through
   water electrolysis using the electricity generated from a wind power
   plant are evaluated in this paper. A life cycle assessment was done to
   determine the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit mass of produced
   hydrogen by considering the emissions starting from the extraction of
   wind energy to the production of hydrogen. An uncertainty analysis was
   conducted to assess the effects of variations of different input
   parameters on the GHG footprint of hydrogen produced from wind. The
   total GHG emissions of a wind-based hydrogen production plant are
   estimated to be 0.68 +/- 0.05 kg CO2 eq./kg H-2, 65\% of which are from
   the construction of the wind power system. The results are compared with
   those of conventional fossil fuel-based systems. The overall GHG
   emissions from wind-based hydrogen production are about 94\% lower than
   those associated with hydrogen production through steam methane
   reforming (SMR). Natural gas-based hydrogen production emissions are
   mainly found in the plant operation stage. For wind-to-hydrogen systems,
   the manufacturing and installation of the systems have significant
   environmental impacts. However, the hydrogen produced from wind energy
   can significantly reduce the GHG footprint of the energy industry. (C)

Title = {{Reduced Right Ventricular Native Myocardial T-1 in Anderson-Fabry
   Disease: Comparison to Pulmonary Hypertension and Healthy Controls}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is characterized by progressive multiorgan
   accumulation of intracellular sphingolipids due to a-galactosidase A
   enzyme deficiency, resulting in progressive ventricular hypertrophy,
   heart failure, arrhythmias, and death. Decreased native (non-contrast)
   left ventricular (LV) T-1 (longitudinal relaxation time) with MRI
   discriminates AFD from healthy controls or other presentations of
   concentric hypertrophy, but the right ventricle (RV) has not been
   studied. The aims of the current study were to evaluate native RV T-1
   values in AFD, with a goal of better understanding the pathophysiology
   of RV involvement.
   Methods and Results
   Native T-1 values were measured in the inferior RV wall (RVI),
   interventricular septum (IVS), and inferior LV (LVI) in patients with
   AFD, patients with pulmonary hypertension, who provided an alternative
   RV pathological process for comparison, and healthy controls. A minimum
   wall thickness of 4 mm was selected to minimize partial volume errors in
   tissue T-1 analysis. T-1 analysis was performed in 6 subjects with AFD,
   6 subjects with PH, and 21 controls. Native T-1 values were shorter
   (adjusted p<0.05 for all comparisons), independent of location, in
   subjects with AFD (RVI-T-1 = 1096 +/- 49 ms, IVS-T-1 = 1053 +/- 41 ms,
   LVI-T-1 = 1072 +/- 44 ms) compared to both PH (RVI-T-1 = 1239 +/- 41 ms,
   IVS-T-1 = 1280 +/- 123 ms, LVI-T-1 = 1274 +/- 57 ms) and HC (IVS-T-1 =
   1180 +/- 60 ms, LVI-T-1 = 1183 +/- 45 ms). RVI measurements were not
   possible in controls due to insufficient wall thickness.
   Conclusion
   Native T-1 values appear similarly reduced in the left and right
   ventricles of individuals with AFD and RV wall thickening, suggesting a
   common pathology. In contrast, individuals with PH and thickened RVs
   showed increased native T-1 values in both ventricles, suggestive of
   fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{Nanohybrid polymer electrolytes (NHPE) with ceramic particles have
   attracted significant attention owing to their improvement in
   electrochemical performance. However, particle aggregation and weak
   nanoparticle/polymer matrix interaction restrict their further
   application in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We demonstrate a facile
   in-situ polymerization/crystallization method to synthesize a
   homogeneous TiO2-grafted NHPE with a cross-linked branching structure,
   comprised of ion-conducting poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether
   methacrylate (PEGMEM) and non-polar stearyl methacrylate (SMA). This
   technique is different from existing methods of blending functionalized
   ceramic particles into the polymer matrix. Highly monodispersed TiO2
   nanocrystals enhance the effective interfacial interactions between
   particles and polymer matrix, which suppress the crystallization of
   ethylene oxide (EO) groups and facilitate forming continuously
   interconnected ion-conducting channels. Moreover, an increased
   dissociation degree of Li salt can also be achieved. The TiO2-grafted
   NHPE exhibits superior electrochemical properties with an ionic
   conductivity of 1.1 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C, a high lithium
   ion transference number and excellent interfacial compatibility with the
   lithium electrode. In particular, a lithium-ion battery based on
   TiO2-grafted NHPE demonstrates good C-rate performance, as well as
   excellent cycling stability with an initial discharge capacity of 153.5
   mAh g(-1) and a capacity retention of 96\% after 300 cycles at 1 C (80
   degrees C). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{293}},
Pages = {{80-94}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{As the oil production from conventional oil reservoirs is decreasing,
   oil production through Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) processes is supposed
   to compensate for both the oil production reduction in matured oil
   reservoirs and the worldwide dramatic increase in oil demand. Therefore,
   developing a strategy to choose an optimized EOR technique is crucial to
   find a resolution for production decline in oil reservoirs. A screening
   tool recommending the most appropriate EOR method is proposed in this
   study. An expert fuzzy logic system is employed to screen four
   well-known EOR methods including miscible CO2 injection, miscible HC gas
   injection, polymer flooding and steam injection based on the reservoir
   condition, fluids characteristics and rock properties. Since this expert
   system has incorporated the rules from successful past experience, it
   reduces the requirement of extensive laboratory and field data. The
   expert system can be used as a quick estimation for evaluating the
   success of the EOR processes for a particular reservoir before making
   any executive decision. Based on the approach proposed in this research,
   a screening program capable of ranking proper EOR techniques has been
   developed. The output results have been compared with the results of a
   Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model and some field experience. This
   comparison indicated that not only is the proposed model in a good
   agreement with the field data, but it also provides a more robust
   approach than the BBN model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of a nanovoid in single-crystal copper has been studied via

   homogenous elastic deformation has been excluded. Through this novel
   approach, we are able to illustrate the feasibility of void growth
   induced by shear loops/curves. At a smaller scale, the formation and
   emission of shear loops/curves contribute to the local mass transport.
   At a larger scale, a new mechanism of void growth via frustum-like

   void growth via frustum-like dislocation structure is also proposed.

Abstract = {{To improve the electrically assisted patterning process and create
   smaller sized features with the higher active surface area, the combined
   thermocapillary-electrohydrodynamic (TC-EHD) instability of liquid
   nanofilms is considered. First, the 3-D thin film equation is rederived
   for nonisothermal films and then the influential factors, on the
   dynamics and stability of thin liquid film are found using linear
   stability (LS) analysis. Nonlinear studies are also conducted to
   investigate the long-time evolution of the interface using an in-house
   developed Fortran code employing high order finite difference and
   adaptive time step solver for the spatial and time derivatives. The
   number density of pillars (columnar raised structure) formed in 1 mu
   m(2) area is significantly increased compared to the EHD base-case and
   nanosized pillars are created due to the thermocapillary effects.
   Relative interface area increases of up to 18\% due to this pattern
   miniaturization are realized. It is also found that increase in the
   thermal conductivity ratio of layers changes the mechanism of pattern
   formation resulting in nonuniform and randomly distributed micro pillars
   being generated.}},

Abstract = {{Bottom-up self-assembly of high-density block-copolymer nanopatterns is
   of significant interest for a range of technologies, including memory

   segregated single-layer hexagonal nano-patterns of silica dots, can be
   layered sequentially to produce density-doubled and-tripled
   nanopatterns. The center-to-center spacing and diameter of the resulting
   silica dots are critical with respect to the resulting double- and
   triple-layer assemblies because dot overlap reduces the quality of the
   resulting pattern. The addition of polystyrene (PS) homopolymer to
   PS-b-PDMS reduces the size of the resulting silica dots but leads to
   increased disorder at higher concentrations. The quality of these
   density-multiplied patterns can be calculated and predicted using
   parameters easily derived from SEM micrographs of corresponding single
   and multilayer patterns; simple geometric considerations underlie the
   degree of overlap of dots and layer-to-layer registration, two important
   factors for regular ordered patterns, and clearly defined dot borders.
   Because the higher-molecular-weight block copolymers tend to yield more
   regular patterns than smaller block copolymers, as defined by order and
   dot circularity, this sequential patterning approach may provide a route
   toward harnessing these materials, thus surpassing their native feature
   density.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen production via steam methane reforming (SMR) dominates the
   supply to refining complexes worldwide, resulting in significant
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a considerable demand for clean
   hydrogen pathways that are economically competitive with SMR. The
   development of a 563 MW integrated wind-hydrogen model with energy
   storage is proposed. The model utilizes real-time wind energy data to
   ascertain the optimal size of the electrolyser, the number of
   electrolyser units and the battery (energy storage) capacity that will
   yield a minimum hydrogen production cost, whilst functioning in a
   liberalized electricity market with dynamic prices. The optimal plant
   configuration consists of 81 units of a 3496 kW (760 Nm(3)/hr)
   electrolyser and 360 MWh (60 units) of battery capacity. For the minimum
   hydrogen production cost determined (\$9.00//kg H-2), the wind farm
   accounts for 63\% of this cost. Hence, if existing wind farm assets are
   used, such that the investment cost of building the wind-hydrogen plant
   does not include the wind farm costs, the hydrogen production cost is
   reduced to \$3.37/kg H-2. For a particular electrolyser-battery
   configuration, it was observed that the minimum hydrogen production cost
   occurs when their respective capacity factors are approximately
   equivalent. The benefits of energy storage are limited by the decrease
   in overall plant efficiency, which results from the use of the battery.
   For the techno-economic conditions considered in this paper, hydrogen
   production costs from wind powered electrolysis (\$3.37 to \$9.00/kg
   H-2) are uncompetitive with SMR/SMR-CCS (\$1.87 to \$2.60/1cg H-2). (C)

Abstract = {{Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and ultraviolet (UV)/chlorine processes are
   regarded as two of many advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Because of
   the similar cost of VUV/UV and UV lamps, a combination of VUV and
   UV/chlorine (i.e., VUV/UV/chlorine) may enhance the removal of organic
   pollutants in water but without any additional power input. In this
   paper, a mini-fluidic VUV/UV photoreaction system (MVPS) was developed
   for bench-scale experiments, which could emit both VUV (185 nm) and DV
   (254 nm) or solely DV beams with a nearly identical UV photon fluence.
   The photon fluence rates of UV and VUV output by the MVPS were
   determined to be 8.88 X 10(-4) and 4.93 x 10(-5) einstein m(-2) s(-1),
   respectively. The VUV/UV/chlorine process exhibited a strong enhancement
   concerning the degradation of methylene blue (MB, a model organic
   pollutant) as compared to the total performance of the VUV/UV and
   UV/chlorine processes, although the photon fluence of the VUV only
   accounted for 5.6\% of that of the UV. An acidic pH favored MB
   degradation by the VUV/UV/chlorine process. The synergistic mechanism of
   the VUV/UV/chlorine process was mainly ascribed to the effective use of
   (OH)-O-center dot for pollutant removal through formation of
   longer-lived secondary radicals (e.g., (OCl)-O-center dot). This study
   demonstrates that the new VUV/UV/chlorine process, as an enhanced AOP,
   can be applied as a highly effective and energy-saving technology for
   small-scale water and wastewater treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of calcination and milling of 8YSZ (8 mol\%
   yttria stabilized zirconia) used in the nickel-YSZ anode on the
   performance of anode supported tubular fuel cells were investigated. For
   this purpose, two different types of cells were prepared based on a
   Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Nd2NiO4+delta-YSZ configuration. For the anode preparation, a
   suspension was prepared by mixing NiO and YSZ in a ratio of 65:35 wt\%
   (Ni:YSZ 50:50 vol.\%) with 30 vol.\% graphite as the pore former. As
   received Tosoh YSZ or its calcined form (heated at 1500 degrees C for 3
   hours) was used in the anode support as the YSZ source. Electrochemical
   results showed that optimization of the fuel electrode microstructure is
   essential for the optimal distribution of gas within the support of the
   cell, especially under electrolysis operation where the performance for
   an optimized cell (calcined YSZ) was enhanced by a factor of two. In
   comparison with a standard cell (containing as received YSZ), at 1.5 V
   and 800 degrees C the measured current density was -1380 mA cm(-2) and
   -690 mA cm(-2) for the cells containing calcined and as received YSZ,
   respectively. The present study suggests that the anode porosity for
   improved cell performance under SOEC is more critical than SOFC mode due
   to more complex gas diffusion under electrolysis mode where large amount
   of steam needs to be transfered into the cell.}},

Abstract = {{A highly sensitive, microwave-coupled ring resonator with a wide dynamic
   range is studied for use in sensing applications. The resonator's
   structure has two resonant rings and, consequently, two resonant
   frequencies, operating at 2.3 and 2.45 GHz. Inductive and capacitive
   coupling mechanisms are explored and compared to study their sensing
   performance. Primary finite element analysis and measurement results are
   used to compare the capacitive and inductive coupled ring resonators,
   demonstrating sensitivity improvements of up to 75\% and dynamic range
   enhancement up to 100\% in the capacitive coupled structure. In this
   work, we are proposing capacitive coupled planar ring resonators as a
   wide dynamic range sensing platform for liquid sensing applications.
   This sensing device is well suited for low-cost, real-time low-power,

   Al(OH)(3)-polyacrylamide (Al-PAM) with different molecular weights (for
   organic characteristics) and contents of aluminum hydroxide
   nanoparticles (for inorganic characteristics) on kaolinite basal planes
   was studied using a versatile quartz crystal microbalance with
   dissipation (QCM-D). The flocculation dynamics of kaolinite by Al-PAMs
   was assessed by measuring the initial settling rate of flocculated
   kaolinite particles and the turbidity of the supernatant after settling
   of flocculated solids. The areal mass (mg/m(2)) of Al-PAMs adsorbed on
   tetrahedral silica and octahedral alumina basal planes of kaolinite
   increased with increasing molecular weight of the polymer. Increasing
   the content of Aluminum hydroxide nanoparticle in Al-PAM has resulted in
   an increase of the amount of the polymer adsorbed on silica basal planes
   while opposite trend was found on alumina basal planes. Results obtained
   from the adsorption kinetics study of Al-PAM6R (M-w = 2.2 million
   Dalton, 0.11 wt\% Aluminum) on silica basal planes revealed that the
   early stage of adsorption is diffusion-controlled. Thus, initially the
   adsorption rate increased with increasing temperature while the maximum
   coverage decreased. Moreover, the adsorption of Al-PAMs on silica basal
   planes was shown to decrease significantly in plant recycle (process)
   water compared to deionized water. Al-PAMs of higher molecular weight
   and/or high content of inorganic Al(OH)(3) nanoparticles were found to
   be more effective in flocculating kaolinite as indicated by the faster

Title = {{Altering Emulsion Stability with Heterogeneous Surface Wettability}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Emulsions-liquid droplets dispersed in another immiscible liquid-are
   widely used in a broad spectrum of applications, including food,
   personal care, agrochemical, and pharmaceutical products. Emulsions are
   also commonly present in natural crude oil, hampering the production and
   quality of petroleum fuels. The stability of emulsions plays a crucial
   role in their applications, but controlling the stability without
   external driving forces has been proven to be difficult. Here we show
   how heterogeneous surface wettability can alter the stability and
   dynamics of oil-in-water emulsions, generated by a co-flow microfluidic
   device. We designed a useful methodology that can modify a
   micro-capillary of desired heterogeneous wettability (e.g., alternating
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions) without changing the hydraulic
   diameter. We subsequently investigated the effects of flow rates and
   heterogeneous wettability on the emulsion morphology and motion. The
   experimental data revealed a universal critical timescale of advective
   emulsions, above which the microfluidic emulsions remain stable and
   intact, whereas below they become adhesive or inverse. A simple
   theoretical model based on a force balance can be used to explain this
   critical transition of emulsion dynamics, depending on the droplet size
   and the Capillary number-the ratio of viscous to surface effects. These
   results give insight into how to control the stability and dynamics of
   emulsions in microfluidics with flow velocity and different wettability.}},

Title = {{Imperfection sensitivity of pressured buckling of biopolymer spherical
   shells}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{Imperfection sensitivity is essential for mechanical behavior of
   biopolymer shells {[}such as ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) and
   spherical viruses] characterized by high geometric heterogeneity. In
   this work, an imperfection sensitivity analysis is conducted based on a
   refined shell model recently developed for spherical biopolymer shells
   of high structural heterogeneity and thickness nonuniformity. The
   influence of related parameters (including the ratio of radius to
   average shell thickness, the ratio of transverse shear modulus to
   in-plane shear modulus, and the ratio of effective bending thickness to
   average shell thickness) on imperfection sensitivity is examined for
   pressured buckling. Our results show that the ratio of effective bending
   thickness to average shell thickness has a major effect on the
   imperfection sensitivity, while the effect of the ratio of transverse
   shear modulus to in-plane shear modulus is usually negligible. For
   example, with physically realistic parameters for typical imperfect
   spherical biopolymer shells, the present model predicts that actual
   maximum external pressure could be reduced to as low as 60\% of that of
   a perfect UCA spherical shell or 55\%-65\% of that of a perfect
   spherical virus shell, respectively. The moderate imperfection
   sensitivity of spherical biopolymer shells with physically realistic
   imperfection is largely attributed to the fact that biopolymer shells
   are relatively thicker (defined by smaller radius-to-thickness ratio)
   and therefore practically realistic imperfection amplitude normalized by
   thickness is very small as compared to that of classical elastic thin
   shells which have much larger radius-to-thickness ratio.}},

   each of these issues with the required implementation details and also
   demonstrates geometallurgical mineral deposit characterization for a

   nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{EXTREME MECHANICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{71-77}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticle (NP) aggregations could enhance performance of the
   materials in many ways. Ultrasonication has been demonstrated as an
   effective and cost-efficient method to aggregate NPs. However, the
   aggregation mechanism remains unclear, which delays the development of
   assembling NPs with ultrasound.
   This letter investigates aggregation mechanism of zirconia NPs using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The aggregation is demonstrated by
   melting and subsequent quenching of the local atoms around impact facets
   between NPs. Value of the critical velocity is one-third of that
   estimated based on complete melting in literature. The partial melting
   mechanism explains experimental phenomena observed in literature
   successfully, and therefore is validated as a more realistic mechanism
   to predict NP aggregation. Furthermore, the work proves that ceramic
   NPs, despite of their low diffusivity, could be aggregated through
   ultrasonication, which provides a convenient manufacturing method to
   assemble ceramic NPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The recent dramatic increase in the power conversion efficiencies of
   organic-inorganic tri-halide perovskite solar cells has triggered
   intense research worldwide and created a paradigm shift in the
   photovoltaics field. It is crucial to develop a solid understanding of
   the photophysical processes underlying solar cell operation in order to
   both further improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar
   cells as well as to exploit the broader optoelectronic applications of
   the tri-halide perovskites. In this short review, we summarize the main
   research findings about the binding energy of excitons in tri-halide
   perovskite materials and find that a value in the range of 2-22 meV at
   room temperature would be a safe estimate. Spontaneous free carrier
   generation is the dominant process taking place directly after
   photoexcitation in organic-inorganic tri-halide perovskites at room
   temperature, which eliminates the exciton diffusion bottleneck present
   in organic solar cells and constitutes a major contributing factor to
   the high photovoltaic performance of this material.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic brittle fragmentation is typically described using analytical
   and computational approaches for tensile stress-states. However, most
   fragmentation applications ( e.g., impact, blast) involve very large
   initial compressive stresses and deformations. In this study, the
   compressive fragmentation of brittle materials is investigated
   experimentally across a range of materials: silicon carbide, boron
   carbide, spinel, basalt and a stony meteorite. Analysis of our
   experimental results suggests that there exists two different regimes in
   the fragment size distributions, based on two brittle fragmentation
   mechanisms. The first is a mechanism that produces larger fragments and
   is associated with the structural failure of the sample being tested.
   This mechanism is influenced by the loading conditions ( rate, stress
   state) and sample geometry. The second fragmentation mechanism produces
   comparatively smaller fragments and arises from the coalescence of
   fractures initiating and coalescence between defects in regions of large
   stresses and contact forces ( e. g., between two fractured surfaces from
   the larger fragments). A framework is developed for comparing
   experimental compressive fragmentation results with tensile
   fragmentation theories. The compressive experimental results are shown
   to be adequately described by the theories using the new framework.}},

Title = {{Modulating mechanical behaviour of 3D-printed cartilage-mimetic PCL
   scaffolds: influence of molecular weight and pore geometry}},
Journal = {{BIOFABRICATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D)-printed poly(epsilon)-caprolactone (PCL)-based
   scaffolds are increasingly being explored for cartilage tissue
   engineering (CTE) applications. However, ensuring that the mechanical
   properties of these PCL-based constructs are comparable to that of
   articular cartilage that they are meant to regenerate is an area that
   has been under-explored. This paper presents the effects of PCL's
   molecular weight (MW) and scaffold's pore geometric configurations;
   strand size (SZ), strand spacing (SS), and strand orientation (SO), on
   mechanical properties of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds. The results
   illustrate that MW has significant effect on compressive moduli and
   yield strength of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds. Specifically, PCL with MW of
   45 K was a more feasible choice for fabrication of visco-elastic,
   flexible and load-bearing PCL scaffolds. Furthermore, pore geometric
   configurations; SZ, SS, and SO, all significantly affect on tensile
   moduli of scaffolds. However, only SZ and SS have statistically
   significant effects on compressive moduli and porosity of these
   scaffolds. That said, inverse linear relationship was observed between
   porosity and mechanical properties of 3D-printed PCL scaffolds in
   Pearson's correlation test. Altogether, this study illustrates that
   modulating MW of PCL and pore geometrical configurations of the
   scaffolds enabled design and fabrication of PCL scaffolds with
   mechanical and biomimetic properties that better mimic mechanical
   behaviour of human articular cartilage. Thus, the modulated PCL scaffold
   proposed in this study is a framework that offers great potentials for
   CTE applications.}},

Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{525-539}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we will consider the selective maintenance problem for
   multistate series systems with stochastic dependent components. In
   multistate systems, the health state of a component may vary from
   perfect functioning to complete failure. The stochastic dependence
   (S-dependence) between components is discussed and categorized into two
   types in multistate context. First, the failure of a component can
   immediately cause complete failures of some other components in the
   system. Second, as components deteriorate, the reduced working
   performance rate of a multistate component affects the state as well as
   the degradation rate of its subsequent components in series structure.
   The system reliability is evaluated using an approach based on
   stochastic process. A cost-based selective maintenance model is
   developed for the multistate system with S-dependent components to
   maximize the total system profit, which includes the production gain and
   loss in the next mission as well as possible maintenance costs for the
   system. Analyses of systems with independent and dependent components
   are provided. It is observed that ignoring S-dependence in the system
   may lead to alternative maintenance decision making and an optimistic
   estimation of the system performance.}},

   explored. Moreover, the thermal spray process parameters that affect the
   properties of metal deposits on polymers are described, followed by
   studies on the temperature distribution within the polymer substrate
   during the thermal spray process. The objective of this review is
   devoted to testing and potential applications of thermal-sprayed metal

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Islet transplantation (IT) is an established clinical therapy for select
   patients with type-1 diabetes. Clinically, the hepatic portal vein
   serves as the site for IT. Despite numerous advances in clinical IT,
   limitations remain, including early islet cell loss posttransplant,
   procedural complications, and the inability to effectively monitor islet
   grafts. Hence, alternative sites for IT are currently being explored,
   with the subcutaneous space as one potential option. When left
   unmodified, the subcutaneous space routinely fails to promote successful
   islet engraftment. However, when employing the previously developed
   subcutaneous ``deviceless{''} technique, a favorable microenvironment
   for islet survival and function is established. In this technique, an
   angiocatheter was temporarily implanted subcutaneously, which
   facilitated angiogenesis to promote subsequent islet engraftment. This
   technique has been employed in preclinical animal models, providing a
   sufficient means to develop techniques to monitor functional aspects of
   the graft such as angiogenesis. Here, we utilize photo-acoustic imaging
   to track angiogenesis during the priming of the subcutaneous site by the
   implanted catheter at 1 to 4 weeks postcatheter. Quantitative analysis
   on vessel densities shows gradual growth of vasculature in the implant
   position. These results demonstrate the ability to track angiogenesis,
   thus facilitating a means to optimize and assess the pretransplant
   microenvironment. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative

Abstract = {{In this article, we focus on adaptive linear regression methods and
   propose a new technique. The article begins with a review of the online
   passive aggressive algorithm (OPAA), an adaptive linear regression
   algorithm from the machine learning literature. We highlight the
   strengths and weaknesses of OPAA and compare it with other popular
   adaptive regression techniques such as moving window and recursive least
   squares, recursive partial least squares, and just in -time or locally
   weighted regression. Modifications to OPAA are proposed to make it more
   robust and better suited for industrial soft-sensor applications. The
   new algorithm is called smoothed passive aggressive algorithm (SPAA),
   and like OPAA, it follows a cautious parameter update strategy but is
   more robust. The trade-off between SPAA's computation complexity and
   accuracy can be easily controlled by manipulating just two tuning
   parameters. We also demonstrate that the SPAA framework is quite
   flexible and a number of variants are easily formulated. Application of
   SPAA to estimate the time-varying parameters of a numerically simulated
   autoregressive with exogenous terms (ARX) model and to predict the Reid
   vapor pressure of the bottoms flow from an industrial column
   demonstrates its superior performance over OPAA and comparable
   performance with the other popular algorithms. Copyright (C) 2016 John

Abstract = {{In this paper, practical considerations for steam assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) monitoring using ultra-wideband (UWB) radar are studied.
   The SAGD process and important factors to monitor its performance are
   discussed. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the possibility
   of using UWB radar for SAGD process monitoring. All the experiments are
   carried out on a simplified laboratory prototype, which is a plateau of
   wet sand covered by dry sand to mimic the steamed area of the reservoir.
   The effect of the metal pipe on the pulse shape and propagation inside
   the reservoir is also experimentally studied. Additionally, a
   miniaturized Vivaldi antenna capable of radiating within oil-sand is
   designed, fabricated, and verified as a sensor for the radar monitoring
   system. Power budget and heterogeneity analysis of the heavy reservoir
   for different grades of Athabasca oil-sands are also studied. Results
   demonstrate the possibility of using UWB radar to detect and image the
   contour of the steamed area in the SAGD process. The information
   collected by the UWB radar can be used for optimizing steam injection to
   improve the usage of water and energy.}},

Abstract = {{A performance monitoring study of an electric rope shovel operating in
   an open pit coal mine was conducted. As the mining industry moves toward
   higher productivity, profitability and predictability, the need for more
   reliable, productive and efficient mining shovels increases.
   Consequently, it is critical to study the productivity of these machines
   and to understand the effect of different operational parameters on
   that. In this paper a clustering analysis is performed to classify
   shovel digging effort and behaviour based on digging energy, dig time
   and payload per pass. Then the influence of the operator on the digging
   efficiency and productivity of the machine is analyzed with a focus on
   operator technique during digging. A statistical analysis is conducted
   on different cycle time components (dig time, swing time, return time)
   for different operators. In addition to time components, swing and
   return angles as well as loading rate and mucking rate are observed and
   analyzed. The results of this study help to understand the effect of
   different operators on the digging productivity of the shovel and then
   to set the best operator practice.}},

Title = {{Predicting Soil Expansion Force during Static Pipe Bursting Using Cavity
   Expansion Solutions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The prediction of total pull force is critical for static pipe-bursting
   installation. As a major component of the total pull force, soil
   expansion prediction is also important; however, there are currently
   limited methods available for such prediction. In this paper, three
   cavity expansion solutions were used to predict soil expansion pressure
   acting upon the expander ( bursting head) during static pipe bursting.
   The determined soil expansion pressure was then used to calculate the
   expansion force required for pipe bursting with or without consideration
   of the soil collapse. Calculated results were then compared with those
   from laboratory pipe-bursting experiments to evaluate the feasibility of
   the calculation methods. The comparison indicated that the large-strain
   cavity expansion solution reasonably predicted the soil expansion force.
   The small-strain solution significantly overestimated the soil expansion
   force. Additionally, considering soil collapse during pipe bursting
   resulted in a remarkably higher calculated expansion force than that
   without consideration; in this study, the soil collapse effect should be
   taken into account because a sandy soil was used in the laboratory
   experiments. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the vibrational fluidization of granular media, 60
   samples of three different granular materials were tested at six normal

Abstract = {{Polymer processes often contain state variables whose distributions are
   multimodal; in addition, the models for these processes are often
   complex and nonlinear with uncertain parameters. This presents a
   challenge for Kalman-based state estimators such as the ensemble Kalman
   filter. We develop an estimator based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)
   coupled with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) specifically for
   estimation with multimodal state distributions. The expectation
   maximization algorithm is used for clustering in the Gaussian mixture
   model. The performance of the GMM-based EnKF is compared to that of the
   EnKF and the particle filter (PF) through simulations of a polymethyl
   methacrylate process, and it is seen that it clearly outperforms the
   other estimators both in state and parameter estimation. While the PF is
   also able to handle nonlinearity and multimodality, its lack of
   robustness to model-plant mismatch affects its performance
   significantly.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS \& MODELLING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{In this work, molecular dynamics simulation was used to examine the
   effect of solution pH on the adsorption behavior and self-aggregation of
   dodecylamine hydrochloride (DDA) on the muscovite (0 01) surface. The
   properties of surfactants are assessed in terms of density profiles in
   the direction perpendicular to the muscovite surface. Results show that
   although DDA can adsorb at muscovite at all pH we discussed, the
   self-aggregation of DDA varies significantly at different pH values. At
   pH 10, a compact hydrophobic monolayer forms on the muscovite surface.
   At pH 3, hemi-micelle aggregated structure forms with several DDA
   cations far away from muscovite surface. At pH 12, it has been confirmed
   that adsorption of DDA neutral molecules occurs with only a few DDA
   molecules adsorbing on muscovite directly and acting as a bridge linking
   the rest DDA molecules, which exists nearby muscovite surface
   irregularly. Density profiles revealed that at pH 10, DDA cations play a
   dominant role in the interaction between DDA surfactants and muscovite.
   While DDA molecules have difficulty in forming a hydrogen bond with the
   oxygen atom on the muscovite surfaces, and they co-adsorb onto muscovite
   through the electrostatic interactions with muscovite and hydrophobic
   force with DDA cations. Therefore, the hydrophobization of muscovite in
   the presence of DDA are higher at pH 10 than that at pH 3 and pH 12. Our
   results indicate that molecular dynamics simulation can be a power tool
   in charactering adsorption behavior of surfactants onto mineral surfaces
   at different pH values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two artificial neural network models (forward and inverse) are developed

   polymer from a set of polymerization conditions, such as ethylene
   concentration, 1-olefin concentration, cocatalyst concentration,
   hydrogen concentration, and polymerization temperature. The results of
   the forward model agree well with those from the kinetic model. The
   inverse model is applied to determine the polymerization conditions to
   produce polymers with desired microstructures. Although the inverse
   model generates multiple solutions for the general case, unique
   solutions are obtained when one of the three key process parameters
   (ethylene concentration, 1-olefin concentration, and polymerization

Abstract = {{We re-examine the conclusion established earlier in the literature that
   in the presence of a homogeneously imperfect interface, the circular
   inhomogeneity is the only shape of inhomogeneity which can achieve a
   uniform internal strain field in an isotropic or anisotropic material
   subjected to anti-plane shear. We show that under certain conditions, it
   is indeed possible to design such non-circular inhomogeneities despite
   the limitation of a homogeneously imperfect interface. Our method
   proceeds by prescribing a uniform strain field inside a non-circular
   inhomogeneity via perturbations of the uniform strain field inside the
   analogous circular inhomogeneity and then subsequently identifying the
   corresponding (non-circular) shape via the use of a conformal mapping
   whose unknown coefficients are determined from a system of nonlinear
   equations. We illustrate our results with several examples. We note also
   that, for a given size of inhomogeneity, the minimum value of the
   interface parameter required to guarantee the desired uniform internal
   strain increases as the elastic constants of the inclusion approach
   those of the matrix. Finally, we discuss in detail the relationship
   between the curvature of the interface and the displacement jump across
   the interface in the design of such inhomogeneities.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Assessment of Budget Sufficiency and Resource Utilization
   for Resource-Constrained Project Schedules}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of budget sufficiency and resource utilization for a
   resource-constrained project schedule is crucial to ensure practical
   feasibility of the schedule and successful delivery of a construction
   project. This paper proposes a quantitative assessment approach for
   characterizing budget sufficiency and resource utilization for a
   resource-constrained project schedule in an objective fashion. The
   budgeted unit, deployed unit, and scheduled unit in connection with a
   resource-constrained project schedule are first defined. Next, two
   budget sufficiency metrics, named the budget sufficiency index and
   budget sufficiency variance, are defined for measuring the sufficiency
   of control budget in terms of deploying resources to execute the project
   schedule with resource constraints. In addition, two resource
   utilization metrics, termed the resource utilization index and resource
   utilization variance, are defined for indicating utilization efficiency
   of deployed resources based on the schedule. The proposed metrics are
   applied to objectively assess multiple alternative resource-constrained
   project schedules derived from various approaches, including a practical
   scheduling approach (Primavera P6) and resource scheduling optimization
   techniques recently developed from in-house research. A textbook example
   and a refinery plant turnaround project are used to demonstrate the
   effective application of proposed metrics on alternative
   resource-constrained schedules. It is concluded that (1) resource
   scheduling optimization techniques outperform Primavera P6 in terms of
   budget sufficiency and resource utilization thanks to streamlining
   resource supply limits and shortening project duration by optimization;
   and (2) a significant portion of the idled resource time in the
   Primavera P6 schedule turns into extra contingency in the optimized
   schedule that can be reserved against any work unforeseen or unknown
   during the planning stage. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) play significant roles in anaerobic
   environments in oil sands mature fine tailings (MFTs). Hydrogen sulfide
   (H2S) is produced during the biological sulfate reduction process. The
   production of toxic H2S is one of the concerns because it may hinder the
   landscape remediation efficiency of oil sands tailing ponds. In present
   study, the in situ activity and the community structure of SRB in MFT
   and gypsum amended MFT in two settling columns were investigated.
   Combined techniques of H2S microsensor and dissimilatory sulfite
   reductase a-subunit (dsrB) genes-based real time quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (qPCR) were applied to detect the in situ H2S and the
   abundance of SRB. A higher diversity of SRB and more H2S were observed
   in gypsum amended MFT than that in MFT, indicating a higher sulfate
   reduction activity in gypsum amended MFT; in addition, the activity of
   SRB varied as depth in both MFT and gypsum amended MFT: the deeper the
   more H2S produced. Long-term plans for tailings management can be
   assessed more wisely with the information provided in this study. (C)

Abstract = {{The byssal threads of the fan shell Atrina pectinata are non-living
   functional materials intimately associated with living tissue, which
   provide an intriguing paradigm of bionic interface for robust
   load-bearing device. An interfacial load-bearing protein (A. pectinata
   foot protein-1, apfp-1) with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
   (DOPA)-containing and mannose-binding domains has been characterized
   from Atrina's foot. apfp-1 was localized at the interface between stiff
   byssus and the soft tissue by immunochemical staining and confocal Raman
   imaging, implying that apfp-1 is an interfacial linker between the
   byssus and soft tissue, that is, the DOPA-containing domain interacts
   with itself and other byssal proteins via Fe3(+)-DOPA complexes, and the
   mannose-binding domain interacts with the soft tissue and cell
   membranes. Both DOPA-and sugar-mediated bindings are reversible and
   robust under wet conditions. This work shows the combination of DOPA and
   sugar chemistry at asymmetric interfaces is unprecedented and highly

Abstract = {{Cooperative diversity is an innovative approach to improve the
   reliability of communication. Although this technique is considered in
   the next-generation mobile communication standards, it has its own
   challenges in practice. For example, in simultaneous transmission-based
   cooperative protocols, perfect synchronisation of nodes is very hard to
   realise. The traditional time division multiple access method can
   simplify the synchronisation problems but leads to long transmission
   delays. In this paper, a low-delay cooperative strategy is proposed for
   a network with multiple sources and a single destination, which requires
   only a simple type of synchronisation. In this technique, we use a
   combination of superposition coding and network coding; hence the name
   superposition network coded cooperation. For this strategy, good bounds
   are obtained for the probability of correct detection for general M-PSK
   and M-QAM modulation and are compared with simulation results. The
   results demonstrate improvement in error performance compared with other
   transmission schemes requiring the same transmission time as
   superposition network coded cooperation. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Asphaltene is the heavy and heteroatom-rich fraction of petroleum that
   is rejected during a solvent deasphalting process. In patent literature
   there are claims that state that this material can be converted into an
   aromatic petrochemical feedstock by oxidative liquefaction at low
   temperature. To evaluate the validity of these claims, asphaltenes from
   an industrial solvent deasphalting process were oxidized with dry and
   water-saturated air at temperatures in the range 45-100 degrees C.
   Infrared spectroscopy of the oxidized product confirmed that oxygen was
   incorporated as C=O and C-O. Under all experimental conditions studied
   little oxidative degradation was observed that would lead to the
   production of a petrochemical feedstock. Nevertheless, some observations
   of scientific value were made about the low-temperature conversion of
   asphaltenes. During autoxidation with dry air, the n-pentane-insoluble
   fraction increased. On the contrary, when oxidation was conducted with
   water-saturated air, the formation of additional n-pentane-insoluble
   material was suppressed. Mild heating of asphaltenes under nitrogen
   atmosphere also caused the n-pentane-insoluble content to increase.
   Spectroscopic evidence showed that esters are formed during oxidation at
   similar to 100 degrees C. The temperature dependence of this reaction
   was explained and a possible reaction pathway for cycloalkane to ester
   conversion was presented. Ester selectivity was determined by the
   competition between hydrogen abstraction and beta-scission of the alkoxy
   radical.}},

Abstract = {{It has been known for years that the performance of a demulsifier in
   diluted bitumen dewatering improves up to a certain demulsifier bulk
   concentration., After this limit, the water removal deteriorates: This
   phenomenon is called overdosing. In this paper, the effects of
   mixing-energy and demulsifier injection concentration on-water removal
   are studied in systems with a high bulk demulsifier concentration. The
   experiments were conducted in a confined impeller stirred tank (CIST),
   which provides well-controlled mixing conditions with more uniform
   turbulence and flow than a conventional stirred tank. The results show
   that an increase in mixing energy and pre-dilution of the demulsifier
   may be able to overcome overdosing effects at a high bulk (mean)
   concentration. If the mixing conditions are well-designed, high local
   demulsifier concentrations at the feed point are avoided and the
   demulsifier can perform well, even at high bulk concentrations. The best
   demulsifier performance in an overdosed system was obtained with a
   combination of high mixing energy and low injection concentration, where
   over 80\% of the water content was separated at a demulsifier bulk
   concentration that showed severe overdosing behavior at poor mixing
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of cell membrane integrity is one of the most widely used
   methods to measure post-cryopreservation viability of cells such as
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). However, an evaluation
   of cell function provides a better measure of cell quality following
   cryopreservation. The tube formation assay mimics angiogenesis in vitro
   and can be used to quantitate the ability of endothelial cells to form
   capillary-like tubular structures when cultured on reconstituted
   basement membrane (Matrigel). We compared the membrane integrity
   (measured by flow cytometry) and tube forming ability of HUVEC
   suspensions exposed to 10\% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), cooled at 1
   degrees C/min to various subzero temperatures, plunged directly into
   liquid nitrogen, stored for an hour, and thawed rapidly. We found that
   as membrane integrity increased so did the various parameters associated
   with the extent of in vitro angiogenesis; however, in comparison to
   fresh cells with a similar percentage of membrane intact cells, the
   extent of tube formation, expressed as total tube length, is
   significantly lower in previously frozen cells for the lower range of
   post-thaw membrane integrities. Our findings underscore the value of an
   assay that quantifies a specific function that a cell is known to
   perform in vivo to measure the success of cryopreservation protocols.

Abstract = {{In this survey, the authors examine the trade-off between the unbiased,
   optimal, and in-between solutions in finite impulse response (FIR)
   filtering. Specifically, they refer to linear discrete real-time
   invariant state-space models with zero mean noise sources having
   arbitrary covariances (not obligatorily delta shaped) and distributions
   (not obligatorily Gaussian). They systematically analyse the following
   batch filtering algorithms: unbiased FIR (UFIR) subject to the
   unbiasedness condition, optimal FIR (OFIR) which minimises the mean
   square error (MSE), OFIR with embedded unbiasedness (EU) which minimises
   the MSE subject to the unbiasedness constraint, and optimal UFIR (OUFIR)
   which minimises the MSE in the UFIR estimate. Based on extensive
   investigations of the polynomial and harmonic models, the authors show
   that the OFIR-EU and OUFIR filters have higher immunity against errors
   in the noise statistics and better robustness against temporary model
   uncertainties than the OFIR and Kalman filters.}},

Abstract = {{Canadian beef is quality graded to characterize the potential eating
   quality of the cooked product. Instrumental meat quality characteristics
   of 48 m. longissimus thoracis (LT, rib eye) from four Canadian beef
   grades (Canada A, AA, AAA, and Prime, n = 12) before and after an
   additional 14-d aging were compared using a split plot design with
   grade, aging, and their interaction as fixed sources of variation. Mean
   percentage intramuscular fat was greatest in Canada Prime muscle and
   least in Canada A and AA muscles (P < 0.0001), whereas mean percentage
   drip loss was lower in Canada Prime muscle than in muscle from all other
   grades (P = 0.0348). Canada Prime and AAA muscles were redder and
   yellower than muscles from other grades even after aging (P < 0.03),
   which may be associated with increased fat content and indicative of
   accelerated myoglobin oxidation and increased myoglobin oxygenation.
   Shear force was not different among the Canada grades, although the
   differences between Canada AA cooked beef LT and that of Canada Prime
   and AAA carcasses approached significance (P = 0.0993). Results
   indicated that Canada quality grades did not differentiate beef on
   cooked product tenderness, substantiating that muscle compositional
   characteristics alone define beef grade advantages.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory measurements of turbulence in submerged hydraulic jumps with
   blocks downstream of a sluice gate are presented. As observed previously
   two flow regimes were distinguished; the deflected surface jet (DSJ) and
   the reattaching wall jet (RWJ) regimes. In the DSJ regime considerable
   turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was generated just downstream of the
   blocks and the rate of dissipation of TKE was found to be very high
   resulting in a rapid decay of TKE. In the RWJ flow regime the magnitude
   of both the TKE and the dissipation rate were considerably lower but
   because the TKE decayed more slowly higher levels of TKE persisted
   farther downstream. This study provides insights into the production and
   dissipation of turbulence in submerged flows and helps to explain why a
   submerged jump with blocks with a low submergence factor; i.e., the DSJ
   flow regime, is as effective as a free jump in dissipating energy.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Theoretical models suggest that He-O-2 as carrier gas may
   lead to more homogeneous ventilation and aerosol deposition than air.
   However, these effects have not been clinically consistent and it is
   unclear why subjects may or may not respond to the therapy. Here we
   present 3D-imaging data of aerosol deposition and ventilation
   distributions from subjects with asthma inhaling He-O-2 as carrier gas.
   The data are compared with those that we previously obtained from a
   similar group of subjects inhaling air.
   Methods: Subjects with mild-to-moderate asthma were bronchoconstricted
   with methacholine and imaged with PET-CT while inhaling aerosol carried
   with He-O-2. Mean-normalized-values of lobar specific ventilation sV{*}
   and deposition sD{*} were derived and the factors affecting the
   distribution of sD{*} were evaluated along with the effects of breathing
   frequency (f) and regional expansion (F-VOL).
   Results: Lobar distributions of sD{*} and sV{*} with He-O-2 were not
   statistically different from those previously measured with air.
   However, with He-O-2 there was a larger number of lobes having sV{*} and
   sD{*} closer to unity and, in those subjects with uneven deposition
   distributions, the correlation of sD{*} with sV{*} was on average higher
   (p < 0.05) in He-O-2 (0.84 +/- 0.8) compared with air (0.55 +/- 0.28).
   In contrast with air, where the frequency of breathing during
   nebulization was associated with the degree of sD{*}-sV{*} correlation,
   with He-O-2 there was no association. Also, the modulation of f on the
   correlation between F-VOL and sD{*}/sV{*} in air, was not observed in
   He-O-2.
   Conclusion: There were no differences in the inter-lobar heterogeneity
   of sD{*} or sV{*} in this group of mild asthmatic subjects breathing
   He-O-2 compared with patients previously breathing air. Future studies,
   using these personalized 3D data sets as input to CFD models, are needed
   to understand if, and for whom, breathing He-O-2 during aerosol
   inhalation may be beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial thermal control of localized fluid volumes is a major challenge
   in the lab-on-chip (LOC) field. Thin-film heaters are commonly used in
   LOC devices to carry out many key functions that require high
   temperature uniformity, including the polymerase chain reaction and
   melting curve analysis. However, the conventional heater design approach
   is to iterate from an initial best guess toward an optimal design, but
   without prior knowledge of the exact power distribution that is required
   to produce the desired temperature profile. Such an iterative process
   enormously increases the time and cost of the design process. We report
   on a novel methodology for rapid-turnaround design of thin-film heaters
   that generate a pre-determined high-resolution spatially controlled
   power density field that yields uniform temperature or any other desired
   temperature profile in a planar structure. High temperature uniformity
   in reaction chambers of arbitrary shape and size is achieved with a
   single metal layer heater, while maximizing energy efficiency and
   minimizing the footprint. We implement the method in a monolithic
   polymer chip architecture, and clearly demonstrate highly selective and
   uniform heating within 1 degrees C in >94\% of the chamber volume in
   four different designs at 95 degrees C.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{125-136}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Gaussian process (GP) regression is a fully probabilistic method for
   performing non-linear regression. In a Bayesian framework, regression
   models can be made robust by using heavy-tailed distributions instead of
   using normal distribution for modeling noise. This work focuses on
   estimation of parameters for robust GP regression. In literature, these
   are learned by maximizing the approximate marginal likelihood of data.
   However, gradient-based optimization algorithms which are used for this
   purpose can be unstable or may require tuning. In this work, an EM
   algorithm based approach is derived and implemented to infer the
   parameters. The pros and cons of the two approaches are analyzed. The
   advantage of EM algorithm lies in its ease of implementation and
   theoretical guarantees of numerical stability and convergence while its
   prediction performance is still comparable to gradient-based approaches.
   In some cases EM algorithm may be slow to converge. To circumvent this
   issue a faster EM based approach known as Expectation Conjugate Gradient
   (ECG) is implemented on robust GP regression. Finally, the proposed EM
   approach to robust GP regression is validated using an industrial data
   set. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Laboratory and field analysis of flowback water from gas shales}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UNCONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESOURCES}},

Abstract = {{Flowback water is usually highly saline and the salt concentration
   varies by time and well location. Understanding the origin of the
   flowback salts is essential for evaluating fracturing and flowback
   processes. In this study, laboratory and field analyses are performed to
   investigate the origin of the flowback salts. The field data includes
   the total salt concentration (salinity), individual ion concentration,
   pH, and dissolved oxygen measured during the flowback process for three
   wells completed in the Horn River Basin. The rock mineralogy is
   determined using XRD. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of shale
   samples are measured using ammonium acetate method. Water and oil
   imbibition experiments are conducted for shale samples of different
   surface-to-volume ratio. The individual ion concentration is measured
   during the water imbibition experiments using ICP-MS and IC. EDXS
   analysis is used to investigate the surface of natural fractures.
   Noticeable amount of barium found on the surface of natural fractures
   suggests that the barium in the flowback water primarily originates from
   the natural fractures. Furthermore, the samples with higher clay content
   have higher CEC. During the water imbibition process, these samples have
   higher and faster ion transfer from shale -to -water; suggesting the
   mobilization of the exchangeable ions from the clays. During the water
   imbibition experiment, the Na/CI and K/CI ratios are initially high and
   decrease at the later times. Leaching of the exchangeable sodium and
   potassium ions from the clay minerals is a possible reason for the
   initial high Na/CI and K/CI molar ratios. The dissolution of chloride
   -bearing components increases the chloride concentration, which
   decreases the Na/CI and K/CI molar ratios at later times. The measured
   pH is slightly above 8 for all of the flowback water samples. The
   presence of natural buffer systems such as calcite and dolomite may
   explain the neutral pH range of the flowback water. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Controlling thermal emission with refractory epsilon-near-zero
   metamaterials via topological transitions}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Control of thermal radiation at high temperatures is vital for waste
   heat recovery and for high-efficiency thermophotovoltaic (TPV)
   conversion. Previously, structural resonances utilizing gratings, thin
   film resonances, metasurfaces and photonic crystals were used to
   spectrally control thermal emission, often requiring lithographic
   structuring of the surface and causing significant angle dependence. In
   contrast, here, we demonstrate a refractory W-HfO2 metamaterial, which
   controls thermal emission through an engineered dielectric response
   function. The epsilon-near-zero frequency of a metamaterial and the
   connected optical topological transition (OTT) are adjusted to
   selectively enhance and suppress the thermal emission in the
   near-infrared spectrum, crucial for improved TPV efficiency. The
   near-omnidirectional and spectrally selective emitter is obtained as the
   emission changes due to material properties and not due to resonances or
   interference effects, marking a paradigm shift in thermal engineering
   approaches. We experimentally demonstrate the OTT in a thermally stable
   metamaterial at high temperatures of 1,000 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Providing more realistic reliability prediction based on small
   proportion of failed population or test data has always been a
   challenging task. Manufacturers rely heavily on reliability prediction
   for designing warranty plan. Furthermore, to predict warranty claims for
   the remaining warranty period, it is important to have more realistic
   reliability assessment by considering a larger proportion of the
   population or the maximum possible information on the remaining
   population. However, generally this information is not readily available
   and is very difficult to gather on the scattered population. In this
   work, we propose to use customer usage rate profile to generate censored
   usage data on the remaining population that do not have any failure and
   warranty claims yet. We intend to use field data available such as
   warranty claims, field failures, recall data, and maintenance data to
   develop usage rate profile and subsequently estimate censored usage
   time. Finally, reliability estimation methodology is developed
   considering both censored data and field failure data to provide more
   reasonable reliability prediction for the remaining warranty period. The
   proposed methodology is demonstrated considering real-life data from a
   big manufacturing company.}},

Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{43-56}},

Abstract = {{There is an interest in increasing the energy efficiency of residential
   housing and sometimes achieving net-zero structures. Effective materials
   such as spray urethane offer benefits in terms of greater thermal
   resistance as well as reduction in uncontrolled air leakage. Increased
   envelope resistance without greatly increasing wall thickness can be a
   positive feature for a low-energy structure. In this paper, potential
   hygrothermal performance of five wall panels with different insulation
   configurations is studied by field experimentation. The five
   configurations of insulation materials are fibreglass, spray foam,
   fibreglass with Structural Insulated Sheathing, spray foam EPS rigid
   insulation, and fibreglass with EPS insulation. The panels are installed
   side-by-side in a test house; thermocouples and relative humidity
   sensors are installed. The thermal performance of the panels, humidity
   levels inside wall cavities, and risk of mold growth are investigated.
   For further investigation, four homes are constructed, each with one of
   four potential wall configuration, and studied under occupancy. The
   experimental results from the building science ``building physics{''}
   point of view are obtained: wood stud is a thermal bridge on north walls
   but a thermal mass on west walls; and air cavity in spray foam wall does
   not generate negative heat convection but increases wall insulation. (C)

Abstract = {{A full-scale permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based wind
   turbine with dc-link voltage control via the machine-side converter has
   the potential to provide inherent low-voltage ride-through (LVRT)

   control on the stability and risk of resonance, successful operation,
   and fatigue in a full-scale PMSG-based wind power generation system. An
   analytical model, considering the double-mass nature of the
   turbine/generator and typical LVRT requirements, is developed,
   validated, and used to characterize the dynamic performance of the wind
   generation system under LVRT control and practical generator
   characteristics. To enhance the operation and reduce the fatigue under
   LVRT control, two solutions, based on active damping control and dc-link
   voltage bandwidth retuning, are proposed, analyzed, and compared. The
   detailed nonlinear time-domain simulation results validate the accuracy

Pages = {{98-110}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The involvement of the human amygdala in emotion-related processing has
   been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for many
   years. However, despite the amygdala being comprised of several
   subnuclei, most studies investigated the role of the entire amygdala in
   processing of emotions. Here we combined a novel anatomical tracing
   protocol with event-related high-resolution fMRI acquisition to study
   the responsiveness of the amygdala subnuclei to negative emotional
   stimuli and to examine intra-amygdala functional connectivity. The
   greatest sensitivity to the negative emotional stimuli was observed in
   the centromedial amygdala, where the hemodynamic response amplitude
   elicited by the negative emotional stimuli was greater and peaked later
   than for neutral stimuli. Connectivity patterns converge with extant
   findings in animals, such that the centromedial amygdala was more
   connected with the nuclei of the basal amygdala than with the lateral
   amygdala. Current findings provide evidence of functional specialization
   within the human amygdala. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Conventional 2-D US assessment of DDH has limitations, including high
   inter-scan variability. We quantified DDH on 3-D US using the acetabular
   contact angle (ACA), a property of the 3-D acetabular shape. We assessed
   ACA reliability and diagnostic utility.
   We prospectively collected data from January 2013 to December 2014,
   including 114 hips in 85 children divided into three clinical diagnostic
   groups: (1) normal, (2) initially borderline but ultimately normal
   without treatment and (3) dysplastic requiring treatment. Using custom
   software, two observers each traced acetabula twice on two 3-D US scans
   of each hip, enabling automated generation of 3-D surface models and ACA
   calculation. We computed inter-observer and inter-scan variability of
   repeatability coefficients and generated receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves.
   The 3-D US acetabular contact angle was reproduced 95\% of the time
   within 6A degrees in the same scan and within 9A degrees in different
   scans of the same hip, vs. 9A degrees and 14A degrees for the 2-D US
   alpha angle (P < 0.001). Areas under ROC curves for diagnosis of
   developmental dysplasia of the hip were 0.954 for ACA and 0.927 for
   alpha angle.
   The 3-D US ACA was significantly more reliable than 2-D US alpha angle,
   and the 3-D US measurement predicted the presence of DDH with slightly
   higher accuracy. The ACA therefore shows promising initial diagnostic
   utility. Our findings call for further study of 3-D US in the diagnosis
   and longer-term follow-up of infant hip dysplasia.}},

Abstract = {{The self-weight consolidation of oil sands tailings and kaolinite slurry
   is modelled using a new geotechnical beam centrifuge located at the
   University of Alberta (Geomechanical Reservoir Engineering Facility
   (GeoREF) centrifuge). The centrifuge is used to create a
   prototype-effective stress regime in the model, and centrifuge tests are
   conducted at different initial compositions at acceleration levels of 40
   to 100g. The objectives of the centrifuge tests are to study the
   long-term consolidation behaviour, derive consolidation parameters,
   verify modelling procedures and to evaluate time-domain reflectometry
   application for solids content profile monitoring during centrifuge
   testing. The interface settlement, pore pressure and solids content
   profiles of the consolidating materials are monitored in-flight. Large
   strain consolidation parameters are derived from centrifuge tests and
   compared with parameters determined from a large strain consolidometer.
   The paper describes the modelling aspect as well as the instrumentation
   and monitoring of centrifuge tests. The centrifuge results are
   presented, discussed and compared using results from large strain
   numerical models.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model has been developed employing an orthogonal stream-tube
   gridding system for the investigation of mixing patterns in meandering
   rivers. The proposed model couples field data and modeling. It uses a
   measured velocity field to solve the advection-diffusion equation. This
   equation provides a practical simulation with greater accuracy and lower
   computational cost for estimation of mixing in meandering channels with
   a long, full mixing length. The model has been used to estimate the
   transverse mixing coefficient in surveyed subreaches of the North
   Saskatchewan River in Canada. Good agreement was observed between the
   numerical and measured tracer concentrations using reasonable values for
   the transverse mixing coefficient. The average dimensionless transverse
   mixing coefficient from the calibrated numerical model for the surveyed
   reach was 0.39, which was consistent with values estimated using
   empirical formulas for transverse mixing coefficients in natural
   meandering rivers. The estimated transverse mixing coefficient was more
   than an order of magnitude higher in a subreach with a sharp bend than
   in other subreaches. For comparison, the transverse mixing coefficient
   was also calculated analytically from standard and general methods of
   moments between some sections. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Modern techniques for expanding stem cells play a substantial role in
   tissue engineering: the raw material that facilitates regeneration of
   damaged tissues and treats diseases. The environmental conditions and
   bioprocessing methods are the primary determinants of the rate of
   cultured stem cell proliferation. Bioceramic scaffolds made of calcium
   phosphate are effective substrates for optimal cell proliferation. The
   present study investigates the effects of two bioceramic scaffolds on
   proliferating cells in culture media. One scaffold was made of
   hydroxyapatite and the other was a mixture of hydroxyapatite and
   ferromagnetic material (Fe3O4 nanoparticles). Disk-shaped (10 mm x 2 mm)
   samples of the two scaffolds were prepared. Primary human fibroblast
   proliferation was 1.8- and 2.5-fold faster, respectively, when cultured
   in the presence of hydroxyapatite or ferrous nanoparticle/hydroxyapatite
   mixtures. Optical microscopy images revealed that the increased
   proliferation was due to enhanced cell-cell contact. The presence of
   magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the ceramic scaffolds significantly
   increased cell proliferation compared to hydroxyapatite scaffolds and

Abstract = {{Three types of magnesia (MgO) with varying reactivity were used to

   indicated that MgO with high reactivity had high activating efficacy for

   however, excessive MgO with high reactivity also had negative effect on
   its strength performance. Hence, low content of MgO with high reactivity

Abstract = {{Selected papers presented at the 19(th) International Conference on
   Hydrotransport (HYDROTRANSPORT 19, Golden, CO, 24-26 September 2014) are
   published as a special section in this issue. The transport of
   solid-liquid mixtures (or slurries) in pipelines or in open-channel flow
   is ubiquitous in Canada's mining, mineral processing, and oil sands
   industries. In particular, processes designed to produce dewatered waste
   tailings, which are crucial components in any strategy to reduce land
   disturbance and minimize water usage, involve the transport and
   deposition of complex, highly non-Newtonian, settling mixtures. The
   specific focus of each study in this special issue section varies quite
   widely, ranging from a historical perspective on slurry flow modelling
   to fluid-structure interactions during pump operation. The papers
   presented, though, are united in that they contribute to step-change
   improvements in the ability to understand slurry flow behaviour through
   model development and advanced measurement techniques.}},

   quiescent, non-Newtonian fluid is often required for analysis of
   fluid-particle systems, e.g. the design and operation of slurry
   pipelines and solid-liquid separation processes. Wilson et al. presented
   a direct method that was able to provide reasonable predictions of the
   terminal settling velocity of a sphere in a fluid with a yield stress.
   This method is somewhat limited in its applicability: if the fluid yield
   stress is greater than the calculated reference shear stress, the
   correlation cannot produce a prediction of terminal settling velocity.
   Measurements of terminal fall velocities of precision spheres in
   quiescent Kaolinite-water suspensions were collected in the present
   study. Kaolinite volume concentrations were 10.6-21.7 \%
   (0.106-0.217L/L) resulting in suspension yield stresses of 1.3-30Pa.
   Both Casson and Bingham models were satisfactory for modelling the
   clay-water mixture rheology. An analogy of the Wilson-Thomas analysis
   for the pipe flow of non-Newtonian fluids was used to develop a new
   method for predicting terminal settling velocity of a sphere in a
   viscoplastic fluid. The new method does not have the limitations of the
   Wilson et al. method, and also provides more accurate predictions. The
   experimental results obtained here show that further research is needed
   to better characterize particle behaviour at low shear Reynolds numbers
   (Re{*}<10).}},

Abstract = {{Information granules, along with their processing constitute a core of
   granular computing, which provides a unified conceptual and algorithmic
   framework for designing and analyzing intelligent systems. In this
   study, we engage a principle of justifiable granularity as a way of
   forming type-1 and type-2 information granules-granular interval-valued
   information granules, whose descriptors are intervals themselves rather
   than numeric entities. A two-phase design process is presented: first,
   intervals (viz. information granules of type-1) are constructed based on
   available experimental data. Second, considering the data that have not
   been ``covered{''} by the intervals (the data one can refer to as
   residual granular data), we construct their bounds in the form of
   information granules (instead of numeric values) thereby giving rise to
   the concept of granular intervals, namely information granules of
   type-2. A series of experiments are provided that focus on sensor fusion
   formed with the aid of information granules and granular system modeling
   of type-1 and type-2.}},

Abstract = {{A crossover operator in genetic algorithms (GAs) plays an essential role
   as the main search operator to breed offspring by exchanging information
   between individuals. Although different types of crossover operators
   have been developed for real-coded GAs (RCGAs), there has been very
   little research on combining different crossover operators to build more
   effective and efficient RCGAs. In this work, we propose new steady-state
   generation alternation-based RCGAs (SSGAs) ameliorated with (i) an
   ensemble of different probabilistic variable-wise crossover strategies,
   which is realized by the corresponding parallel populations, to utilize
   synergetic and complementary effect with their efficient operations, and
   (ii) efficient operation at each evolution step to obtain further
   performance enhancement. To investigate the performance of this ensemble
   with respect to search abilities and computation time, we compare the
   proposed algorithms against various SSGAs when running 27 benchmark
   functions. Empirical studies showed that the proposed algorithms exhibit
   better performance than the contestant SSGAs on these functions.
   Moreover, a comparison with the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms
   on eight difficult benchmark functions clearly demonstrated
   outperformance of the proposed algorithms.}},

   measurement, relative degree analysis and sensitivity analysis between
   measured outputs and states. Considerations with respect to time-scale

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new sensorless capacitor voltage balancing
   strategy for modular multilevel converters (MMCs) to effectively balance
   the submodule capacitor voltages in a wide range of switching
   frequencies. The proposed strategy is realized via a balancing unit
   equipped with a hierarchical permutation cyclic coding (PCC) method to
   evenly distribute the switching gate signals among the submodules of
   each arm within a permutation time. The proposed strategy balances the
   submodule capacitor voltages to track their reference values with low
   voltage ripple in a wide range of switching frequencies. It remarkably
   enhances the converter system reliability, especially for a large number
   of submodules, because the need to measure the submodule capacitor
   voltages in each arm is eliminated. The proposed hierarchical PCC
   algorithm is decoupled from other standard control loops in an MMC.
   Digital time-domain simulation studies are conducted on a 21-level MMC
   to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in high and low
   switching frequencies under balanced and unbalanced load conditions. In
   addition, the proposed method is implemented in the FPGA-based RT-LAB
   real-time simulator platform to validate its performance in a
   hardware-in-the-loop setup.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Study region: This study spans the Prairie/parkland/boreal transition in
   central Alberta, including lakes in the Athabasca, North Saskatchewan,
   Battle River and Red Deer Basins.
   Study focus: Stable isotopes of water, oxygen-18 and deuterium, were
   measured in a network of 50 lakes during 2008 and 2009. The lakes are
   the subject of recent concern due to widespread lake level decline and
   development of eutrophic conditions that have been attributed to climate
   and land-use impacts. An isotope mass balance method was applied to
   estimate evaporation/inflow, water yield, and water residence times to
   assess relationships between water balance and lake status.
   New hydrological insights: Water yield was found to range from near 0 to
   235 mm, evaporation/inflow was found to range from 18 to 136 \%, and
   water residence time ranged from 2.3 to 58 years. The healthiest lakes
   in terms of trophic status are deep lakes with smaller catchments with
   long residence times. These lakes may have stable or variable water
   levels. Distressed lakes are often shallow prairie lakes with limited
   inflow and shorter residence times, and situated in areas with higher
   evaporation rates. High conductivity and high sulfate in some eutrophic
   lakes, attributed to saline groundwater inflow, may inhibit algae and
   cyanobacterial growth, thereby promoting healthier conditions. Extended
   drought under climate warming is expected to cause eventual decline of
   water levels in a greater number of lakes. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Designing information granules used intensively in Granular Computing is
   of paramount relevance to the fundamentals of the discipline.
   Information granules are key functional components in granular models,
   granular classifiers, and granular decision-making models. The design of
   information granules is central to the discipline of Granular Computing.
   In this study, we introduce a way of designing information granules by
   combining the mechanisms of unsupervised and supervised learning and
   subsequently using the principle of justifiable granularity. An overall
   design process consists of two phases. First, the granulation process
   involves hierarchical clustering or K-means clustering. It is followed
   by a parametric refinement of information granules realized by the
   principle of justifiable granularity. The characterization of
   information granules is offered in terms of measures of coverage,
   specificity, and entropy. Experimental results including synthetic data
   and publicly available data are covered to demonstrate the performance
   of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundChildhood cancer survivors show evidence of diffuse myocardial
   fibrosis that is related to exercise capacity. The mechanism of reduced
   exercise tolerance in anthracycline cardiotoxicity remains unclear. We
   explored the determinants of exercise intolerance by evaluating left
   ventricular (LV) distensibility and functional reserve.
   MethodsPatients (n=22) and healthy controls (n=10) underwent
   two-dimensional echocardiography while supine, upright, and during cycle
   exercise. LV distensibility was measured as the change in end-diastolic
   cavity area (EDCA) from supine to the upright position. LV functional
   reserve was assessed during peak exercise, and measured as the
   exercise-induced change in systolic circumferential strain rate (SR) and
   early-diastolic SR (EDSR). The peak rate of oxygen consumption was
   measured by indirect calorimetry.
   ResultsMedian age of patients was 16 years (range 8-19) and controls 14
   years (range 8-19). Median time since anthracycline therapy was 6years
   (range 2-16). Peak oxygen consumption was significantly lower in
   patients compared to controls (35ml/kg/min {[}28-60] vs. 45ml/kg/min
   {[}44-53], P=0.005). Transitioning from the supine position to the
   upright position caused a similar reduction in LV EDCA, suggesting
   similar LV distensibility between patients (-22\% {[}-46 to -4]) and
   controls (-20\% {[}-46 to -3], P=0.3). However, during exercise, both
   systolic SR and EDSR reserve were significantly impaired in patients
   (SR: 93\% {[}14-308], EDSR: -4.5\% {[}-88 to 121]) compared to controls
   (SR: 128\% {[}54-230], P=0.046; EDSR: 74\% {[}22-234], P=0.02).
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that impaired LV contractility and
   functional reserve play a role in the reduced exercise capacity in
   anthracycline cardiotoxicity rather than LV distensibility.}},

Abstract = {{We used isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics simulation to study the
   diffusivity of a hydrophobic drug Cucurbitacin B (CuB) in polymer
   matrices made up of a single polyethylene oxide-b-polycaprolactone
   (PEO-b-PCL) chain and different numbers of water molecules at body
   temperature (310 K) and ambient pressure (1 bar). Four PEO-b-PCL models
   were used. Three of them had the same total molecular weight of 3750
   g/mol but different PCL/PEO weight ratios at 0.5, 1 and 2. The remaining
   model had a total molecular weight of 5000 g/mol and a PCL/PEO weight
   ratio of 1. The data showed that self-diffusion coefficients of CuB
   decreased with increasing PCL/PEO weight ratio and was insensitive to
   the water concentration at fixed PCL/PEO weight ratios. The first
   observation was attributed to a high number of hydrogen bonds formed
   between the oxygen atoms on CuB and the activated hydrogen atoms on the
   PCL block as the PCL/PEO weight ratio increased. It was found that
   degree of swelling and effects of the mobility of the PEO and PCL blocks
   on the diffusivity of CuB were minor and were overshadowed by the PCL
   block-CuB hydrogen bonds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Three dimensional visualization of solvent chamber growth during the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{46-67}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{VAPEX is a non-thermal process proposed as an alternative to SAGD due to
   its applicability in thinner reservoirs, advantage of energy efficiency,
   produced oil quality, and environmental saving. Its high cost caused by
   the injected solvent, however, requires further efforts to optimize the
   process. This, in turn, entails a clear understanding of the physics of
   the process. To acquire this understanding, a 3-D visualization
   technique was applied to a VAPEX model packed with glass beads. The oil
   saturated porous media and the solvent injected into the model processed
   refractive indices matched with the glass beads, which made the model
   transparent. Laser illuminated the yellow fluorescent dye dissolved in
   the solvent to distinguish it from the oil. Two high-speed cameras
   recorded the process from two sides of the model while a laser sheet
   moved along the model.
   A dome-shaped solvent chamber with viscous fingering on its top was
   observed. The injection pressure influenced the size of the chamber
   especially in the horizontal direction, which was not possible to
   identify through standard 2-D tests. Also, the solvent spread along the
   ceiling of the model and then displaced the oil down. The boundary of
   the solvent and oil was tilted and even curved at different injection
   rates. Finally, variable injection rate cases were compared with
   constant rate trials and an optimum operation plan was proposed through
   the analysis of the production rate, produced oil quality, and 3-D
   images of the chamber growth. (C)) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The potential of aerosol phage therapy for treating lung infections has
   been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. This work
   compared the performance of two dry powder formation techniques, spray
   freeze drying (SFD) and spray drying (SD), in producing inhalable phage
   powders.
   A Pseudomonas podoviridae phage, PEV2, was incorporated into
   multi-component formulation systems consisting of trehalose, mannitol
   and L-leucine (F1 = 60:20:20 and F2 = 40:40:20). The phage titer loss
   after the SFD and SD processes and in vitro aerosol performance of the
   produced powders were assessed.
   A significant titer loss (similar to 2 log) was noted for droplet
   generation using an ultrasonic nozzle employed in the SFD method, but
   the conventional two-fluid nozzle used in the SD method was less
   destructive for the phage (similar to 0.75 log loss). The phage were
   more vulnerable during the evaporative drying process (similar to 0.75
   log further loss) compared with the freeze drying step, which caused
   negligible phage loss. In vitro aerosol performance showed that the SFD
   powders (similar to 80\% phage recovery) provided better phage
   protection than the SD powders (similar to 20\% phage recovery) during
   the aerosolization process. Despite this, higher total lung doses were
   obtained for the SD formulations (SD-F1 = 13.1 +/- 1.7 x 10(4) pfu and
   SD-F2 = 11.0 +/- 1.4 x 10(4) pfu) than from their counterpart SFD
   formulations (SFD-F1 = 8.3 +/- 1.8 x 10(4) pfu and SFD-F2 = 2.1 +/- 0.3
   x 10(4) pfu).
   Overall, the SD method caused less phage reduction during the powder
   formation process and the resulted powders achieved better aerosol
   performance for PEV2.}},

Abstract = {{The development of embedded de-icing elements for polymer-based
   composite materials, coupled with mathematical models that describe
   their performance, is of interest to the aerospace, communications, and
   energy industries. Nickel-chromium-aluminum-yttrium (NiCrAlY) coatings
   were deposited on to fiber-reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) plates by
   using a flame spraying process. Electric current was supplied to the
   metal alloy coatings to generate energy by way of Joule heating (or
   resistive heating) and to enable the coatings to act as heating elements
   for the FRPC structures. De-icing tests were performed at ambient
   temperatures of 5 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 25 degrees C, after
   liquid water was sprayed on the samples. Heat transfer models were
   developed to predict the heating and melting times of the ice during the
   de-icing process with the flame-sprayed coatings. The models were based
   on the separation of variables method for a finite length-scale melting
   problem and Stefan's problem applied to a semi-infinite medium. It was
   found that a coating that was on the order of 100 mu m thick was
   effective for melting accumulated ice on polymer composite structures
   that were exposed to cold environments. The results of the finite
   length-scale model and its agreement with experimental data suggest that
   a heat conduction model based on the separation of variables method may
   be applied to free boundary problems to predict phase change phenomena
   induced by thermal-sprayed coatings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Minimal paths (MPs) play an important role in network reliability
   evaluation. In this paper, we report an efficient recursive algorithm
   for finding all MPs in two-terminal networks, which consist of a source
   node and a sink node. A linked path structure indexed by nodes is
   introduced, which accepts both directed and undirected form of networks.
   The distance between each node and the sink node is defined, and a
   simple recursive algorithm is presented for labeling the distance for
   each node. Based on the distance between each node and the sink node,
   additional conditions for backtracking are incorporated to reduce the
   number of search branches. With the newly introduced linked node
   structure, the distances between each node and the sink node, and the
   additional backtracking conditions, an improved backtracking algorithm
   for searching for all MPs is developed. In addition, the proposed
   algorithm can be adapted to search for all minimal paths for each
   source-sink pair in networks consisting of multiple source nodes and/or
   multiple sink nodes. Through computational experiments, it is
   demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing
   algorithms when the network size is not too small. The proposed
   algorithm becomes more advantageous as the size of the network grows.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{370}},
Pages = {{372-393}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Rolling element bearings are key components of planetary gearboxes.
   Among them, the motion of planet bearings is very complex, encompassing
   spinning and revolution. Therefore, planet bearing vibrations are highly
   intricate and their fault characteristics are completely different from
   those of fixed-axis case, making planet bearing fault diagnosis a
   difficult topic. In order to address this issue, we derive the explicit
   equations for calculating the characteristic frequency of outer race,
   rolling element and inner race fault, considering the complex motion of
   planet bearings. We also develop the planet bearing vibration signal
   model for each fault case, considering the modulation effects of load
   zone passing, time-varying angle between the gear pair mesh and fault
   induced impact force, as well as the time-varying vibration transfer
   path. Based on the developed signal models, we derive the explicit
   equations of Fourier spectrum in each fault case, and summarize the
   vibration spectral characteristics respectively. The theoretical
   derivations are illustrated by numerical simulation, and further
   validated experimentally and all the three fault cases (i.e. outer race,
   rolling element and inner race localized fault) are diagnosed. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In the present work, superhydrophobic silver surface was prepared by
   immersing a copper plate in an aqueous solution of AgNO3 for 20 min. The
   sample exhibits superhydrophilicity after dried at 150 degrees C for 30
   min in an oven. The as-prepared silver surfaces exhibit contact angle
   (CA) larger than 160 degrees and sliding angle (SA) lower than 5
   degrees. Neither low surface free energy (SFE) materials nor organic
   compounds were used during the producing process. It was suggested that
   the spontaneously adsorbed carbon contaminant with low SFE was very
   critical for the superhydrophobicity of silver surface during heat
   treatment. Additionally, the silver surface could be switched between
   superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity by alternating UV
   irradiation and heat treatment for many times. Our findings in this work
   might provide a simple route to rational control the spontaneously
   adsorbed carbon contaminant on solid surface to endow the metal or other
   solid surfaces with superhydrophobicity or superhydrophilicity. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Many medical and industrial applications require high-purity oxygen.
   Because of the similar physical properties of oxygen and argon, this
   separation is very challenging, and very few commercial adsorbents offer
   the ability to separate the two gases. Silver-exchanged titanosilicates
   (Ag-ETS-10) have the potential to separate these gases based on their
   adsorption affinities. In this work, adsorption isotherms of O-2, Ar,
   and N-2 on Ag-ETS-10 extrudates have been measured using a volumetric
   technique and described using a Langmuir isotherm. Single, binary, and
   ternary breakthrough profiles were measured using a laboratory-scale
   dynamic column breakthrough apparatus. These profiles have been modeled
   by writing mass and energy balances that are solved using the finite
   volume technique. The model was able to predict the experimental
   profiles to a high degree of accuracy. A simple vacuum swing adsorption
   process was simulated using mathematical models to demonstrate the
   potential of the material to produce high-purity oxygen. Multiobjective
   optimization to maximize O-2 purity and recovery from a feed containing
   95\% O-2 and 5\% Ar revealed that purities in excess of 99.0\% can be
   achieved at a recovery of 11.35\%.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{21}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Lab-on-a-Chip compatible techniques for thermal characterization of
   miniaturized volumes of liquid analytes are necessary in applications
   such as protein blotting, DNA melting, and drug development, where
   samples are either rare or volume-limited. We developed a closed-chamber
   calorimeter based on a bimaterial microchannel cantilever (BMC) for
   sub-nanoliter level thermal analysis. When the liquid-filled BMC is
   irradiated with infrared (IR) light at a specific wavelength, the IR
   absorption by the liquid analyte results in localized heat generation
   and the subsequent deflection of the BMC, due to a thermal expansion
   mismatch between the constituent materials. The time constant of the
   deflection, which is dependent upon the heat capacity of the liquid
   analyte, can be directly measured by recording the time-dependent
   bending of the BMC. We have used the BMC to quantitatively measure the
   heat capacity of five volatile organic compounds. With a deflection
   noise level of similar to 10 nm and a signal-to-noise ratio of 68: 1,
   the BMC offers a sensitivity of 30.5 ms/(J g(-1) K-1) and a resolution
   of 23 mJ/(g K) for similar to 150 pl liquid for heat capacity
   measurements. This technique can be used for small-scale thermal
   characterization of different chemical and biological samples. Published

Abstract = {{Dynamic evolution of liquid/liquid/solid contact line at micrometer
   length scale, corresponding to the Bond number Bo similar to 0, was
   investigated in a system with tuneable interfacial properties. Viscous
   oil was spontaneously displaced by water on a micron size spherical
   glass surface. By controlling wettability of the substrate and chemistry
   of surrounding aqueous solution, the displacement dynamics of three
   phase contact lines over a wide range of capillary numbers were studied.
   The rates of spontaneous oil displacement showed a strong dependence on
   fluid viscosity and interfacial properties of the system. The observed
   wetting dynamics were modeled using hydrodynamic and molecular-kinetic
   theory. Energy dissipation in the immediate neighborhood of the contact
   line was shown to determine the wetting dynamics of our micron scale
   experiments, even when capillary numbers were well above 10(-4) in which
   hydrodynamic flow regime could be usually expected for conventional
   macroscopic systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To protect data communication from eavesdropper nodes, different
   techniques have been developed to improve the physical-layer security
   (PLS) of communications systems. Destination-based cooperative
   signalling (DBCS) is one of such techniques where the destination sends
   an intended artificial noise to the untrusted listeners helping to
   protect the source message from being captured reliably at
   eavesdroppers. In this study, the authors investigate the application of
   DBCS to improve the PLS, and as a consequence the secrecy performance of
   a two-hop amplify-and-forward cooperative system with an untrusted
   relay. To get the best performance out of DBCS, the transmit power of
   the source's signal as well as the artificial noise should be carefully
   adjusted. To address this, they have introduced the optimal power
   allocation to maximise the secrecy rate of the system under a sum-power
   constraint at the network nodes. For a system with large-scale antenna
   arrays at the base station, then then find the closed-form solution for
   the secrecy outage probability and the ergodic secrecy rate of the
   optimised system for both uplink and downlink. The presented simulation
   results validate the authors' theoretical analysis and reveal that the
   proposed DBCS with optimal power allocation significantly improves the
   secrecy performance of the system.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviors and molecular interactions of asphaltenes are related to
   many challenging issues in oil production. In this study, the molecular
   interaction mechanism of asphaltenes in Heptol solvents of varying
   toluene/n-heptane ratio were directly measured using a surface forces
   apparatus (SFA). The results showed that the interactions between
   asphaltene surfaces gradually changed from pure repulsion to weak
   adhesion as the weight ratio of toluene (omega) in Heptol decreased from
   omega = 1 to 0. The measured repulsion was mainly due to the steric
   interactions between swelling asphaltene molecules and/aggregates. The
   micropipet technique was applied to test the stability of two
   water-in-oil emulsion droplets attached to glass pipettes. A
   computer-controlled 4-roll mill fluidic device was also built in-house
   to investigate the interaction of free-suspending water-in-oil emulsions
   under dynamic flow conditions. Both micropipet and 4-roll mill fluidic
   tests demonstrate that asphaltenes adsorbed at oil/water interfaces play
   a critical role in stabilizing the emulsion drops, in agreement with the
   repulsion measured between asphaltene surfaces in toluene using SFA, and
   that interfacial sliding or shearing is generally required to
   destabilize the protective interfacial apshaltene layers which
   facilitates the coalescence of emulsion drops. Our results provide
   insights into the fundamental understanding of molecular interaction
   mechanisms of asphaltenes in organic solvents and
   stabilization/destabilization behaviors of water-in-oil emulsions with
   asphaltenes.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced inhibition of spinal motoneurons by sensory pathways may
   contribute to heightened reflex activity, spasticity and impaired motor
   function in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). To measure if the
   activation of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) by sensory
   inputs is reduced in CP, the tonic discharge rate of single motor units
   from the soleus muscle was plotted time-locked to the occurrence of a
   sensory stimulation to produce peri-stimulus frequencygrams (PSFs).
   Stimulation to the medial arch of the foot was used to activate
   cutaneomuscular afferents in 17 adults with bilateral spastic CP and 15
   neurologically intact (NI) peers. Evidence of IPSP activation from the
   PSF profiles, namely a marked pause or reduction in motor unit firing
   rates at the onset of the cutaneomuscular reflex, was found in all NI
   participants but in only half of participants with CP. In the other half
   of the participants with CP, stimulation of cutaneomuscular afferents
   produced a PSF profile indicative of a pure excitatory post-synaptic
   potential, with firing rates increasing above the mean pre-stimulus rate
   for 300 ms or more. The amplitude of motoneuron inhibition during the
   period of IPSP activation, as measured from the surface EMG, was less in
   participants with poor motor function as evaluated with the Gross Motor
   Functional Classification System (r = 0.72, P < 0.001) and the
   Functional Mobility Scale (r = -0.82, P < 0.001). These findings

Abstract = {{The degradation of cyclohexanoic acid (CHA) as a model compound of
   naphthenic acid (NA) was investigated in this study by a
   nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) - modified Fenton process at pH 8. The
   optimum doses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Fe(III)NTA (NTA:Fe = 2:1)
   were 4.41 mM and 0.27 mM, respectively. CHA degradation reached a
   plateau within 4 h under these conditions. The degradation of CHA was
   influenced primarily by the dose of H2O2, while the concentration of
   Fe(III)NTA complex primarily influenced the reaction time. The
   second-order rate constants of hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) with
   CHA and with NTA were investigated using a competition-kinetics method
   and obtained as 4.09 +/- 0.39 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) and 4.77 +/- 0.24 x
   10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively. (OH)-O-center dot radical was the main
   responsible species for CHA degradation, while O-center dot(2)- radical
   played a minor role. The reaction of CHA with O-center dot(2)- radical
   generated by potassium superoxide (KO2) in dimethyl sulfoxide
   (DMSO)/water solution was investigated for the first time. The reaction
   mechanisms of the NTA-modified Fenton process were proposed and
   discussed based on the discovery that no Fe(III)NTA was detected in the
   system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The matter in extreme conditions end station at the Linac Coherent Light
   Source (LCLS) is a new tool enabling accurate pump-probe measurements
   for studying the physical properties of matter in the high-energy
   density (HED) physics regime. This instrument combines the world's
   brightest x-ray source, the LCLS x-ray beam, with high-power lasers
   consisting of two nanosecond Nd:glass laser beams and one short-pulse
   Ti:sapphire laser. These lasers produce short-lived states of matter
   with high pressures, high temperatures or high densities with properties
   that are important for applications in nuclear fusion research,
   laboratory astrophysics and the development of intense radiation
   sources. In the first experiments, we have performed highly accurate
   x-ray diffraction and x-ray Thomson scattering measurements on
   shock-compressed matter resolving the transition from compressed solid
   matter to a co-existence regime and into the warm dense matter state.
   These complex charged-particle systems are dominated by strong
   correlations and quantum effects. They exist in planetary interiors and
   laboratory experiments, e.g., during high-power laser interactions with
   solids or the compression phase of inertial confinement fusion
   implosions. Applying record peak brightness x-rays resolves the ionic
   interactions at atomic (Angstrom) scale lengths and measure the static
   structure factor, which is a key quantity for determining equation of
   state data and important transport coefficients. Simultaneously,
   spectrally resolved measurements of plasmon features provide dynamic
   structure factor information that yield temperature and density with
   unprecedented precision at micron-scale resolution in dynamic
   compression experiments. These studies have demonstrated our ability to
   measure fundamental thermodynamic properties that determine the state of
   matter in the HED physics regime.}},

Title = {{Predicting equivalent settling area factor in hydrocyclones; a method
   for determining tangential velocity profile}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{341-351}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the equivalent settling area of the hydrocyclones is
   important for selection and design of the device. It also allows
   comparison of hydrocyclone to other separators that work using a similar
   concept. A mathematical model based on the physics of the separation
   phenomenon in the hydrocyclone is developed to predict the equivalent
   area factor of the hydrocyclone. The effect of the overflow and inlet
   diameters on the hydrocyclone performance are evaluated and it is shown
   that changing the overflow diameter has more effect on the equivalent
   area factor than the inlet diameter. The equivalent settling area model
   (ESAM) is validated with experimental data from experiments using a 50
   mm diameter hydrocyclone and glass bead particles. Good agreement
   between ESAM and the experiments is observed. An advantage of ESAM is
   that it can be used to estimate the tangential velocity profile in a
   hydrocyclone. A method of predicting the tangential velocity profile on
   the basis of equivalent settling area without performing velocity
   measurement is detailed and examined for an experimental velocity
   profile. This allows the ESAM to be used as a framework for design of
   the hydrocyclone devices. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Linear programming-based scenario reduction using transportation
   distance}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{50-58}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{One of the major difficulties for scenario-based decision-making
   problems (e.g. stochastic programming using scenarios) is that the
   problem complexity quickly increases as the number of scenarios
   increases. Scenario reduction aims at selecting a small number of
   scenarios to represent a large set of scenarios for decision making, so
   as to significantly reduce the computational complexity while preserving
   the solution quality of using a large number of scenarios. In this work,
   a new computationally efficient scenario reduction algorithm is proposed
   based on transportation distance minimization. The proposed algorithm
   relies on solving linear programming problems. The scenario subset
   updating step and the probability value assignment step are performed in
   an iterative manner until the transportation distance converges.
   Comparison with existing scenario reduction methods reveals that the
   proposed method is very efficient for the reduction of large scenario
   set. Application studies on stochastic optimization problems also
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The conception, design, and implementation of sustainable development
   strategies in an organization aims at meeting and balancing economic,
   social, and environmental needs of internal and external stakeholders.
   While the principles and fundamentals of sustainability assist during
   the conception and design phases, the implementation process of
   management strategies - impacted directly or indirectly by internal and
   external factors - may identify areas of competitive advantages or
   challenges that would impede the projects and organizations' performance
   targets. An organization is not an isolated entity and its performance
   is often compared against others in the market arena; therefore,
   assessment tools, benchmarking processes, and reporting strategies
   become essential for the understanding of the efforts made towards the
   implementation of plan, policies, and programs at the organization and
   project levels. A framework for a hybrid process-criterion benchmarking
   methodology is proposed in this paper. The framework integrates the Rank
   Xerox benchmarking process and the Wa-Pa-Su project sustainability
   rating system assessment methodology. The proposed hybrid
   process-criterion benchmarking methodology encourages the
   diversification in the development and implementation of sustainable and
   environmental rating systems in industry contexts (e.g., oil and gas,
   mining, heavy industrial, and energy) and aims for the improvement of
   existing sustainability performance assessment and reporting practices.
   It also assists the quantitative assessment process of advances and/or
   setbacks in sustainability performance and the implementation of
   continuous performance improvement programs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a visual servoing control for a quadrotor
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which is based on a state transformation
   technique. The UAV is equipped with a single downwards facing camera,
   and the motion control objective is the regulation of relative
   displacement and yaw to a stationary visual target located on the
   ground. The state transformation is defined by a system of partial
   differential equations (PDEs) which eliminate roll and pitch rate
   dependence in the transformed image feature kinematics. A method for
   computing the general solutions of these PDEs is given, and we show a
   particular solution reduces to an established virtual camera approach.
   We treat point and line cases and introduce image moment features
   defined in the virtual camera image plane. Robustness of the control
   design is improved by accounting for attitude measurement bias, and
   uncertainty in thrust gain, mass, and image feature depth. The
   asymptotic stability of the closed-loop is proven. The method is based
   on a simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) structure which can
   be readily implemented on-board. Experimental results show improved
   performance relative to previous work.}},

Abstract = {{Tire-derived aggregates (TDA) have previously been applied in leachate
   collection and drainage systems (LCDSs). However, these systems are
   subjected to large overburden pressures, which may compress a tire
   medium and change its properties, thereby affecting its performance. In
   this study, properties of three types of commercially-available TDA
   sourced from processors in Alberta, Canada were investigated under
   conditions expected in a landfill, along with the implications of these
   properties on hydraulic performance of LCDSs. A large test apparatus was
   used to compress the materials by up to 330 kPa. Samples tested were
   highly compressible, with strains of about 50\% under 150-240 kPa loads
   (corresponding to landfill heights of 12-18.5 m under typical
   compaction). Vertical hydraulic conductivity decreased with compression,
   but remained above the Alberta threshold of 10(-4) m/s. No significant
   differences among media types were demonstrated. A criterion for
   determining the initial thickness of a drainage layer required to
   maintain a thickness of at least 300 mm over a landfill's lifetime. At
   least 600 mm of TDA would need to be placed to account for 50\%
   compression.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are envisioned as one of the most promising
   alternative renewable energy sources because they can generate electric
   current continuously while treating waste. Terrestrial Microbial Fuel
   Cells (TMFCs) can be inoculated and work on the use of soil, which
   further extends the application areas of MFCs. Energy supply, as a
   primary influential factor determining the lifetime of Wireless Sensor
   Network (WSN) nodes, remains an open challenge in sensor networks. In
   theory, sensor nodes powered by MFCs have an eternal life. However, low
   power density and high internal resistance of MFCs are two pronounced
   problems in their operation. A single-hop WSN powered by a TMFC
   experimental setup was designed and experimented with. Power generation
   performance of the proposed TMFC, the relationships between the
   performance of the power generation and the environment temperature, the
   water content of the soil by weight were measured by experiments.
   Results show that the TMFC can achieve good power generation performance
   under special environmental conditions. Furthermore, the experiments
   with sensor data acquisition and wireless transmission of the TMFC
   powering WSN were carried out. We demonstrate that the obtained
   experimental results validate the feasibility of TMFCs powering WSNs.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are abundant in various
   proteomes, where they play numerous important roles and complement
   biological activities of ordered proteins. Among functions assigned to
   IDPs are interactions with nucleic acids. However, often, such
   assignments are made based on the guilty-by-association principle. The
   validity of the extension of these correlations to all nucleic acid
   binding proteins has never been analyzed on a large scale across all
   domains of life. To fill this gap, we perform a comprehensive
   computational analysis of the abundance of intrinsic disorder and
   intrinsically disordered domains in nucleiomes (similar to 548 000
   nucleic acid binding proteins) of 1121 species from Archaea, Bacteria
   and Eukaryota. Nucleiome is a whole complement of proteins involved in
   interactions with nucleic acids. We show that relative to other proteins
   in the corresponding proteomes, the DNA-binding proteins have
   significantly increased disorder content and are significantly enriched
   in disordered domains in Eukaryotes but not in Archaea and Bacteria. The
   RNA-binding proteins are significantly enriched in the disordered
   domains in Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota, while the overall abundance
   of disorder in these proteins is significantly increased in Bacteria,
   Archaea, animals and fungi. The high abundance of disorder in nucleiomes
   supports the notion that the nucleic acid binding proteins often require
   intrinsic disorder for their functions and regulation.}},

Abstract = {{RF-enabled wireless power transfer and energy harvesting has recently
   emerged as a promising technique to provision perpetual energy
   replenishment for low-power wireless networks. The network devices are
   replenished by the RF energy harvested from the transmission of ambient
   RF transmitters, which offers a practical and promising solution to
   enable self-sustainable communications. This paper adopts a stochastic
   geometry framework based on the Ginibre model to analyze the performance
   of self-sustainable communications over cellular networks with general
   fading channels. Specifically, we consider the point-to-point downlink
   transmission between an access point and a battery-free device in the
   cellular networks, where the ambient RF transmitters are randomly
   distributed following a repulsive point process, called Ginibre
   alpha-determinantal point process (DPP). Two practical RF energy
   harvesting receiver architectures, namely time-switching and
   power-splitting, are investigated. We perform an analytical study on the
   RF-powered device and derive the expectation of the RF energy harvesting
   rate, the energy outage probability and the transmission outage
   probability over Nakagami-m fading channels. These are expressed in
   terms of so-called Fredholm determinants, which we compute efficiently
   with modern techniques from numerical analysis. Our analytical results
   are corroborated by the numerical simulations, and the efficiency of our
   approximations is demonstrated. In practice, the accurate simulation of
   any of the Fredholm determinant appearing in the manuscript is a matter
   of seconds. An interesting finding is that a smaller value of alpha
   (corresponding to larger repulsion) yields a better transmission outage
   performance when the density of the ambient RF transmitters is small.
   However, it yields a lower transmission outage probability when the
   density of the ambient RF transmitters is large. We also show
   analytically that the power-splitting architecture outperforms the
   time-switching architecture in terms of transmission outage
   performances. Lastly, our analysis provides guidelines for setting the
   time-switching and power-splitting coefficients at their optimal values.}},

Abstract = {{The state feedback regulator problem for a network of countercurrent
   heat exchangers is considered in this paper. The system is described by
   two sets of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and the
   model is nonlinear with respect to the control input. To deal with the
   nonlinearity, the equilibrium temperature profile is calculated and
   utilized in the linearization of the original nonlinear system. Then,
   based on infinite-dimensional representation, the state feedback
   regulator problem (in particular the tracking problem) is considered,
   where the target is to design a controller that, while guaranteeing the
   stability of the closed-loop system, drives the controlled output to
   track a reference signal generated by an exosystem with its spectrum on
   the imaginary axis. Given the explicit expression of the transfer
   function, we provide sufficient conditions such that the resulting
   linearized system is causal and stable. Given that the controlled system
   is stable, we propose a simple and novel method to provide the
   stabilization feedback gain K, such that the controlled system tracks
   the reference signal. Finally, a numerical simulation illustrating the
   results is presented. (C) 2016 European Control Association. Published

Abstract = {{Electrical submersible pumps (ESPs) are commonly used artificial lift
   method in deep wells in oil industry. To monitor ESP systems operation,
   downhole monitoring tools are used to transmit data representing the
   physical condition of the downhole such as temperature, pressure, and
   vibration to the surface. The most common communication method for
   downhole monitoring tools in the field is to use a direct current (dc)
   signal over three phases of the main power cable, and the ground serves
   as a return path. However, this method cannot operate in the event of a
   single-line-to-ground (SLG) fault, although the ESP is still in
   operation due to ungrounded practice in its downhole zone. This method
   is also prone to failure in the presence of voltage unbalance. To
   overcome issues in the existing downhole monitoring tool design, a new
   phase-to-phase communication scheme is proposed in this paper.
   Intentional disturbances are applied to the ESP system and used as means
   of binary communication. In this paper, theoretical formulas of the
   proposed method are derived, and its performance is evaluated using
   simulation through case and sensitivity studies.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Infarcted myocardium can remodel after successful
   reperfusion, resulting in left ventricular dilation and heart failure.
   Epicardial infarct repair (EIR) using a bioinductive extracellular
   matrix (ECM) biomaterial is a novel surgical approach to promote
   endogenous myocardial repair and functional recovery after myocardial
   infarction. Using a pre-clinical porcine model of coronary
   ischemia-reperfusion, we assessed the effects of EIR on regional
   functional recovery, safety, and possible mechanisms of benefit.
   METHODS: An ECM biomaterial (CorMatrix ECM) was applied to the
   epicardium after 75 minutes of coronary ischemia in a porcine model.
   Following ischemia-reperfusion injury, animals were randomly assigned in
   2:1 fashion to EIR (n = 8) or sham treatment (n = 4). Serial cardiac
   magnetic resonance imaging was performed on normal (n = 4) and study
   animals at baseline (1 week) and 6 weeks after treatment. Myocardial
   function and tissue characteristics were assessed.
   RESULTS: Functional myocardial recovery was significantly increased by
   EIR compared with sham treatment (change in regional myocardial
   contraction at 6 weeks, 28.6 +/- 14.0\% vs 4.2 +/- 13.5\% wall
   thickening, p < 0.05). Animals receiving EIR had reduced adhesions
   compared with animals receiving sham treatment (1.44 +/- 0.51 vs 3.08
   +/- 0.89, p < 0.05). Myocardial fibrosis was not increased, and EIR did
   not cause myocardial constriction, as left ventricular compliance by
   passive pressure distention at matched volumes was similar between
   groups (13.9 +/- 4.0 mm Hg in EIR group vs 16.0 +/- 5.2 mm Hg in sham
   group, p = 0.61). Animals receiving EIR showed evidence of
   vasculogenesis in the region of functional recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the beneficial effects of successful
   reperfusion, EIR using a bioinductive ECM enhances myocardial repair and
   functional recovery. Clinical translation of EIR early after myocardial
   infarction as an adjunct to surgical revascularization may be warranted
   in the future. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

   values that exceeded that of equivalent TiO2 nanoparticle systems by 3-4
   times and are comparable to the robust UV/Cl-2 and UV/H2O2 systems. The
   higher photocatalytic efficiency of SiNPs is attributed to the combined
   effects of quantum confinement, effective band gap, and surface states,
   among which surface states play a dominant role. SiNPs provide a

Abstract = {{Thermal cracking reactions of a variety of heavy petroleum feeds were
   analyzed by in situ cross-polarized microscopy using a reactor equipped
   with a sapphire window. Cross-polarized microscopy is a powerful
   technique for detecting the formation of anisotropic domains of
   carbonaceous material (mesophase coke). The present study, however,
   focused on the characterization of the chemical and physical events
   prior to the formation of new phases by evaluating the changes in image
   properties with reaction time. Results showed that changes in image
   brightness were strongly correlated to the conversion of 524+ degrees C
   material but could not provide much insight regarding the stability of
   reacting oils. Color analyses of the cross-polarized micrographs,
   however, revealed a consistent red-to-blue color shift around the point
   of instability. This color shift corresponded to either the formation of
   a fouling layer of isotropic material or a homogeneous color change of
   the reacting medium, indicating the formation of CS2-insoluble material.
   In both cases, the beginning of the color shift preceded the formation
   of mesophase, whose appearance had the effect of enhancing the blue
   color of the samples. The detection of the red-to-blue color shift in
   reacting samples under thermal cracking conditions provides an improved
   framework for testing the fouling propensity of feeds or for developing
   online sensors operating on industrial units.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the results of the first detailed experimental study
   on probing nanoaggregation of a polyaromatic compound. Electrospray
   ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to monitor the
   self-association of a well-defined polyaromatic compound,
   N-(1-hexylhepyl)-N'-(5-carboxylicpentyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyl
   icbisimide (CSPe), under various solution conditions. Gaseous ions
   corresponding to nanoaggregates of CSPe molecules were directly observed
   on ESI mass spectra. The dominant aggregation number (n) was found to be
   less than 10, although larger nanoaggregates with an aggregation number
   larger than 10 were also observed. The aggregation number of CSPe
   decreased by replacing toluene with xylene, while it increased with the
   CSPe concentration or upon the addition of heptane to toluene as the
   solvent. The consecutive aggregation number was found only for small
   CSPe nanoaggregates (2 <= n <= 11), which suggests a stepwise
   self-association at n <= 11. The larger nanoaggregates (n > 11) were
   formed by interactions between small nanoaggregates. The presence of
   naphthenic acids (NAs) was observed to hinder CSPe self-association. The
   dispersive effect of NAs was found to be in the order of
   1-methyl-1-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid similar to cyclohexanebutyric acid
   < stearic acid < 5 beta-cholanic acid < 1-naphthalene pentanoic acid.
   The nanoaggregation behavior of CSPe was compared to that of two other
   polyaromatic compounds.}},

Title = {{Bitumen Recovery from Carbonates by a Modified SOS-FR

Abstract = {{This study investigates the applicability of the modified version of the
   previously proposed SOS-FR (steam-over solvent injection in fractured
   reservoir) method to recover bitumen from the Grosmont formation in
   Canada. Three phases were applied on a total of 13 preserved core
   samples. In Phase 1, the cores taken from three different parts of the
   Grosmont formation were soaked in a liquid solvent (heptane or
   distillate) at ambient conditions. The objective of the first phase was
   to reduce the viscosity of the bitumen in preparation for the second
   phase which is wettability alteration. In Phase 2, we soaked the samples
   in water with chemicals. Wettability modifiers tested include high pH
   solution, cationic surfactants, and ionic liquids because the screening
   process indicated they are the most useful wettability alteration
   chemicals for oil-wet carbonates. One of the key benefits of the ionic
   liquids is that they are environmentally friendly as they are chemically
   stable with low level of toxicity and flammabiliy. They can also be
   customized for particular rock/fluid system. On the other hand, pH
   solutions are economically attractive, in comparison with other
   wettability modifiers. Finally, Phase 3 was applied by increasing
   temperature to the bubble point of the solvent to mimic hot-water
   injection with chemicals. Each phase was analyzed in terms of ultimate
   oil recovery (and wettability alteration), time to reach this amount,
   the most suitable wettability alteration chemicals, and soaking times
   needed. The results revealed that the solvent phase not only affects the
   bitumen properties, but also changes Grosmont rock characteristics
   significantly. Wettability alteration of the fractured Grosmont
   reservoir was observed to be critical for additional oil recovery as
   well as for solvent retrieval. Specific high pH solution efficiently
   altered wettability and helped to recover considerable amount of
   bitumen/solvent mixture fairly quick showing a potential as a low cost
   chemical to recover bitumen. A discussion about the optimization of the
   process in terms of the solvent soaking period, wettability alteration
   chemicals, and the effect of temperature was also included.}},

Abstract = {{We test the localization model (LM) prediction of a parameter-free
   relationship between the a-structural relaxation time tau(alpha) and the
   Debye-Waller factor < u(2)> for a series of simulated glass-forming
   Cu-Zr metallic liquids having a range of alloy compositions. After
   validating this relationship between the picosecond ('fast') and
   long-time relaxation dynamics over the full range of temperatures and
   alloy compositions investigated in our simulations, we show that it is
   also possible to estimate the self-diffusion coefficients of the
   individual atomic species (D-Cu, D-Zr) and the average diffusion
   coefficient D using the LM, in conjunction with the empirical fractional
   Stokes-Einstein (FSE) relation linking these diffusion coefficients to
   tau(alpha). We further observe that the fragility and extent of
   decoupling between D and tau(alpha) strongly correlate with < u(2)> at
   the onset temperature of glass-formation T-A where particle caging and
   the breakdown of Arrhenius relaxation first emerge.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{In order to examine the effects of the fluid type as the electrolyte
   solvent on the efficiency of electrokinetic energy conversion, a
   comparative numerical study among three different fluid types of a
   transient electrokinetic flow through a single circular finite length
   microchannel has been conducted. The system was initially at an
   equilibrium non-flow state, and a step change in flow was applied and
   the calculation proceeding until steady state was achieved. The analysis
   was based on non-dimensional transport governing equations that were
   scaled using Debye length as the characteristic length scale and
   diffusion time as characteristic time scale. The fluid types considered
   were shear thinning, Newtonian, and shear thickening, and a power law
   modeled them with the scaled flow behavior index having values of 0.2,
   1.0, and 1.8. In order to isolate the electrokinetic effects of the
   different relationships between the shear strain rate and shear stress,
   the flow consistency index was adjusted so that in all the cases the
   flow rate and total pressure drop matched that of water at 25 degrees C.
   All other fluid and interfacial properties were the same for all cases.
   The key observational difference between the various fluid types was
   that their different axial velocity profile acted on essential the same
   free charge density profiles. Consequently, the convection current
   density (i.e., the radial distribution of charge being advected along
   the channel) was strongly affected by the fluid type. Integration of
   this quantity to calculate the convection current showed that for the
   particular fluid properties chosen the shear thinning fluid was 20 \%
   higher than the Newtonian fluid, while the shear thickening fluid was
   only 4 \% lower than the Newtonian fluid. Combined with the effects,
   these different currents have on the streaming potential, the shear
   thinning fluid was 50 \% more effective in converting flow work to
   electrical work than the Newtonian fluid, while the shear thickening
   fluid was only 16 \% lower than the Newtonian fluid.}},

Journal = {{PETROLEUM GEOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Blocking facies information to a constant length prior to
   three-dimensional (3D) modelling is necessary with current 3D
   geostatistical modelling techniques. The high-resolution information
   from core and well logging must be upscaled to unify the scale to a
   target scale considered in building the 3D numerical models. A downside
   is the inevitable loss of information when the majority facies is
   assigned to each upscaled interval. The loss of such information could
   become problematic when dealing with small shale barriers in the middle
   of the reservoir or at the boundary of the facies transitions. This
   paper addresses the information loss by retaining as much information as
   possible in the upscaling process and proposes a metric to account for
   small-scale information that is mixed during the process: such a metric
   is referred to as facies mixing measure (FMM). Retaining more
   information in the upscaling process and utilizing that information to
   better model petrophysical properties is an important contribution. FMM
   is calculated during the upscaling step and is treated as a secondary
   property during petrophysical property modelling. Cross-validation with
   two different datasets demonstrates improvements in porosity estimation.}},

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{765-772}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the pore pressure behaviour observed within peat
   beneath a newly constructed railway embankment. Piezometers installed at
   different depths beneath the structure showed episodic increases in pore
   pressure above hydrostatic pressure followed by a rapid pore pressure
   decrease. It was postulated that this fluctuation in pore pressure was
   due to the movement and expulsion of gases within the peat.
   Investigations were conducted in the laboratory to replicate this pore
   pressure response. The peat specimens were subjected to isotropic
   consolidation, within a triaxial cell, at constant confining pressure
   while measuring the change in the specimen's pore pressure and volume.
   The results of this investigation indicate that the gas bubbles move
   through the channeled network of voids towards the drainage boundary
   where they restrict the flow of water, which results in the increase of
   pore pressure towards an upper limit or escape pressure, ultimately
   causing an expulsion of gas bubbles. This expulsion of bubbles results
   in a rapid drop in pore pressure and volume change within the specimen.
   The implications of the volume change associated with this pore pressure
   behaviour are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A real-time video recording of the 2008 landslide in Nanmu, China is
   analyzed to reveal information regarding the format, velocity,
   post-failure characteristics and destructiveness of the slide. This
   recording indicates that the failure proceeded in three stages. Back
   analysis has found that colluvial deposits (residual slope deposits and
   cemented colluvial deposits) in a weakly cemented form were the internal
   factor that contributed to the failure, and that damage resulting from
   the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 and focused rainstorms were the external
   contributing factors. A field investigation showed that the
   destructiveness of the slide involved integral pushing damage to the
   base of man-made structures and damage to buildings from the impact of
   rolling gravel. In the 5 years following the Nanmu landslide, the local
   landscape has evolved further with sporadic individual rock falls or
   local collapses along the sliding bed and boundary. Corresponding
   prevention practices for the secondary disasters have demonstrated that
   the combined measures, including the removal of accumulated gravel,
   installation of a passive prevention net on the sliding bed,
   construction of an underground diversion culvert and a retaining wall,
   have been extremely effective and economical during the past 5 years.}},

   Converters}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a resilient framework for fault-tolerant operation
   in modular multilevel converters (MMCs) to facilitate normal operation
   under internal and external fault conditions. This framework is realized
   by designing and implementing a supervisory algorithm and a postfault
   restoration scheme. The supervisory algorithm includes monitoring and
   decision-making units to detect and identify faults by analyzing the
   circulating current and submodule capacitor voltages in a very short
   time. The postfault restoration scheme is proposed to immediately
   replace the faulty submodule with the redundant healthy one. The
   restoration is achieved by virtue of a multilevel modular
   capacitor-clamped dc/dc converter (MMCCC), which is redundantly
   aggregated to each arm of the MMC. This design effectively guarantees
   smooth mode transition and handles the failure of multiple submodules in
   a short time interval. In addition, a modified modulation scheme is
   presented to ensure submodule capacitor voltage balancing of the MMC
   without implementing any additional hardware. Fast fault identification,
   a fully modular structure, and robust postfault restoration are the main
   features of the proposed framework. Digital time-domain simulation
   studies are conducted on a 21-level MMC to confirm the effectiveness and
   resilience of the proposed fault-tolerant framework during internal and
   external faults. Furthermore, the proposed framework is implemented in
   the FPGA-based RT-LAB real-time simulator platform to validate its
   resilience in a hardware-in-the-loop setup.}},

Abstract = {{Description of self-assembly by means of atomistic models without
   coarse-graining and empirical adjustment is the most challenging problem
   in statistical mechanics of liquids. Partial molar volume (PMV) is a
   thermodynamic property related to effective solvation forces
   spontaneously driving self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in
   solution. We calculate the PMV of several ethylene glycol derivatives,
   in particular, alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers H(CH2)(m-1)
   (CH2OCH2)(n)CH2OH commonly known as CmEn nonionic surfactants, in
   aqueous solution at infinite dilution by using the Kirkwood-Buff (KB)
   equation and the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with
   the Kovalenko-Hirata closure relation (3D-RISM-KH) integral equation
   theory of molecular liquids. Special attention is paid to the infinite
   dilution case since direct measurement of PMV of monomeric surfactants
   is hindered by their very low critical micelle concentration (cmc). The
   PMVs obtained from the KB/3D-RISM-KH approach are in good qualitative
   agreement with experimental data for ethylene glycol derivatives in
   water at 5; 25; and 45 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},

Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{142-159}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We study the deformation of a crack between a soft elastomer and a rigid
   substrate with finite interfacial slippage. It is assumed that slippage
   occurs when the interfacial shear traction exceeds a threshold. This
   leads to a slip zone ahead of the crack tip where the shear traction is
   assumed to be equal to the constant threshold. We perform asymptotic
   analysis and determine closed-form solutions describing the near-tip
   crack opening displacement and the corresponding stress distributions.
   These solutions are consistent with numerical results based on finite
   element analysis. Our results reveal that slippage can significantly
   affect the deformation and stress fields near the tip of the interface
   crack. Specifically, depending on the direction of slippage, the crack
   opening profile may appear more blunted or sharpened than the parabola
   arising from for the case of zero interfacial shear traction or free
   slippage. The detailed crack opening profile is determined by the
   constant shear traction in the slip zone. More importantly, we find that
   the normal stress perpendicular to the interface can increase or
   decrease when slippage occurs, depending on the direction of slippage
   and the shear traction in the slip zone. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Missing values are a common phenomenon when dealing with real-world data
   sets. Analysis of incomplete data sets has become an active area of
   research. In this paper, we focus on the problem of clustering
   incomplete data, which is intended to introduce some prior distribution
   information of the missing values into the algorithm of fuzzy
   clustering. First, non-parametric hypothesis testing is employed to
   describe the missing values adhering to a certain Gaussian distribution
   as probabilistic information granules based on the nearest neighbors of
   incomplete data. Second, we propose a novel clustering model, in which
   probabilistic information granules of missing values are incorporated
   into the Fuzzy C-Means clustering of incomplete data by involving the
   maximum likelihood criterion. Third, the clustering model is optimized
   by using a tri-level alternating optimization utilizing the method of
   Lagrange multipliers. The convergence and the time complexity of the
   clustering algorithm are also discussed. The experiments reported both
   on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed
   approach can effectively realize clustering of incomplete data. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Systematic efforts to sequence the cancer genome have identified large
   numbers of mutations and copy number alterations in human cancers.
   However, elucidating the functional consequences of these variants, and
   their interactions to drive or maintain oncogenic states, remains a
   challenge in cancer research. We developed REVEALER, a computational
   method that identifies combinations of mutually exclusive genomic
   alterations correlated with functional phenotypes, such as the
   activation or gene dependency of oncogenic pathways or sensitivity to a
   drug treatment. We used REVEALER to uncover complementary genomic
   alterations associated with the transcriptional activation of
   beta-catenin and NRF2, MEK-inhibitor sensitivity, and KRAS dependency.
   REVEALER successfully identified both known and new associations,
   demonstrating the power of combining functional profiles with extensive
   characterization of genomic alterations in cancer genomes.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) was used to study the effect of
   humidity on the permeability of selected low molecular weight alcohols
   (methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol) through films made up of a
   hydrophilic polymer hydroxypropyl xylan (HPX). The thin films used
   consisted of a neat HPX film and a HPX film with sorbitol, a commonly
   used food grade plasticizer, (HPX/Sorbitol) and a HPX film with sorbitol
   and cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) (HPX/Sorbitol/CNC). Diffusivity and
   solubility of the alcohols at infinite dilution were measured at
   relative humidity (RH) values of 30\%, 50\%, and 70\% of the carrier gas
   (helium). Permeability was then calculated using the measured
   diffinivity and solubility. Solubility coefficients of the alcohols were
   more or less insensitive to the RH. Increasing humidity from dry to 50\%
   RH increased diffusion coefficients of the alcohols due to
   plasticization and swelling of the films whereas at higher RH, diffusion
   coefficient of the alcohols decreased. Based on the water contents of
   the films estimated from the weight-fraction-based Henry's constant, at
   70\% RH, water clustering was the reason for the reduced diffusion
   coefficient in the neat HPX films while alcohol water clustering was
   suggested for HPX/sorbitol and HPX/Sorbitol/CNC films. Permeability
   coefficients of the alcohols exhibited a maximum at around 50\% RH as
   well suggesting that diffusion, not dissolution, dominated the
   permeability behavior. The findings suggest that due to sensitivity of
   the films to humidity, films should be used along with water barrier
   films to control humidity of the environment for applications used as
   barrier to alcohols.}},

Title = {{Influence of second-order bracket-archwire misalignments on loads

Journal = {{ANGLE ORTHODONTIST}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the influence of a rotational second-order
   bracket-archwire misalignment on the loads generated during third-order
   torque procedures. Specifically, torque in the second and third-order
   directions was considered.
   Materials and Methods: An orthodontic torque simulator (OTS) was used to
   simulate the third order torque between Damon Q brackets and 0.019 x
   0.025-inch stainless steel archwires. Second-order misalignments were
   introduced in 0.5 degrees increments from a neutral position, 0.0, up to
   3.0 of misalignment. A sample size of 30 brackets was used for each
   misalignment. The archwire was then rotated in the OTS from its neutral
   position up to 30 degrees in 3 degrees increments and then unloaded in
   the same increments. At each position, all forces and torques were
   recorded. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine
   if the second-order misalignments significantly affected torque values
   in the second- and third-order directions.
   Results: From statistical analysis of the experimental data, it was
   found that the only statistically significant differences in third-order
   torque between a misaligned state and the neutral position occurred for
   2.5 degrees and 3.0 degrees of misalignment, with mean differences of
   2.54 Nmm and 2.33 Nmm, respectively. In addition, in pairwise
   comparisons of second-order torque for each misalignment increment,
   statistical differences were observed in all comparisons except for 0.0
   degrees vs 0.5 degrees and 1.5 degrees vs 2.0 degrees.
   Conclusion: The introduction of a second-order misalignment during
   third-order torque simulation resulted in statistically significant
   differences in both second- and third-order torque response; however,
   the former is arguably clinically insignificant.}},

Abstract = {{Many distributed interactive multimedia applications, such as live video
   conferencing and video sharing, require each participating client to
   transmit its captured video stream to other clients via relay servers.
   We consider connecting multiple clients through multiple relay servers
   and study the server selection problem from a dense pool of content
   delivery network edge locations and datacenters to reduce the end-to-end
   delays between clients. To achieve scalability in the presence of a
   large number of candidate servers, we formulate server selection as a
   geometric problem in a delay space instead of in a graph, which turns
   out to be an extension of the well-known Euclidean k-median problem. We
   propose practical approximation schemes when using only one or two
   servers with theoretical worst-case guarantees as well as fast
   heuristics when using k servers. We demonstrate the benefit of our
   optimized multiserver selection schemes through extensive evaluation
   based on real-world traces collected from the PlanetLab and Seattle
   platforms, containing personal mobile devices as well as real network
   experiments based on a prototype implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Many video streaming applications operate their geo-distributed services
   in the cloud, taking advantage of superior connectivities between
   datacenters to push content closer to users or to relay live video
   traffic between end users at a higher throughput. In the meantime,
   inter-datacenter networks also carry high volumes of other types of
   traffic, including service replication and data backups, e.g., for
   storage and email services. It is an important research topic to
   optimally engineer and schedule inter-datacenter traffic, taking into
   account the stringent latency requirements of video flows when
   transmitted along inter-datacenter links shared with other types of
   traffic. Since inter-datacenter networks are usually overprovisioned,
   unlike prior work that mainly aims to maximize link utilization, we
   propose a delay-optimized traffic routing scheme to explicitly
   differentiate path selection for different sessions according to their
   delay sensitivities, leading to a software-defined inter-datacenter
   networking overlay implemented at the application layer. We show that
   our solution can yield sparse path selection by only solving linear
   programs, and thus, in contrast to prior traffic engineering solutions,
   does not lead to overly fine-grained traffic splitting, further reducing
   packet resequencing overhead and the number of forwarding rules to be
   installed in each forwarding unit. Real-world experiments based on a
   deployment on six globally distributed Amazon EC2 datacenters have shown
   that our system can effectively prioritize and improve the delay
   performance of inter-datacenter video flows at a low cost.}},

Abstract = {{Increased non-linear residential loads in today's distribution system is
   a concern due to the harmonics related power quality issues. The
   situation gets worsened by the harmonic resonance introduced by the
   installation of power factor correction (PFC) capacitor banks in the
   distribution network. At the same time, more and more renewable
   energy-based distributed generation (DG) units are being installed in
   the residential area. These DG systems can be used as an effective way
   to mitigate the harmonic related power quality problems introduced by
   the nonlinear residential loads. In literature, very limited work has
   been done to identify harmonic compensation priorities that should be
   assigned to different DGs operating at different locations of the
   distribution system for improved compensation performance. This issue is
   addressed in this paper. A selective harmonic compensation scheme based
   on modal analysis is developed to assign compensation priorities on DGs
   operating at different distribution system nodes for improved
   compensation performance. A modeled residential distribution system
   containing distribution components such as distribution line, PFC
   capacitors, transformers, and household appliances along with DG units
   is used to verify the improvement of compensation performance.
   Experimental verification of the proposed method is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{The use of distributed generators (DGs) has increased in the past decade
   and projections indicate that penetration will further increase. In this
   scenario, with the improvements in power-electronics-based converters,
   the DG units have the potential to effectively resolve voltage/current
   control issues in low-voltage distribution systems. In this paper, a new
   probabilistic index is defined to measure the controllability of
   voltages and currents in the buses and lines of distribution systems.
   Using this index greatly facilitates the analysis and measurement of
   voltage/current controllability levels of distribution systems.
   Different types of DGs are allocated in the system to optimize the
   voltage/current controllability by using the defined index. The results
   are compared with those obtained through the conventional approach of DG
   allocation, which is based on the minimization of energy losses. A new
   combined index is defined to include both V-I controllability and energy
   losses. Several sensitivity studies are then performed to show the
   effect of the penetration level of different types of DGs on the
   proposed indices.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a 60-GHz power amplifier (PA) fabricated in a 65-nm
   CMOS technology. The proposed PA utilizes a dual-mode amplification
   circuit topology to achieve a high level of output power and efficiency
   in a small die area. High-output power is achieved by combining class AB
   cascode stage with a conventional class A common source (CS) stage in a
   compact four-way differential distributed active transformer to increase
   the amplifier's power density. Driver stages consist of an enhanced
   cascode stage followed by a CS stage to achieve a high power (HP) gain.
   Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the maximum measured gain of the
   60-GHz PA is 22 dB within a wide 3-dB bandwidth of 14 GHz. A maximum
   saturated output power of 19.7 dBm is measured in HP mode while
   consuming 430 mW over a 1.2 V core supply. In low-power (LP) mode of
   operation, the power gain of 20 dB and 19.7 dBm saturated power is
   measured at 60 GHz. The proposed dual-mode topology achieves an HP added
   efficiency of 25\% and 19\% in HP and LP modes, respectively.}},

   Case Study in China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops a holistic simulation-based approach to determining
   reasonable strategies to limit the magnitude of ground settlement in
   shallow tunnel excavation. Simulation models are built to investigate
   and analyze the impact of different response strategies on the
   development tunnel-induced movement. A real tunnel case with a shallow
   buried depth of 5-8 m in the Wuhan metro system in China is utilized to
   demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach. Results
   indicate that (1) the simulation technique can be used to model the
   complex tunnel-soil-ground interaction in a reliable manner and predict
   the tunnel-induced ground settlement given some grouting strategies are
   implemented; (2) the optimal control strategy to reduce the
   tunnel-induced ground settlement should first satisfy the requirement of
   safety consideration where the ground settlement should be controlled
   within an allowable range and should then satisfy the cost effective
   requirement; and (3) the continuous grouting strategy is more suitable
   to deal with the excessive settlement in case the thickness of covering
   soil layers is almost equal or less than the tunnel diameter because it
   can reduce the ground settlement by almost 50\%, compared with the
   situation where no grouting strategies are implemented. The developed
   approach takes into account both the knowledge of domain experts and
   computer science techniques and can be used by practitioners in the
   industry as a decision tool to provide benefits in the development of
   better alternatives and optimization. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Water Surface Characteristics of Submerged Rectangular Sharp-Crested
   Weirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the water surface
   characteristics of submerged flow over sharp-crested weirs. Interesting
   observations were made on the water surface profiles near the weir as
   weir submergence sets in as well as for various stages of submergence.
   Submerged flow was divided into four regimes: (I) impinging jet, (II)
   surface jump, (III) surface wave, and (IV) surface jet. It was found
   that a surface jump turned into a surface wave when the wave trough
   became level with the tip of the weir. The surface jet regime began as
   the surface waves faded out. A condition was set to quantify the
   boundary between the surface wave and surface jet regimes. Based on flow
   observations, the surface jet regime sets in as the amplitude of the
   surface wave becomes small (i.e.,less than 0.1h, where h is the head).
   An empirical equation was developed based on the literature data to
   predict the discharge reduction factor in the generally used discharge
   equation. This formulation was compared with other formulations in the
   literature. It was found that the proposed formulation provides a
   slightly better estimation of flow discharge. (C) 2016 American Society

Title = {{Cuticle expansion during feeding in the tick Amblyomma hebraeum (Acari:

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Female Amblyomma hebraeum ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) increase their weight
   similar to 10-fold during a `slow phase of engorgement' (7-9 days), and
   a further 10-fold during the `rapid phase' (12-24 h). During the rapid
   phase, the cuticle thins by half, with a plastic (permanent) deformation
   of greater than 40\% in two orthogonal directions. A stress of 2.5 MPa
   or higher is required to achieve this degree of deformation (Flynn and
   Kaufman, 2015). Using a dimensional analysis of the tick body and
   applying the Laplace equation, we calculated that the tick must achieve
   high internal hydrostatic pressures in order to engorge fully: greater
   than 55 kPa at a fed:unfed mass ratio of similar to 20:1, when cuticle
   thinning commences (Flynn and Kaufman, 2011). In this study we used a
   telemetric pressure transducer system to measure the internal
   hydrostatic pressure of ticks during feeding. Sustained periods of
   irregular high frequency (>20 Hz) pulsatile bursts of high pressure (>55
   kPa) were observed in two ticks: they had been cannulated just prior to
   the rapid phase of engorgement, and given access to a host rabbit for
   completion of the feeding cycle. The pattern of periods of high pressure
   generation varied over the feeding cycle and between the two specimens.
   We believe that these pressures exceed those reported so far for any
   other animal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with parameter estimation for a single-input
   single-output (SISO) linear parameter varying (LPV) system in an input
   output setting with output-error (OE) time-delay model structure. Since
   the practical industrial processes are inherently nonlinear and are
   often operated over several working points with transition dynamic
   periods between different working points, the multiple model LPV model
   is considered in this paper. A global maximization method is firstly
   used to estimate an autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) time-delay
   model for each local process in a noniterative way. Then the Maximum
   Likelihood (ML) estimator is developed to identify a global LPV OE model
   based on the local process data and the transition data with the
   parameters initialized based on the local parameter estimates for the
   ARX time-delay models. One numerical example and two practical
   simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed method. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{We employed a polypyrrole hydrogel precursor to create a carbon
   framework that possesses both huge heteroatom content (13 wt\% nitrogen

   (NIC, HIC) electrode fabricated from this N and O Functionalized Carbon
   (NOFC) has tremendous reversible capacity and rate capability, e.g. 437
   mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1), and 185 mA h g(-1) at 1600 mA g(-1). This is
   among the most favorable reported, and is due to copious nanoporosity
   that enables fast ion sorption at the many N and O moieties and graphene
   defects. The NOFC imbues a NIC device with energy -power characteristics
   that are not only state-of-the-art for Na hybrids, but also rival Li
   systems: Ragone chart placement is 111 W h kg(-1) and 38 W h kg(-1) at

Abstract = {{Displacement of fossil fuel-based power through biomass co-firing could
   reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuels. In this
   study, data-intensive techno-economic models were developed to evaluate
   different co-firing technologies as well as the configurations of these
   technologies. The models Were developed to study 60 different scenarios
   involving various biomass feedstocks (wood chips, wheat straw, and
   forest residues) co-fired either with coal in a 500 MW subcritical
   pulverized coal (PC) plant or with natural gas in a 500 MW natural gas
   combined cycle (NGCC) plant to determine their technical potential and
   costs, as well as to determine environmental benefits. The results
   obtained reveal that the fully paid-off coal-fired power plant co-fired
   with forest residues is the most attractive option, having levelized
   costs of electricity (LCOE) of \$53.12-\$54.50/MW h and CO2 abatement
   costs of \$27.41-\$31.15/tCO(2). When whole forest chips are co-fired
   with coal in a fully paid-off plant, the LCOE and CO2 abatement costs
   range from \$54.68 to \$56.41/MW h and \$35.60 to \$41.78/tCO(2),
   respectively. The LCOE and CO2 abatement costs for straw range from
   \$54.62 to \$57.35/MW h and \$35.07 to \$38.48/tCO(2), respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper reports an investigation into the performance of a
   multi-chamber catalytic converter (MCCC). The MCCC design uses internal
   insulation layers within a standard automotive catalytic converter to
   control the radial propagation of thermal energy. By retaining more
   energy within the monolith core, the emissions are reduced over the
   drive cycle, allowing for a reduction of precious metals use and a
   smaller catalytic converter. An additional benefit is a reduction in
   back pressure as a result of suppressing turbulence within the
   converter, which translates into an improvement in fuel economy of up to
   15\%.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Pages = {{938-946}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Recently, natural chabazite was identified as a catalyst for a novel
   thermocatalytic oil upgrading process. To further develop this process,
   it is essential to understand the chemical reactions involved. In this
   study, up to 67.5\% vanadium removal from oil sands bitumen is obtained
   without adding hydrogen. Using model compounds, vanadium removals up to
   47.9\% and nickel removals up to 3.4\% were obtained after a 1h reaction
   at 400 degrees C. Nickel removal up to 90.0\% at equilibrium and room
   temperature was observed. Evidence of free-base porphyrin formation is
   presented. It was also found that chabazite can catalyze the
   dealkylation of octaethylporphyrins. The results presented here allow
   for a better understanding of the chemical properties of chabazite and
   open the possibility for the creation of pretreatment processes that can
   remove metals and modify the structure of petroleum-derived fractions
   without using hydrogen or rejecting substantial amounts of usable oil.}},

   legitimate or a Phish. We perform feature selection in the feature space
   induced by a well-known compression algorithm (specifically, the entries
   of the compression dictionary). We then apply four well-known
   classification algorithms to the reduced feature sets, and conduct a
   Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis on them. We find that a

Abstract = {{Methods of qualitative analysis, such as qualitative classification,
   have gained importance as an essential complement of existing
   quantitative analysis in numerous fields. Only a few models have been
   developed to deal with qualitative inputs in the form of type-2
   fuzzy(T2F) sets properly, given that traditional defuzzification method
   like the Karnik-Mendel algorithm performs dimensionality reduction at
   the cost of loss of information. To improve the situation, we define the
   expected value and variance of T2F set in this paper. By using a
   combination of them, we transfer the vertical three-dimensional
   uncertainty of T2F set to horizontal range uncertainty without much
   distortion of information. Additionally, current classification models
   are unsuitable to the partial classification problem if an output is not
   fully assigned to a single class. We build a comprehensive qualitative
   classification model based on fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM)
   combined with type-2 fuzzy expected regression (FER) to solve the
   partial classification problem as mentioned. This classifier (i.e.
   FER-FSVM) makes it possible to achieve the discrimination of output
   while characterizing membership for each class in terms of
   multidimensional qualitative inputs (attributes) in the form of T2F
   sets. FER-FSVM also can self-learn the data structure and shift between
   FER or FSVM for classification automatically, thus largely improving the
   efficiency of the classification process. The new model is almost 7
   times more efficient than FSVM, as shown by our empirical experiments.

Abstract = {{The axisymmetric formulation of the governing equations for geomechanics
   in the framework of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented
   in this study. Two forms of SPH discretization for the motion equations,
   which are labeled as form I and form II, are proposed, and the methods
   to compute the hoop stress and strain terms including hoop strain rate
   and the acceleration introduced by the hoop stress are compared. To
   avoid possible singularity problem near the axis of symmetry, a
   perfectly smooth contact along with ghost particles are applied to
   prevent the real particles from overly approaching the axis of symmetry
   to remove this potential singularity. In addition, the Mohr-Coulomb
   constitutive model is implemented into the SPH formulation in describing
   soil behavior. Four numerical tests are carried out to validate and
   compare the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithms, and their
   results are compared with analytical solutions and results from FEM
   analysis. The performance in these comparisons suggests that SPH II with
   hoop terms computed through direct hoop method is more stable than the
   others, and the adoption of contact for the symmetric axis is efficient
   in eliminating the singularity problem. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In this paper the design of sampled-data state observers for nonlinear
   plants is investigated under the effect of system and measurement
   disturbance signals. We establish general design principles using the
   standard approaches of (i) direct discrete-time design via approximation
   and (ii) discretization of a continuous-time observer (emulation). By
   interpreting the disturbances as exogenous inputs affecting the error
   dynamics, sufficient conditions are derived which ensure the
   input-to-state stability (ISS) of the observer error system in a
   semiglobal practical sense for the unknown exact discrete-time model.
   Next, we focus on systems whose vector fields are one-sided Lipschitz to
   develop constructive design techniques via linear matrix inequalities
   (LMIs). Numerical simulations of an academic example and a chaotic
   attractor corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed sampled-data

Abstract = {{This paper presents an overall assessment of the hydraulics of a
   vertical slot fishway, the Vianney-Legendre vertical slot fishway on the
   Richelieu River in Quebec, Canada, which has been shown to be successful
   for passing a variety of fish species, including lake sturgeon. The
   fishway has a number of features that combine for a unique design. This
   includes two turning pools, shorter and narrower than recommended
   regular pools, and a low overall gradient. Detailed field measurements
   of the water levels and velocity patterns were obtained and a
   computational fluid dynamics modeling study was conducted. The model
   study evaluates the performance of various regular pool geometries based
   on fishway hydrodynamics. Low overall fishway gradient was shown to
   result in a fishway hydraulically suitable to fish passage, overcoming
   non-optimal pool dimensions. The relationship between discharge and
   corresponding average water depth in the pools, under both uniform and
   non-uniform flow conditions, using the discharge coefficient enabled us
   to simulate the distribution of water levels in a vertical slot fishway.
   Two distinct flow patterns were observed in a regular pool depending on
   the shape ratios between the pool's length and width. This study also
   assessed the spatial variation of velocity magnitude in the vertical
   plane to reveal regions of upwelling, downwelling, and the formation of
   eddies and dead flow zones that have potential importance for fish
   migration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Characterizing Tight Oil Reservoirs With Dual- and Triple-Porosity
   Models}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The response of existing transient triple-porosity models for fractured
   horizontal wells do not converge to that of linear dual-porosity model
   (DPM) in the absence of natural/microfractures (MFs). The main reason is
   the assumption of sequential-depletion from matrix to MF, and from MF to
   hydraulic-fractures (HFs). This can result in unreasonable estimates of
   MF and/or HF parameters. Hence, the authors proposed a quadrilinear flow
   model (QFM) in a previous paper which relaxes this sequential-depletion
   assumption to allow simultaneous matrix-MF and matrix-HF depletion.
   Also, it is proved that QFM simplifies to both DPM and linear sequential
   triple-porosity model (STPM). This work considers the implications of
   applying QFM, STPM, and DPM type-curves and analysis equations on
   production data of two fractured horizontal wells completed in the
   Bakken and Cardium Formations. A comparative study of the reservoir
   parameters estimated from the application of these models to the same
   production data reveals two key results. First, the application of DPM
   on the production data from reservoirs with active MF could result in
   overestimation of HF half-length. This happens to compensate for the
   extra fluid depletion pathways provided by MF. Second, the application
   of STPM on the production data from the reservoirs with active matrix-HF
   communication could result in overestimation of the MF intensity.
   Results from this study are significant when selecting the appropriate
   model for interpreting production data from fractured horizontal wells
   completed in formations with or without active MF. The DPM is
   appropriate if analog studies (e.g., outcrop, microseismic and image log
   analyses) reveal high fracture spacing aspect ratio (negligible MF) in
   the reservoir. Fracture spacing aspect ratio is MF spacing divided by
   the HF spacing. The STPM is appropriate if analog studies reveal low
   spacing aspect ratio (e.g., matrix-HF face damage or high MF intensity
   within a given HF spacing). QFM is appropriate for all fracture spacing
   aspect ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallographic features, physical properties and ionic release from
   yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) in suspension were studied by means of
   XRD, TEM, light-scattering particle size, BET, ICP and zeta potential
   analysis. It was found that Zr, Y, Na, and to a lesser extent Ca, Hf and
   Pd leach from 8 mol\% YSZ powder. The impurities present increase the
   zeta potential of suspensions made from as-received YSZ. A trace amount
   of tetragonal phase observed in 8 mol\% YSZ persists following washing
   and calcination milling. Dislocations and crystallographic defects
   together with fractured crystals which form during milling of the
   calcined powder should lead to the formation of more broken bonds; as a
   result the surface of the particles can support higher surface charge
   density. Washing and calcination milling lead to a shift of the
   isoelectric point of 8 mol\% YSZ from pH 8.4 to pH 6.3 and 6.8,
   respectively. Due to higher chemical stability and previously shown
   positive impacts on microstructure and performance of fuel cells, use of
   calcined YSZ can be more advantageous than as received powder. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper considers the minimum mean square error estimation problem
   for a class of jump Markov linear systems (JMLSs) with unknown
   transition probabilities (TPs). Compared with other existing estimators,
   the underlying real but unknown TPs addressed in our method are allowed
   to be time -variant. The expectation and covariances of residual error
   in the traditional interacting multiple -model (IMM) algorithm are
   computed analytically to show that Kalman filter running under true mode
   can still perform satisfactorily in the presence of wrong TPs. A
   compensation operator which heuristically modifies the posterior
   probabilities by adjusting a compensation parameter automatically is
   then developed. The proposed method is recursive and reduces to IMM
   method when the compensation parameter goes to value one. Application
   results for a simulated system are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) is an emerging area of brain
   research with clear application to brain iron studies in deep gray
   matter. However, acquisition of standard whole brain QSM can be
   time-consuming. One means to reduce scan time is to use a focal
   acquisition restricted only to the regions of interest such as deep gray
   matter. However, the non-local dipole field necessary for QSM
   reconstruction extends far beyond the structure of interest. We
   demonstrate the practical implications of these non-local fields on the
   choice of brain volume for QSM. In an illustrative numerical simulation
   and then in human brain experiments, we examine the effect on QSM of
   volume reduction in each dimension. For the globus pallidus, as an
   example of iron-rich deep gray matter, we demonstrate that substantial
   errors can arise even when the field-of-view far exceeds the physical
   structural boundaries. Thus, QSM reconstruction requires a non-local
   field-of-view prescription to ensure minimal errors. An axial QSM
   acquisition, centered on the globus pallidus, should encompass at least
   76 mm in the superior-inferior direction to conserve susceptibility
   values from the globus pallidus. This dimension exceeds the physical
   coronal extent of this structure by at least five-fold. As QSM sees
   wider use in the neuroscience community, its unique requirement for an
   extended field-of-view needs to be considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

   Using complex variable methods, exact electric and stress fields in the

   for periodic cracks to those for a single crack is determined by only
   the ratio of the period of the periodic crack-system to the crack
   length. Additionally, we find that the stress intensity factors for
   periodic cracks and the stress field in the proximity of periodic cracks
   can be treated essentially as those for a single crack when the period

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the accuracy of micro-scale finite
   element modeling for simulating broadband ultrasound propagation in
   water-saturated trabecular bone-mimicking phantoms. To this end, five
   commercially manufactured aluminum foam samples as trabecular
   bone-mimicking phantoms were utilized for ultrasonic immersion
   through-transmission experiments. Based on micro-computed tomography
   images of the same physical samples, three-dimensional high-resolution
   computational samples were generated to be implemented in the
   micro-scale finite element models. The finite element models employed
   the standard Galerkin finite element method (FEM) in time domain to
   simulate the ultrasonic experiments. The numerical simulations did not
   include energy dissipative mechanisms of ultrasonic attenuation;
   however, they expectedly simulated reflection, refraction, scattering,
   and wave mode conversion. The accuracy of the finite element simulations
   were evaluated by comparing the simulated ultrasonic attenuation and
   velocity with the experimental data. The maximum and the average
   relative errors between the experimental and simulated attenuation
   coefficients in the frequency range of 0.6 - 1.4 MHz were 17\% and 6\%
   respectively. Moreover, the simulations closely predicted the
   time-of-flight based velocities and the phase velocities of ultrasound
   with maximum relative errors of 20 m/s and 11 m/s respectively. The
   results of this study strongly suggest that micro-scale finite element
   modeling can effectively simulate broadband ultrasound propagation in
   water-saturated trabecular bone-mimicking structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present research deals with bifurcation and vibration responses of a
   composite truncated conical shell with embedded single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs) subjected to an external pressure and axial
   compression simultaneously. The distribution of reinforcements through
   the thickness of the shell is assumed to be either uniform or
   functionally graded. The equations of motion are established using
   Green-Lagrange type nonlinear kinematics within the framework of
   Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory. Linear membrane prebuckling analysis
   is conducted to extract the prebuckling deformations. The stability
   equations are derived by applying the adjacent equilibrium criterion to
   the prebuckling state of the conical shell. A semi-analytical solution
   on the basis of the trigonometric expansion through the circumferential
   direction along with the harmonic differential quadrature (HDQ)
   discretization in the meridional direction is developed. A series of
   comparison studies are carried out to assure the accuracy and the
   convergence of the HDQ method. The research indicates that the superb
   accuracy and efficiency of solutions with few grid points are attributed
   to the higher-order harmonic approximation function in the HDQ method.
   Parametric studies are also presented to investigate the influence of
   boundary conditions, semi-vertex angle of the cone, volume fraction and
   distribution of CNTs on stability and vibration characteristics of the
   truncated conical shell. The results show that both volume fraction and
   distribution of CNTs play a pivotal role in the natural frequencies,
   buckling mode and buckling loads of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical
   shell. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Production of renewable diesel through the hydroprocessing of

Abstract = {{Due to the scarcity of fossil fuels and to population increases, there
   is an urgent need for renewable energy sources that can replace
   petroleum-derived fuels. Lignocellulosic biomass, a renewable resource,
   can be converted to bio-oil by fast pyrolysis and further upgraded to
   renewable diesel through hydro processing. The upgrading of oil by fast
   pyrolysis is the main focus of this paper. Bio-oil has a higher energy
   density and heating value than biomass, but it cannot be used in place
   of petro-diesel as it is highly unstable, polar, and immiscible with
   hydrocarbons. Thus upgrading is necessary as it removes
   oxygen-containing compounds from bio-oil. Hydroprocessing was chosen for
   this review paper as the method of upgrading bio-oil because there are
   hydrotreating units in place in refineries. To upgrade bio-oil,
   hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) in the presence of both a catalyst and hydrogen
   can replace hydro-desulfurization (the removal of sulfur compounds from
   crude oil). A sulfided NiMo/CoMo catalyst supported on gamma alumina is
   used as a benchmark catalyst for a hydrodesulfurization reaction in
   refineries and is considered the reference catalyst for HDO in the
   production of renewable diesel. The properties of renewable diesel made
   through hydroprocessing are similar to those of petro-diesel. Catalyst
   deactivation and techno-economic assessments of the whole pathway are
   areas that need more attention before renewable diesel can be
   commercialized. This review paper concentrates on the reaction mechanism
   in bio-oil upgrading, process parameters, and the limitations of
   hydroprocessing technology. This paper will be helpful for further
   modeling of techno-economic analysis in renewable diesel production from
   lignocellulosic biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The granular extension of Sugeno-type fuzzy models based on optimal

Abstract = {{The Sugeno-type fuzzy models are used frequently in system modeling. The
   idea of information granulation inherently arises in the design process
   of Sugeno-type fuzzy model, whereas information granulation is closely
   related with the developed information granules. In this paper, the
   design method of Sugeno-type granular model is proposed on a basis of an
   optimal allocation of information granularity. The overall design
   process initiates with a well-established Sugeno-type numeric fuzzy
   model (the original Sugeno-type model). Through assigning soundly
   information granularity to the related parameters of the antecedents and
   the conclusions of fuzzy rules of the original Sugeno-type model (i.e.
   granulate these parameters in the way of optimal allocation of
   information granularity becomes realized), the original Sugeno-type
   model is extended to its granular counterpart (granular model). Several
   protocols of optimal allocation of information granularity are also
   discussed. The obtained granular model is applied to forecast three
   real-world time series. The experimental results show that the method of
   designing Sugeno-type granular model offers some advantages yielding
   models of good prediction capabilities. Furthermore, those also show
   merits of the Sugeno-type granular model: (1) the output of the model is
   an information granule (interval granule) rather than the specific
   numeric entity, which facilitates further interpretation; (2) the model
   can provide much more flexibility than the original Sugeno-type model;
   (3) the constructing approach of the model is of general nature as it
   could be applied to various fuzzy models and realized by invoking
   different formalisms of information granules. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a concept of a granular input space in
   system modeling, in particular in fuzzy rule-based modeling. The
   underlying problem can be succinctly formulated in the following way:
   given is a numeric model, develop an efficient way of forming granular
   input variables so that the corresponding granular outputs of the model
   achieve the highest level of specificity. The rationale behind the
   formulation of the problem is offered along with several illustrative
   examples. In conjunction with the underlying idea, developed is an
   algorithmic framework supporting an optimization of the specificity of
   the model exposed to granular inputs (data). It is dwelled upon one of
   the principles of Granular Computing, namely an optimal allocation of
   information granularity. For illustrative purposes, the study is focused
   on information granules formalized in terms of intervals (however the
   proposed approach becomes equally relevant for other formalism of
   information granules). Some comparative analysis with the existing idea
   of global sensitivity analysis is also carried out by contrasting the
   essential differences among the two approaches and analyzing the results

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{20-31}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{For a planetary gear set, the transducer-perceived vibration signal
   contains vibration information from multiple sources including the sun
   gear, planet gears, and the ring gear. All these vibration sources are
   subject to corresponding transmission path effects. In this paper, a
   comprehensive vibration signal model for a planetary gear set is
   proposed considering all the vibration sources and transmission path
   effects. Vibration sources were generated with a nonlinear
   two-dimensional lumped-parameter dynamic model. Transmission path
   effects are modeled as two parts: the part inside the gearbox to the
   casing and the other part along the casing to the transducer position.
   Given the gear sizes, the transmission path effect modeling parameters
   are estimated. Then the influences of different transmission paths on
   resultant vibration signals are analyzed. Some vibration characteristics
   are revealed for one healthy planetary gear set. These vibration
   characteristics are validated with lab experimental data in both time
   domain and frequency domain. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{96-106}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mechanism reliability is defined as the ability of a certain mechanism
   to maintain output accuracy under specified conditions. Mechanism
   reliability is generally assessed by the classical direct probability
   method (DPM) derived from the first order second moment (FOSM) method.
   The DPM relies strongly on the analytical form of the dynamic solution
   so it is not applicable to multi-body mechanisms that have only
   numerical solutions. In this paper, an indirect probability model (IPM)
   is proposed for mechanism reliability evaluation of multi-body
   mechanisms. IPM combines the dynamic equation, degradation function and
   Kaplan-Meier estimator to evaluate mechanism reliability
   comprehensively. Furthermore, to reduce the amount of computation in
   practical applications, the IPM is simplified into the indirect
   probability step model (IPSM). A case study of a crank-slider mechanism
   with clearance is investigated. Results show that relative errors
   between the theoretical and experimental results of mechanism
   reliability are less than 5\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As we aim at alleviating the curse of high-dimensionality, subspace
   learning is becoming more popular. Existing approaches use either
   information about global or local structure of the data, and few studies

   local structure preserving sparse subspace learning (GLOSS) model for
   unsupervised feature selection. The model can simultaneously realize
   feature selection and subspace learning. In addition, we develop a
   greedy algorithm to establish a generic combinatorial model, and an
   iterative strategy based on an accelerated block coordinate descent is
   used to solve the GLoSS problem. We also provide whole iterate sequence
   convergence analysis of the proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to show the superiority

Abstract = {{Planetary gearbox vibration signals feature complex modulations, thus
   leading to intricate sideband structure and resulting in difficulty in
   fault characteristic frequency identification. Intrinsic time-scale
   decomposition has unique merits, such as high adaptability to changes in
   signals, low computational complexity, good capability to suppress mode
   mixing and to preserve temporal information of transients, and excellent
   suitability for mono-component decomposition of complex multi-component
   signals. In order to address the issue with planetary gearbox fault
   diagnosis due to the multiple modulation sources, a joint amplitude and
   frequency demodulation analysis method is proposed, by exploiting the
   merits of intrinsic time-scale decomposition. The signal is firstly
   decomposed into a series of mono-component proper rotational components.
   Then the one with its instantaneous frequency fluctuating around the
   gear meshing frequency or its harmonics is selected as the sensitive
   component. Next, Fourier transformation is applied to the instantaneous
   amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the sensitive component to
   obtain the amplitude and frequency demodulated spectra respectively.
   Finally, a planetary gearbox fault is diagnosed by matching the peaks in
   the amplitude and frequency demodulated spectra with the theoretical
   gear fault characteristic frequencies. The proposed method is
   illustrated by a numerical simulated signal, and further validated by
   lab experimental signals of a planetary gearbox. The localized faults of
   sun, planet and ring gears are diagnosed, showing the effectiveness of
   the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{10293-10301}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{Conventional anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are
   Ni-based cermets, which are highly susceptible to deactivation by
   contaminants in hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrogen sulfide is one of the
   commonly existed contaminants in readily available natural gas and
   gasification product gases of pyrolysis of biomasses. Development of
   sulfur tolerant anode materials is thus one of the critical challenges
   for commercial viability and practical application of SOFC technologies.
   Here we report a viable approach to enhance substantially the sulfur
   poisoning resistance of a Ni-gadolinia-doped ceria (Ni-GDC) anode
   through impregnation of proton conducting perovskite
   BaCe0.9Yb0.1O3-delta (BCYb). The impregnation of BCYb nanoparticles
   improves the electrochemical performance of the Ni-GDC anode in both H-2
   and H2S containing fuels. Moreover, more importantly, the enhanced
   stability is observed in 500 ppm of H2S/H-2. The SEM and XPS analysis
   indicate that the infiltrated BCYb fine particles inhibit the adsorption
   of sulfur and facilitate sulfur removal from active sites, thus
   preventing the detrimental interaction between sulfur and Ni-GDC and the
   formation of cerium sulfide. The preliminary results of the cell with
   the BCYb+Ni-GDC anode in methane fuel containing 5000 ppm of H2S show
   the promising potential of the BCYb infiltration approach in the
   development of highly active and stable Ni-GDC-based anodes fed with
   hydrocarbon fuels containing a high concentration of sulfur compounds.}},

Title = {{Sparse RNA folding revisited: space-efficient minimum free energy
   structure prediction}},
Journal = {{ALGORITHMS FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: RNA secondary structure prediction by energy minimization is
   the central computational tool for the analysis of structural non-coding
   RNAs and their interactions. Sparsification has been successfully
   applied to improve the time efficiency of various structure prediction
   algorithms while guaranteeing the same result; however, for many such
   folding problems, space efficiency is of even greater concern,
   particularly for long RNA sequences. So far, space-efficient sparsified
   RNA folding with fold reconstruction was solved only for simple
   base-pair-based pseudo-energy models.
   Results: Here, we revisit the problem of space-efficient free energy
   minimization. Whereas the space-efficient minimization of the free
   energy has been sketched before, the reconstruction of the optimum
   structure has not even been discussed. We show that this reconstruction
   is not possible in trivial extension of the method for simple energy
   models. Then, we present the time-and space-efficient sparsified free
   energy minimization algorithm SPARSEMFEFOLD that guarantees MFE
   structure prediction. In particular, this novel algorithm provides
   efficient fold reconstruction based on dynamically garbage-collected
   trace arrows. The complexity of our algorithm depends on two parameters,
   the number of candidates Z and the number of trace arrows T; both are
   bounded by n(2), but are typically much smaller. The time complexity of
   RNA folding is reduced from O(n(3)) to O(n(2) + nZ); the space
   complexity, from O(n(2)) to O(n + T + Z). Our empirical results show
   more than 80 \% space savings over RNAfold {[}Vienna RNA package] on the
   long RNAs from the RNA STRAND database (>= 2500 bases).
   Conclusions: The presented technique is intentionally generalizable to
   complex prediction algorithms; due to their high space demands,
   algorithms like pseudoknot prediction and RNA-RNA-interaction prediction
   are expected to profit even stronger than ``standard{''} MFE folding.}},

Abstract = {{Dry adhesives have attracted much attention because of their repeatable
   and reversible attachment. Many research groups have made fruitful
   achievements in fabricating and designing various dry adhesives.
   However, most of these studies focus on imitating bioinspired geometry
   to achieve this smart adhesion, neglecting the contact interface control
   through their peeling motion. Here, we present an alternative design to
   achieve this switchable adhesion on the basis of controlling contact
   areas. This unique design includes micropillars array with large
   overhanging caps and a ``step{''} located at the center line of the cap.
   When dragging the pillars in the direction of the upper surface of the
   step, the lower surface is brought into contact, rapidly yielding
   stronger adhesion (switched-on state). Alternatively, when dragging the
   pillars in the direction of the lower surface of the step, the contact
   areas decrease sharply, leading to weak adhesion (switched-off state).
   Such switchable property under strong adhesion force is exactly what
   many practical applications need, and the ability to achieve this
   property by controlling the adhesion area size presented here opens a
   new way to dry adhesives design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the oxidation of oil sands process-affected
   water (OSPW) by potassium ferrate (VI). Due to the selectivity of
   ferrate(VI) oxidation, two-ring and three-ring fluorescing aromatics
   were preferentially removed at doses <100 mg/L Fe(VI), and one-ring
   aromatics were removed only at doses >= 100 mg/L Fe(VI). Ferrate(VI)
   oxidation achieved 64.0\% and 78.4\% removal of naphthenic acids (NAs)
   at the dose of 200 mg/L and 400 mg/L Fe(VI) respectively, and NAs with
   high carbon number and ring number were removed preferentially. H-1
   nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectra indicated that the
   oxidation of fluorescing aromatics resulted in the opening of some
   aromatic rings. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis detected
   signals of organic radical intermediates, indicating that one electron
   transfer is one of the probable mechanisms in the oxidation of NAs. The
   inhibition effect of OSPW on Vibrio fischeri and the toxicity effect on
   goldfish primary kidney macrophages (PKMs) were both reduced after
   ferrate(VI) oxidation. The fluorescing aromatics in OSPW were proposed
   to be an important contributor to this acute toxicity. Degradation of
   model compounds with ferrate(VI) was also investigated and the results
   confirmed our findings in OSPW study.}},

   simulated solutions separately with CO2, H2S as well as a mixed gas of
   them were studied and compared with those of X70 and 316 stainless steel
   (316 SS). The results show that X70 and 316 SS display inclusions on the
   surface before corrosion, while Ni-Cr-Mo coating exhibits a uniform and
   compact microstructure. Moreover, Ni-Cr-Mo coating has no change in
   morphology after corrosion, while X70 and 316 SS display severe
   corrosion and pitting corrosion, respectively. For each simulated
   solution, Ni-Cr-Mo coating exhibits higher corrosion resistance than X70
   and 316 SS. Also, it shows higher polarization resistance than 316 SS
   and X70 as immersion time lasts, revealing an enhanced and stable
   anticorrosion performance. Furthermore, the variation trends of
   electrochemical response was opposite for X70 and 316 SS/Ni-Cr-Mo
   coating in simulated solutions with CO2, H2S as well as the mixed gas
   accordingly, which is caused by different corrosion mechanisms. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{(RADA)(4)-based nanoscaffolds have many inherent properties making them

   effect on primary microglia in culture and general tissue (in vivo)
   biocompatibility (astrocyte and migroglia). Laminin-derived IKVAV
   peptide was chosen to promote beneficial cell interaction and attenuate
   deleterious glial responses. Microglia remained ramified when cultured
   with these nanoscaffolds, as observed using TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, NO,
   and proliferation assays. Evidence suggests that cultured microglia
   phagocytise the matrix whilst remaining ramified and viable, as shown
   visually and metabolically (MIT). Nanoscaffold intracerebral injection
   did not lead to microglia migration or proliferation, nor were glial
   scarring and axonal injury observed over the course of this study. IINAV
   had no affect on microglia activation and astrogliosis. (RADA)(4) should
   be advantageous for localized injection as a tuneable-platform device,
   which may be readily cleared without deleterious effects on
   tissue-resident microglia.

Journal = {{CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{116-125}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Just-in-time learning is an important framework for adaptive soft sensor
   modeling. However, the prediction accuracy strongly depends on the
   appropriate selection of relevant samples. Most traditional sample
   selection methods only consider the input information of samples,
   without any reference to the output information. In this paper, a new
   sample selection method in the supervised latent structure is proposed,
   in which the latent variables are highly related to the output. After
   that, to enhance the performance of the JITL local model, both sample
   importance and variable importance are taken into consideration for
   feature extraction in principal component regression (PCR), which is
   termed as double locally weighted principal component regression
   (D-LWPCR) in this paper. The effectiveness of the D-LWPCR model with
   sample selection in supervised latent structure is validated through a
   numerical example and an industrial blast furnace ironmaking process.

Volume = {{173}},

Abstract = {{The electrode potential or galvanic series is usually used to reflect
   the nobility of metals and semi-metals. However, this potential is
   environment-dependent and the intrinsic nobility of a metal is
   ultimately governed by its electron stability, which can be represented
   by the electron work function (EWF). This article reports our studies on
   the corrosion behavior of isomorphous Cu-Ni alloy in HCl and NaCl
   solutions, respectively. It was demonstrated that the EWF of the alloy
   increased as the Ni concentration was increased, so did the corrosion
   resistance in the acidic solution. In the sodium chloride solution,
   however, the trend was reversed due to adsorption, hydrolysis and the
   formation of oxide scale on Cu-rich samples, which more or less
   prevented them from further corrosion in this solution. In order to
   confirm this, corrosive wear tests were performed to analyze the
   performance of the alloy when the effect of oxide scale was eliminated
   or minimized by the mechanical action. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{173}},
Pages = {{467-474}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Ceria-silica composite nanoparticles are used in a variety of areas
   including catalysis, biomedical applications, and the microelectronic
   industry. In this study, we explain the connection between colloidal
   forces of interaction during preparation of ceria-silica mixed colloidal
   particles, the stability of these suspensions, and the relationship
   between the stability and the functionality of mixed colloidal particles
   under different conditions. Short-term stability evolution of the mixed
   colloidal particles reveals that at the very early stages of the
   interaction of ceria and silica, the interaction rate increases until it
   reaches a maximum value, and then it decreases during the subsequent
   stage. More importantly, it is found that the first stage of the
   interaction becomes more dominant at lower relative surface area of
   ceria to silica. Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory of colloidal
   interaction is successfully used to explain short-term stability
   results. Moreover, it is found that mixed colloidal particles exhibit a
   long-term stability behaviour that not only depends on the colloidal
   forces of interaction between ceria and silica particles, but also is
   affected by hydrodynamic effects such as gravitational forces. For that
   reason, mixed colloidal particles exhibit long-term stability behaviours
   that are not the same as their short-term stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this work, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed
   to investigate the effect of naphthenic acids (NAs) in early stage
   self-assembly of polyaromatic (PA) molecules in toluene. By exploiting
   NA molecules of the same polar functional group but different
   aliphatic/cycloaliphatic nonpolar tails, it was found that irrespective
   of the presence of the NA molecules in the system, the dominant mode of
   pi-pi stacking is a twisted, offset parallel stacking of a slightly
   larger overlapping area. Unlike large NA molecules, the presence of
   small NA molecules enhanced the number of pi-pi stacked PA molecules by
   suppressing the hydrogen bonding interactions among the PA molecules.
   Smaller NA molecules were found to have a higher tendency to associate
   with PA molecules than larger NA molecules. Moreover, the size and
   distribution of n pi-pi stacking structures were affected to different
   degrees by changing the size and structural features of the NA molecules
   in the system. It was further revealed that the association between NA
   and PA molecules, mainly through hydrogen bonding, creates a favorable
   local environment for the overlap of PA cores (i.e., pi-pi stacking
   growth) by depressing the hydrogen bonding between PA molecules, which
   results in the removal of some toluene molecules from the vicinity of
   the PA molecules.}},

   In this study we compared the structure of ZnS nanoparticles relaxed in
   a vacuum and in water using a classical molecular dynamics method.
   Structural analyses showed that the previously observed three-phase
   structure of bare nanoparticles is not formed in the hydrated state. The
   bulk of hydrated nanoparticles has more crystalline structure; however,
   the dynamic heterogeneity in their surface relaxation makes them more
   polar compared to bare nanoparticles. This heterogeneity is more severe
   in hydrated wurtzite nanoparticles, causing them to show larger dipole
   moments. Analyzing the structure of water in the first hydration shell
   of the surface atoms shows that water is mainly adsorbed to the
   nanoparticles' surface through Zn-O interaction, which causes the
   structure of water in the first hydration shell to be discontinuous.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of interface curvature on phase equilibrium has been much
   more studied for single-component than multicomponent systems. We
   isolate the effect of curvature on multicomponent vapor liquid
   equilibrium (VLE) phase envelopes and phase composition diagrams using

   interface curvature shifts the azeotrope (equal volatility point) of
   nonideal systems. Understanding of the effect of curvature on VLE can be
   exploited in future nanoscale prediction and design.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Using nickel added X70 steel as a sample material, we demonstrate that
   electron work function (EWF), which largely reflects the electron
   behavior of materials, could be used as a guide parameter for material
   modification or design. Adding Ni having a higher electron work function
   to X70 steel brings more ``free{''} electrons to the steel, leading to
   increased overall work function, accompanied with enhanced e(-)-nuclei
   interactions or higher atomic bond strength. Young's modulus and
   hardness increase correspondingly. However, the free electron density
   and work function decrease as the Ni content is continuously increased,
   accompanied with the formation of a second phase, FeNi3, which is softer
   with a lower work function. The decrease in the overall work function
   corresponds to deterioration of the mechanical strength of the steel. It
   is expected that EWF, a simple but fundamental parameter, may lead to
   new methodologies or supplementary approaches for metallic materials
   design or tailoring on a feasible electronic base.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study between nanotitanate doped with different metals

   fixed-bed reactor and exposed to the H2S containing gas flow at
   temperatures ranging from 75 to 950 degrees C. Online analysis is done
   by a mass spectrometer. The sorbents are also tested by the off line
   analytical techniques X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) after the experiments to provide detailed information
   about their elemental and crystalline composition. The results indicate
   Cu-ETS-2 as the most effective H2S-scrubber among the tested sorbents.
   The lowest H2S concentration in the outlet gas is always achieved in
   water rich gas. Additionally, the H2S capacity is nearly always higher
   for the water rich gas than in the hydrogen rich gas.}},

Title = {{Reacquisition of the lower temporal bar in sexually dimorphic fossil
   lizards provides a rare case of convergent evolution}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{Temporal fenestration has long been considered a key character to
   understand relationships amongst reptiles. In particular, the absence of
   the lower temporal bar (LTB) is considered one of the defining features
   of squamates (lizards and snakes). In a re-assessment of the
   borioteiioid lizard Polyglyphanodon sternbergi (Cretaceous, North
   America), we detected a heretofore unrecognized ontogenetic series,
   sexual dimorphism (a rare instance for Mesozoic reptiles), and a
   complete LTB, a feature only recently recognized for another
   borioteiioid, Tianyusaurus zhengi (Cretaceous, China). A new
   phylogenetic analysis (with updates on a quarter of the scorings for P.
   sternbergi) indicates not only that the LTB was reacquired in squamates,
   but it happened independently at least twice. An analysis of the
   functional significance of the LTB using proxies indicates that, unlike
   for T. zhengi, this structure had no apparent functional advantage in P.
   sternbergi, and it is better explained as the result of structural
   constraint release. The observed canalization against a LTB in squamates
   was broken at some point in the evolution of borioteiioids, whereas
   never re-occuring in other squamate lineages. This case of convergent
   evolution involves a mix of both adaptationist and structuralist causes,
   which is unusual for both living and extinct vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{A harmonic synergy between the load-bearing and stabilizing components
   of the spine is necessary to maintain its normal function. This study
   aimed to investigate the load-sharing along the ligamentous lumbosacral
   spine under sagittal loading. A 3D nonlinear detailed Finite Element
   (FE) model of lumbosacral spine with realistic geometry was developed
   and validated using wide range of numerical and experimental (in-vivo
   and in-vitro) data. The model was subjected to 500 N compressive
   Follower Load (FL) combined with 7.5 Nm flexion (FLX) or extension (EXT)
   moments. Load-sharing was expressed as percentage of total internal
   force/moment developed along the spine that each spinal component
   carried. These internal forces and moments were determined at the discs
   centres and included the applied load and the resisting forces in the
   ligaments and facet joints.
   The contribution of the facet joints and ligaments in supporting bending
   moments produced additional forces and moments in the discs. The
   intervertebral discs carried up to 81\% and 68\% of the total internal
   force in case of FL combined with FLX and EXT, respectively. The
   ligaments withstood up to 67\% and 81\% of the total internal moment in
   cases of FL combined with EXT and FLX, respectively. Contribution of the
   facet joints in resisting internal force and moment was noticeable at
   levels L4-S1 only particularly in case of FL combined with EXT and
   reached up 29\% and 52\% of the internal moment and force, respectively.
   This study demonstrated that spinal load-sharing depended on applied
   load and varied along the spine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The infrared-active (IR) vibrational mode of ethanol (EtOH) associated
   with the asymmetrical stretching of the C-C-O bond in pico-liter volumes
   of EtOH-water binary mixtures is calorimetrically measured using
   photothermal microfluidic cantilever deflection spectroscopy (PMCDS). IR
   absorption by the confined liquid results in wavelength dependent
   cantilever deflections, thus providing a complementary response to IR
   absorption revealing a complex dipole moment dependence on mixture
   concentration. Solvent-induced blue shifts of the C-C-O asymmetric
   vibrational stretch for both anti and gauche conformers of EtOH were
   precisely monitored for EtOH concentrations ranging from 20-100\% w/w.
   Variations in IR absorption peak maxima show an inverse dependence on
   induced EtOH dipole moment (mu) and is attributed to the complex
   clustering mechanism of EtOH-water mixtures.}},

   significant amount of basic research, also being potential drug targets.
   High-throughput identification of these channels is hampered by the low
   levels of availability of their structures and an observation that use
   of sequence similarity offers limited predictive quality. Consequently,
   several machine learning predictors of ion channels from protein
   sequences that do not rely on high sequence similarity were developed.
   However, only one of these methods offers a wide scope by predicting ion
   channels, their types and four major subtypes of the voltage-gated
   channels. Moreover, this and other existing predictors utilize
   relatively simple predictive models that limit their accuracy. We
   propose a novel and accurate predictor of ion channels, their types and
   the four subtypes of the voltage-gated channels called PSIONplus. Our
   method combines a support vector machine model and a sequence similarity
   search with BLAST. The originality of PSIONplus stems from the use of a
   more sophisticated machine learning model that for the first time in
   this area utilizes evolutionary profiles and predicted secondary
   structure, solvent accessibility and intrinsic disorder. We empirically
   demonstrate that the evolutionary profiles provide the strongest
   predictive input among new and previously used input types. We also show
   that all new types of inputs contribute to the prediction. Results on an
   independent test dataset reveal that PSIONplus obtains relatively good
   predictive performance and outperforms existing methods. It secures
   accuracies of 85.4\% and 68.3\% for the prediction of ion channels and
   their types, respectively, and the average accuracy of 96.4\% for the
   discrimination of the four ion channel subtypes. Stand-alone version of
   PSIONplus is freely available from

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage is the method of choice to extract
   bitumen from Athabasca oil-sand reservoirs in Western Canada. Under
   reservoir conditions, bitumen is immobile because of high viscosity, and
   its typically high level of saturation limits the injectivity of steam.
   In current industry practice, steam is circulated within injection and
   production wells. Operators keep the steam circulating until mobile
   bitumen breaks through the producer and communication is established
   between the injector and the producer. The ``startup{''} phase is a
   time-consuming process taking three or more months with no oil
   production. A variety of processes could be used to minimize the length
   of the startup phase, such as electromagnetic (EM) heating in either the
   induction (medium frequency) or radio-frequency ranges. Knowledge of the
   size of the hot zone formed by steam circulation and of the benefits of
   simultaneous EM-heating techniques increases understanding of the
   startup process and helps to minimize startup duration. The aim of the
   present work is to introduce an analytical model to predict startup
   duration for steam circulation with and without EM heating. Results
   reveal that resistive (electrothermal) heating with/without brine
   injection cannot be a preferable method for mobilizing the bitumen in
   startup phase. Induction slightly decreases startup time at frequencies
   smaller than 10 kHz, and at 100 kHz it can reduce startup time to less
   than two months.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, different models were proposed to describe two- and
   three-phase flow at the edge of a steam chamber developed during a
   steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) process. However, 2D-scaled SAGD
   experiments and recent micromodel visualizations demonstrate that steam
   condensate is primarily in the form of microbubbles dispersed in the oil
   phase (water-in-oil emulsion). Therefore, the challenging question is:
   Can the multiphase Darcy equation be used to describe the transport of
   water as a discontinuous phase? Furthermore, the physical impact of
   water as a continuous phase or as microbubbles on oil flow can be
   different. Water microbubbles increase the apparent oil viscosity,
   whereas a continuous water phase decreases the oil relative
   permeability. Investigating the impact of these two phenomena on oil
   mobility at the steam-chamber edge and on overall oil-production rate
   during an SAGD process requires development of relevant mathematical
   models, which is the focus of this paper.
   In this paper, we develop an analytical model for lateral expansion of
   the steam chamber that accounts for formation and transport of
   water-in-oil emulsion. It is assumed that emulsion is generated as a
   result of condensation of steam, which penetrates into the heated
   bitumen. The emulsion concentration decreases from a maximum value at
   the chamber interface to zero far from the interface. The oil viscosity
   is affected by both temperature gradient caused by heat conduction and
   microbubble concentration gradient resulting from emulsification. We
   conduct a sensitivity analysis with the measured data from scaled SAGD
   experiments. The sensitivity analysis shows that, by increasing the
   value of m (temperature viscosity parameter), the effect of
   emulsification on oil- flow rate decreases. It also shows that the
   effect of temperature on oil mobility is much stronger than that of
   emulsion. We also compare the model predictions with field production
   data from several SAGD operations. Butler's model overestimates oil-
   production rate caused by the single-phase assumption, whereas the
   proposed model presents more-accurate oil- flow rate, supporting the
   fact that one should include emulsification effect in the SAGD analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Flow conditions determine the flow regimes governing gas flow in porous
   media. Slip-flow regime commonly occurs in laboratory gas-permeability
   measurements, and one must consider the physics of that when finding the
   absolute permeability of a sample. Accurate permeability estimates are
   paramount for production forecasts, financial planning, and recovery
   estimation. Slip flow is present in low-permeability rocks, both in the
   laboratory environment and at reservoir conditions. Gas flow through the
   matrix lies under the slip-flow regime for the majority of
   low-permeability-reservoir production scenarios, and accurate prediction
   of pressure and production rate requires a good understanding of the
   flow regime. In this paper, an analytical study is conducted on the
   dominant flow regimes under typical shale-gas reservoir conditions. A
   flow-regime map is produced with respect to gas pressure and matrix
   permeability. Steady-state gas-permeability experiments are conducted on
   three shale samples. An analytical model is used to match the
   experimental results that could explain the order-of-magnitude
   difference between the permeabilities of gas and liquid in shales.
   Experimental results are combined with further tests available in the
   literature to inform a discussion of the model's parameters. The results
   improve the accuracy of gas-flow modeling and of absolute-permeability
   estimates from laboratory tests. Similar tests performed at various mean
   effective stresses investigate the influence of mean effective stress on
   flow regime and apparent permeability. The results indicate that flow
   regime is a function of mean effective stress, and that the apparent
   permeability of shale rocks is a function of both flow regime and mean
   effective stress.}},

Abstract = {{The particular bacterium under investigation here (S. pasteurii) is
   unique in its ability, under the right conditions, to induce the
   hydrolysis of urea (ureolysis) in naturally occurring environments
   through secretion of an enzyme urease. This process of ureolysis,
   through a chain of chemical reactions, leads to the formation of calcium
   carbonate precipitates. This is known as Microbiologically Induced
   Calcite Precipitation (MICP). The proper culture protocols for MICP are
   detailed here. Finally, visualization experiments under different modes
   of microscopy were performed to understand various aspects of the
   precipitation process. Techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
   Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Photo-electron Spectroscopy (XPS)
   were employed to chemically characterize the end-product. Further, the
   ability of these precipitates to clog pores inside a natural porous
   medium was demonstrated through a qualitative experiment where sponge
   bars were used to mimic a pore-network with a range of length scales. A
   sponge bar dipped in the culture medium containing the bacterial cells
   hardens due to the clogging of its pores resulting from the continuous
   process of chemical precipitation. This hardened sponge bar exhibits
   superior strength when compared to a control sponge bar which becomes
   compressed and squeezed under the action of an applied external load,
   while the hardened bar is able to support the same weight with little
   deformation.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Halloysite is a naturally occurring clay, with physical structure
   represented by halloysite nanotubes (HNTs). We investigated the
   potential applicability of HNTs for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, using
   two amine-functionalized HNTs: (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane
   (APTES)-grafted HNTs and polyethylenimine (PEI)-impregnated HNTs.
   APTES-HNTs and PEI-HNTs resulted in 5.6 and 30 wt.\% (in sorbent) in
   functionalization onto HNTs, respectively. Capture efficiency was higher
   in APTES-HNTs at lower temperatures, while it was maximum in PEI-HNTs at
   70 degrees C-75 degrees C. At 75 degrees C, adsorption/desorption tests
   showed that 95\% of the two reactions occurred within 30 min, and
   exhibited 0.15 and 0.21 millimole of CO2 adsorption capacity per
   millimole of amine group for APTES-HNTs and PEI-HNTs, respectively.
   During 10 cycles of CO2 adsorption/desorption, there was no significant
   decrease in sorbent weight and adsorption capacity in both HNTs. These
   results show that inherent structural features of HNTs can be easily
   tailored for the development of operational condition-specific CO2
   capture system.}},

Abstract = {{Underground coal gasification (UCG) has been identified as an
   environmentally friendly technique for gasification of deep un-mineable
   coal seams in situ. This technology has the potential to be a clean and
   promising energy provider from coal seams with minimal greenhouse gas
   emission. The UCG eliminates the presence of coal miners underground
   hence, it is believed to be a much safer technique compared to the deep
   coal mining method. The UCG includes drilling injection and production
   wells into the coal seam, igniting coal, and injecting oxygen-based mix
   to facilitate coal gasification. Produced syngas is extracted from the
   production well. Evolution of a cavity created from the gasification
   process along with high temperature as well as change in pore fluid
   pressure causes mechanical changes to the coal and surrounding
   formations. Therefore, simulation of the gasification process alone is
   not sufficient to represent this complex
   thermal-hydro-chemical-mechanical process. Instead, a coupled flow and
   geomechanical modeling can help better represent the process by allowing
   simultaneous observation of the syngas production, advancement of the
   gasification chamber, and the cavity growth. Adaptation of such a
   coupled simulation would aid in optimization of the UCG process while
   helping controlling and mitigating the environmental risks caused by
   geomechanical failure and syngas loss to the groundwater. This paper
   presents results of a sequentially coupled flow-geomechanical simulation
   of a three-dimensional (3D) UCG example using the numerical methodology
   devised in this study. The 3D model includes caprock on top, coal seam
   in the middle, and another layer of rock underneath. Gasification
   modeling was conducted in the Computer Modelling Group Ltd. (CMG)'s
   Steam, Thermal, and Advanced processes Reservoir Simulator (STARS).
   Temperature and fluid pressure of each grid block as well as the cavity
   geometry, at the timestep level, were passed from the STARS to the
   geomechanical simulator i.e. the Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua in
   3 Dimensions (FLAC3D) computer program (from the Itasca Consulting Group
   Inc.). Key features of the UCG process which were investigated herein
   include syngas flow rate, cavity growth, temperature and pressure
   profiles, porosity and permeability changes, and stress and deformation
   in coal and rock layers. It was observed that the coal matrix deformed
   towards the cavity, displacement and additional stress happened, and
   some blocks in the coal and rock layers mechanically failed.}},

Title = {{History matching and production optimization of water flooding based on
   a data-driven interwell numerical simulation model}},

Abstract = {{Production optimization of a water flooding project aims to determine
   the optimum production strategy for maintaining the reservoir under
   real-time optimal controls, and maximizing the oil production or net
   present value (NPV) of the project. Current production optimization
   method with a conventional grid based simulator bears a high
   computational cost. Also, cumbersome history matching procedures are
   often required to build a reliable reservoir model for reducing the
   uncertainty of the optimized production strategies. To address the
   drawbacks of such conventional method, data-driven surrogate models,
   e.g., the correlation-based model, are developed to acquire interwell
   connectivity; such history matched model can be then used for production
   optimization. It is noted that, however, the correlation based models
   cannot handle the case where the conversion of duty occurs for some
   wells draining the reservoir, e.g., a production well is converted to a
   producer. Recently, we have developed a physics-based data-driven
   interwell numerical simulation model (INSIM) which can predict the
   production rates of individual phases and handle conversion-of-duty
   scenarios between any well pair. INSIM is derived by solving the
   material balance equation and augmenting the Buckley-Leverett theory. In
   this study, the INSIM is applied for the first time to optimize the
   production of water flooding projects. We derive and improve the INSIM
   by considering the active bottom or edge aquifers that are often
   encountered in real reservoirs. The improved INSIM can handle two types
   of aquifers: constant pressure aquifer and constant volume aquifer. By
   applying the inversion theory based on a finite-difference algorithm, we
   estimate the model parameters by history matching the historic
   production data. Subsequently, the history-matched INSIM is used for
   optimizing NPV of water flooding projects in both a synthetic reservoir
   and a real reservoir with an active aquifer. The injection rate of each
   injection well is treated as a tuning variable. As for the synthetic
   model, the simulation results show that the inversely derived model
   parameters are able to characterize the interwell formation properties,
   and the optimization result based on INSIM is in a good agreement with
   that obtained with the commercial simulator Eclipse 100. Similar
   history-matching results are also obtained when INSIM is applied to a
   real fracture-vuggy reservoir with an active aquifer. After production
   optimization of this real reservoir with INSIM, we achieve a 4\%
   reduction in the water cut but a 20\% increase in the oil production
   rate, which verifies the soundness of the proposed method. (C) 2016

Pages = {{119-128}},

Abstract = {{In order to explore the optimal relationship between eccentricity and
   mud-cement density difference in cement displacement process, the flow
   characteristics for non-Newtonian fluids involved in the laminar
   displacement inside an eccentric annulus are analyzed with fluid
   mechanics theory. An optimal density difference criterion is established
   based on the Herschel-Bulkley fluid model, which can be used to
   theoretically determine the optimum density difference yielding an
   optimal cement displacement performance. Numerical simulations are
   performed with a CFD software to investigate the influence of mud cement
   density difference on displacement performance under different
   eccentricities in highly deviated wells. The results indicate that there
   is an optimal density difference which can provide the best displacement
   efficiency at given inclination and eccentricity under laminar flow
   conditions. The good agreement, between the optimal density differences
   calculated by the optimal density difference formula and CFD numerical
   simulations, confirms the validity of the optimal density difference
   criterion for determining the optimal density difference in highly
   deviated wells. The research results can provide a practical guide on
   how to design the cement slurry density and how to install centralizers
   at highly deviated wells under laminar flow conditions. (C) 2016

Title = {{Ontology-based semantic approach for construction-oriented quantity
   take-off from BIM models in the light-frame building industry}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In building information modeling (BIM), the model is a digital
   representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility
   and contains enriched product information pertaining to the facility.
   This information is generally embedded into the BIM model as properties
   for parametric building objects, and is exchangeable among project
   stakeholders and BIM design programs a key feature of BIM for enhancing
   communication and work efficiency. However, BIM itself is a
   purpose-built, product-centric information database and lacks domain
   semantics such that extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off
   information for the purpose of construction workface planning still
   remains a challenge. Moreover, some information crucial to construction
   practitioners, such as the topological relationships among building
   objects, remains implicit in the BIM design model. This restricts
   information extraction from the BIM model for downstream analyses in
   construction. To address identified limitations, this study proposes an
   ontology-based semantic approach to extracting construction-oriented
   quantity take-off information from a BIM design model. This approach
   allows users to semantically query the BIM design model using a domain
   vocabulary, capitalizing on building product ontology formalized from
   construction perspectives. As such, quantity take-off information
   relevant to construction practitioners can be readily extracted and
   visualized in 3D in order to serve application needs in the construction
   field. A prototype application is implemented in Autodesk Revit to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new approach in the domain
   of light-frame building construction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, we employed both molecular statics and molecular dynamics
   simulation methods to investigate the role of vacancies in the formation
   and phase transition of Cu-rich precipitates in a-iron. The results
   indicated that vacancies promoted the diffusion of Cu atoms to form
   Cu-rich precipitates. After Cu-rich precipitates formed, they further
   trapped vacancies. The supersaturated vacancy concentration in the
   Cu-rich precipitate induced a shear strain, which triggered the phase
   transition from bcc to fcc structure by transforming the initial bcc
   (110) plane into fcc (111) plane. In addition, the formation of the
   fcc-twin structure and the stacking fault structure in the Cu-rich
   precipitates was observed in dynamics simulations. (C) 2016 Author(s).

Abstract = {{In construction, workers are frequently exposed to ergonomic risks that
   can lead to musculoskeletal disorders. To prevent ergonomic injuries,
   proper assessment of ergonomic risk is a key to identifying risk factors
   and modifying work practice in a timely manner. In field observation,
   however, difficulties in visually estimating human postures (e.g., body
   joint angles) required for ergonomic analysis have led to inconsistent
   results due to the subjectiveness of observers. This study thus proposes
   a fuzzy logic approach to posture-based ergonomic evaluation tools.
   Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) is selected as a case study to
   describe the fuzzy logic modelling of RULA scoring systems and discuss
   the application to modular construction shops. The results of validation
   comparing correlations with biomechanical analysis - used as a ground
   truth - reveal that the proposed system produces more accurate results
   than traditional methods and hence helps minimize human errors in
   observation for reliable on-site ergonomic assessment.}},

Abstract = {{This communication presents a new dual-band low-profile aperture antenna

   superposition of electric fields of patch and grooves, the antenna with
   high performance in both bands is achieved. In the proposed structure,
   three simple printed circuit boards (PCBs) for implementing a resonant
   transmission line and specific SIW structures are employed instead of
   waveguide feeder and grooves on metallic plate in conventional
   corrugated antennas. Removing the metallic plate reduces the weight and
   cost of the structure and provides ease of fabrication. Dual-band
   characteristic is achieved using resonant slot (cavity) and resonant

Abstract = {{Alarm systems play critically important roles for the safe and efficient
   operation of modern industrial plants. However, most existing industrial
   alarm systems suffer from poor performance, noticeably having too many
   alarms to be handled by operators in control rooms. Such alarm
   overloading is extremely detrimental to the important role played by
   alarm systems. This paper provides an overview of industrial alarm
   systems. Four main causes are identified as the culprits for alarm
   overloading, namely, chattering alarms due to noise and disturbance,
   alarm variables incorrectly configured, alarm design isolated from
   related variables, and abnormality propagation owing to physical
   connections. Industrial examples from a large-scale thermal power plant
   are provided as supportive evidences. The current research status for
   industrial alarm systems is summarized by focusing on existing studies
   related to these main causes. Eight fundamental research problems to be
   solved are formulated for the complete lifecycle of alarm variables
   including alarm configuration, alarm design, and alarm removal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a new approach for the theoretical design of
   unequal multisection Wilkinson power dividers, using single-layer
   microstrip lines. Similar to most multisection structures, the presented
   unequal divider can provide a broadband performance. To provide the
   design guideline, closed-form formulas are derived for the divider with
   odd or even number of sections. In each case, various simulations have
   been conducted to investigate the performance of dividers over the
   frequency band. For experimental verifications, two 1: 2 power dividers
   with a center frequency of 1 GHz are fabricated, having three and four
   sections. The simulated and measured results are presented, and good
   agreements between them are observed.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the surface tension-induced stress concentration around an
   elliptical hole inside an anisotropic half-plane with traction-free
   surface. Using conformal mapping techniques, the corresponding complex
   potential in the half-plane is expressed in a series whose unknown
   coefficients are determined numerically. Our results indicate that the
   maximum hoop stress around the hole (which appears in the vicinity of
   the point of maximum curvature) increases rapidly with decreasing
   distance between the hole and the free surface. In particular, for an
   elliptical or even circular hole in an anisotropic half-plane we find
   that, with decreasing distance between the hole and the free surface,
   the hoop stress can switch from compressive to tensile at certain points
   on the hole's boundary and from tensile to compressive at others. This
   phenomenon is absent in the case of an elliptical or even circular hole
   in the corresponding case of an isotropic half-plane. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Characterization of Precipitates in a Microalloyed Steel Using
   Quantitative X-ray Diffraction}},
Journal = {{METALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative X-ray diffraction (QXRD) (also known as the Rietveld
   method) was used to analyze the precipitates present in Grade 100
   microalloyed steel. The precipitates were extracted from the steel using
   electrolytic dissolution and the residue from the dissolution was
   analyzed using XRD. The XRD pattern exhibited three (3) distinct
   diffraction peaks, and significant broadening of a fourth peak
   corresponding to the <10 nm size precipitates. QXRD analysis was applied
   to the XRD pattern to obtain precipitate size, composition, and weight
   fraction data for each of the four diffraction peaks observed. The
   predicted mean precipitate diameter and average atomic composition of
   the nano-size (<10 nm) precipitates was 4.7 nm and
   (Nb0.50Ti0.32Mo0.18)(C0.59N0.41), respectively. The predicted
   precipitate size correlates well with the average size of precipitates
   measured in previous work by the authors using both transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). The
   average atomic composition correlates well with the composition measured
   in this work using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of individual
   nano-sized precipitates. The calculated weight fraction of the nano-size
   precipitates in the extracted residue was 42.2 wt. \%. The calculated
   atomic compositions of the other three diffraction peaks were TiN,
   (Ti0.87Nb0.13)N, and (Nb0.82Ti0.18)(C0.87N0.13) with weight fraction
   values of 12.9 wt. \%, 31.7 wt. \%, and 13.1 wt. \%, respectively. The
   sizes of both the (Ti0.87Nb0.13)N and the (Nb0.82Ti0.18)(C0.87N0.13)
   groups of precipitates were directly measured and were observed to range
   from 150 nm to 570 nm and from 90 nm to 475 nm, respectively. QXRD was
   unable to determine a reasonable mean precipitate size for either of
   these two groups of precipitates. The wide compositional range (i.e.,
   varying levels of Nb and Ti) of these precipitates (as measured by EDX)
   resulted in XRD peak broadening that was erroneously interpreted as a
   size broadening effect.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{112}},

Pages = {{619-635}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We present an analytical solution for buoyancy-driven ``filling box{''}
   flows in axisymmetric porous media having closed bottom and side
   boundaries. The flow consists first and foremost of a descending, point
   source plume. When plume fluid reaches the (horizontal) bottom boundary,
   it begins to flow radially outward in the form of an axisymmetric
   gravity current. The leading edge of the gravity current advances with
   time as until it reaches the vertical sidewalls. At this point, the flow
   is characterized by a vertically ascending ``first front{''} that
   steadily advects towards the plume source. We assume the plume to be in
   a Darcy regime, i.e. , with , where Re and Pe are, respectively, the
   Reynolds and P,clet numbers, and derive a similarity solution for the
   plume by applying a boundary layer approximation. Formulas are therefore
   obtained for the vertical variation of the plume volume flux and
   area-averaged concentration. The former result shows important
   qualitative differences with the analogue equation derived in the limit
   . In particular, the plume volume flux is now predicted to explicitly
   depend on the reservoir permeability, plume buoyancy flux and fluid
   viscosity. The gravity current problem is likewise solved using a
   self-similar solution, this time adapted from the work of Lyle et al. (J
   Fluid Mech 543:293-302, 2005) but connected to the outflow conditions of
   the plume. Finally, in solving for the motion of the first front, we
   apply a volume flux balance equation and therefore estimate the time
   scale required for the first front to advect from the bottom of the
   control volume to the source elevation. By synthesizing the above
   results, we can estimate the total volume of source fluid and mass of
   solute that can be injected into an axisymmetric reservoir without
   overflow. Predictions can also be made for the time-variable mean
   concentration of this contaminated fluid layer, which must obviously be
   less than the source concentration.}},

Title = {{The impacts of changing flight demands and throughput performance on
   airport delays through the Great Recession}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{19-34}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Several significant events between 2007 and 2009 impacted flight demands
   and the abilities of the three major New York area airports to handle
   demand. This paper assesses the results of applying a probabilistic
   simulation method - which isolates the individual contributions of
   changes in flight demand and changes in airport throughput performance
   to changes in flight delays - to diagnose how these different events may
   have caused operational changes at these airports, and in turn, how the
   results may be used to inform policies for appropriate countermeasures.
   The analysis revealed two key observations. Firstly, certain patterns in
   throughput performance shifts caused the most significant delays, and
   were more likely to have been caused by controller staffing issues
   rather than caps. Secondly, relatively constant average delays from one
   year to the next may result from significant demand drops accompanied by
   large throughput performance degradations at an airport. This suggests
   that not only operational limitations on capacity encourage airlines to
   reduce schedules, but that changed demands can also impact throughput
   performance. Overall, the analysis indicates that caps may not have
   provided their fully intended delay benefits. Although they successfully
   reduced overall flight demands at LGA and JFK, they also directly
   limited throughput performance at critical times, in turn limiting delay
   benefits. In addition, demands at the busiest times of the day appear to
   be relatively inelastic to these operational limitations, insofar as
   demand profiles at EWR and JFK remained ``peaky{''} in 2008 and 2009.
   Also, the recession was largely responsible for reducing demands at the
   airports in 2009, but the delay benefits of this were dampened by a
   corresponding throughput performance degradation. Based on the above
   observations, a more direct demand management policy combined with
   policies that focus on maintaining high staffing capabilities at
   critical times of the day may be considered, to reduce the likelihood of
   major queue formation on days that do experience sustained demands. The
   results also suggest that a more flexible caps system, particularly
   during times of heavy queues, could be explored. Although airport
   practitioners have keen understandings of how their airports operate,
   without the support of quantitative analysis tools, it can be more
   difficult to argue the need for appropriate countermeasures. An analysis
   such as the one presented here can provide the detailed quantitative
   substantiation required to build cases for these targeted policy
   directives and infrastructure investments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Using GIS to interpret automated speed enforcement guidelines and guide

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Automated speed enforcement (ASE) guidelines are designed to guide
   enforcement agencies in operating ASE programs that are effective in
   improving traffic safety. Given that appropriate deployment decisions
   are essential to a program's effectiveness, a number of deployment
   priorities are generally included in most ASE guidelines. However, when
   implementing,the guidelines, most descriptions of deployment goals are
   so qualitative that they might have multiple quantitative
   interpretations, and thus affecting the identification of specific
   deployment considerations. In addition, limited research has been done
   to improve the process by which guidelines are implemented. Therefore,
   this paper proposes quantitative measures for an ASE program, in order
   to facilitate interpretation of the main ASE principles and improve
   deployment decisions. To illustrate the various types of high priority
   deployment considerations, a case study in the city of Edmonton in the
   province of Alberta, Canada is presented. It explores the deployment
   outcomes of the mobile photo enforcement (MPE) program in Edmonton, in
   relation to six priorities identified in the provincial enforcement
   guidelines. Two performance measures, spatial coverage and enforcement
   intensity, are assessed for priority sites and non-priority sites.
   Moreover, the distance halo effects of MPE are considered in the review
   of spatial coverage. All findings are visualized using Geographic
   Information Systems, such that high priority sites and coverage of these
   sites in the historical deployment can be visually assessed. A better
   understanding of the governing ASE guidelines and how to implement them
   can help enforcement agencies to improve decision-making and resource
   allocation, thereby increasing program effectiveness and efficiency. (C)

Abstract = {{The selection of the most suitable solvent for an efficient heavy-oil
   recovery process is a critical task. Low carbon number solvents yield
   faster diffusion, but the mixing quality may not be high. Also, high
   carbon number solvents yield a better quality mixing (much less
   asphaltene precipitation), but the mixing process is rather slow. Hence,
   the understanding of solvent selection criteria for solvent-aided
   recovery processes has established two main aspects of oil solvent
   (liquid liquid) interaction: (1) oil-solvent mixture quality and (2)
   rate of mixture formation. Oil-solvent mixture quality is determined by
   two parameters: (1) viscosity and (2) asphaltene precipitation. The rate
   of mixing is quantified by the diffusion rate. Both mixture quality and
   mixing rate need to be quantitatively and qualitatively determined to
   select the suitable solvent for heavy-oil recovery. In addition to this,
   experiments that measure the solvent diffusion rate (and oil recovery)
   into a rock sample saturated with heavy oil at static conditions are
   needed to support the observations obtained from the liquid-liquid
   interaction of solvent and oil. This paper focuses on these tests and
   uses three oil samples with a wide range of viscosities (250-476 000 cP)
   and three liquid solvents with different carbon numbers varying between
   C-7 and C-13. Core experiments at different temperatures were performed
   on Berea sandstone samples using the same solvent-heavy oil pairs to
   obtain the optimum carbon size (solvent type)-heavy oil combination that
   yields the highest recovery factor and the least asphaltene
   precipitation. On the basis of the fluid-fluid (solvent-heavy oil)
   interaction experiments and heavy-oil-saturated rock-solvent interaction
   tests, the optimal solvent type was determined considering the fastest
   diffusion and best mixing quality for different oil-solvent
   combinations.}},

Title = {{Optimal Design of Low-Temperature Air Injection with Propane for

Abstract = {{Low-temperature air/solvent injection (LTASI) can be a possibility if
   injected air/solvent into a fractured reservoir diffuses into the matrix
   effectively to oxidize oil in it while reducing its-viscosity by
   temperature and solvent dissolution. However, early breakthrough of air
   with partial consumption of oxygen as a result of the highly conductive
   nature of the reservoirs is a concern. Once it is controlled by a proper
   injection scheme and consumption of air injected through efficient
   diffusion into the matrix, low-temperature air injection (LTAI) can be
   an alternative technique for heavy-oil recovery from deep naturally
   fractured reservoirs (NFRs). Limited number of studies on light oils
   showed that this process was highly dependent upon the oxygen diffusion
   coefficient and matrix permeability. In this process, oil production is
   governed by drainage and stripping of light oil components, which have a
   greater effect on recovery than the swelling of oil. In the present
   study, static laboratory tests were performed that complement previously
   published experimental data, by immersing heavy-oil-saturated porous
   media into air-filled reactors to determine critical parameters on
   recovery, such as the diffusion coefficient. A data acquisition system
   was established for continuous monitoring of the pressure at different
   temperatures. Also analyzed was the possibility of hydrocarbon gas
   additive to air, minimizing the oil viscosity increase created by
   oxidation reactions. On the basis of core-scale experimental results, a
   numerical simulation model of air diffusion into a single matrix was
   created to obtain the diffusion coefficient through matching of
   laboratory results. Then, sensitivity runs were performed for different
   matrix sizes and composition of injected gas (air and hydrocarbon).
   Additionally, a scaling-up study was performed to obtain an approximate
   production time for different matrix block sizes and temperatures. It is
   imperative that enough timing is required for the diffusion process
   before injected air filling to fracture network breakthrough. This
   implies that huff-and-puff-type injection is an option as opposed to
   continuous injection of air. The optimal design and duration of the
   cycles were also tested experimentally and numerically for a single
   matrix case.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a series of dynamic experiments in which liquid solvent
   (heptane) was injected into heavy-oil saturated artificially fractured
   Berea sandstone samples with and without prethermal injection. To
   account for the effect of wettability on the process, experiments were
   repeated on the samples exposed to a wettability alteration (more
   oil-wet) process. Cores were saturated with heavy crude oil and placed
   inside a rubber sleeve. Next, the system was placed into an oven and
   maintained under constant temperature conditions. Then, either hot
   solvent (superheated to be in the vapor phase) or cold solvent was
   introduced into the system through the fracture at a constant rate.
   Pressure and temperature was continuously monitored at the inlet and
   center of the core. Properties of the oil and liquid condensate from the
   gas produced were measured and analyzed. This scheme was repeated for a
   wide range of temperature conditions. The retrieval of the solvent
   during the solvent injection phase and post-thermal method (steam or
   hot-water) injection performed for a wide range of temperature was
   monitored. Our results and observations indicate that the first
   requirement for a successful application is an effective solvent
   diffusion into matrix before it breaks through and improves the gravity
   drainage of oil by dilution. The second requirement is solvent
   retrieval. We also observed that a critical temperature and injection
   rate exists that yields a maximized oil recovery and solvent retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{String test cases are required by many real-world applications to
   identify defects and security risks. Random Testing (RT) is a low cost
   and easy to implement testing approach to generate strings. However, its
   effectiveness is not satisfactory. In this research, black-box string
   test case generation methods are investigated. Two objective functions
   are introduced to produce effective test cases. The diversity of the
   test cases is the first objective, where it can be measured through
   string distance functions. The second objective is guiding the string
   length distribution into a Benford distribution based on the hypothesis
   that the population of strings is right-skewed within its range. When
   both objectives are applied via a multi-objective optimization
   algorithm, superior string test sets are produced. An empirical study is
   performed with several real-world programs indicating that the generated
   string test cases outperform test cases generated by other methods.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the power-allocation problem in a two-tier femtocell
   network including a macrocell and multiple femtocells. Due to shadowing
   and fading effects, at each cell (macrocell or femtocell), the power
   levels of desired signal and interference signals vary with time. Under
   this circumstance, one method to achieve transmission quality in the
   cells is to first get channel state information (CSI) of all desired
   links and interference links and then perform power allocation. This
   method has very large communication and computation overhead. In this
   paper, we focus on power allocation in which the transmit power levels
   of the users in the cells do not need to change when the wireless
   channels fluctuate. We formulate a power-allocation problem subject to
   bounded outage probability in any cell (macrocell or femtocell). The
   formulated problem has probabilistic constraints. It is hard to have
   closed-form expressions of the probabilistic constraints. To solve this,
   we propose novel transformations of the constraints, based on which we
   obtain constraints in the format of worst-case value-at-risk. Such
   constraints can be converted to convex constraints, and thus, the
   research problem is transformed to a convex problem. For the convex
   problem, we provide an iterative algorithm that converges quickly. We
   also investigate the case when the channel gain distributions are
   unknown. Our proposed schemes have the merits of very small
   communication and computation overhead and are particularly useful in
   fast-fading environments.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated two complementary nanostructures, nanocavity and

Title = {{The Effect of Molecular Structure and Environment on the Miscibility and
   Diffusivity in Polythiophene-Methanofullerene Bulk Heterojunctions:
   Theory and Modeling with the RISM Approach}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Although better means to model the properties of bulk heterojunction
   molecular blends are much needed in the field of organic
   optoelectronics, only a small subset of methods based on molecular
   dynamics-and Monte Carlo-based approaches have been hitherto employed to
   guide or replace empirical characterization and testing. Here, we
   present the first use of the integral equation theory of molecular
   liquids in modelling the structural properties of blends of
   phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) and a carboxylated poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT), respectively.
   For this, we use the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM) with the
   Universal Force Field (UFF) to compute the microscopic structure of
   blends and obtain insight into the miscibility of its components. Input
   parameters for RISM, such as optimized molecular geometries and charge
   distribution of interaction sites, are derived by the Density Functional
   Theory (DFT) methods. We also run Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to
   compare the diffusivity of the PCBM in binary blends with P3HT and P3BT,
   respectively. A remarkably good agreement with available experimental
   data and results of alternative modelling/simulation is observed for
   PCBM in the P3HT system. We interpret this as a step in the validation
   of the use of our approach for organic photovoltaics and support of its
   results for new systems that do not have reference data for comparison
   or calibration. In particular, for the less-studied P3BT, our results
   show that expectations about its performance in binary blends with PCBM
   may be overestimated, as it does not demonstrate the required level of
   miscibility and short-range structural organization. In addition, the
   simulated mobility of PCBM in P3BT is somewhat higher than what is
   expected for polymer blends and falls into a range typical for fluids.
   The significance of our predictive multi-scale modelling lies in the
   insights it offers into nanoscale morphology and charge transport
   behaviour in multi-component organic semiconductor blends.}},

Abstract = {{The extraction process used to obtain bitumen from the oil sands
   produces large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). As a
   newly emerging desalination technology, forward osmosis (FO) has shown
   great promise in saving electrical power requirements, increasing water
   recovery, and minimizing brine discharge. With the support of this
   funding, a FO system was constructed using a cellulose triacetate FO
   membrane to test the feasibility of OSPW desalination and contaminant
   removal. The FO systems were optimized using different types and
   concentrations of draw solution. The FO system using 4M NH4HCO3 as a
   draw solution achieved 85\% water recovery from OSPW, and 80 to 100\%
   contaminant rejection for most metals and ions. A water backwash
   cleaning method was applied to clean the fouled membrane, and the
   cleaned membrane achieved 77\% water recovery, a performance comparable
   to that of new FO membranes. This suggests that the membrane fouling was
   reversible. The FO system developed in this project provides a novel and
   energy efficient strategy to remediate the tailings waters generated by
   oil sands bitumen extraction and processing.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION \& BIODEGRADATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},

Abstract = {{Observations of microbial community changes in full-scale engineered
   ecosystems such as wastewater treatment plants are rarely available, and
   it has long been believed that in such large systems it takes time for
   the microbial community to adapt to new conditions. However, it turns
   out that the microbial community in such a large system is impressively
   resilient. In a full-scale activated sludge bioreactor, the flow rate
   was increased to 135\% of the normal average flow and kept constant
   during a storm event. Based on 454 pyrosequencing results, the microbial
   community structure was observed to shift significantly within 24 h
   after the flow rate was increased, but recovered to its initial state
   within five days. In addition, no significant impact on the bioreactor
   effluent quality was observed during the five-days at the higher flow
   rate. With the influent loading, the solid retention time, and sludge
   settleability carefully controlled to mimic the experimental conditions,
   a BioWin simulation produced a biomass concentration and effluent
   quality consistent with experimental results. This indicates that the
   stability of the microbial community in an activated sludge bioreactor
   subjects to a flow rate increase can be predicted to some extent. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel frequency aware robust economic dispatch
   (FARED) approach to exploit the synergistic capability of accommodating
   uncertain loads and renewable generation by accounting for both the
   frequency regulation effect and optimal participation mechanism of
   secondary regulation reserves for conventional units in response to
   uncertainties in the robust optimization counterpart of security
   constrained economic dispatch. The FARED is formulated as a robust
   optimization problem. In this formulation the allowable frequency
   deviation and the possible load or renewable generation curtailments are
   expressed in terms of variable uncertainty sets. The variables in the
   formulation are described as interval variables and treated in affine
   form. In order to improve the computational tractability, the dominant
   constraints which can be the candidates of tight transmission
   constraints are determined by complementarity constraints. Then the
   robust optimization problem is simplified to a bilinear programming
   problem based on duality theory. Finally, the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed method are illustrated based on several study
   cases.}},

Abstract = {{The suppression of parallel-plate modes is difficult to control over
   electrically short lengths. The use of electromagnetic bandgap (EBG)
   technology allows for a large suppression with controllable bandwidth,
   but traditional EBGs are often too electrically large to be used in
   practice. Moreover, in some forms they require several metallization
   layers and/or interconnecting vias. We introduce a metamaterial-based
   EBG that is miniaturized, uniplanar, and fully printable for the
   suppression of signals carried by the parallel-plate mode. We also
   present a corresponding multiconductor transmission-line analysis for
   accurate modeling of the EBG's dispersive properties, which arise from
   the coupling of contradirected forward and backward modes. The theory is
   supported by full-wave finite-element-method simulations and verified by
   measurements of a fabricated EBG. To demonstrate the practical value of
   the metamaterial-based EBG, we propose an alternate implementation that
   extends the one-dimensional structure to a two-dimensional radial EBG
   suitable for the suppression of high-frequency parallel-plate noise
   coupled between adjacent via interconnects. The simulation and
   measurement results for this device were found to be in agreement with
   each other and with the predicted bandgap.}},

Title = {{Bridging the Gap Between Science and Clinical Efficacy: Physiology,

Abstract = {{Development of a new drug for the treatment of lung disease is a complex
   and time consuming process involving numerous disciplines of basic and
   applied sciences. During the 2015 Congress of the International Society
   for Aerosols in Medicine, a group of experts including aerosol
   scientists, physiologists, modelers, imagers, and clinicians
   participated in a workshop aiming at bridging the gap between basic
   research and clinical efficacy of inhaled drugs. This publication
   summarizes the current consensus on the topic. It begins with a short
   description of basic concepts of aerosol transport and a discussion on
   targeting strategies of inhaled aerosols to the lungs. It is followed by
   a description of both computational and biological lung models, and the
   use of imaging techniques to determine aerosol deposition distribution
   (ADD) in the lung. Finally, the importance of ADD to clinical efficacy
   is discussed. Several gaps were identified between basic science and
   clinical efficacy. One gap between scientific research aimed at
   predicting, controlling, and measuring ADD and the clinical use of
   inhaled aerosols is the considerable challenge of obtaining, in a single
   study, accurate information describing the optimal lung regions to be
   targeted, the effectiveness of targeting determined from ADD, and some
   measure of the drug's effectiveness. Other identified gaps were the
   language and methodology barriers that exist among disciplines, along
   with the significant regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome for
   novel drugs and/or therapies to reach the marketplace and benefit the
   patient. Despite these gaps, much progress has been made in recent years
   to improve clinical efficacy of inhaled drugs. Also, the recent efforts
   by many funding agencies and industry to support multidisciplinary
   networks including basic science researchers, R\&D scientists, and
   clinicians will go a long way to further reduce the gap between science
   and clinical efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembling peptide based hydrogels have a wide range of
   applications in the field of tissue repair and tissue regeneration.
   Because of its physicochemical properties, (RADA)(4) has been studied as
   a potential platform for 3D cell culture, drug delivery, and tissue
   engineering. Despite some small molecule and protein release studies
   with this system, there is a lack of work investigating the controlled
   release of hydrophobic compounds (i.e., anti-inflammatory, anticancer,
   antibacterial drugs, etc.) that are important for many clinical
   therapies. Attempts to incorporate hydrophobic compounds into
   self-assembling matrices usually inhibited nanofiber formation, rather
   resulting in a peptide drug complex or microcrystal formation. Herein, a
   self assembling chitosan/carboxymethyl-beta-cyclodextrin nanoparticle
   system was used to load dexamethasone, which formed within a
   self-assembling (RADA)(4) nanoscaffold matrix. Nanoparticles dispersed
   within the matrix were stabilized by the nanofibers within. The in vitro
   release of dexamethasone from the hybrid system was observed to be pH
   sensitive. At pH 7, release was observed for more than 8 days, with
   three distinct kinetic domains in the first 6 days. Data suggest that
   the deprotonation of chitosan at a solution pH > 6.8 leads to
   nanoparticle dissociation and ultimately the release of dexamethasone
   from the hybrid system. This system has the potential to form a
   multifunctional scaffold that can self-assemble with the ability to
   control the release of hydrophobic drugs for a wide variety of
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Linear induction machines are widely used in transportation systems due
   to their many advantages. Design and prototyping of electric machines
   are an expensive and time-consuming process; hardware-in-the-loop
   simulation provides an efficient alternative. In this paper, a
   field-programmable gate array-based real-time digital emulation of
   single-sided linear induction motor with the drive system is proposed.
   Implementation of the model is performed in both fixed-point using
   Xilinx system generator and floating-point number representations using
   a handwritten VHSIC Hardware Description Language code. Then, an
   evaluation in terms of real-time step-size and accuracy as well as
   hardware resource utilization is provided. The whole design was fully
   paralleled, which resulted in a considerable reduction of model
   execution time. The minimum time step of 2.3 and 0.8 mu s was achieved
   for floating-point and fixed-point implementations, respectively. The
   results of the real-time simulation are verified by the experimental
   results as well as a 2-D finite-element simulation in JMAG software.}},

Abstract = {{Local (e.g., habitat compensation activities) and regional (e.g.,
   climate-related range expansion) events that are expected to increase in
   northern Canada can facilitate movement of fishes into aquatic
   ecosystems from which they were previously absent. Successful
   colonization would change fish community structure and potentially alter
   food web dynamics. We compared the trophic ecology, growth, and body
   condition of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in small, tundra lakes
   that varied in fish community structure to help understand effects of
   colonization on this key species. Complementary stable isotope and
   stomach content analyses indicated that Lake Trout foraging differs
   between lakes with and without multiple large-bodied fishes. In lakes
   with a single potential competitor, trout consumed primarily pelagic
   zooplankton, but focused on more littoral resources in the presence of
   multiple large-bodied fishes. Population trophic niche width and
   inter-individual variation in Lake Trout diet were larger in lakes with
   multiple competitors, whereas Lake Trout populations in lakes with only
   one other large-bodied species were in better body condition. Our
   findings highlight the potential sensitivity of northern Lake Trout
   populations to colonizing fish species. (C) 2015 International

Abstract = {{This study explains how to make rigid polyurethane/mature fine tailings
   (PU/MFT) foam composites with good mechanical and thermal properties by
   in situ polymerization. Compared to PU/Cloisite Na+ and PU/Cloisite 30B
   composites, the novel PU/MFT composites have similar tensile properties,
   but better thermal properties. Adding 2 parts per hundred parts (pphp of
   polyol by weight) of MFT particles decreases the thermal conductivity of
   polyurethane foam by 10\%, while adding Cloisite Na+ or Cloisite 30B
   decreases it by only 6\% and 5\%, respectively, resulting in
   considerable energy savings in large-scale insulation applications.
   PU/MFT foams also sustain about the same compressive strength and
   modulus even when loaded up to 20 pphp MFT. These results are important
   for oil sands industries trying to decrease the environmental footprint
   of their operations and for polyurethane-producing companies attempting
   to improve properties of their products and contribute to environmental
   cleanup.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospinning of sulfur-free softwood lignin (SFSL) in
   N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is reported as is and with poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PEO). SFSL macromolecules behave as rigid spheres, instead of
   free draining macromolecules in DMF. Hence they are investigated as
   colloids. Colloidal SFSL generates uniform fibers only at the volume
   fraction of 0.63. It is due to the sufficiently high longest mean
   relaxation time at the volume fraction of 0.63. Colloidal SFSL below the
   volume fraction of 0.63 does not exhibit any measurable viscoelasticity
   and also does not generate any uniform fibers. Bead-free fibers are
   generated at volume fractions below 0.63 only by adding PEO. PEO
   presence brings elasticity to colloidal SFSL and produces bead-free
   fibers only above the entanglement concentration of PEO in DMF. The
   presence of SFSL macromolecules does not cause any interactions with PEO
   molecules, except it reduces the available of free volume for PEO chains
   in DMF.}},

Abstract = {{A preventive maintenance scheduling model is proposed in this article.
   The proposed model includes finite planning horizon and limited
   available resources to perform maintenance scheduling. A subset of
   maintenance actions, that is, selective maintenance is needed during
   maintenance breaks due to limited resources such as time, cost, and
   repairman availability. Maintenance can not only improve the effective
   age of a component but also may alter the hazard rate. Therefore, a
   hybrid imperfect maintenance model is used in this article that
   considers the combined effect of age reduction and hazard adjustment on
   a component. For a multi-component system, selective maintenance is
   performed at periodic intervals. In addition to maintenance and failure
   costs, we have included the maintenance break duration and the shutdown
   cost in the proposed scheduling model. A periodic maintenance scheduling
   problem is solved in this article for a series-parallel system. The
   optimal number of periodic maintenance breaks in a finite planning
   horizon is determined. Also, maintenance actions required during each of
   the maintenance breaks are determined. The number of periodic
   maintenance breaks and maintenance actions during these breaks is
   selected in a way that the total maintenance, failure, and shutdown cost
   are minimum. An evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the problem.}},

   geometry. Furthermore, we reported the first observation of localized

Abstract = {{This article presents an analytical numerical method for the multiple

   The main focus is on the detailed evaluation of the effectiveness and

   behaviour of such composite media with significant numbers of
   inhomogeneities. The method is based on the eigenfunction expansion
   (Fourier expansion) of single inhomogeneity problem and the use of a
   pseudo-incident wave technique, which allows the accurate determination
   of local stress field caused by the interaction. The accuracy and
   effectiveness of the method for dealing with multiple interaction
   problems are discussed in detail. Illustrative examples under different
   loading and geometric conditions are considered to study the local
   dynamic field, the effective properties of the composite media based on
   self-consistent material modelling, and the behaviour of stop-band of
   wave propagating for periodic inhomogeneity arrangements. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel scheme to mitigate harmonic distortions in

   configuration and installation concept, namely, the filter is a 240 V
   device that can be easily plugged into the sockets of utility revenue
   meters. Analytical, simulation, and economic studies have been conducted
   to understand the filter design parameters, performance characteristics,
   and cost implications. As an example application, the scheme is
   evaluated for mitigating an actual harmonic-caused telephone

   promising option to reduce the harmonic distortions in selected areas of

Title = {{Use of Air Circulation Pipes in Deep Dropshafts for Reducing Air
   Induction into Sanitary Sewers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Falling water in dropshafts can induce large amounts of air into the
   airspace of sewers, and the subsequent release of the pressurized air
   can cause sewer odor concerns. The construction of a vertical airshaft
   that is connected to a dropshaft via pipes is expected to circulate the
   air and reduce air induction into sewers. In this study, two deep
   dropshafts with drop heights of 24 and 11m were retrofitted sequentially
   with air circulation pipes in a sanitary sewer system. Air pressure
   inside the sewer line and air flow rates inside the air circulation
   pipes were monitored in 2006-2011. The results show that the retrofits
   reduced the manhole air pressure by about 10-47\%. Air pressures in the
   manholes and the dropshafts, as well as air flow rates in the air
   circulation pipes, were noticed to have diurnal patterns, which appeared
   to relate to wastewater discharge and air pipe elevation. Overall, the
   ratios of air flow rate to water flow rate were found to be 160 +/- 78
   and 144 +/- 113 for the two dropshafts, which are several times larger
   than those reported for laboratory dropshafts without air circulation
   pipes. Sewer air was indeed circulated via air pipes in the first
   dropshaft, while no circulation was observed most of time in the second
   dropshaft because the air was directly pushed downstream by the upstream
   dropshaft.}},

Title = {{Time-strain rate superposition for relaxation behavior of polyethylene
   pressure pipes}},
Journal = {{POLYMER TESTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{292-296}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A new superposition principle based on time and strain rate is suggested
   as an alternative approach to construct a master curve of relaxation
   modulus versus time for polyethylene (PE) pressure pipe. The new
   approach uses results from a series of relaxation tests that reach the
   same relaxation strain at different strain rates (by varying the
   crosshead speed). Construction of the master curve for the relaxation
   modulus is first through horizontal shift using an expression similar to
   that for the time-temperature superposition principle. Then, a vertical
   shift is applied to generate a smooth curve profile. Such a time strain
   rate superposition principle can serve as an alternative approach to
   construct a master curve for the long-term behavior of PE. The master
   curve shows two transitions for the rate of decrease of the relaxation
   modulus, instead of one transition reported before. The additional
   transition occurs within a short period after the relaxation strain is
   reached, and is detectable only if the initial strain rate is
   sufficiently low. Discovery of the new transition offers an additional
   perspective for studying mechanisms involved in the PE deformation. (C)

Abstract = {{Activated carbons produced with agricultural residues have attracted
   substantial attention in recent years. However, much work remains to be
   done. The current study determined the adsorption isotherms for toluene
   and acetone vapors for pinewood chip-derived activated carbon. The
   effects on the physical properties, such as the porous structures of the
   adsorbents, were also investigated using scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). The results indicate that the activated carbon is a mainly
   microporous structure with a micropore volume of 0.701 cc/g (75.1 \% of
   the total pore volume). The adsorption capacities of toluene and acetone
   can be as high as 0.71 and 0.57 g/g at room temperature, respectively.
   The adsorption isotherms for toluene and acetone vapors were obtained
   from 25 to 45 A degrees C, with relative pressures between 0.01 and 0.9.
   As the temperature increased, the adsorption capacity decreased. This
   behavior indicates that the adsorption process is physical adsorption.
   The fitted isotherms using the Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption models
   exhibited low mean total relative errors. The fitted isotherms obtained
   using the Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption models had mean total relative
   errors of 3.3 and 4.1 \% for the adsorption of toluene and acetone,
   respectively, at temperatures ranging from 25 to 45 A degrees C. The
   results of this study may be highly significant because they provide a
   more accurate prediction of the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents,
   thus improving the design of adsorption systems.}},

Abstract = {{An instrumented section of a 10-m-diameter circular shaft located at a
   depth of 1.2 km in an average quality rock mass was back analyzed to
   establish the rock mass behavior. Extensometers were installed radially
   at four locations and provided the primary data for the back analyses.
   Three- and two-dimensional continuum models were analyzed using the
   numerical codes FLAC3Dand Phase2 to assess the rock mass behavior. An
   initial set of mechanical parameters obtained from empirical
   relationships were found to give a reasonable match to the measured
   response of extensometers 2 and 4, when using a Mohr-Coulomb strain
   softening model. A different set of parameters were needed for FLAC3D
   when trying to match the significantly higher displacements recorded by
   only one of the extensometer. It was noted that regardless of the
   material model and corresponding parameters, the three-dimensional
   models were not able to give reasonable match to the results of all
   extensometers. It was shown that for the given problem, there is a
   theoretical limit for ratio of displacements predicted for different
   extensometers using a continuum isotropic material model. The
   two-dimensional models in Phase2, however, gave an apparently better
   overall match to all the extensometers. Comparison of the results of
   three-dimensional models with the assumed longitudinal displacement
   profile for the two-dimensional model indicated that the
   three-dimensional effects were not adequately captured in the
   two-dimensional model.}},

Abstract = {{Physiological motion makes performing a surgical or therapeutic
   procedure more difficult for the physician. In heart surgery, the heart
   is stopped as it is too difficult for the surgeon to follow the heart's
   beating motion and perform a surgical task. In radiation therapy,
   respiration causes the cancerous tissue to move, rendering the therapy
   less effective and possibly damaging to healthy tissue. This paper
   focuses on controlling a robot, which is used to perform the surgery or
   therapy, to compensate for the physiological motion along the surgical
   tool's axis such that the point of interest (POI) on the organ becomes
   stationary relative to the robot. The difficulty in creating such a
   system lies in the measurement of the POI's and robot's positions via
   different sensors that are unregistered, have different measurement
   rates, and have data acquisition and processing delays. This paper
   presents the Kalman-filter-based estimation of the organ motion despite
   the large data acquisition/processing delays and low update rates
   inherent in some measurements used for robot control in robot-assisted
   surgeries and therapies. This paper also proposes control systems that
   compensate for the organ motion despite the delayed, multirate, and
   unregistered sensor data allowing the physician to perform a therapeutic
   or surgical procedure with a teleoperated robot on a seemingly
   stationary POI.}},

Abstract = {{Run-of-the-river hydropower is a typical form of power generation in
   mountainous regions. This study investigates the velocity field upstream
   of Aberfeldie dam, a run-of-the river facility on the Bull River near
   Wardner, British Columbia, Canada. As is typical for these types of
   run-of-the river facilities, the headpond of this dam is very shallow
   (approximately 1m deep) because of long term sediment deposition. Near
   the facility's power intakes, a large scour hole has been created
   because of increased velocities induced by the intakes. This study
   conducted field measurements and developed a computational fluid dynamic
   (CFD) model to investigate the velocity field under various flow
   conditions. The CFD solver shows in a simplistic way that flow-induced
   bed shear stress likely causes a fluctuating, dynamic bed form that
   varies by season and the distance upstream, so that a consistent
   velocity pattern is seen across the entire headpond. The velocity field
   generated by the CFD solver is used to evaluate the entrainment risk of
   mountain whitefish and westslope cutthroat trout based on swimming
   mechanics and life stage. The unique habitat conditions generated by the
   scour hole act as an attractant to the high risk zone, greatly
   increasing fish density adjacent to the intakes at this facility.}},

Title = {{Bridged cracks of mode III with surface elasticity}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{125-135}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We examine the contribution of surface elasticity to a fully or
   partially bridged finite mode III crack. The surface effect is
   incorporated using the continuum-based surface/interface model of Gurtin
   and Murdoch. We assume that the bridging force is proportional to the
   crack opening displacement while the bridging stiffness is allowed to
   vary arbitrarily along the crack. By considering a distribution of screw
   dislocations on the crack, the problem is reduced to a first-order
   Cauchy singular integro-differential equation. After the expansion of
   both the unknown dislocation density and the known variable bridging
   stiffness into Chebyshev polynomials, the integro-differential equation
   is solved numerically using a collocation technique. A complete solution
   valid throughout the solid (including at the crack tips) is obtained. We
   identify two intrinsic material lengths: one associated with the surface
   elasticity and the other with the crack bridging. We find that the
   surface elasticity plays a predominant role when the crack is
   significantly shorter than the two intrinsic lengths. At the other
   extreme, the crack bridging plays a predominant role when the crack is
   considerably longer than the two intrinsic lengths. Numerical results
   are presented to demonstrate the significance of the solution. Finally,
   a consequence of our analysis is that the solution of the problem
   involving the Dugdale model of a mode III crack with surface elasticity
   is also readily available. Our results in this respect show that the
   determination of the size of the plastic zone is independent of the
   parameter characterizing the surface elasticity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{562-582}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is an emerging technology in which
   membranes are used for organic solvent separation and purifications. Its
   fields of applications range from pharmacy, catalyst regeneration, to
   oil and solvent treatments. A major challenge is to maintain a high
   stability of these (modified) membranes under different feed conditions.
   Tailoring the selective layer of OSN membranes is the main approach to
   develop functionalized membranes which show stable high selectivities
   and permeabilities. During the past decade, methods such as grafting,
   light-induced modification, plasma treatment, and polyelectrolyte
   modification have been intensively studied. This paper reviews the
   recent progress in this field of surface modification of different types
   of polymeric and also of ceramic OSN membranes. First, the most crucial
   surface layer properties that affect the OSN membranes properties are
   described in detail. Next, different surface modification methods and
   their effects on membrane selectivity and permeability are reviewed and
   compared. Finally, a perspective is given on expected future trends in
   this, highly challenging and important field of current research. (C)

Title = {{Supply-and-demand models for exploring relationships between smaller
   airports and neighboring hub airports in the US}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{67-79}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Airport passenger leakage is the phenomenon of air passengers choosing
   to travel longer distances to access more extensive air services offered
   by airlines at an out-of-region hub (or, substitute) airport, instead of
   using their local airports. Airport leakage can cause further reduction
   in services offered by airlines at a local airport, thereby causing even
   further leakage, and so on, which can significantly impact an airport's
   role in the growth of the local economy. This paper explores the
   geographic and operational attributes of local-and-substitute airport
   pairs in the United States, explicitly accounting for the interactive
   feedback relationship between passenger volumes and air service
   characteristics that contribute to the onset, persistence, and
   exacerbation of airport passenger leakage. A two-stage least squares
   regression model of air passenger demand at small- and medium-sized
   airports is first presented, where local passengers may travel by
   vehicle to larger, out-of-region hub airports. The results confirm that
   airfare and passenger volume relationships exist between the local and
   substitute airport pairs included in the dataset, and that lower
   airfares at the substitute airport have a greater impact on airport
   choices made by larger travel groups. They also suggest the existence of
   positive feedback in that if an airport attracts increasingly smaller
   passenger numbers with fewer air services and fewer air services with
   fewer passengers, without external intervention airport leakage impacts
   may be irreversible and exacerbate over time. A conceptual market share
   equilibrium analysis is used to illustrate the mechanisms of a direct
   two-way feedback relationship between passenger volumes at a local
   airport and air service characteristics at both the local and substitute
   airports. With data, this quantitative framework can help guide airport
   planners in further assessing and verifying suspected passenger leakage
   issues at their airport. The results suggest that without intervention,
   airport leakage impacts may be difficult to reverse; further
   exacerbating the trend are technological advancements that make driving
   cheaper and easier (connected and autonomous vehicles). However, the
   results can also guide planners in choosing the types and degrees of
   infrastructure investments and airline incentives that may be used to
   expand or retain air services to attract passengers. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The phenomenon associated with the ion-exchange of silver ions into the
   microporous vanadosilicate EVS-10 is explored. EVS-10 is a
   vanadium-substituted form of the titanosilicate ETS-10 and is composed
   of corner-sharing orthogonal chains of vanadia octahedra which connect
   through silicate bridges to form pores and channels of molecular
   dimensions. The anionic charge associated with the vanadia octahedra is
   offset by mobile and exchangeable cationic counter-ions. It was found
   that silver replaces sodium quantitatively in EVS-10 and that,
   unexpectedly, the silver ions are spontaneously reduced to silver metal
   particles which appear as nano-scale metal clusters in the TEM images.
   The reduction of the silver ions is accompanied by an oxidation of the
   framework vanadium and this redox pair is established through XPS and
   Raman spectroscopy. The mechanism for this unique behaviour is believed
   to be explained by a galvanic reaction between the incoming Ag+ and the
   framework V4+. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{For the development of reliable numerical models of entrained flow
   gasifiers it is crucial to understand and to model correctly the
   interactions between the hot gas-flow and the coal particles undergoing
   pyrolysis and char conversion. In this work a laboratory-scale entrained
   flow coal gasifier was investigated numerically. Based on the detailed
   analysis of the particle trajectories, the interaction between the flow
   field and coal particles of different sizes was carefully discussed and
   analyzed. For small, medium, and large particles, the primary regions
   for devolatilization, oxidation, and gasification were detected, and the
   conversion behavior for these particle fractions was quantified in terms
   of pyrolysis time, residence time, and overall conversion rate.
   Additional particle-resolved CFD calculations were carried out for
   representative particles of different sizes in order to study the heat
   and mass transfer of the isolated particles in detail. Pyrolyzing coal
   particles and combusting or gasifying char particles were considered at
   several positions in the reactor, where each location is characterized
   by different gas compositions and temperatures. For these particles, the
   flow field, and the species and temperature distributions in the
   boundary layer are discussed. The particle-resolved calculations
   demonstrate the impact of the particle Reynolds number and the influence
   of the mass flow from the particle to the surrounding gas on the overall
   heat and mass transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Global Clustering Approach Using Hybrid Optimization for Incomplete
   Data Based on Interval Reconstruction of Missing Value}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{297-313}},

Abstract = {{Incomplete data clustering is often encountered in practice. Here the
   treatment of missing attribute value and the optimization procedure of
   clustering are the important factors impacting the clustering
   performance. In this study, a missing attribute value becomes an
   information granule and is represented as a certain interval. To avoid
   intervals determined by different cluster information, we propose a
   congeneric nearest-neighbor rule-based architecture of the
   preclassification result, which can improve the effectiveness of
   estimation of missing attribute interval. Furthermore, a global fuzzy
   clustering approach using particle swarm optimization assisted by the
   Fuzzy C-Means is proposed. A novel encoding scheme where particles are
   composed of the cluster prototypes and the missing attribute values is
   considered in the optimization procedure. The proposed approach improves
   the accuracy of clustering results, moreover, the missing attribute

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of metals are intrinsically determined by their
   electron behavior, which is largely reflected by the electron work
   function (EWF or phi). Since the work function varies with temperature,
   the dependence of material properties on temperature could be predicted
   via variations in work function with temperature. Combining a hardness -
   phi relationship and the dependence of work function on temperature, a
   temperature -dependent model for predicting solid -particle erosion is
   proposed. Erosive wear losses of copper, nickel, and carbon steel as
   sample materials were measured at different temperatures. Results of the
   tests are consistent with the theoretical prediction. This study
   demonstrates a promising parameter, electron work function, for looking
   into fundamental aspects of wear phenomena, which would also help
   develop alternative methodologies for material design. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this article, microwave heating of the heavy oil reservoir, oil-sand,
   is critically studied. The study is carried out based on full wave and
   multiphysics simulations that are performed at 2.45 GHz using both CST
   Microwave studio and COMSOL. It is demonstrated that most of the
   microwave power is deposited in bitumen rather in sand due to the
   dielectric properties of bitumen. Thermal analysis showed that most of
   the heat is generated in bitumen and is conducted to sand. Although
   microwave power is selectively deposited into bitumen of the oil-sand,
   the temperature gradient between the bitumen and sand is not able to
   maintain due to high thermal conductivity of the oil-sand medium.
   Microwave heating can play very important role to reduce the tailing
   ponds and protect the environment by minimizing water usage in the

Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{428-452}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate multiple attribute decision making (MADM)
   problems based on Frank triangular norms, in which the attribute values
   assume the form of hesitant fuzzy information. Firstly, some basic
   concepts of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) and the Frank triangle norms are
   introduced. We develop some hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators based
   on Frank operations, such as hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted average
   (HFFWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted averaging
   (HFFOWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid averaging (HFFHA)
   operator, hesitant fuzzy Frank weighted geometric (HFFWG) operator,
   hesitant fuzzy Frank ordered weighted geometric (HFFOWG) operator, and
   hesitant fuzzy Frank hybrid geometric (HFFHG) operator. Some essential
   properties together with their special cases are discussed in detail.
   Next, a procedure of multiple attribute decision making based on the
   HFFHWA (or HFFHWG) operator is presented under hesitant fuzzy
   environment. Finally, a practical example that concerns the human
   resource selection is provided to illustrate the decision steps of the
   proposed method. The result demonstrates the practicality and
   effectiveness of the new method. A comparative analysis is also
   presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium phosphorus oxide (VPO) catalysts supported on CeO2 and
   P-modified CeO2 (P-CeO2) have been firstly synthesized for selective

   on P-CeO2 showed higher catalytic performance, especially higher MA
   selectivity than catalysts on pure ceria, and their specific activities
   (normalized to per unit mass of VPO loading) were also superior to that
   of bulk VPO. TG, TEM, XRD, Raman, H-2-TPR and XPS results revealed that
   the structure and property of VPO are largely affected by the support.
   The loaded VPO existed almost wholly as VOPO4 phases on pure ceria,
   while mainly in the form of (VO)(2)P2O7 with small amount of VOPO4
   phases on phosphorus modified ceria. Both VPO/P-CeO2 and bulk VPO
   catalysts have the similar VPO phase structure, but the former showed
   the enhanced reducibility of V4+ phase. These differences in structure

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Crack formation in cellular solids is often triggered by the presence of
   flaws caused by the manufacturing process that is used to build them. In
   thermal management applications, an imperfection embedded in the core of
   a sandwich panel might have a detrimental thermal impact that is often
   challenging to predict. This paper focuses on a theoretical study of
   non-Fourier heat conduction in a sandwich panel with a cracked foam
   core. With the aim of exploring the thermal response of a panel with
   porous core and skins made of a single material, we examine the role of
   crack position, relative density of the foam core, and other geometric
   parameters of the panel. Based on the assumption that the crack in the
   core is thermally insulated, i.e. no heat flux can pass through, we
   obtain the temperature distribution and heat flux intensity factor in
   the time domain via Fourier and Laplace transforms. The results are
   visualized in maps that show the influence of the size of the skin
   relative to that of the foam core and the crack location as well as the
   antagonist impact that the relative density of the foam core has on the
   maximum temperature and heat flux. The method presented here can be used
   to tailor the thermal response of sandwich panels. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{Recently, heavy bituminous crudes have increasingly being coming into
   focus as feedstock for synthesis gas production. One of the heaviest
   compounds of petroleum is asphaltenes, which are formed during the
   primary upgrading process of bitumen. One feasible option for asphaltene
   utilization is their gasification in an entrained-flow gasifier. In this
   view, modeling can be used as an initial step in the design and
   optimization of large-scale gasifiers. This work presents a new subgrid
   model for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modeling of the
   gasification of Athabasca asphaltene particles (median diameter of 207
   gm) in an entrained-flow reactor. The model is based on a virtual
   homogeneous reaction zone (VHRZ) concept (originally developed by
   {[}1]). However, in the present formulation the model considers melting,
   pyrolysis, homogeneous reactions in the particle vicinity and
   heterogeneous reactions of the char, where the VHRZ thickness is
   calculated using boundary layer approximation. The model has been
   verified using preliminary experimental data obtained for Athabasca
   asphaltene gasified in a lab-scale drop tube furnace (DTF). Experiments
   have been conducted for two different oxygen ratios, where the
   experimental conditions are analyzed using CFD. Good agreement between
   submodel predictions and experiments has been demonstrated. Finally, the
   results of the subgrid model emphasize the relevance of the energy
   feedback from the particle vicinity to the particle surface. A
   sensitivity study of model parameters shows that the ambient temperature
   and the assumed particle density have a mayor impact on the overall
   particle conversion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{310-317}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The effect of desorption purge gas oxygen content on activated carbon
   performance, specifically irreversible adsorption, was investigated.
   Beaded activated carbon (BAC) was tested for 5 adsorption/ regeneration
   cycles using a mixture of nine organic compounds representing
   industrially-relevant organic groups. Different concentrations of oxygen
   (<= 5-10,000 ppm) were used in the N-2 desorption purge gas. With
   increasing O-2 concentration, mass balance cumulative heel increased by
   up to 35\% and the fifth cycle adsorption capacity decreased by up to
   55\% relative to baseline scenario (<= 5 ppm O-2 in N-2). Derivative
   thermogravimetric analysis showed heel formation due to physisorption
   for <= 5 ppm O-2 and a combination of physisorption and chemisorption
   for other samples, indicating that with increasing oxygen concentration,
   compounds that would be physically adsorbed in highly pure N-2, may
   instead undergo chemical reactions and become chemisorbed. Micropore
   surface analysis indicated increased diffusion resistance in samples

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new passive auto focusing algorithm to
   acquire images with enhanced quality through a digital camera. The focus
   measure operations play a key role in a passive auto focusing method.
   The proposed focus measure operation is based on a localized version of
   image variance method. The localization of the image variance focus
   measure operation can be implemented with the use of fuzzy partition and
   Fuzzy Transform. In order to validate our approach, experimental
   comparative studies are conducted on test images with the use of
   different focus measure operators. The selected operators have been
   chosen from an extensive review of the state-of-the-art approaches. A
   comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is
   superior to the conventional methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We report a simple, rapid and cost effective detection technique for
   Escherichia coli (E. coli) using a Light Addressable Potentiometric
   Sensor integrated with electrospun poly acrylic acid/polyvinyl alcohol
   (PAA/PVA) hydrogel nanofibers as a sensing layer (NF-LAPS). Changes in
   pH of the media are detected as E. coli cells ferment sugar molecules
   and increase acidity of the surrounding. A super-Nernstian response of a
   74 mV/pH change in the NF-LAPS provides high sensitivity towards E. coli
   with a theoretical limit of detection (LOD) of 20 CFU/ml. The high
   sensitivity is associated with the pH sensitive behavior of the NFs on
   the surface. Detection of acidic species released in cellular metabolism
   of pathogens in the presence of carbon source renders the sensing
   mechanism cheaper, less time consuming and more practical than the
   antibody-antigen interaction based approach. Selectivity towards E. coli
   for applications in drinking water detection is ensured by the
   incorporation of D-mannose for specific binding. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a non-contact liquid sensor operating in an aquatic
   environment using an active, feedback loop assisted, planar, micro strip
   microwave resonator. The proposed sensor has the ability to operate in
   noncontact fashion within a distance of 0 to 8 cm. The active loop
   technique is shown to increase the primary quality factor from 210 to
   500,000 in air when measured at a resonant frequency of 1.52 GHz. The
   quality factor of the proposed resonator is adjustable with the direct
   current (DC) bias voltage and is set to 450,000 in the presence of an
   aquatic medium. The ability to adjust the quality factor of the reported
   microwave sensor allows for larger dynamic range and permittivity
   variation monitoring. Different shifts in resonant frequency are
   reported in the presence of various liquid samples in tubes which are
   submerged in deionized (DI) water. The proposed device is used to
   distinguish between Water, Ethanol, Methanol, Isopropanol, and Acetone
   in a submerged tube inside a water filled container. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Introduction: Routine MR images do not consistently reveal pathological
   changes in the brain in ALS. Texture analysis, a method to quantitate
   voxel intensities and their patterns and interrelationships, can detect
   changes in images not apparent to the naked eye. Our objective was to
   evaluate cerebral degeneration in ALS using 3-dimensional texture
   analysis of MR images of the brain.
   Methods: In a case-control design, voxel-based texture analysis was
   performed on T1-weighted MR images of 20 healthy subjects and 19
   patients with ALS. Four texture features, namely, autocorrelation, sum
   of squares variance, sum average, and sum variance were computed.
   Texture features were compared between the groups by statistical
   parametric mapping and correlated with clinical measures of disability
   and upper motor neuron dysfunction.
   Results: Texture features were different in ALS in motor regions
   including the precentral gyrus and corticospinal tracts. To a lesser
   extent, changes were also found in the thalamus, cingulate gyrus, and
   temporal lobe. Texture features in the precentral gyrus correlated with
   disease duration, and in the corticospinal tract they correlated with
   finger tapping speed.
   Conclusions: Changes in MR image textures are present in motor and
   non-motor regions in ALS and correlate with clinical features. Whole
   brain texture analysis has potential in providing biomarkers of cerebral
   degeneration in ALS.}},

   Implications for calibration and improved accuracy}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{786-792}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) are commercially available thin film
   polymer sensors commonly employed in a multitude of biomechanical
   measurement environments. Reasons for such wide spread usage lie in the
   versatility, small profile, and low cost of these sensors. Yet FSRs have
   limitations. It is commonly accepted that temperature, curvature and
   biological tissue compliance may impact sensor conductance and resulting
   force readings. The effect of these variables and degree to which they
   interact has yet to be comprehensively investigated and quantified. This
   work systematically assesses varying levels of temperature, sensor
   curvature and surface compliance using a full factorial
   design-of-experiments approach. Three models of Interlink FSRs were
   evaluated. Calibration equations under 12 unique combinations of
   temperature, curvature and compliance were determined for each sensor.
   Root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and maximum error were
   quantified as measures of the impact these thermo/mechanical factors
   have on sensor performance. It was found that all three variables have
   the potential to affect FSR calibration curves. The FSR model and
   corresponding sensor geometry are sensitive to these three mechanical
   factors at varying levels. Experimental results suggest that reducing
   sensor error requires calibration of each sensor in an environment as
   close to its intended use as possible and if multiple FSRs are used in a
   system, they must be calibrated independently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Hot/cold lime softening process (LSP) is an established process for
   water conditioning. LSP is currently monitored with various chemical
   analyses such as measuring simple and total alkalinities, pH, and
   hardness of softened water. The current monitoring is a labor-intensive
   task, which consumes various chemicals and generates a considerable
   amount of chemical wastewater during daily routine tests. Experiences in
   many industrial softeners show that the results of the traditional
   chemical method are not often conclusive. In this work, the weakness of
   the current chemical method for LSP monitoring has been experimentally
   verified and the effectiveness of an eco-friendly clean technology,
   based on puffing, has been introduced. The new method functions via
   comparing the measured electrical conductivities of softened water
   before and after puffing. As a totally green method, it has several
   advantages such as lack of need for any chemical reagent, easy and
   reliable testing, significant reduction in test costs, and chemical
   wastes compared to the conventional chemical method.}},

Title = {{Identification of Potential Drug Targets in Cancer Signaling Pathways
   using Stochastic Logical Models}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{The investigation of vulnerable components in a signaling pathway can
   contribute to development of drug therapy addressing aberrations in that
   pathway. Here, an original signaling pathway is derived from the
   published literature on breast cancer models. New stochastic logical
   models are then developed to analyze the vulnerability of the components
   in multiple signalling sub-pathways involved in this signaling cascade.
   The computational results are consistent with the experimental results,
   where the selected proteins were silenced using specific siRNAs and the
   viability of the cells were analyzed 72 hours after silencing. The genes
   elF4E and NFkB are found to have nearly no effect on the relative cell
   viability and the genes JAK2, Stat3, S6K, JUN, FOS, Myc, and Mcl1 are
   effective candidates to influence the relative cell growth. The
   vulnerabilities of some targets such as Myc and S6K are found to vary
   significantly depending on the weights of the sub-pathways; this will be
   indicative of the chosen target to require customization for therapy.
   When these targets are utilized, the response of breast cancers from
   different patients will be highly variable because of the known
   heterogeneities in signaling pathways among the patients. The targets
   whose vulnerabilities are invariably high might be more universally
   acceptable targets.}},

Abstract = {{Lanthanum chromate-based perovskite oxides have attracted great
   attention as the cathode materials in the high-temperature CO2
   electrolysis because of its good redox stability. However, the
   unsatisfied electrochemical catalytic activity and insufficient
   adsorption of CO2 at operating temperature still hindered the further
   improvement of electrochemical performance and the Faraday efficiency of
   the electrolysis cell. In this work, the catalytic and redox active Ce
   was doped into A site of La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.5Fe0.5O3-delta (LSCrF) to promote
   the catalytic performance, and to introduce oxygen vacancies in the
   lattice in situ after reduction under the operational condition. The
   increased amount of oxygen vacancies not only facilitates the mobility
   of oxygen ions, but also provides favorable accommodation for chemical
   adsorption of CO2. The CO2 electrolysis tests demonstrated the superior
   electrochemical performances, higher Faraday efficiencies of the
   Ce-doped LSCrF cathode catalyst in comparison with that without Ce
   doping, indicating the perspective application of this functional
   material.}},

Title = {{Small hydrophobe substitution on polyethylenimine for plasmid DNA

Abstract = {{Cationic polymers have been turned into effective gene delivery agents
   by functionalizing with long chain aliphatic lipids, but little
   information exists if small hydrophobic moieties can serve as effective
   substituents for this purpose. To explore this issue, we modified small
   molecular weight (1.2 kDa) polyethylenimine (1.2PEI) by a small
   hydrophobe, propionic acid (PrA), through N-acylation and investigated
   the efficacy of resultant polymers to deliver plasmid DNA (pDNA) to
   breast cancer cells MDA-231 and MCF-7. A significant impact of PrA
   grafting was observed on physicochemical features of polymers and
   resultant pDNA complexes. pDNA binding capacity, as measured by BC50
   (weight ratio for 50\% binding), was decreased from 0.25 to 0.64 with
   PrA substitution. Hydrodynamic size of polymer/pDNA complexes was not
   altered, but the surface charge (xi-potential) was increased with low
   PrA substitution and decreased at higher PrA substitutions. Similarly,
   in vitro pDNA transfection efficacy in MDA-231 and MCF-7 cells was
   significantly increased with PrA grafting and optimum efficacy was
   observed in polymers with modest substitution, 0.25-1.0 PrAs/PEI
   (mol/mol), but higher substitutions was detrimental to transfection. The
   transfection efficiency of PEI-PrAs was higher than aliphatic lipid
   (linoleic acid) substituted PEI and more stable than 25 kDa branched
   PEI. However, unlike studies reported elsewhere, siRNA had no effect on
   transfection efficacy of pDNA/PEI-PrA complexes when used as an
   additive. We conclude that small hydrophobe substitution on low MW PEI
   converts it into effective pDNA delivery agent in breast cancer cells up
   to an optimal ratio, indicating that balancing hydrophobicity of polymer
   is critical for pDNA transfection.
   Statement of Significance
   This manuscript investigated the influence of small hydrophobe
   (propionic acid, PrA, 3 carbon) grafted onto small molecular weight
   polyethylenimine (1.2PEI) in pDNA delivery. We have explored this
   approach as an alternative of common strategies to graft long chain
   and/or bulky lipids {[}linoleic acid (18 carbon), cholesterol]. At
   optimal substitution, transfection efficiency of these polymers was
   significantly higher than long chain lipid substituted 1.2PEI,
   emphasizing a proper hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance for optimum gene
   delivery. The overall results establish the feasibility of using small
   hydrophobes to create functional carriers, as long as the polymers are
   engineered with optimal ratio of substituent. The reported studies
   should facilitate the efforts of biomaterials scientists and engineers
   to design new carriers for gene therapy. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

Title = {{Interaction Mechanism of Oil-in-Water Emulsions with Asphaltenes
   Determined Using Droplet Probe AFM}},

Abstract = {{Emulsions with interface-active components at the oil/water interface
   have long been of fundamental and practical interest in many fields. In
   this work, the interaction forces between two oil droplets in water in
   the absence/presence of asphaltenes were directly measured using droplet
   probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) and analyzed using a theoretical
   model based on Reynolds lubrication theory and the augmented
   Young-Laplace equation by including the effects of disjoining pressure.
   It was revealed that the interaction forces measured between two
   pristine oil droplets (i.e., toluene) could be well described by the
   classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, while an
   additional steric interaction should be included in the presence of
   asphaltenes in the oil. The surface interaction and the stability of oil
   droplets in aqueous solution were demonstrated to be significantly
   influenced by the asphaltenes concentration in oil, salt concentration,
   pH, and presence of divalent ions (Ca2+) in water. Adsorbed asphaltenes
   at the oil/water interface led to more negative surface potential of the
   oil/water interface and also induced steric repulsion between oil
   droplets, inhibiting the drop coalescence and stabilizing the
   oil-in-water emulsion. Lower pH of aqueous solution could lead to less
   negative surface potential and weaken the repulsion between oil
   droplets. Addition of divalent ions (Ca2+) was found to disrupt the
   protecting effects of adsorbed asphaltenes at oil/water interface and
   induce coalescence of oil droplets. Our results provide a useful
   methodology for quantifying the interaction forces and investigating the
   properties of asphaltenes at the oil/water interfaces and provide
   insights into the stabilization mechanism of oil-in-water emulsions due
   to asphaltenes in oil production and water treatment.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{274-285}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we explore the combination of two well defined topics in
   fuzzy systems research: fuzzy rule based systems, and information
   granulation. Rule based systems are a powerful and well-studied form of
   knowledge representation, due to their approximation abilities and
   interpretability. In recent years, these types of systems have become
   increasingly powerful with regards to modeling accuracy; however, many
   of these improvements come at the cost of model interpretability. This
   recent direction of research has left an unexplored avenue towards the
   generation of increasingly interpretable fuzzy rule based models, which
   we intend to explore. Information granulation is a relatively new, yet
   very promising area of research in human centric systems. As a form of
   knowledge representation, information granulation is very well suited to
   fuzzy rule based systems, where rules represent linguistic quantities in
   a, intuitively understandable format. It is notable that the combination
   of these two concepts has been left largely unstudied. We aim to explore
   this union by defining a methodology for the construction of a partially
   granular fuzzy rule based model. The aim of this novel model format is
   to provide a first step in the improvement of fuzzy model
   interpretability, through the use of information granulation. We are
   additionally interested in studying new ways of generating fuzzy rules;
   hence, we will also look at the use of hierarchical clustering as a
   potential alternative to the tried and tested Fuzzy C Means clustering
   algorithm. The models created using hierarchical clustering are then
   compared with those generated using Fuzzy C Means to evaluate the
   effectiveness of this algorithm. As a result of these experiments, we
   demonstrate that partially granular fuzzy rules are capable of providing
   a significant improvement to fuzzy rule interpretability, and we believe
   that granular fuzzy models present an exciting avenue of future research
   in human centric systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A newly designed two-grade fractal model for improving the packing state
   in brown coal water slurry (BCWS), which was built on the fractal theory
   and modified by separating the size into two grades, was investigated
   systematically. Packing efficiency (PE) and regression levels of the
   fractal model in various particle systems were analyzed. The results
   showed that the PE of brown coal particle system is determined mainly by
   the fractal characteristics of particles under 74 mu m and the packing
   state in BCWS can be significantly improved when the fractal dimension
   is around 2.6-2.7. In addition, the two-grade fractal model fits the
   PSDs for various particle systems with different graduation ratios of
   coarse samples (CS), fine samples (FS) and ultra-fine samples (UFS)
   well. PE reaches the maximum value when the graduation ratio is 7: 0: 3
   (CS: FS: UFS) and the fractal dimension is 2.7080, which is consistent
   with the calculated results. It was confirmed by the slurry preparation
   experiment that the maximum solid loading of BCWS increased by 2.9\%

Title = {{Detection of nitroaromatics in the solid, solution, and vapor phases
   using silicon quantum dot sensors}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{Silicon quantum dots (Si-QDs) represent a well-known QD fluorophore that
   can emit throughout the visible spectrum depending on the interface
   structure and surface functional group. Detection of nitroaromatic
   compounds by monitoring the luminescence response of the sensor material
   (typically fluorescent polymers) currently forms the basis of new
   explosives sensing technologies. Freestanding silicon QDs may represent
   a benign alternative with a high degree of chemical and physical
   versatility. Here, we investigate dodecyl and amine-terminated Si-QD
   luminescence response to the presence of nitrobenzene and dinitrotoluene
   (DNT) in various solid, solution, and vapor forms. For dinitrotoluene
   vapor the 3 sigma detection limit was 6 ppb for monomer-terminated QDs.
   For nitroaromatics dissolved in toluene the detection limit was on the
   order of 400 nM, corresponding to similar to 100 pg of material
   distributed over similar to 1 cm(2) on the sensor surface. Solid traces
   of nitroaromatics were also easily detectable via a simple `touch test'.
   The samples showed minimal interference effects from common contaminants
   such as water, ethanol, and acetonitrile. The sensor can be as simple
   and inexpensive as a small circle of filter paper dipped into a QD
   solution, with a single vial of QDs able to make hundreds of these
   sensors. Additionally, a trial fiber-optic sensor device was tested by
   applying the QDs to one end of a 2 x 2 fiber coupler and exposing them
   to controlled DNT vapor. Finally, the quenching mechanism was explored
   via luminescence dynamics measurements and is different for blue (amine)
   and red (dodecyl) fluorescent silicon QDs.}},

Abstract = {{The heat flow generated from the infinite rock mass surrounding the
   underground tunnels is a major cause for the increasing cooling demands
   in deep mine tunnels. Insulation layers with lower thermal
   conductivities on tunnel walls and roof ceilings are believed to supply
   a thermo-barrier for heat abatement. However, it is found that no
   systematic theoretical investigations were made to predict and confirm
   the effectiveness of underground thermal insulation. Specifically,
   investigations on the underground insulation problems involving heat
   flows through the semi-infinite hot rock mass and insulation layer were
   not sufficient. Thus, in this paper, the thermal characteristics,
   accompanied with heat flow through the semi-infinite rock mass and the
   insulation layer, were modeled by both analytical and numerical methods
   with focus on underground mine tunnels. The close agreements between
   models have indicated that the thermal insulation applied on tunnel
   surfaces is able to provide promising heat abatement effects. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{During horizontal directional drilling (HDD), the drilling fluid
   pressure must not surpass the maximum allowable pressure to minimize the
   risk of hydraulic fracturing; hence, a plan pressure can be used to
   manage the drilling fluid pressure. This paper addresses the prediction
   of plan annular pressure using the power law flow model. The annular
   pressures were predicted using the power law model with rheological
   parameters determined from a six-speed viscometer with varying shear
   rate ranges from 3 to 600 RPM for two HDD projects, and the predicted
   pressures were compared with the measurements. The results indicated
   that the annular pressure could be properly predicted, and the best
   prediction was achieved by the shear rate range of 6-100 RPM due to
   embracing the real shear rate of drilling fluid inside the annulus; this
   shear rate range is close to the recommendation (3-100 RPM) by American
   Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The state estimation problem for hidden Markov models subject to
   event-based sensor measurement updates is considered in this work, using
   the change of probability approach. We assume the measurement updates
   are transmitted through wired or wireless communication networks. For
   the scenarios with reliable and unreliable communication channels,
   analytical expressions for the probability distributions of the states
   conditioned on all the past point- and set-valued measurement
   information are obtained. Also, we show that the scenario with a lossy
   channel, but without the event-trigger, can be treated as a special case
   of the reliable channel results. Based on these results, closed-form
   expressions for the estimated communication rates under the original
   probability measure are presented, which are shown to be the ratio
   between a weighted 1-norm and the 1-norm of the unnormalized conditional
   probability distributions of the states under the new probability
   measures constructed. Implementation issues are discussed, and the
   effectiveness of the results is illustrated by numerical examples and
   comparative simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Hydrophobic effects play important roles in a wide range of natural
   phenomena and engineering processes such as coalescence of oil droplets
   in water, air flotation of mineral particles, and folding and assembly
   of proteins and biomembranes. In this work, the authors highlight recent
   experimental attempts to reveal the physical origin of hydrophobic
   effects by directly quantifying the hydrophobic interaction on both
   solid/water and fluid/water interfaces using state-of-art nanomechanical
   techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). For solid hydrophobic surfaces of different hydrophobicity, the
   range of hydrophobic interaction was reported to vary from similar to 10
   to > 100 nm. With various characterization techniques, the very
   long-ranged attraction (> 100 nm) has been demonstrated to be mainly
   attributed to nonhydrophobic interaction mechanisms such as pre-existing
   nanobubbles and molecular rearrangement. By ruling out these factors,
   intrinsic hydrophobic interaction was measured to follow an exponential
   law with decay length of 1-2 nm with effective range less than 20 nm. On
   the other hand, hydrophobic interaction measured at fluid interfaces
   using AFM droplet/bubble probe technique was found to decay with a much
   shorter length of similar to 0.3 nm. This discrepancy of measured decay
   lengths is proposed to be attributed to inherent physical distinction
   between solid and fluid interfaces, which impacts the structure of
   interface-adjacent water molecules. Direct measurement of hydrophobic
   interaction on a broader range of interfaces and characterization of
   interfacial water molecular structure using spectroscopic techniques are
   anticipated to help unravel the origin of this rigidity-related mismatch
   of hydrophobic interaction and hold promise to uncover the physical
   nature of hydrophobic effects. With improved understanding of
   hydrophobic interaction, intrinsic interaction mechanisms of many
   biological and chemical pathways can be better elucidated, and novel
   devices/processes can be developed with capacity to modulate and control
   the hydrophobic effects from the molecular to the macroscopic scale. (C)

   porosity models typically assume sequential flow from matrix to micro
   fractures and from micro fractures to hydraulic fracture. Modeling
   simultaneous depletion of a matrix block into both micro and hydraulic
   fractures entails solution of a two dimensional continuity equation that
   is challenging by analytical or even semi-analytical methods. In
   addition, analysis with analytical models and type-curves provides
   deterministic and homogeneous estimates, rendering uncertainty analysis
   of fracture properties difficult.
   In this paper, we use a commercial reservoir simulator to compute the
   transient response in a segment of a hydraulically fractured horizontal
   well with a triple-porosity model, where matrix and fracture elements
   are explicitly discretized. Some limitations in analytical models such
   as sequential flow, singlephase flow and fully-connected symmetric
   fractures are investigated using the actual rate data from two tight oil
   wells completed in the Cardium and Bakken formations. An early drop in
   production, as commonly observed in many tight oil wells, could be
   attributed to gas dissolution with pressure decline and multiphase flow
   effects. Impacts of pressure interference between natural fractures and
   inter-well fracture communication are also investigated. Uncertainty in
   model parameter estimation is studied by assuming that results obtained
   from analytical solutions would characterize the mean estimate of the
   corresponding fracture parameters, additional heterogeneous models of
   natural/induced micro-fracture properties including its total number and
   intensity (spacing) are assigned stochastically. These models are
   subsequently subjected to flow simulations, and the variability in
   production performance captures the sensitivity due to model parameter
   uncertainties. Our results highlight the non-uniqueness of fracture
   characterization in production data analysis. It is demonstrated that
   ignoring the uncertainty in history-matched parameters and assumptions
   associated with analytical models could potentially over or
   under-estimate production by up to 30\%. The analysis workflow adopted
   in this study presents a practical framework for integrating numerical
   simulations with analytical solutions to study the limitations of
   analytical transient flow models and to quantify the uncertainty in
   production performance predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nanotechnology is an emerging paradigm for creating functional nanoscale
   materials for various biomedical applications. In this study, a new
   nanotechnology-based drug delivery method was developed using gold
   nanoparticles (GNPs) as a delivery vehicle to reduce adverse drug side
   effects. Fludarabine Phosphate is a commercial chemotherapy drug used in
   cancer treatment, and has ability to kill various cancer cells. KG-1
   cell, a type of acute cancer leukemia cell, was selected as a
   proof-of-concept target in this study. Due to the small size of GNPs,
   they can help Fludarabine Phosphate enter cancer cells more efficiently
   and better interfere with DNA synthesis in the cancer cells. To enhance
   targeting ability, folic acid molecules were also covalently linked to
   GNPs, resulting in GNP-Fludarabine-folic acid (GNP-F/f). Compared to
   treatments with GNP-F or drugs on its own (Fludarabine Phosphate), the
   GNP-F/f achieves much improved cell-killing effects. The UV-Vis spectra
   results also revealed that the drugs had successfully bonded covalently
   to the GNPs. The higher cell-killing efficiency of GNP-F/f compared with
   GNP-Fludarabine (GNP-F) or drugs on their own further validates the
   effectiveness of both the vectors (GNPs) and folic acid in enhancing the
   drug delivery to the cancer cells. The MTT viability tests showed that
   the GNPs had no cytotoxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Nanostring resonator and fiber-optics-based biosensors are of interest
   as they offer high sensitivity, real-time measurements and the ability
   to integrate with electronics. However, these devices are somewhat
   impaired by issues related to surface modification. Both nanostring
   resonators and photonic sensors employ glassy materials, which are
   incompatible with electrochemistry. A surface chemistry approach
   providing strong and stable adhesion to glassy surfaces is thus
   required. In this work, a diazonium salt induced aryl film grafting
   process is employed to modify a novel SiCN glassy material. Sandwich
   rabbit IgG binding assays are performed on the diazonium treated SiCN
   surfaces. Fluorescently labelled anti-rabbit IgG and anti-rabbit IgG
   conjugated gold nanoparticles were used as markers to demonstrate the
   absorption of anti-rabbit IgG and therefore verify the successful
   grafting of the aryl film. The results of the experiments support the
   effectiveness of diazonium chemistry for the surface functionalization
   of SiCN surfaces. This method is applicable to other types of glassy
   materials and potentially can be expanded to various nanomechanical and
   optical biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{In order to efficiently use the intrinsic data information, in this
   study a Discriminative Sparse Subspace Learning (DSSL) model has been
   investigated for unsupervised feature selection. First, the feature
   selection problem is formulated as a subspace learning problem. In order

   discriminative information in the subspace learning process. Second, a
   two-step TDSSL algorithm and a joint modeling JDSSL algorithm are
   developed to incorporate the clusters' assignment as the discriminative
   information. Then, a convergence analysis of these two algorithms is
   provided. A kernelized discriminative sparse subspace learning (KDSSL)
   method is proposed to handle the nonlinear subspace learning problem.
   Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to
   show the superiority of the proposed approaches over several

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of determining all the robust PID
   (proportional-integral-derivative) controllers in terms of the gain and

   GPM specifications provided by a PID controller are given for UFOPTD
   processes. A gain and phase margin tester is used to modify the original
   model, and the ranges of the margin specifications are derived such that
   the modified model can be stabilized by a stabilizing PID controller
   based on Hermite-Biehlers Theorem. Furthermore, we obtain all the
   controllers satisfying a given margin specification. Simulation studies
   show how to use the results to design a robust PID controller. (C) 2015

   Forty-eight 28-d-old female Wistar rats were divided into ovariectomized
   and intact groups. In both groups, animals were left untreated; treated
   with 50 g mesially directed orthodontic force on the maxillary first
   molars using nickel-titanium closed-coil springs for 28 d; or treated
   with the same orthodontic protocol along with a 20-min LIPUS application
   on alternate days for 28 d. Extent of OTM and amount of OIRR of mesial
   roots were measured on three-dimensionally reconstructed micro-computed
   tomography images. Ovariectomy increased OIRR (p < 0.05). LIPUS reduced
   root volumetric loss regardless of ovariectomy status (p < 0.05); only
   ovariectomized animals had decreased OTM (p < 0.05). LIPUS normalizes
   OTM and attenuates OIRR in ovariectomized osteoporotic rats. It may
   therefore be beneficial in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we re-examine the relay channel under the decode-forward
   (DF) strategy. Contrary to the established belief that block Markov
   coding is always the rate-optimal DF strategy, under certain channel
   conditions (a link regime), independent signaling between the source and
   relay achieves the same transmission rate without requiring coherent
   channel phase information. Furthermore, this independent signaling
   regime allows the relay to conserve power. As such, we design a
   composite DF relaying strategy that achieves the same rate as block
   Markov DF but with less required relay power. The finding is attractive
   from the link adaptation perspective to adapt relay coding and relay
   power according to the link state. We examine this link adaptation in
   fading under both perfect channel state information (CSI) and practical
   CSI in which nodes have perfect receive and long-term transmit CSI, and
   derive the corresponding relay power savings in both cases. We also
   derive the outage probability of the composite relaying scheme, which
   adapts the signaling to the link regime. Through simulation, we expose a
   tradeoff for relay placement showing that the relay conserves the most
   power when closer to the destination but achieves the most rate gain
   when closer to the source.}},

   which is the spectrum seller that would like to lease its unused
   channels to secondary users. To accommodate different arrival instants
   of secondary users' spectrum requests, spectrum leasing is performed in
   multiple rounds (stages), and in each stage, a separate spectrum price
   is set. First, we consider the case that, for each specific price value,
   the spectrum demand (the number of channels requested by secondary
   users) is a random variable. An optimization problem is formulated to
   set up the spectrum prices in the multiple stages, with the purpose of
   maximizing the total revenue of the primary network. The solving method
   of the formulated optimization problem is presented. Additionally, some
   interesting properties of the optimal solution are also presented, such
   as monotonicity and convexity of the maximal total revenue with respect
   to the stage index and lower/upper bounds of the maximal total revenue.
   Furthermore, we consider the case that, for a specific price value, the
   spectrum demand is nonrandom and can be solely determined by the price.
   An incremental algorithm is given to find out the optimal price values
   at the stages. We also demonstrate themonotonicity of the optimal price
   value with respect to the stage index. Numerical results are provided to
   verify the research findings and compare them with existing work.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular heterogeneous networks (HetNets) can improve capacity by
   offloading users from congested macro cells to lightly loaded small
   cells through biased association known as cell range expansion (CRE).
   However, the offloaded (range-expanded) users must be protected from
   macro interference through time/frequency resource partitioning. In this
   paper, we develop an analytical framework to evaluate the performance
   gain due to CRE further supported by resource partitioning in two-tier
   (macro-pico) networks with multichannel downlinks, e.g., those based on
   orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). By exploiting the
   flexibility in subchannel allocation offered by OFDMA, frequency-domain
   resource partitioning is proposed in which the macro tier is muted on a
   fraction of total subchannels, which are allocated exclusively to
   range-expanded pico users. The load perceived by a base-station is a key
   factor in determining its interference contribution over the network and
   is directly affected by user offloading and resource partitioning. Thus,
   the analysis of such systems must incorporate cell load. While previous
   studies mostly rely on full-load assumption, in this paper, we properly
   characterize cell load as the function of user density, association bias
   and resource partitioning fraction. We then, evaluate the performance in
   terms of average user data rate over the entire network, and also
   investigate the optimal choice of association bias and resource
   partitioning fraction.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of including spatial heterogeneity
   in multivariate random parameters models and their influence on
   different collision severity levels. The models were developed for
   severe (injury and fatal) and no -injury collisions using three years of
   collision data from the city of Vancouver. Three different modeling
   formulations were applied to measure the effects of spatial
   heterogeneity in a multivariate random parameters model. The proposed
   models were estimated in a Full Bayesian (FB) context using Markov Chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The Deviance Information Criteria (DIC)
   values indicated that all the models were comparable to one another.
   Therefore, no particular model can be distinctly preferred over others.
   According to parameter estimates, a variety of traffic and road
   geometric covariates were found to significantly influence collision
   severities. The variance for spatial heterogeneity was higher than the
   variance for heterogeneous effects. The correlation between severe and
   no -injury collisions for the total random effects (heterogeneous and
   spatial) was significant and quite high, indicating that higher no
   -injury collisions are associated with higher severe collisions. These
   results support the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity in
   multivariate random parameters models. Furthermore, the multivariate
   random parameters spatial models were compared with two independent
   univariate random parameters spatial models with respect to model
   inference and goodness of fit. The multivariate spatial models
   outperformed the two univariate spatial models with a very significant
   drop in the DIC value. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent works on mussel adhesion have identified a load bearing matrix
   protein (PTMP1) containing von Willebrand factor (vWF) with collagen
   binding capability that contributes to the mussel holdfast by
   manipulating mussel collagens. Using a surface forces apparatus, we
   investigate for the first time, the nanomechanical properties of
   vWF-collagen interaction using homologous proteins of mussel byssus,
   PTMP1 and preCollagens (preCols), as collagen. Mimicking conditions
   similar to mussel byssus secretion (pH < 5.0) and seawater condition (pH
   8.0), PTMP1 and preCol interact weakly in the ``positioning{''} phase
   based on vWF-collagen binding and strengthen in ``locked{''} phase due
   to the combined effects of electrostatic attraction, metal binding, and
   mechanical shearing. The progressive enhancement of binding between
   PTMP1 with porcine collagen under the aforementioned conditions is also
   observed. The binding mechanisms of PTMP1-preCols provide insights into
   the molecular interaction of the mammalian collagen system and the
   development of an artificial extracellular matrix based on collagens.}},

Abstract = {{Vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) are the most abundant and troublesome
   metals present in oil sands. During upgrading of the oil sand bitumen,
   these metals become concentrated in the heavier fraction asphaltenes.
   Any thermochemical conversion of asphaltene causes the release of these
   trace metals, and their distribution in the products poses concerns with
   toxicity, corrosion, and fouling. The pyrolysis, partial oxidation, and
   steam gasification experiments of asphaltene were carried out in an
   electrically heated atmospheric entrained-flow reactor, and the products
   char and soot are analyzed for the trace metal content. It is observed
   that the main metals present in the char and soot are V and Ni. During
   pyrolysis, with an increase in the temperature, the quantity of V and Ni
   present in char decreases as a result of the increased liberation into
   the gas phase. However, more liberated V and Ni were not captured by
   soot formed in the same experiment. During partial oxidation of
   asphaltenes, an increase in the stoichiometric oxygen content decreases
   the soot yield. The V and Ni contents in both the char and soot decrease
   with an increase in the stoichiometric oxygen ratio. The V content
   increases with the increase in the steam/fuel ratio in both char and
   soot obtained from steam gasification. With the increase in the
   steam/fuel ratio, the Ni content slightly decreases in char but
   increases to more than double in soot. Understanding the interaction of
   inorganic matter with char and soot will help in solving
   post-gasification fouling and erosion problems.}},

Abstract = {{The warm-water extraction of mined oil sands recovers the bitumen
   content as a froth, with significant amounts of emulsified water and
   fine mineral solids. Direct thermal processing of this bitumen water
   mixture, giving hydrothermal conditions, could reduce the number of
   process steps. In this study, the mineralogy and wettability of fine
   solids in Athabasca bitumen froth before and after hydrothermal
   treatment at 392 degrees C for 30 min at 15 MPa were investigated. The
   clay minerals, mainly kaolinite and illite, were unchanged, but siderite
   (FeCO3) and pyrite (FeS2) were converted to pyrrhotite (Fe(1-x)S) after
   the treatment. This conversion can be advantageous during direct
   hydrothermal treatment of bitumen froth because it fixes organic sulfur.
   The initial fine solids in the bitumen froth possessed a wide range of
   wettability, but they turned uniformly more oil-wet after the
   hydrothermal treatment. Consequently, the fine solids mostly stayed in
   the oil phase after the hydrothermal treatment and did not act as
   stabilizers for water-in-oil emulsions. The filterability of the fine
   solids in the bitumen froth was also significantly increased.
   Consequently, hydrothermal treatment of Athabasca bitumen froth could be
   used to destabilize water-in oil emulsions and facilitate fine solids
   removal by filtration.}},

Abstract = {{This communication presents a small, low-profile planar triple-band
   microstrip antenna for WLAN/WiMAX applications. The goal of this
   communication is to combine WLAN and WiMAX communication standards
   simultaneously into a single device by designing a single antenna that
   can excite triple-band operation. The designed antenna has a compact
   size of 19 x 25 mm(2) (0.152 lambda(0) x 0.2 lambda(0)). The proposed
   antenna consists of F-shaped slot radiators and a defected ground plane.
   Since only two F-shaped slots are etched on either sides of the radiator
   for triple-band operation, the radiator is very compact in size and
   simple in structure. The antenna shows three distinct bands I from 2.0
   to 2.76, II from 3.04 to 4.0, and III from 5.2 to 6.0 GHz, which covers
   entire WLAN (2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz) and WiMAX (2.5/3.5/5.5) bands. To validate
   the proposed design, an experimental prototype has been fabricated and
   tested. Thus, the simulation results along with the measurements show
   that the antenna can simultaneously operate over WLAN (2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz)
   and WiMAX (2.5/3.5/5.5 GHz) frequency bands.}},

Abstract = {{Using Particle Flow Code, a discrete element model is presented in this

   simulate a biaxial sliding experiment from literature on a saw-cut
   specimen of Sierra granite with a single fault. The fault is represented
   by the smooth-joint contact model. Also, an algorithm is developed to
   record the stick-slip induced microseismic events along the fault. Once
   the results compared well with laboratory data, a parametric study was
   conducted to investigate the evolution of the model's behavior due to
   varying factors such as resolution of the model, particle elasticity,
   fault coefficient of friction, fault stiffness, and normal stress. The
   results show a decrease in shear strength of the fault in the models
   with smaller particles, smaller coefficient of friction of the fault,
   harder fault surroundings, softer faults, and smaller normal stress on
   the fault. Also, a higher rate of displacement was observed for
   conditions resulting in smaller shear strength. An increase in b-values
   was observed by increasing the resolution or decreasing the normal
   stress on the fault, while b-values were not sensitive to changes in
   elasticity of the fault or its surrounding region. A larger number of
   recorded events were observed for the models with finer particles,
   smaller coefficient of friction of the fault, harder fault surroundings,
   harder fault, and smaller normal stress on the fault. The results
   suggest that it is possible for the two ends of a fault to be still
   while there are patches along the fault undergoing stick-slips. Such
   local stick-slips seem to provide a softer surrounding for their
   neighbor patches facilitating their subsequent stick-slips.}},

Abstract = {{Amniotic membrane (AM) transplantation is increasingly used in
   ophthalmological and dermatological surgeries to promote
   re-epithelialization and wound healing. Biologically active cells in the
   epithelial and stromal layers deliver growth factors and cytokines with
   anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-immunogenic and anti-fibrotic
   properties. In this work, confocal microscopy was used to show that our
   cryopreservation protocol for AM yielded viable cells in both the
   stromal and epithelial layers with favorable post-transplant outcome. AM
   was obtained from Caesarean-section placenta, processed into allograft
   pieces of different sizes (3 cm x 3 cm, 5 cm x 5 cm, and 10 cm x 10 cm)
   and cryopreserved in 10 \% dimethyl sulfoxide using non-linear
   controlled rate freezing. Post-thaw cell viability in the entire piece
   of AM and in the stromal and epithelial cell layers was assessed using a
   dual fluorescent nuclear dye and compared to hypothermically stored AM,
   while surveys from surgical end-users provided information on
   post-transplant patient outcomes. There was no significant statistical
   difference in the cell viability in the entire piece, epithelial and
   stromal layers regardless of the size of allograft piece (p = 0.092,
   0.188 and 0.581, respectively), and in the entire piece and stromal
   layer of hypothermically stored versus cryopreserved AM (p = 0.054 and
   0.646, respectively). Surgical end-user feedback (n = 49) indicated that
   16.3 \% of AM allografts were excellent and 61.2 \% were satisfactory.
   These results support the expanded clinical use of different sizes of
   cryopreserved AM allografts and address the issue of orientation of the
   AM during transplant for the treatment of dermatological defects and
   ocular surface disorders.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Wind power generation is increasing, rapidly forming a significant part
   of the power systems of the near future. Thus, incorporating-wind power
   into frequency regulation seems necessary. Droop and virtual inertia are
   two key methods for involving the wind power in frequency regulation.
   However, when these methods are applied, undesirable effects can be
   induced. However, the mitigation of such impacts has not yet been
   analyzed. The rate of change of power (ROCOP) of a wind generator could
   be a major factor limiting the effective implementation of frequency
   regulation-methods. Whereas high ROCOP leads to wear and tear and
   increases the maintenance cost, simply limiting the ROCOP of the
   generator by a ramp-limit control function will neutralize the desired
   impact of frequency regulation. In this paper, small-signal analysis is
   employed to study the impact of frequency regulation methods on the
   ROCOP of wind turbines considering the two-mass mechanical dynamics.
   Both doubly fed induction generator-and permanent magnet synchronous
   generator-based turbines are considered. An effective solution, based on
   utilizing the converter dc-link capacitor, is proposed, analyzed, and
   compared to the conventional ramp-rate limit method in different
   aspects. Time-domain simulation is used to validate the analytical
   results.}},

Title = {{Analog Programmable Distance Calculation Circuit for Winner Takes All
   Neural Network Realized in the CMOS Technology}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{661-673}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a programmable analog current-mode circuit used to
   calculate the distance between two vectors of currents, following two
   distance measures. The Euclidean (L2) distance is commonly used.
   However, in many situations, it can be replaced with the Manhattan (L1)
   one, which is computationally less intensive, whose realization comes
   with less power dissipation and lower hardware complexity. The presented
   circuit can be easily reprogrammed to operate with one of these
   distances. The circuit is one of the components of an analog winner
   takes all neural network (NN) implemented in the complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor 0.18-mu m technology. The learning process of
   the realized NN has been successfully verified by the laboratory tests
   of the fabricated chip. The proposed distance calculation circuit (DCC)
   features a simple structure, which makes it suitable for networks with a
   relatively large number of neurons realized in hardware and operating in
   parallel. For example, the network with three inputs occupies a
   relatively small area of 3900 mu m(2). When operating in the L2 mode,
   the circuit dissipates 85 mu W of power from the 1.5 V voltage supply,
   at maximum data rate of 10 MHz. In the L1 mode, an average dissipated
   power is reduced to 55 mu W from 1.2 V voltage supply, while data rate
   is 12 MHz in this case. The given data rates are provided for the worst
   case scenario, where input currents differ by 1\%-2\% only. In this
   case, the settling time of the comparators used in the DCC is quite
   long. However, that kind of situation is very rare in the overall
   learning process.}},

Title = {{Do adsorbent screening metrics predict process performance? A process
   optimisation based study for post-combustion capture of CO2}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{76-85}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in carbon dioxide capture has led to the development of
   hundreds of adsorbents. Adsorbent screening is typically performed
   either by inspecting the isotherms or by using simple adsorbent
   screening metrics (selectivities, working capacities, figures of merit,
   etc.). This work seeks to critically evaluate the efficacy of various
   adsorption metrics for adsorbent screening through the use of
   process-optimisation. A case study addressing post-combustion CO2
   capture using vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) is presented. Four different
   adsorbents (Mg-MOF-74, UTSA-16, Zeolite 13X and a type of activated
   carbon) were subjected to process-optimisation studies on a 4-step PSA
   cycle with light product pressurisation (LPP). Two kinds of process
   optimisation studies were performed. The first to maximise purity and
   recovery; and the second to minimise energy consumption and maximise
   productivity subject to purity/recovery constraints. This study
   highlights that most commonly used adsorbent metrics do not correctly
   rank adsorbents in order of their performance at a process scale.
   Further, it is also shown that N-2 affinity/capacity plays a critical
   role in deciding the process performance of VSA based post-combustion
   CO2 capture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluidic resonators with integrated microchannels (hollow resonators) are
   attractive for mass, density, and volume measurements of single
   micro/nanoparticles and cells, yet their widespread use is limited by
   the complexity of their fabrication. Here we report a simple and
   cost-effective approach for fabricating hollow microtube resonators. A
   prestructured silicon wafer is annealed at high temperature under a
   controlled atmosphere to form self-assembled buried cavities. The
   interiors of these cavities are oxidized to produce thin oxide tubes,
   following which the surrounding silicon material is selectively etched
   away to suspend the oxide tubes. This simple three-step process easily
   produces hollow microtube resonators. We report another innovation in
   the capping glass wafer where we integrate fluidic access channels and
   getter materials along with residual gas suction channels. Combined
   together, only five photolithographic steps and one bonding step are
   required to fabricate vacuum-packaged hollow microtube resonators that
   exhibit quality factors as high as similar to 13 000. We take one step
   further to explore additionally attractive features including the
   ability to tune the device responsivity, changing the resonator
   material, and scaling down the, resonator size. The resonator wall
   thickness of similar to 120 nm and the channel hydraulic diameter of
   similar to 60 nm are demonstrated solely by conventional
   microfabrication approaches. The unique characteristics of this new
   fabrication process facilitate the widespread use of hollow microtube
   resonators, their translation between diverse research fields, and the
   production of commercially viable devices.}},

Abstract = {{The Dugdale plastic zone ahead of a penny-shaped crack in a

   assumption of electrically permeable crack face conditions. A
   closed-form solution to the mixed boundary-value problem is obtained to
   predict the relationship between the length of the plastic zone and the
   applied loading. The stress distribution in and outside of the yield
   zone has been derived analytically, and the crack opening displacement
   has been investigated. The electric displacement has a constant value in
   the strip yield zone. The current Dugdale crack model leads to
   non-singular stress and electric fields near the crack front, and it is
   observed that the material properties affect the crack opening
   displacement.}},

Title = {{Zero-One Programming Approach to Determine Optimum Resource Supply under

Abstract = {{Skilled labor is critical to any construction project. The determination
   of optimum resource supply quantities over different project time
   periods compounds the resource-constrained project scheduling problem,
   which has yet to be formally formulated and analytically solved.
   Previous related research endeavors focused on the allocation of finite
   quantities of resources in order to arrive at the shortest total
   duration for a project. The proposed mathematical model is based on the
   modeling strategy underlying the zero-one programming approach, aiming
   to generate the optimum resource-constrained schedule under
   time-dependent resource constraints. Furthermore, a two-stage solution
   framework is devised to align with critical decision-making processes in
   current practices of project scheduling and workface planning. The
   resulting optimum schedule shortens total project duration while
   streamlining resource supply for each specified time period. An
   industrial turnaround project serves as the test bed to (1)demonstrate
   the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed resource
   scheduling approach; and (2)identify the optimum time-dependent resource
   availability limits in practical application settings. (C) 2015 American

   Sensors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Logarithmic CMOS image sensors are easily able, at video rates, to
   capture scenes where the dynamic range (DR) is high. However, tone
   mapping is required to output resulting images or videos to standard
   low-DR displays. This article proposes a new method, designed especially
   for logarithmic CMOS image sensors, which can suffer from temporal, and
   residual fixed pattern, noise. The novel tone mapping, a global operator
   based on histogram adjustment, uses a model of the camera noise to
   ensure that the mapping does not amplify the noise above a display
   threshold. Moreover, to reduce the likelihood of flickering, a temporal
   adaptation process is incorporated into the histogram calculation.
   Furthermore, to reduce complexity for real-time processing, a
   fixed-point implementation is designed for the proposed tone mapping.
   The novel operator and its fixed-point design are validated through
   offline and real-time experiments with a logarithmic CMOS image sensor.

Title = {{Characterization of the shear behavior of Z-shaped steel plate
   connectors used in insulated concrete panels}},
Journal = {{PCI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{23-37}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Insulated concrete panels are composed of two concrete layers with
   thermal insulation between them. The out-of-plane behavior of these
   panels depends on the shear behavior of their interlayer mechanical
   connectors. A new connector system using Z-shaped steel plates is under
   development. The shear strength and stiffness of the Z-shaped steel
   plate connectors should be determined to approximate the out-of-plane
   flexural response of insulated concrete panels. This paper presents the
   results of 11 push-off shear tests performed on Z-shaped steel plate
   connectors to study the effect of their width and thickness on their
   shear strength and stiffness. A simplified plate model and a tension tie
   model were adopted to estimate the shear behavior of the Z-shaped steel
   plate connectors. The experimental results indicate that the shear
   behavior of the tested Z-shaped steel plate connectors is affected by
   connector-concrete debonding and concrete cracking around the
   connector-concrete connection and that these effects increase with the
   thickness-to-width ratio of the connectors. The plastic shear strength
   of the simplified plate model using the Tresca yield criterion and the
   lateral stiffness of the tension tie model estimate the shear strength
   and stiffness of the tested connectors, respectively, with reasonable
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The resuscitation of hearts donated after circulatory death (DCD) is
   gaining widespread interest; however, the method of initial reperfusion
   (IR) that optimizes functional recovery has not been elucidated. We
   sought to determine the impact of IR temperature on the recovery of
   myocardial function during ex vivo heart perfusion (EVHP). Eighteen pigs
   were anesthetized, mechanical ventilation was discontinued, and cardiac
   arrest ensued. A 15-min standoff period was observed and then hearts
   were reperfused for 3min at three different temperatures (5 degrees C;
   N=6, 25 degrees C; N=5, and 35 degrees C; N=7) with a normokalemic
   adenosine-lidocaine crystalloid cardioplegia. Hearts then underwent
   normothermic EVHP for 6h during which time myocardial function was
   assessed in a working mode. We found that IR coronary blood flow
   differed among treatment groups (5 degrees C=48353, 25 degrees C=722 +/-
   60, 35 degrees C=906 +/- 36mL/min, p<0.01). During subsequent EVHP, less
   myocardial injury (troponin I: 5 degrees C=91 +/- 6, 25 degrees C=64 +/-
   16, 35 degrees C=57 +/- 7pg/mL/g, p=0.04) and greater preservation of
   endothelial cell integrity (electron microscopy injury score: 5 degrees
   C=3.2 +/- 0.5, 25 degrees C=1.8 +/- 0.2, 35 degrees C=1.7 +/- 0.3,
   p=0.01) were evident in hearts initially reperfused at warmer
   temperatures. IR under profoundly hypothermic conditions impaired the
   recovery of myocardial function (cardiac index: 5 degrees C=3.9 +/- 0.8,
   25 degrees C=6.2 +/- 0.4, 35 degrees C=6.5 +/- 0.6mL/minute/g, p=0.03)
   during EVHP. We conclude that the avoidance of profound hypothermia
   during IR minimizes injury and improves the functional recovery of DCD
   hearts.}},

Abstract = {{Hearts donated following circulatory death (DCD) may represent an
   additional source of organs for transplantation; however, the impact of
   donor extubation on the DCD heart has not been well characterized. We
   sought to describe the physiologic changes that occur following
   withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) in a porcine model of DCD.
   Physiologic changes were monitored continuously for 20min following
   WLST. Ventricular pressure, volume, and function were recorded using a
   conductance catheter placed into the right (N=8) and left (N=8)
   ventricles, and using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, N=3). Hypoxic
   pulmonary vasoconstriction occurred following WLST, and was associated
   with distension of the right ventricle (RV) and reduced cardiac output.
   A 120-fold increase in epinephrine was subsequently observed that
   produced a transient hyperdynamic phase; however, progressive RV
   distension developed during this time. Circulatory arrest occurred
   7.60.3min following WLST, at which time MRI demonstrated an 18 +/- 7\%
   increase in RV volume and a 12 +/- 9\% decrease in left ventricular
   volume compared to baseline. We conclude that hypoxic pulmonary
   vasoconstriction and a profound catecholamine surge occur following WLST
   that result in distension of the RV. These changes have important
   implications on the resuscitation, preservation, and evaluation of DCD
   hearts prior to transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{Mussel-inspired self-polymerized catecholamine coatings have been widely
   utilized as a versatile coating strategy that can be applied to a
   variety of substrates. For the first time, nanomechanical measurements
   and an evaluation of the contribution of primary amine groups to
   poly(catecholamine) coatings have been conducted using a surface-forces
   apparatus. The adhesive strength between the poly(catecholamine) layers
   is 30-times higher than that of a poly(catechol) coating. The origin of
   the strong attraction between the poly(catecholamine) layers is probably
   due to surface salt displacement by the primary amine, - stacking (the
   quadrupole-quadrupole interaction of indolic crosslinks), and cation-
   interactions (the monopole-quadrupole interaction between positively
   charged amine groups and the indolic crosslinks). The contribution of
   the primary amine group to the catecholamine coating is vital for the
   design and development of mussel-inspired catechol-based coating
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{As an important component of soil organic matter (SOM), the
   transformation of pyrogenic carbon plays a critical role in the
   biogeochemical cycles of carbon and other redox-active elements such as
   iron (Fe). Herein, we studied the influences of wheat straw-derived
   biochars on the microbial reduction of 100 mM of hematite by the
   dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 under
   anoxic conditions. The long-term microbial reduction extent and initial
   reduction rate of hematite were accelerated by more than 2-fold in the
   presence of 10 mg L-1 biochar. Soluble leachate from 10 mg L-1 biochar
   enhanced Fe(III) reduction to a similar degree. Microbially prereduced
   biochar leachate abiotically reduced hematite, consistent with the
   apparent electron shuttling capacity of biochar leachate. Electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis suggested that biochar
   leachate-associated semiquinone functional groups were likely involved
   in the redox reactions. In addition to electron shuttling effects,
   biochar particles sorbed 0.5-1.5 mM biogenic Fe(II) and thereby
   increased the long-term extent of hematite reduction by 1.4-1.7 fold.
   Our results suggest that Fe redox cycling may be strongly impacted by
   pyrogenic carbon in soils with relatively high content of indigenous
   pyrogenic carbon or substantial application of biochar.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeA readout-segmented method for acquiring robust GRAPPA
   calibration data for echo-planar imaging (EPI) was proposed and compared
   with two previous methods, including the gold standard interleaved
   approach and a single shot method with halved phase encode resolution.
   Theory and MethodsThe readout-segmented and single shot techniques
   acquire adjacent phase encode lines in the same shot to obtain the
   calibration data, rather than interleaving of lines between shots, to
   decrease sensitivity to motion. Additionally, it uses multiple segments
   with shortened frequency encode extent to match the phase encode
   bandwidth to the undersampled data, which decreases sensitivity to B-0
   inhomogeneity. The three methods were tested using simulations and EPI
   scans of the brain in healthy volunteers.
   ResultsThe interleaved approach exhibited high sensitivity to motion,
   while residual undersampling artifacts remained in the single shot
   method due to mismatch of B-0 inhomogeneity between the calibration and
   undersampled data. The readout segmented method exhibited no such
   errors, having 30\% lower ghosting intensity than the single shot method
   and 90\% lower ghosting intensity than the interleaved approach in
   moving subjects.
   ConclusionArtifacts from B-0 inhomogeneity and motion during calibration
   scans for EPI GRAPPA can be mitigated with a readout segmented
   calibration scan. Magn Reson Med 75:1166-1174, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{This review covers the characterization and distribution of metals and
   nonmetals in the Alberta oil sands region (AOSR) of Canada. The
   development of the oil sands industry has resulted in the release of
   organic, metal and nonmetal contaminants via air and water to the AOSR.
   For air, studies have found that atmospheric deposition of metals in the
   AOSR decreased exponentially with distance from the industrial emission
   sources. For water, toxic metal concentrations often exceeded safe
   levels leading to the potential for negative impacts to the receiving
   aquatic environments. Interestingly, although atmospheric deposition,,
   surface waters, fish tissues, and aquatic bird eggs exhibited increasing
   level of metals in the AOSR, reported results from river sediments
   showed no increases over time. This could be attributed to physical
   and/or chemical dynamics of the river system to transport metals to
   downstream. The monitoring of the airborne emissions of relevant
   nonmetals (nitrogen and sulphur species) was also considered over the
   AOSR. These species were found to be increasing along with the oil sands
   developments with the resultant depositions contributing to nitrogen and
   sulphur accumulations resulting in ecosystem acidification and
   eutrophication impacts. In addition to direct monitoring of
   metals/nonmetals, tracing of air emissions using isotopes was also
   discussed. Further investigation and characterization of
   metals/nonmetals emissions in the AOSR are needed to determine their
   impacts to the ecosystem and to assess the need' for further treatment
   measures to limit their continued output into the receiving
   environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use randomized network coding (RNC) with simple connection topology
   control to approach the theoretical limit on finish time of
   disseminating k blocks in a server cluster of n nodes. Unlike prior

   that with RNC, any receiver selection following a simple permutation
   rule can achieve a broadcast completion time of k + n and that a
   time-varying random ring topology achieves a completion time of k + o(k)
   + O(log n), both with high probability. Since the theoretical limit on
   finish time is k + {[}log(2) n], our simple permutation algorithms
   achieve absolutely optimal (not only order-optimal) block pipelining for
   the k blocks. Our results hold for both one-to-all (broadcast) and
   all-to-all transfers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
   organized network coded gossip with an application to content
   distribution in cluster computing systems like MapReduce, and discuss
   practical block dividing strategies to hide the negative effect of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{21-34}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Recently, slow feature analysis (SFA), a novel dimensionality reduction
   technique, has been adopted for integrated monitoring of operating
   condition and process dynamics. By isolating temporal behaviors from
   steady-state information, the SFA-based monitoring scheme enables
   improved discrimination of nominal operating point changes from real
   faults. In this study, we demonstrate that the temporal dynamics is an
   additional indicator of control performance changes, and further exploit
   its unique efficacy in control performance monitoring. Because of its
   data-driven nature and ease from first-principle knowledge, the
   SFA-based monitoring scheme allows an overall assessment of the
   plant-wide control performance and is compatible with different control
   strategies. An attractive feature of the SFA-based approach compared to
   existing ones is that generic process monitoring indices are used, which
   renders contribution plots naturally applicable to real-time diagnosis
   of control performance. As a result, potential fault variables as root
   causes of control performance changes can be identified, including not
   only controlled variables (CV) but also manipulated variables (MV) and
   disturbance variables (DV). Simulated and experimental studies
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A subset of the family of fluorescent proteins are the non-fluorescent
   chromoproteins which are promising probe molecules for use in
   photoacoustic imaging and as acceptor chromophores in Forster resonance
   energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors. Typical approaches for
   fluorescent protein optimization by screening of large libraries of
   variants cannot be effectively applied to chromoproteins due to their
   characteristic lack of fluorescence. To address this challenge, we have
   developed a directed evolution method to iteratively screen large
   libraries of protein variants on the basis of their photoacoustic signal
   levels. By applying this procedure to the promising Ultramarine and
   cjBlue chromoprotein templates, we were able to identify improved
   variants with a 02-04 fold increase in photoacoustic signal-to-noise
   ratio after only a few evolutionary steps. These improved variants
   enable more accurate spectral de-mixing and localization of
   protein-producing bacteria in vivo and serve as effective FRET acceptors
   for both fluorescence-and photoacoustic-based detection of protease
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent homology captures the evolution of topological features of a
   model as a parameter changes. The most commonly used summary statistics
   of persistent homology are the barcode and the persistence diagram.
   Another summary statistic, the persistence landscape, was recently
   introduced by Bubenik. It is a functional summary, so it is easy to
   calculate sample means and variances, and it is straightforward to
   construct various test statistics. Implementing a permutation test we
   detect conformational changes between closed and open forms of the
   maltose-binding protein, a large biomolecule consisting of 370 amino
   acid residues. Furthermore, persistence landscapes can be applied to
   machine learning methods. A hyperplane from a support vector machine
   shows the clear separation between the closed and open proteins
   conformations. Moreover, because our approach captures dynamical
   properties of the protein our results may help in identifying residues
   susceptible to ligand binding; we show that the majority of active site
   residues and allosteric pathway residues are located in the vicinity of
   the most persistent loop in the corresponding filtered VietorisRips
   complex. This finding was not observed in the classical anisotropic
   network model.}},

Title = {{Solvent removal from cyclohexane-extracted oil sands gangue}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Pages = {{408-414}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Solvent extraction of bitumen from the Alberta oil sands has the
   potential to overcome the shortcomings of the current aqueous extraction
   process by reducing fresh water demand and eliminating tailings ponds.
   Bitumen is recovered as a solution, leaving behind the solids (or
   gangue) with a residual solvent and water from the original ore.
   Removing the solvent from the gangue is a crucial step that involves
   evaporation of volatile material (cyclohexane) from a porous matrix in
   the presence of a less volatile immiscible phase (water). In this study,
   we examined the effects of relative humidity, temperature, and the
   addition of water during cyclohexane extraction on the extent of
   cyclohexane removal from the extraction gangue. The drying curves showed
   two constant-rate periods, with the initial period mainly removing
   cyclohexane, and the second mainly removing water. The initial drying
   rate of gangue in an environmental chamber was 2.7 times faster than
   drying in a fume hood due to the stronger convective currents in the
   chamber produced by its fan. The initial drying rate was independent of
   the relative humidity, which was in the range of 30-90\%, but the
   residual cyclohexane content in the gangue increased at high relative
   humidity. The addition of water to oil sands prior to cyclohexane
   extraction increased the residual cyclohexane in the gangue, likely by
   forming a barrier to efficient evaporation.}},

Abstract = {{The thickener is an important operating unit in a coal handling and
   preparation plant (CHPP). The optimal control and operation of the
   thickener is critical for the efficiency and economics of a CHPP. In
   this work, we apply a computationally efficient economic model
   predictive controller (EMPC) to a deep cone thickener and compare its
   performance to a proportional-integral controller and a regular model
   predictive controller (MPC). Based on a detailed model of the deep cone
   thickener that is appropriate for controller design purpose, the three
   control designs are compared on different aspects, including average
   water recovery rate and controller execution time, via extensive
   simulations. The robustness of the EMPC is also investigated in the
   presence of random disturbances in feed flow rate. The results
   demonstrate that the EMPC has the potential to significantly improve
   water recovery rate compared to the proportional-integral control and
   the regular MPC.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{For high-power pulsewidth modulation (PWM) converters, selective
   harmonic elimination (SHE) modulation scheme is commonly adopted to
   reduce the low-order harmonics caused by a low switching frequency.
   However, the SHE scheme itself lacks the capability to actively
   compensate the grid background harmonics. To enable the active
   compensation ability of the SHE-modulated PWM converters, a selective
   harmonic compensation scheme and an SHE phase jittering method have been
   proposed in the previous works, and their effectiveness to actively
   attenuate the one grid line current harmonic was verified on a
   high-power PWM current-source rectifier (CSR) system application.
   Nevertheless, both the two methods have difficulty in compensating two
   harmonics simultaneously, which limits their applications with a low
   resonant frequency of converter system's filter circuit. This paper
   extends the previous studies to enable the high-power PWM converters to
   actively compensate two grid background harmonics. The proposed method
   can not only further reduce the grid line current distortion but also
   make the application of the active compensation no longer limited by the
   filter circuit. The experimental results of its application on a
   high-power PWM CSR system are provided to verify the effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Cell membranes are highly selective structures and prevent foreign
   objects, such as biomolecules and genes, from entering cells. Different
   carrier-based delivery methods have been developed and each method has
   its advantages and disadvantages. In previous article, a
   microbubble-based gene delivery method was developed to increase cell
   membrane permeability. In a high centrifugation field, cells deform and
   collide with microbubbles which induces intracellular pathways through
   cell membranes. This delivery method significantly increases delivery
   efficiency especially when using hard-to-deliver cells, such as stem
   cells and plant cells. To understand the mechanism of this delivery
   method, the structural behaviour of cell models under hydrodynamic
   collision pressure was analyzed by finite element analysis. Simulation
   results show that cells with more deformed structures experience higher
   strain on the cell membrane than cells with less deformed structures
   while the cells' mechanical properties and the collision conditions were
   kept the same.}},

Title = {{Celerities of waves and ice runs from ice jam releases}},
Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{71-80}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The release of a river ice jam can lead to rapidly rising water levels
   and a fast-moving torrent of water and ice that can threaten riverside
   communities. Two phases are released when an ice jam fails: a water wave
   and a moving ice accumulation (called an ``ice run{''}). The propagation
   of the water component of an ice jam release wave is relatively well
   understood. However, a dearth of simultaneous observations of both the
   water and ice components of an ice jam release has hampered the
   development of tools to predict of the effects of these releases. This
   paper presents a field experiment on the Hay River in the Northwest
   Territories where both water level and ice condition were observed
   simultaneously at several locations over a distance of more than ten
   thousand flow depths. This research shows that the water wave and the
   ice run travel at different celerities resulting in two distinct, but
   initially overlapping, features. The celerity of the leading edge of the
   water wave was found to be higher than the ice components, making the
   water wave move out in front of the ice after 4 to 8 ice jam lengths of
   travel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional frost heave testing of soil samples of differing
   composition (Devon silt and the fines generated from the abrasion of an
   aggregate) demonstrates a contradictory assessment of their frost heave
   susceptibility based on the rate of segregation heave and the
   segregation potential (SP). Specifically, the rate of segregation heave
   is representative of the frost heave susceptibility during transient
   conditions, whereas the SP is an indicator of the frost heave
   susceptibility under steady state conditions. The contradiction between
   these two measures is due to the transient conditions that result from
   the differing thermal conductivity of the soils. Limitations of frost
   susceptibility criteria are discussed in light of these results. (C)

Abstract = {{The Ripley Landslide is a soil slide moving on a fully developed,
   sub-horizontal, shear surface. The landslide represents a hazard for two
   important railway lines across its toe. The landslide is being monitored
   by an array of displacement measurement systems including GPS units, a
   ShapeAccelArray (SAA), satellite InSAR, and crack extension metres, as
   well as an array of piezometers targeting pore water pressures in the
   vicinity of the shear surface. The displacement monitoring system shows
   an annual cycle of slope deformations most active between September and
   May. Annual horizontal displacements range between 60 and 100 mm.
   Vertical displacements range between 20 and 80 mm of settlement. The
   average horizontal velocities during the active displacement period are
   between 0.2 and 0.35 mm/day, with maximum velocities of up to 0.6
   mm/day. This paper describes the development of an early warning system
   based on landslide displacement measurements. The system is based on GPS
   and SAA measurements, which provide near real-time displacement data.
   The early warning system focuses on detecting changes in landslide
   annual displacement cycles and potential accelerations, as well as the
   effects of slope deformation on the railway alignment. As such, the
   system monitors both the integrity and performance of the slope.}},

Abstract = {{An electrothermal method of capacitive heating of oil sands was
   investigated. Temperature-based impedance spectroscopy experiments for a
   given rich grade of oil sands were conducted to identify a suitable
   dielectric relaxation frequency for carrying out capacitive heating,
   which was observed to be around 65 kHz having a full width at
   half-maximum of two decades. This was attributed to interfacial
   polarizations at water, bitumen, and silicate mineral interfaces. The
   relaxation frequency changed with temperature rise, indicating that
   frequency tuning could be suitable to optimize capacitive heating.
   Hence, capacitive heating of oil sands was demonstrated by exposing it
   to high alternating electric fields (10(4) V/m) at a frequency in the
   dispersion regime of its relaxation frequency. As temperature increased,
   the overall impedance of oil sands decreased as determined from
   impedance spectroscopy. Frequency was retuned to match the changed
   impedance of the system, which ensured that temperature further
   increased.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-70}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{There is a need to bridge theory and practice for incorporating
   parameter uncertainty in geostatistical simulation modeling workflows.
   Simulation workflows are a standard practice in natural resource and
   recovery modeling, but the incorporation of multivariate parameter
   uncertainty into those workflows is challenging. However, the objectives
   can be met without considerable extra effort and programming. The
   sampling distributions of statistics comprise the core theoretical
   notion with the addition of the spatial degrees of freedom to account
   for the redundancy in the spatially correlated data. Prior parameter
   uncertainty is estimated from multivariate spatial resampling.
   Simulation-based transfer of prior parameter uncertainty results in
   posterior distributions which are updated by data conditioning and the
   model domain extents and configuration. The results are theoretically
   tractable and practical to achieve, providing realistic assessments of
   uncertainty by accounting for large-scale parameter uncertainty, which
   is often the most important component impacting a project. A
   simulation-based multivariate workflow demonstrates joint modeling of
   intrinsic shale properties and uncertainty in estimated ultimate
   recovery in a shale gas project. The multivariate workflow accounts for
   joint prior parameter uncertainty given the current well locations and
   results in posterior estimates on global distributions of all modeled
   properties. This is achieved by transferring the joint prior parameter
   uncertainty through conditional simulations.}},

   the extraction efficiency of naphthenic acids from oil sands
   process-affected water}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{472-477}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) from oil sand process-affected water (OSPW) were
   liquid liquid extracted using six organic solvents (n-pentane, n-hexane,
   cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ethyl ether, and ethyl acetate) at three
   pHs (2.0, 8.5, and 12.0). The NAs exist in ionic (ions) and non-ionic
   (molecules) forms in the water phase depending on their dissociation
   constants and the solution pH. Results showed the extractability of NA
   molecules depends on the solvent polarity and the extractability of NA
   ions on the water solubility in solvent. The organic solvent type and
   solution pH were found to not only impact the extracted amounts of each
   NA species, but also the NM distribution in terms of molecule carbon
   number and hydrogen deficiency. Overall, it is concluded that ethyl
   ether can be used as an alternative to dichloromethane (DCM) given their
   similar extraction efficiencies and extracted NA profiles. This is
   important since DCM is known to have metabolic toxicity and
   transitioning to the safer ethyl ether would eliminate laboratory DCM
   exposures and risk to human health. Despite the higher extraction
   efficiency of NAs at pH 2.0, extraction at pH 12.0 could be useful for
   targeted extraction of low-concentration nonpolar organic compounds in
   OSPW. This knowledge may assist in the determination of the specific NAs
   species that are known to have chronic, sub-chronic and acute toxicity
   to various organisms, and the potential targeting of treatment to these
   NAs species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS \& MANUFACTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{35-40}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the relationship between the preload and no-load
   drag torque of ball screws. Based on a new equation to calculate the
   normal contact load between balls and the screw raceway under no
   external load, a new correlation between preload and no-load drag torque
   is proposed. Meanwhile, a novel preload-adjustable ball screw mechanism
   and a drag torque measuring system are constructed. Three LCM300 load
   cells and a force sensor are implemented for obtaining the experimental
   data from the constructed systems. Preload and no-load drag torque are
   obtained and analyzed. It is found that there is a large gap between the
   calculated preload by traditional formula and the measured value. The
   experimental results, agreeing well with the theoretical values
   calculated in this paper, show there exists a linear correlation between
   preload and drag torque in a preloaded ball screw mechanism.
   Furthermore, the derivation of the drag torque would be decreased when
   increasing the preload, which can improve the stability of the screw
   during its operation. This study provides an accurate correlation to
   obtain the preload through the no-load drag torque for preloaded ball
   screws, which is significant for better performance of ball screws as
   well as the CNC machine tools. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   frequency range of 0.2-1.5 THz, despite the fact that they are made from
   the same linear chain of glucose monomers. The results show that the
   permittivity is strongly dependent on the source from which the CNC

   The THz loss tangent (0.043 < tan(delta) < 0.145), absorption
   coefficient (3.5 cm(-1) < alpha < 63.7 cm(-1)), and growth-varying

Abstract = {{A strain-consistent elastic plate model is formulated in which both
   initial surface tension and the induced residual stress are treated as
   finite values, and the exactly same strain expressions are consistently
   employed for both the surface and the bulk plate. Different than most of
   previous related models which follow the original Gurtin-Murdoch model
   and include some non-strain displacement gradient terms (which cannot be
   expressed in terms of the surface infinitesimal strains or the von
   Karman-type strains) in the surface stress-strain relations, the present
   model does not include any non-strain displacement gradient terms in the
   surface stress-strain relations. For a free elastic plate with in-plane
   movable edges, the present model predicts that initial surface tension
   exactly cancels out the induced residual compressive stress. On the
   other hand, if all edges are in-plane immovable, residual stress cannot
   develop in the plate and the initial surface tension causes a tensile
   net membrane force. In addition, the present model predicts that initial
   surface tension reduces the effective bending rigidity of the plate,
   while this reduction does not depend on Poisson ratio. In particular,
   self-buckling of a free elastic plate under tensile surface tension
   cannot occur unless the effective bending rigidity of plate vanishes or
   becomes negative.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a complete analytical solution predicting the deformation of

   perimeter of the membrane. The shape equation describing the equilibrium
   state of a lipid membrane is taken from the classical Helfrich model. A
   linearized version of the shape equation describing membrane morphology
   (within the Monge representation) is obtained via a limit of superposed
   incremental deformations. We obtain a complete analytical solution by
   reducing the corresponding problem to a single partial differential
   equation and by using Fourier series representations for various types
   of boundary forces. The solution obtained predicts smooth morphological
   transition over the domain of interest. Finally, we note that the
   methods used in our analysis are not restricted to the particular type
   of boundary conditions considered here and can accommodate a wide class
   of practical and important edge conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a

   the designed sensor were optimized for higher sensitivity by finite
   element modeling and simulations. Here we demonstrate the detection of
   different liquid-liquid interfaces such as water-olive oil, water-olive
   oil-ethanol, and rag layer samples using microwave resonator method. In
   the proposed sensor, the resonance frequency demonstrated a maximum
   variation of 5.7\% for water to rag layer interface. To increase the
   accuracy of the sensor in the interface detection, quality factor is
   also measured and demonstrated a maximum variation of 85\% depending on
   the materials. The proposed sensor provides a non-contact real time,
   cost-effective, robust method for interface detection, which has
   potential applications in the oil sands industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{188-198}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a multiscale model to simulate coalbed methane
   (CBM) production from reservoirs along with the inclusion of secondary
   biogenic gas generated by the continued anaerobic breakdown of coal. A
   two-step gas transport model is derived for this purpose, based on the
   assumption that coal porosity can be classified into two scales,
   macropores and micropores. The model assumes laminar gas flow in
   macropores and diffusive flow in micropores, driven by desorption.
   Surface diffusion of gas due to the Klinkenberg effect occurring at low
   permeability and pressure conditions is also considered. The transport
   model built for gas flow simulation in a 1D radial reservoir is
   non-dimensionalized and solved using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The
   Morris OAT (one-at-a-time) method for global sensitivity analysis is
   used to identify important gas transport/storage parameters to perform
   model refinement for history matching of production data from the gas
   producing phase of Manville wells found in Alberta. The validated
   transport model is then combined with a suitably modified enzymatic
   kinetic model for coal bioconversion that was originally developed by us
   for lab-scale experiments. Finally, parametric investigations revealed
   that an order of magnitude increase in the methanogenesis rate can
   significantly improve biogenic gas recovery, and the next most
   significant parameter is the solubilization rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The electric energy sector is moving toward extensive integration of
   renewable and clean energy resources, energy storage units, and modern
   loads via highly efficient and flexible multiterminal dc grids
   integrated within the traditional ac grid infrastructure. A
   voltage-source converter (VSC) is the main technology enabling the
   interconnection of dc and ac grids. In such demanding applications,
   dc-link voltage control is crucial to maintain system stability.
   However, the dynamics and control of VSCs considering the instantaneous
   power of both ac- and dc-side filters and dc grid uncertainties are not
   addressed in the current literature. Furthermore, as shown in this
   paper, the uncertainty in the effective dc grid parameters, including
   filter capacitance and dc-side inductance owing to
   connecting/disconnecting electric devices to/from the dc grid remarkably
   affects the converter stability and performance. To overcome these
   difficulties, this paper presents 1) a detailed small-signal model of
   the dc-link dynamics in grid-connected VSCs considering the
   instantaneous power of both ac- and dc-side energy storage components,
   and 2) a robust optimal dc-link voltage controller. The proposed
   controller ensures excellent tracking performance, robust disturbance
   rejection, and robust performance against operating point and parameter
   variation with a simple fixed-parameter controller. A theoretical
   analysis, comparative simulation studies, and experimental results are
   presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control structure.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Head circumference is used together with other measures as a proxy for
   central nervous system damage in the diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum
   disorders, yet the relationship between head circumference and brain
   volume has not been investigated in this population. The objective of
   this study is to characterize the relationship between head
   circumference, brain volume and cognitive performance in a large sample
   of children with prenatal alcohol exposure (n = 144) and healthy
   controls (n = 145), aged 5-19 years. All participants underwent magnetic
   resonance imaging to yield brain volumes and head circumference,
   normalized to control for age and sex. Mean head circumference, brain
   volume, and cognitive scores were significantly reduced in the prenatal
   alcohol exposure group relative to controls, albeit with considerable
   overlap between groups. Males with prenatal alcohol exposure had
   reductions in all three measures, whereas females with prenatal alcohol
   exposure had reduced brain volumes and cognitive scores, but no
   difference in head circumference relative to controls. Microcephaly
   (defined here as head circumference <= 3rd percentile) occurred more
   often in prenatal alcohol exposed participants than controls, but 90\%
   of the exposed sample had head circumferences above this clinical cutoff
   indicating that head circumference is not a sensitive marker of prenatal
   alcohol exposure. Normalized head circumference and brain volume were
   positively correlated in both groups, and subjects with very low head
   circumference typically had below-average brain volumes. Conversely,
   over half of the subjects with very low brain volumes had normal head
   circumferences, which may stem from differential effects of alcohol on
   the skeletal and nervous systems. There were no significant correlations
   between head circumference and any cognitive score. These findings
   confirm group-level reductions in head circumference and increased rates
   of microcephaly in children with prenatal alcohol exposure, but raise
   concerns about the predictive value of this metric at an
   individual-subject level.}},

Title = {{A Novel Approach Toward Fabrication of High Performance Thin Film
   Composite Polyamide Membranes}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{A practical method is reported to enhance water permeability of thin
   film composite (TFC) polyamide (PA) membranes by decreasing the
   thickness of the selective PA layer. The composite membranes were
   prepared by interfacial polymerization (IP) reaction between
   meta-phenylene diamine (MPD)-aqueous and trimesoyl chloride
   (TMC)-organic solvents at the surface of polyethersulfone (PES)
   microporous support. Several PA TFC membranes were prepared at different
   temperatures of the organic solution ranging from -20 degrees C to 50
   degrees C. The physico-chemical and morphological properties of the
   synthesized membranes were carefully characterized using serval
   analytical techniques. The results confirmed that the TFC membranes,
   synthesized at sub-zero temperatures of organic solution, had thinner
   and smoother PA layer with a greater degree of cross-linking and
   wettability compared to the PA films prepared at 50 degrees C. We
   demonstrated that reducing the temperature of organic solution
   effectively decreased the thickness of the PA active layer and thus
   enhanced water permeation through the membranes. The most water
   permeable membrane was prepared at -20 degrees C and exhibited nine
   times higher water flux compared to the membrane synthesized at room
   temperature. The method proposed in this report can be effectively
   applied for energy-and cost-efficient development of high performance
   nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is widely used for the fabrication of
   advanced semiconductor devices and related nanoscale structures. During
   ALD, large precursor doses (> 1000 L per pulse) are often required to
   achieve surface saturation, of which only a small fraction is utilized
   in film growth while the rest is pumped from the system. Since the metal
   precursor constitutes a significant cost of ALD, strategies to enhance
   precursor utilization are essential for the scaling of ALD processes. In
   the precursor reaction step, precursor physisorption is restricted by
   steric hindrance (m(A1)) from ligands on the precursor molecules. On
   reaction, some of these ligands are removed as by-products resulting in
   chemisorbed species with reduced steric hindrance (m(A1) > m(A2), where
   m(A2) < m(A1)) and some of the initially hindered surface reaction sites
   becoming accessible for further precursor physisorption. To utilize
   these additional reaction sites, we propose a generalized A(x)BA(x)B.
   pulsed deposition where the total precursor dose (Phi(A)) is introduced
   as multiple x (x > 1, x 2 I) short-pulses rather than a single pulse. A
   numerical first-order surface reaction kinetics growth model is
   presented and applied to study the effect of A(x)BA(x)B... pulsed ALD on
   the growth per cycle (GPC). The model calculations predict higher GPC
   for A(x)BA(x)B... pulsing than with ABAB... deposition. In agreement
   with the model predictions, with A(x)BA(x)B... pulsed deposition, the
   GPC was found to increase by similar to 46\% for ZrN plasma enhanced ALD
   (PEALD), similar to 49\% for HfO2 PEALD, and similar to 8\% for thermal
   A1(2)O(3) ALD with respect to conventional ABAB... pulsed growth. (C)

Abstract = {{Here we report on preparation of Eu3+-doped Gd(2)Ti(2)O(7)pyrochlore
   luminescent thin films by pulsed laser deposition technique and their
   structural, morphological and optical characterization. The influence of
   annealing temperature and background gas (air vs. argon) on film
   photoluminescence is examined fort he optimization of post-deposition
   annealing conditions. As-deposited amorphous films become pure
   pyrochlore crystalline after calcination at temperatures higher than
   1000 degrees C. Atomic force microscopy showed increase in the grain
   size from similar to 20 nm in the as-deposited to similar to 60 nm in
   the crystalline sample annealed at 1100 degrees C. Scanning electron
   microscopy showed dense films with the uniform thickness of about 700
   nm. Luminescence spectra of crystalline films were complex and composed
   of better resolved emission lines than in the amorphous sample. Emission
   spectra showed that symmetry of Eu3+ sites become disturbed in annealed
   films due to the extrinsic thermal stress. Films treated in argon
   displayed similar emission and excitation spectral features like
   air-treated ones, but with better resolved emissionlines. Calculated
   quantum efficiency of emission showed that optimization of annealing
   conditions led to an enhancement of films luminescence. The highest
   quantum efficiency of emission and the longestlife time is found for the
   sample annealed at 1100 degrees C in presence of argon. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{In spite of high complete remission rates in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
   (AML), little progress has been made in the long-term survival of
   relapsing AML patients, urging for the development of novel therapies.
   The CXCR4/SDF-1 axis is a potential therapeutic target in AML to reduce
   the enhanced survival and proliferation of leukemic cells, with current
   drug development efforts focusing on antagonists and blocking
   antibodies. The RNAi technology mediated by siRNA is a promising
   alternative; however, further development of clinically relevant siRNA
   carriers is needed since siRNA on its own is an incompetent silencing
   agent. Here, we report on lipid-substituted polymeric carriers for siRNA
   delivery to AML cells, specifically targeting CXCR4. Our results
   demonstrate an effective suppression of CXCR4 protein with the polymeric
   siRNA delivery in AML THP-1 cells. The suppression of CXCR4 as well as
   its ligand, SDF-1 (CXCL12), decreased THP-1 cell numbers due to reduced
   cell proliferation. The reduced proliferation was also observed in the
   presence of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC), suggesting that our
   approach would be effective in the protective bone marrow
   microenvironment. The combination of CXCR4 silencing and cytarabine
   treatment resulted in more effective cytotoxicity when the cells were
   co-incubated with hBMSC. We observed a decrease in the toxicity of the
   lipopolymer/siRNA complexes when THP-1 cells were treated in the
   presence of hBMSC but this effect did not negatively affect CXCR4
   silencing. In addition, siRNA delivery to mononuclear cells derived from
   AML patients led to significant CXCR4 silencing in 2 out of 5 samples,
   providing a proof-of-concept for clinical translation. We conclude that
   decreasing CXCR4 expression via lipopolymer/siRNA complexes is a
   promising option for AML therapy and could provide an effective
   alternative to current CXCR4 inhibition strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Properties of the
   peptide-coated and uncoated TiO2 nanotubular arrays, including hardness,
   elastic modulus, electron work function and photocurrent, were evaluated
   using micromechanical probe, Kelvin Probe and electrochemical system.
   Effect of the peptide on surface conductivity was also investigated
   through current mapping and I-V curve analysis with conductive atomic

Abstract = {{Steam regeneration of polyethylenimine (PEI)-impregnated commercial
   grade silica was investigated in a packed bed reactor. Adsorption was
   performed at 75 degrees C under 10\% CO2/N-2, and desorption was carried
   out under steam at 110 degrees C for 20 consecutive cycles. CO,
   adsorption capacity was found to decrease by 9 mol \% over the period of
   20 cycles. No evident signs of sorbent degradation due to PEI leaching
   or changes in surface morphology and amine functionalities were observed
   upon characterization of the sorbent after the cyclic study. Most of the
   loss in adsorption capacity was associated with thermal degradation of
   the sorbent during drying under N-2 after steam stripping at 110 degrees
   C. The desorption kinetics during steam stripping was found to be much
   faster than during N2 stripping. Over 80\% of the total CO, was released
   within the first 3 min of steam injection into the reactor. A separate
   packed bed study was conducted to investigate the influence of moisture
   content (5.3-14.7 vol \%) in flue gas on the CO, adsorption capacity of
   PEI-impregnated silica. The presence of moisture had a positive impact
   on CO2 uptake of the sorbent; a 4-9 mol \% increase in CO2 uptake was
   observed in comparison to the adsorption under dry conditions. However,
   the presence of moisture increased the heat of regeneration of the
   sorbent significantly. It was calculated that the energy demand
   increased approximately 2-fold on introduction of 14.7\% moisture
   compared to that of dry flue gas.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the extensive fondness of layer-structured materials in
   electronic applications, black phosphorus (BP) has been found in 1960
   having great carrier mobility as well as a fundamental band gap.
   Phosphorene, which is the mono- or few-layer formation of black
   phosphorus, was lately figured out as a 2D layered material with
   inspiring prospective applications in multidisciplinary fields such as
   electronics and optoelectronics. However, there is still a need for
   developing its fundamental properties, sophisticated design schemes, and
   growth techniques. This review highlights the recent evolution in
   phosphorene studies, particularly on the synthesis methods, properties,
   and applications. Additionally, the main challenges relative to
   phosphorene investigations are addressed briefly. The anisotropic
   properties of phosphorene including electronic, mechanical,
   optoelectronic, and thermo-electric arising from its unique puckered
   structure unlike those of graphene and transition-metal dichalcogenides
   (TMD) are deliberated particularly. This review suggests the attractive
   2D material provides wonderful opportunities for novel research works.
   Furthermore, it highlights the synthesis, characterization and
   applications of black phosphorus, including its challenges and future
   outlook. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Title = {{Dynamic higher-order cumulants analysis for state monitoring based on a
   novel lag selection}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{331}},
Pages = {{45-66}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Higher-order cumulants analysis (HCA) is an up-to-date method that
   utilizes higher-order cumulants rather than lower-order statistics
   (e.g., variances) to achieve the state monitoring purpose. Although HCA
   has a strong capability for state monitoring, it still exhibits many
   inadequacies for monitoring dynamic processes. Currently, there are
   various approaches (e.g., dynamic principle component analysis and
   dynamic independent component analysis) that are applicable to dynamic
   features. However, the key step of dynamic state monitoring methods is
   determination of the time lags or the lag structure. Almost all the
   reported dynamic methods select a single number of time lags for all
   variables. This simple selection method may not be appropriate since it
   is generally not possible that all variables have the same lag
   structure. In order to address this issue, a new lag selection method
   for each individual variable is proposed in this study. Hence, two
   dynamic higher-order cumulants analysis (DHCA) approaches are proposed
   for state monitoring, among which one is based on the conventional lag
   selection method and another is based on the new lag selection method
   proposed in this study. The two kinds of DHCA approaches are tested on
   the Tennessee Eastman process, and are demonstrated to be superior to
   all the compared methods. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Assessing Pontine Involvement Using
   Proton MR Spectroscopic Imaging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{Background/Objective
   The underlying mechanism of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) remains
   poorly understood. Our study investigates the involvement of the
   ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), originating in the pontine
   brainstem, in MS patients with symptoms of fatigue.
   Methods
   Female relapsing-remitting MS patients (n = 17) and controls (n = 15)
   underwent a magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging protocol at 1.5T.
   Fatigue was assessed in every subject using the Fatigue Severity Scale
   (FSS). Using an FSS cut-off of 36, patients were categorized into a low
   (n = 9, 22 +/- 10) or high (n = 10, 52 +/- 6) fatigue group. The brain
   metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and total creatine (tCr) were
   measured from sixteen 5x5x10 mm(3) spectroscopic imaging voxels in the
   rostral pons.
   Results
   MS patients with high fatigue had lower NAA/tCr concentration in the
   tegmental pons compared to control subjects. By using NAA and Cr values
   in the cerebellum for comparison, these NAA/tCr changes in the pons were
   driven by higher tCr concentration, and that these changes were focused
   in the WM regions.
   Discussion/Conclusion
   Since there were no changes in NAA concentration, the increase in tCr
   may be suggestive of gliosis, or an imbalanced equilibrium of the
   creatine and phosphocreatine ratio in the pons of relapsing-remitting MS
   patients with fatigue.}},

Abstract = {{A generalized methodology has been developed and successfully applied to
   determine diffusion coefficient of alkane solvent-CO2-heavy oil systems
   with consideration of swelling effect. Theoretically, a one-dimensional
   and one-way mass transfer model incorporating the volume translated
   Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) has been developed to describe
   the mass transfer from alkane solvent-CO2 mixture to heavy oil, which
   accounts for the oil swelling effect resulted from gas dissolution. The
   heavy oil sample has been characterized as three pseudocomponents, while
   the binary interaction parameter (BIP) correlations are tuned with the
   experimentally measured saturation pressures. Both apparent diffusion
   coefficients for gas mixtures and individual diffusion coefficient of
   each component of a mixture are determined once the discrepancy between
   the measured and calculated dynamic swelling factors of heavy oil has
   been minimized. The volume translated PR EOS with the three
   characterized pseudocomponents and the tuned BIP correlations is able to
   accurately predict the phase behavior of alkane solvent-CO2-heavy oil
   systems. Compared to the apparent diffusion coefficient, better
   agreements between the measured and calculated dynamic swelling factors
   have been obtained by use of the individual diffusion coefficients.
   Addition of C3H8 into CO2 stream is found to not only diffuse faster
   into heavy oil than CO2 but also contribute to a larger degree of oil
   swelling, leading to a faster and enhanced swelling effect of C3H8-CO2
   heavy oil system in comparison with the CO2-heavy oil system.}},

   Tensor Surface Model Tract-Specific Analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Previous diffusion tensor imaging tractography studies have demonstrated
   exponential patterns of developmental changes for diffusion parameters
   such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) averaged
   over all voxels in major white matter (WM) tracts of the human brain.
   However, this assumes that the entire tract is changing in unison, which
   may not be the case. In this study, a surface model based tract-specific
   analysis was applied to a cross-sectional cohort of 178 healthy subjects
   (83 males/95 females) aged from 6 to 30 years to spatially characterize
   the age-related changes of FA and MD along the trajectory of seven major
   WM tracts corpus callosum (CC) and six bilateral tracts. There were
   unique patterns of regions that showed different exponential and linear
   rates of increasing FA or decreasing MD and age at which FA or MD levels
   off along each tract. Faster change rate of FA was observed in genu of
   CC and frontal parietal part of superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF).
   Inferior corticospinal tract (CST), posterior regions of association
   tracts such as inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontal
   occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus also displayed earlier
   changing patterns for FA. MD decreases with age also exhibited this
   posterior-to-anterior WM maturation pattern for most tracts in females.
   Both males and females displayed similar FA/MD patterns of change with
   age along most large tracts; however, males had overall reached the FA
   maxima or MD minima later compared with females in most tracts with the
   greater differences occurring in the CST and frontal parietal part of
   SLF for MD. Therefore, brain WM development has spatially varying
   trajectories along tracts that depend on sex and the tract.}},

   or unstructured porous media, accurate measurements of such currents
   remain a challenge. In this study a gigantic amount of streaming current
   was successfully generated and measured using a glass microchannel array
   with special gold sputtered coatings on both its ends. Streaming current
   as high as 0.7 mA was obtained with moderate pressure drop (124 kPa)
   across the glass microchannel array that consists of approximately 11
   250 000 parallel microchannels with radii of 2.5 mu m. Higher streaming
   currents are also possible to generate (scaled to 142 mu A/cm(2) of
   frontal area at a flow rate of 12 cm(3)/s) with potential applications
   in surface charge characterizations and electrokinetic power generation.
   In addition, apparent zeta potential of glass microchannel array surface
   was estimated with the aid of streaming current data and Levine-Olivare
   theories and an apparent zeta potential of -65 mV (0 M KCl, kappa a = 8)
   is reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that polyelectrolyte complexes and coacervates can form
   on mixing oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in aqueous solutions, due
   to mainly electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged
   polymers. Here, we report the first (to the best of our knowledge)
   complexation and coacervation of two positively charged
   polyelectrolytes, which provides a new paradigm for engineering strong,
   self-healing interactions between polyelectrolytes underwater and a new
   marine mussel-inspired underwater adhesion mechanism. Unlike the
   conventional complex coacervate, the like-charged coacervate is
   aggregated by strong short-range cation-p interactions by overcoming
   repulsive electrostatic interactions. The resultant phase of the
   like-charged coacervate comprises a thin and fragile polyelectrolyte
   framework and round and regular pores, implying a strong electrostatic
   correlation among the polyelectrolyte frameworks. The like-charged
   coacervate possesses a very low interfacial tension, which enables this
   highly positively charged coacervate to be applied to capture, carry, or
   encapsulate anionic biomolecules and particles with a broad range of
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The final carbon conversion rate is of critical importance in the
   efficiency of gasifiers. Therefore, comprehensive modeling of char
   particle conversion is of primary interest for designing new gasifiers.
   This work presents a novel intrinsic-based submodel for the gasification
   of a char particle moving in a hot flue gas environment considering CO2
   and H2O as inlet species. The first part of the manuscript describes the
   model and its derivation. Validations against experiments carried out in
   this work for German lignite char are reported in the second part. The
   comparison between submodel predictions and experimental data shows good
   agreement. The importance of char porosity change during gasification is
   demonstrated. The third part presents the results of CFD simulations
   using the new submodel and a surface-based sub model for a generic
   endothermic gasifier. The focus of CFD simulations is to demonstrate the
   crucial role of intrinsic based heterogeneous reactions in the adequate
   prediction of carbon conversion rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Motivation: Many drugs interact with numerous proteins besides their
   intended therapeutic targets and a substantial portion of these
   interactions is yet to be elucidated. Protein-Drug Interaction Database
   (PDID) addresses incompleteness of these data by providing access to
   putative protein-drug interactions that cover the entire structural
   human proteome.
   Results: PDID covers 9652 structures from 3746 proteins and houses 16
   800 putative interactions generated from close to 1.1 million accurate,
   all-atom structure-based predictions for several dozens of popular
   drugs. The predictions were generated with three modern methods: ILbind,
   SMAP and eFindSite. They are accompanied by propensity scores that
   quantify likelihood of interactions and coordinates of the putative
   location of the binding drugs in the corresponding protein structures.
   PDID complements the current databases that focus on the curated
   interactions and the BioDrugScreen database that relies on docking to
   find putative interactions. Moreover, we also include experimentally
   curated interactions which are linked to their sources: DrugBank,
   BindingDB and Protein Data Bank. Our database can be used to facilitate
   studies related to polypharmacology of drugs including repurposing and
   explaining side effects of drugs.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Canada has many isolated communities that are not connected to the
   electrical grid. Most of these communities meet their electricity demand
   through stand-alone diesel generators. Diesel generators have economic
   and environmental concerns that can be minimized by using hybrid
   renewable energy technologies. This study aims to assess the
   implementation of a hybrid energy system for an off-grid community in
   Canada and to propose the best hybrid energy combination to reliably
   satisfy electricity demand. Seven scenarios were developed: 1) 100\%
   renewable resources, 2) 80\% renewable resources, 3) 65\% renewable
   resources, 4) 50\% renewable resources, 5) 35\% renewable resources, 6)
   21\% renewable resources, and 7) battery-diesel generators (0\%
   renewable resources). A case study for the remote community of Sandy
   Lake, Ontario, was conducted. Hybrid systems were chosen to meet the
   requirements of a 4.4 MWh/day primary load with a 772 kW peak load.
   Sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the impact of solar
   radiation, wind speed, diesel price, CO2 penalty cost, and project
   interest rate on optimum results. A GHG (greenhouse gas) abatement cost
   was assessed for each scenario. Considering GHG emission penalty cost,
   the costs of electricity for the seven scenarios are \$1.48/kWh,
   \$0.62/kWh, \$0.54/kWh, \$0.42/kWh, \$0.39/kWh, \$0.37/kWh, and

Abstract = {{Traditional multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM)
   approaches aim at detecting deviations from the routine operating
   condition. However, if the process remains well controlled by feedback
   controllers in spite of some deviations, alarms triggered in this
   context become no longer necessary. In this regard, slow feature
   analysis (SFA) has been recently applied to MSPM tasks by Shang et al.
   (2015), which allows for seperate distributions of both nominal
   operating points and dynamic behaviors. Since a poor control performance
   is always characterized by dynamics anomalies, one can discriminate
   nominal operating deviations with acceptable control performance, from
   real faults that deserve more attentions, according to the temporal
   dynamics of processes. In this work, we propose a new process monitoring
   scheme based upon probabilistic SFA (PSFA). Compared to deterministic
   SFA, its probabilistic extension takes the measurement noise into
   considerations and allows for missing data imputation conveniently,
   which is beneficial for process monitoring. Apart from generic T-2 and
   SPE metrics for monitoring the operating point, a novel S-2 statistics
   is considered for exclusively monitoring temporal behaviors of
   processes. Two case studies are provided to show the efficacy of the
   proposed monitoring approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To estimate the fraction of the exhaled airflow that is re-inhaled
   during normal nasal breathing, experiments were carried out in a water
   tank with an anatomically accurate respiratory tract model of a 4
   year-old child. The velocity of respiratory flow was scaled using
   similarity laws between air and water. Breath simulation was performed
   via a computer-controlled piston-cylinder system. Food-dye visualization
   allows a qualitative analysis of the re-inhaled fraction of this exhaled
   flow. For the quantitative analysis, neutrally buoyant particles were
   added to the water medium, and illuminated by the laser which
   illuminates the whole breathing region of the respiratory model, such
   that the trajectory and quantity of the re-inhaled particles can be
   recorded and counted. The experimental results in the pediatric airway
   replica show that a negligible fraction (<0.06\%) of the exhaled airflow
   is re-inhaled during normal nasal breathing in the absence of the rising
   thermal plume. The artificial plume generated by a heated aluminium
   brick at the tank bottom increases the re-inhalation ratio by 4 times
   under the investigated case (albeit still at a very low value of
   0.15\%). Our results thus reveal that during normal nasal breathing in
   the present pediatric subject, the vast majority of human exhaled
   airflow escapes from the inhalation zone and is not re-inhaled. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Purpose: Freezing of gait is a major source of disability associated
   with the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Our objective was to
   determine whether evolving changes in nigral iron content in association
   with declining motor function in early PD differentiates subjects who
   develop freezing from those who do not.
   Methods: A cohort of previously untreated individuals with early PD (n =
   19) was followed for 36 months clinically and with MRI. The cohort was
   divided into two groups based on the development of freezing during
   follow-up. A multiple gradient echo MRI sequence provided an index of
   basal ganglia iron content.
   Results: There were significant baseline differences between those who
   developed freezing (n = 7) and those who did not (n = 12) in Unified
   Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores, time to complete a 14 m
   walk and timed up and go. There was a significant correlation between
   the measured change in transverse relaxation in the lateral substantia
   nigra pars compacta and the change in motor score from baseline to 36
   months (p = 0.002). The freezing group showed a greater change in motor
   score and iron content than did the non-freezing group.
   Conclusions: Individuals destined to develop freezing early in PD have
   more motor impairment at baseline, more rapid deterioration in motor
   function, and pars compacta changes suggestive of increased iron content
   in comparison to those who do not. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{A biocidal coating was developed in order to reduce biofouling on a
   reverse osmosis (RO) membrane using a quaternary ammonium (QA)
   functionalized polymer. The synthesis of a series of polysulfone (PS)
   ionomers with QA groups is described, and a method for spraying these QA
   ionomers as an alcoholic solution, which dried into water insoluble
   coatings. Contact angle and streaming potential were used to analyze the
   coating's hydrophilicity and surface charge. Both PS-QA1 and the
   commercial RO membrane had an apparent contact angle of 68 degrees that
   increased to 126 degrees for PS-QA12 corresponding to alkyl chain
   length. A negatively charged particle-probe was used to measure coated
   and uncoated RO membrane interaction forces. Measured interaction forces
   correlated strongly with the length of alkyl chains or hydrophobicity of
   the coated surfaces. Uncoated RO membranes and ones coated with PS-QA
   were exposed to suspensions of Escherichia coli cells. All four PS-QA
   coatings showed significant biotoxicity and killed 100\% of the E. coli
   cells, but uncoated RO membranes had metabolically active biofilms.
   However, coatings tested in a RO crossflow system showed a flux
   reduction that is attributed to mass transfer resistance due to
   excessively thick films. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   were developed to comparatively study the impacts of different unit
   operations on water demand. The lowest life cycle water consumption
   coefficient of 0.12 L/kW his for the pathway of conventional gas with
   combined cycle technology, and dry cooling. The highest life cycle
   consumption coefficient of 2.57 L/kW his for a pathway of shale gas
   utilization through steam cycle technology and cooling tower systems.
   The water consumption coefficient for the complete life cycle of
   cogeneration technology is in the range 0.07-0.39 L/kW h and for

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In ``traditional{''} rough set methodologies, data are assumed to be
   stored in a single data repository. However, this assumption is not
   always true in many real-world problems, where data may be distributed
   across multiple locations, which is especially pertinent with the
   development of the Internet. To cope with this phenomenon, in this paper
   we extend the methodology of rough sets to distributed decision
   information systems. We first present a definition of rough sets in
   distributed decision information systems. Then we study the reducibility
   of distributed decision information systems at two different levels of
   granularity. The conditions for a decision information table or an
   attribute in distributed decision information systems to be reducible
   are presented, and an approach to compute reducts of a distributed
   decision information system is developed. The experimental results show
   that the proposed approach can be used to simplify distributed decision
   information systems, while retain their classification abilities. (C)

Abstract = {{Europium (III)-doped (YxSc1-x)(2)O-3 nanocrystalline powders of
   different compositions (x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1) are synthesized
   using a polymer complex solution method. Comparative structural and
   optical characterization is carried out with powder X-ray diffraction
   and photoluminescence excitation, emission and emission decay
   measurements. Detailed information about unit cell parameter and energy
   levels of europium (III) ions are presented for all powder compositions.
   The second rank crystal field parameters (B-0(2)) and (B-2(2)) and
   crystal field strength (N-v) are calculated from the energies of Stark
   components of the F-7(1) manifold of the europium (III) emissions. It
   has been shown that the crystal field parameter changes with the powder
   composition and shows a linear relationship with the average ionic radii
   of cations in the solid solutions. A similar dependence is also found
   for the magnitude of splitting of F-7(1) manifold vs. unit cell
   parameter values. Moreover, this linear relationship is demonstrated for
   the whole family of europium (III)-doped mixed rare-earth sesquioxide
   hosts (RR'O-3; R, R'=rare earth ions) by taking into consideration
   results published in the literature so far. A simple, semi-empirical
   equation which relates structural properties (unit cell parameters,
   ionic radii) of the sesquioxide host material and the emission
   properties of europium (III) ions (energy splitting of the F-7(1)
   manifold, crystal field parameters and crystal field strength) are
   presented. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd and Techna

   into polyethersulfone (PES) casting solution to form an ITO doped phase
   inversion PES membrane was studied. The experimental results showed that
   the incorporation of ITO NPs into the PES matrix improved thermal and
   electrical properties of the resulting hybrid membrane. The PES/ITO
   nanocomposite membrane demonstrated an enhanced antifouling propensity
   without any loss in separation efficiency compared to unmodified PES
   membrane. The combination of ITO NPs and the polymeric membranes
   provides a pathway to develop antifouling membranes with a higher
   thermal tolerance and tunable electrical characteristics. The prepared
   nanocomposite membranes can alter their characteristics based on
   external stimuli such as electric fields which might open up novel
   applications for different separation processes by membranes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the effect of water and fine solids
   on coke formation during thermal cracking of a residue fraction from
   vacuum distillation (Athabasca vacuum tower bottoms) and Athabasca
   bitumen froth. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor with 0-33.3
   wt.\% water at 410 degrees C for up to 80 min to measure the time of
   onset of coke formation, total coke yield as a function of time, and
   conversion of vacuum residue. Removal of fine solids significantly
   shortened the onset time of coke formation, but the addition of water
   had no significant impact on onset time. The yield of cracked products,
   as determined by simulated distillation, was insensitive to the presence
   of water and fine solids. Based on the findings from this study, it was
   concluded that residual fine solids have a beneficial effect on thermal
   upgrading as they delayed the onset of coke formation, while water has
   little impact within the tested concentration range of 0-33 wt.\% water.

   increases with the electron work function. However, if the electron work

Abstract = {{Evanescent electromagnetic waves possess spin-momentum locking, where
   the direction of propagation (momentum) is locked to the inherent
   polarization of the wave (transverse spin). We study the optical forces
   arising from this universal phenomenon and show that the fundamental
   origin of recently reported non-trivial optical chiral forces is
   spin-momentum locking. For evanescent waves, we show that the direction
   of energy flow, the direction of decay, and the direction of spin follow
   a right hand rule for three different cases of total internal
   reflection, surface plasmon polaritons, and HE11 mode of an optical
   fiber. Furthermore, we explain how the recently reported phenomena of
   lateral optical force on chiral and achiral particles are caused by the
   transverse spin of the evanescent field and the spin-momentum locking
   phenomenon. Finally, we propose an experiment to identify the unique
   lateral forces arising from the transverse spin in the optical fiber and
   point to fundamental differences of the spin density from the well-known
   orbital angular momentum of light. Our work presents a unified view on
   spin-momentum locking and how it affects optical forces on chiral and
   achiral particles. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Even nanomechanical modes transduced by integrated photonics}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 8}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate the actuation and detection of even flexural vibrational
   modes of a doubly clamped nanomechanical resonator using an integrated
   photonics transduction scheme. The doubly clamped beam is formed by
   releasing a straight section of an optical racetrack resonator from the
   underlying silicon dioxide layer, and a step is fabricated in the
   substrate beneath the beam. The step causes uneven force and
   responsivity distribution along the device length, permitting excitation
   and detection of even modes of vibration. This is achieved while
   retaining transduction capability for odd modes. The devices are
   actuated via optical force applied with a pump laser. The displacement
   sensitivities of the first through third modes, as obtained from the
   thermomechanical noise floor, are 228 fm Hz(-1/2), 153 fm Hz(-1/2), and
   112 fm Hz(-1/2), respectively. The excitation efficiency for these modes
   is compared and modeled based on integration of the uneven forces over
   the mode shapes. While the excitation efficiency for the first three
   modes is approximately the same when the step occurs at about 38\% of
   the beam length, the ability to tune the modal efficiency of
   transduction by choosing the step position is discussed. The overall
   optical force on each mode is approximately 0.4 pN mu m(-1) mW(-1), for
   an applied optical power of 0.07 mW. We show a potential application
   that uses the resonant frequencies of the first two vibrational modes of
   a buckled beam to measure the stress in the silicon device layer,
   estimated to be 106 MPa. We anticipate that the observation of the
   second mode of vibration using our integrated photonics approach will be
   useful in future mass sensing experiments.}},

Abstract = {{UV-vis absorption spectrometry and DFT calculations were used to study
   the selective binding of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole derivatives (MBI, EMBI,
   PMBI and BMBI) as chelating collectors with metal ions, including Fe3+,
   Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ and Ag+ The results showed superior selectivity of
   these collectors towards Ag+ as compared with the other metal ions. The
   binding stoichiometry of MBI derivatives with Ag+ was found by Job-plot
   method to be 1:1. The binding constant determined using
   Benesi-Hildebrand (B-H) method showed the following order of BMBI-Ag >
   PMBI-Ag > EMBI-Ag > MBI-Ag. The binding energies of MBI derivatives with
   Ag+ calculated by DFT method followed the same order as the binding
   constant calculated by B-H method. All the calculation results were in
   good agreement with the results of UV-vis experiments which showed the
   highest selectivity and binding energies of BMBI towards Ag+ This study
   clearly shows that the BMBI is a good sensor for Ag+ ion. Therefore, the
   BMBI could be a highly selective and efficient collector to enhance the
   recovery of silver from silver-rich lead-zinc sulfide minerals. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The uncertainty set-induced robust optimization framework has received
   considerable attention in the past decades. It has been extensively
   studied in literature and applied to address various decision-making
   problems. However, existing robust optimization methods generally assume
   that the uncertain parameters are independent. As a result, the
   traditional robust optimization methods may lead to a conservative
   solution in practice when correlations between uncertain parameters
   exist. In this work, we present novel results on robust optimization
   under correlated uncertainties that appear in a single constraint.
   Robust counterpart optimization formulations are derived based on
   various types of uncertain sets. Numerical and application examples are
   studied to compare the performance of robust optimization by
   incorporating various levels of correlation. The results demonstrate
   that incorporating more accurate correlation into the robust
   optimization formulation can lead to less conservative robust solution.

Abstract = {{Displacement of heavy-oil by gas at elevated temperatures and residual
   oil saturation (S-or) development on the walls of a square capillary
   were investigated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The
   displacements were carried out at 55 and 85 degrees C and compared to
   experimental data showing good quantitative and qualitatively agreement.
   On the basis of these results, the behavior of S-or was explored at 200
   degrees C, a typical temperature of thermal oil recovery (steam
   injection) applications. It is shown that S-or decreases at higher
   temperatures for a fixed air injection velocity. This numerical study
   suggests that the S diminishes exponentially with time until it reaches
   a constant value along the square capillary during the displacements. It
   also indicates that when the contact angle is increased, the retention
   of oil decreases lineally. Above 60 degrees, oil is completely swept at
   85 degrees C and 200 degrees C.
   This is the first attempt with CFD to analyze the retention of oil in
   the pores of a reservoir after the application of thermal methods. CFD
   approach to model this microscopic phenomenon is promising to carry out
   further research at temperature and pressure conditions that are very
   difficult to generate at the microscopic scale in laboratory
   experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of bacteriophages (phages) onto host cells is, in all but
   a few rare cases, a sine qua non condition for the onset of the

   involved in recognition and adsorption and their interactions during

   phage ecology and the development of phage-based technologies. To assist

   instead of transmission loss (s(21)), which is measurable using THz

Abstract = {{In order to promote the acceptance of cell-based toxicity testings, the
   accuracy of cytotoxicity test must be determined when compared to in
   vivo results. Traditional methods of cytotoxicity analysis, such as LC50
   (concentration where 50\% of the cells are killed) can be problematic
   since they have been found to vary with time. Technological advances in
   cytotoxicity testing make it easy to record the dynamic data on changes
   in cell proliferation, morphology, and damage. To effectively and
   reasonably analyze the dynamic data, we present a new in vitro toxicity
   assessed method using the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) which
   maps the measured cell index from the time domain to the frequency
   domain. The direct current (DC) component of the DTFT is extracted as a
   feature which reflects the intensity of cytotoxicity. The smaller the
   value, the higher the cytotoxicity. Then, a novel toxicity index, as
   expressed in terms of DC50, is calculated. Results generated with
   selected test chemicals are compared favorably with data obtained from
   The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative
   Method (ICCVAM) report concerning the prediction of acute systemic
   toxicity in rodents. The method can be applied with the standard and
   high throughput to estimate acute rodent oral toxicity which reduces the
   number of animals required in subsequent pharmacological/toxicological

Abstract = {{Background: A previous PET-CT imaging study of 14 bronchoconstricted
   asthmatic subjects showed that peripheral aerosol deposition was highly
   variable among subjects and lobes. The aim of this work was to identify
   and quantify factors responsible for this variability. Methods: A
   theoretical framework was formulated to integrate four factors affecting
   aerosol deposition: differences in ventilation, in how air vs. aerosol
   distribute at each bifurcation, in the fraction of aerosol escaping
   feeding airways, and in the fraction of aerosol reaching the periphery
   that is exhaled. These factors were quantified in 12 of the subjects
   using PET-CT measurements of relative specific deposition sD{*},
   relative specific ventilation sV{*} (measured with dynamic PET or
   estimated as change in expansion between two static HRCTs), average
   lobar expansion F-VOL, and breathing frequency measured during aerosol
   inhalation f(N). Results: The fraction of the variance of sD{*}
   explained by sV{*} (0.38), by bifurcation effects (0.38), and by
   differences in deposition along feeding airways (0.31) were similar in
   magnitude. We could not directly estimate the contribution of aerosol
   that was exhaled. Differences in expansion did not explain any fraction
   of the variability in sD{*} among lobes. The dependence of sD{*} on
   sV{*} was high in subjects breathing with low f(N), but weakened among
   those breathing faster. Finally, sD{*}/sV{*} showed positive dependence
   on F-VOL among low f(N) subjects, while the dependence was negative
   among high f(N) subjects. Conclusion: The theoretical framework allowed
   us to analyze experimentally measured aerosol deposition imaging data.
   When considering bronchoconstricted asthmatic subjects, a dynamic
   measurement of ventilation is required to evaluate its effect on aerosol
   transport. The mechanisms behind the identified effects of f(N) and
   F-VOL on aerosol deposition need further study and may have important
   implications for aerosol therapy in subjects with heterogeneous
   ventilation.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of metallic coatings on elastomeric polymers is a challenging
   task due to the heat sensitivity and soft nature of these materials and
   the high temperatures in thermal spraying processes. In this study, a
   flame spraying process was employed to deposit conductive coatings of
   aluminum-12silicon on polyurethane elastomers. The effect of process
   parameters, i.e., stand-off distance and air added to the flame spray
   torch, on temperature distribution and corresponding effects on coating
   characteristics, including electrical resistivity, were investigated. An
   analytical model based on a Green's function approach was employed to
   determine the temperature distribution within the substrate. It was
   found that the coating porosity and electrical resistance decreased by
   increasing the pressure of the air injected into the flame spray torch
   during deposition. The latter also allowed for a reduction of the
   stand-off distance of the flame spray torch. Dynamic mechanical analysis
   was performed to investigate the effect of the increase in temperature
   within the substrate on its dynamic mechanical properties. It was found
   that the spraying process did not significantly change the storage
   modulus of the polyurethane substrate material.}},

Title = {{Determination of Individual Diffusion Coefficients of Solvent/CO2
   Mixture in Heavy Oil With Pressure-Decay Method}},

Abstract = {{A novel methodology was developed to determine the molecular-diffusion
   coefficient for each component of the solvent/CO2 mixture in heavy oil
   under reservoir conditions on the basis of the pressure-decay theory.
   Experimentally, molecular-diffusion tests for the solvent/CO2/heavy-oil
   systems (i.e., pure-CO2/heavy-oil system, C3H8/CO2/heavy-oil system, and
   n-C4H10/CO2/heavy-oil system) are performed with a DBR
   pressure/volume/temperature system at constant temperature and decayed
   pressure. Theoretically, the Peng-Robinson equation of state combined
   with a 1D diffusion model is developed to describe the diffusion process
   of solvent/CO2 mixture in heavy oil. The composition analysis in the
   beginning and the end of pressure-decay experiments for the
   solvent/CO2/heavy-oil system indicate that the gas-phase solvent
   fraction decreases as diffusion proceeds, whereas the gas-phase CO2
   fraction increases during the tests. One can determine the individual
   molecular-diffusion coefficient for each component in the mixture by
   minimizing the discrepancy between the measured composition change and
   the calculated composition change with the diffusion model. The newly
   developed methodology is successfully validated with the diffusion tests
   on the two solvent/CO2 mixtures: C3H8/CO2/heavy-oil system and
   n-C4H10/CO2/heavyoil system. As for the solvent/CO2 mixtures tested, the
   molecular-diffusion coefficient of solvent in heavy oil is found to be
   significantly larger than that of CO2 in heavy oil. At similar test
   conditions, the C3H8/CO2/heavy-oil system ends up with a swelling factor
   of 1.058 after 168 hours of diffusion test, in comparison to 1.031 for
   the CO2/heavy-oil system.}},

Abstract = {{As observed in many shale-gas operations, salt concentration of flowback
   water increases with time. Usually, the shape of
   salt-concentration/load-recovery plots is different from one well to
   another. We hypothesize that the shape of the salinity profile during
   the flowback process provides useful information about the complexity of
   the fracture network. In this study, we propose a model to describe the
   relationship between salinity and cumulative water production. We also
   compare the model results and flowback-salinity data to characterize the
   fracture network.
   Flowback-salinity data are collected from three multifractured
   horizontal wells completed in the three shale members {[}Muskwa (Mu),
   Otter-Park (OP), and Evie (Ev)] of the Horn River Basin. The salinity
   profiles for the Mu and OP wells initially increase and finally reach a
   plateau, whereas the salinity profile for the Ev well shows a continuous
   increase and does not show a plateau. We hypothesize that the early
   water with lower salt concentration at the onset of the flowback process
   is mainly produced from the primary fractures with larger aperture size.
   Also, we believe that the fractures with smaller aperture size become
   more important as the flowback process progresses, and therefore, the
   high-salinity water produced at later times is mainly produced from
   secondary fractures. We also propose a model to describe the
   salinity-profile behaviors. The model presents the aperture-size
   distribution (ASD) of the fracture network. A comparative analysis of
   the model results and the flowback-salinity data indicates that the Ev
   well with a steady increase in its salinity profile has a wider ASD
   compared with the Mu and OP wells with a plateau in their salinity
   profiles. This suggests that the fracture network is more complex in Ev
   compared with those in Mu and OP. More-complex fracture network in Ev is
   also in agreement with its higher gas and lower water recovery during
   the flowback process as opposed to the lower gas and higher water
   recovery in Mu and OP.
   The presented model for describing the behavior of the salinity profile
   during the flowback process and its meaningful relationship to the
   fracture-network complexity provide an alternative approach for
   reservoir characterization. This study encourages the industry to manage
   the flowback operations carefully and to monitor the water chemistry.}},

   properties with temperature. The displacement of heavy oil by water or
   gas was accelerated under a positive temperature gradient, including the
   spontaneous imbibition of water. Relative permeability curves were
   greatly affected by temperature gradient and showed significant changes
   compared with the curves at constant temperature. Clarifications were

Abstract = {{We propose and investigate an electrical-to-optical clock multiplier,
   based on a bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG)
   magnetoplasmonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Transient magnetic
   fields induce a precession of the magnetization vector of the Bi: YIG,
   which in turn modulates the nonreciprocal phase shift in the MZI arms,
   and hence the intensity at the output port. We show that the device is
   capable of modulation depth of 16.26 dB and has a tunable output
   frequency between 279.9MHz and 5.6GHz. Correspondingly, the input
   electrical modulation frequency can be multiplied by factors of up to
   2.1 x 10(3) in the optical signal. Such a device is envisioned as a
   critical component in the development of hybrid electrical-optical
   circuitry. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes the measurement of complex permittivity (or
   dielectric constant) of powders (water insoluble), solutions, and
   suspensions using a parallel-plate capacitor cell. An impedance analyzer
   measures the cell's impedance at radio frequencies used in nuclear
   magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging (10-300 MHz) through
   an appropriate test fixture. The cell's impedance is fitted to an
   equivalent circuit using a Matlab script or other software, and the
   permittivity of the material is extracted after calibration with known
   materials. The permittivity of the solid material is obtained from that
   of the powder suspension using known mixing rules. Measurements for most
   materials tested are in agreement with those obtained using standard
   coaxial probes. Some discrepancies are observed for loose powders
   because of the difficulty of controlling the amount of packing. For
   high-permittivity materials or conductive solutions an enhanced
   equivalent circuit has been found that characterizes the cell's behavior

Abstract = {{The analysis of the enclosure's shielding effectiveness (SE) is an
   important work in the electronic device's electromagnetic compatibility
   problem. Almost all devices cannot work without connected accessory
   including cables and electronic connectors. Except for apertures and
   seams on the enclosure, the connected accessory is also a leakage path
   for electromagnetic power. For the SE problem of enclosure with
   connected accessory, a hybrid numerical analysis method of the partial
   element equivalent circuit (PEEC) and the method of moment (MoM) are
   proposed. PEEC is used to model the connected accessory. Based on energy
   conservation, the cable-connector is replaced by an equivalent dipole
   that has similar electromagnetic radiation properties. The equivalent
   dipole is added to the model of enclosure, which is analyzed by the MoM.
   Two experiments are presented to verify the proposed hybrid approach.
   The test results are in good agreement with the simulated results. This
   hybrid method not only could be used to calculate the SE of the
   cable-enclosure system, but also has the potentiality to apply to the
   signal integrity of printed circuit boards in enclosures.}},

Abstract = {{The hydro-transportation process used to obtain bitumen from the Alberta
   oil sands produces large volume of basal depressurization water (BDW),
   which contains high salt concentrations. In this research, thin-film
   nanocomposite (TFN) membrane technology applied to treat BDW in
   lab-scale, and evaluated water properties before and after the
   treatment. The average rejection ratios of ionic species were 95.2\% and
   92.8\% by TFN membrane (with ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs)) and
   thin-film composite (TFC) (without OMCs) membrane, respectively. The
   turbidity and total dissolved solids (TDS) were completely rejected in
   all treatment conditions. Interestingly, the water flux of TFN membrane
   was dramatically increased compared to TFC membrane. The increase of
   water flux was believed to be caused by the increased membrane surface
   hydrophilicity and nano-pore effects by the OMCs.}},

   filters}},

Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Stochastic computing utilizes compact arithmetic circuits that can
   potentially lower the implementation cost in silicon area. In addition,
   stochastic computing provides inherent fault tolerance at the cost of a
   less efficient signal encoding. Finite impulse response (FIR) filters
   are key elements in digital signal processing (DSP) due to their linear
   phase-frequency response. In this article, we consider the problem of
   implementing FIR filters using the stochastic approach. Novel stochastic
   FIR filter designs based on multiplexers are proposed and compared to
   conventional binary designs implemented using Synopsys tools with a
   28-nm cell library. Silicon area, power and maximum clock frequency are
   obtained to evaluate the throughput per area (TPA) and the energy per
   operation (EPO). For equivalent filtering performance, the stochastic
   FIR filters underperform in terms of TPA and EPO compared to the
   conventional binary design, although the stochastic design shows more
   graceful degradation in performance with a significant reduction in
   energy consumption. A detailed analysis is performed to evaluate the
   accuracy of stochastic FIR filters and to determine the required
   stochastic sequence length. The fault-tolerance of the stochastic design
   is compared with that of the binary circuit enhanced with triple modular
   redundancy (TMR). The stochastic designs are more reliable than the
   conventional binary design and its TMR implementation with unreliable
   voters, but they are less reliable than the binary TMR implementation
   when the voters are fault-free. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biogenic production of coalbed methane under anaerobic conditions occurs
   through a large number of reactions involving a community of
   micro-organisms. We propose a kinetic scheme for this complicated
   reaction network using lumped species reacting in a series of enzymatic
   reaction blocks consisting of coal solubilization, hydrolysis,
   acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. Among these pathways,
   acetoclastic methanogenesis is assumed to be dominant. Based on
   implications from experimental data, tryptone (a nitrogen rich nutrient
   used in the stimulation of methane production) is assumed to produce
   aromatic ring intermediates. Coal solubilization is described by a
   diffusion layer model. Monod kinetics are applied to model the enzymatic
   reaction rates, but the rate of methanogenesis is modeled, with modified
   Monod kinetics to account for substrate inhibition. An analytical
   solution to the model is derived and its parametric sensitivity is
   investigated in different operating regions. Model parameters are
   estimated from data from various anaerobic bottle experiments conducted
   by us using nonlinear regression with the particle swarm optimization
   algorithm, and the model's predictive ability has been validated for
   various coal samples from the literature, too. The predictive kinetic
   model thus established provides estimates of the concentration of
   products as well as intermediate species in the conversion of coal. The
   model can be used to optimize biogenic methane production from coal at
   different scales ranging from coreflooding experiments to the reservoir
   and field scales.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Mixtures of polystyrene + Maya and Athabasca pentane asphaltene +
   toluene split into two stable phases, one toluene + polymer rich and one
   toluene + asphaltene rich. This phase behavior was attributed to
   depletion flocculation, previously, and a Fleer-Tuinier based model was
   used to simulate the phase diagrams including one-phase to two-phase
   boundaries, tie lines, critical points, and relative phase volumes in
   the two-phase region. The distribution of asphaltenes between molecular
   and aggregated species and the variation of the mean size and size
   distribution of aggregated asphaltene species with global composition
   are not known a priori. This knowledge gap presents a key conceptual
   challenge. Consequently, the variation of the fraction of asphaltenes
   participating in the depletion flocculation mechanism, gamma(eta), and
   variation of asphaltene mean size R-s(eta) with asphaltene volume
   fraction, eta, are fitted parameters introduced in the phase behavior
   model. In this work, the phase behavior modeling approach is presented
   and illustrated, and the joint conformance of R-s(eta) and gamma(eta)
   with trends anticipated by the well-known Ostwald-Freundlich equation
   for solute solubility with solute particle size is demonstrated for both
   Maya and Athabasca pentane asphaltenes. With this conformance, the
   behavior of asphaltenes in toluene is shown to be consistent with the
   behavior of a temperature invariant distribution of solid, spherical,
   colloids where the mean size varies with asphaltene volume fraction,
   eta. Furthermore, the correlations gamma(eta) and R-s(eta) are validated
   with measured differential enthalpies of solution for asphaltenes in
   toluene. These outcomes provide additional theoretical underpinnings for
   a phase behavior modeling approach that may lead to the development of
   predictive models for asphaltene + polystyrene + toluene and analogous
   mixtures as additional phase behavior data become available.}},

Abstract = {{We conduct spontaneous imbibition experiments using different fluids
   (deionized, DI, water and brines) and different media (unwashed and
   washed shale powder) to study the wetting behavior of the shale samples
   from the Horn River Basin (HRB), a massive unconventional gas play in
   the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. As expected, unwashed shale
   powder imbibes DI water faster than brine. Surprisingly, washing the
   powders results in faster imbibition of DI water. The imbibition of DI
   water into washed shale powders, which have a reduced soluble/leachable
   ion content, cannot be fully explained by osmotic effects. We explain
   the observed imbibition profiles using the electrostatic interaction
   theory. We measure the ion concentration of the brines by ICP-MS
   analysis and determine the ionic strength, I, of the in situ formed
   brine. We also calculate the characteristic thickness of electrostatic
   double layer, kappa(-1), formed around the surface of charged shale
   powders. The results indicate that the imbibition rate depends on the
   kappa(-1)value of the in situ formed brine. Electrostatic interaction is
   part of the disjoining pressure which is not considered in the
   Young-Laplace equation. A higher kappa(-1) value enlarges the
   electrostatic interaction range, which results in formation of a thicker
   hydration shell around the surface of the shale powder and increases the
   imbibition rate.}},

   specificity of manufacturing processes. When forming information
   granules on a basis of experimental data, we propose to deal with the
   unequal-length temporal granules by exploiting dynamic time warping,
   which becomes instrumental to the realization of the prediction model.
   The model engages the fuzzy C-means clustering method. To quantify the
   performance of the proposed method, real-world industrial energy data
   coming from a steel plant in China are employed. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to some other
   data-driven methods and becomes capable of satisfying the requirements
   of the practically viable prediction.}},

Abstract = {{This study elaborates on a comprehensive design methodology of fuzzy
   cognitive maps (FCMs). Here, the maps are regarded as a modeling vehicle
   of time series. It is apparent that whereas time series are
   predominantly numeric, FCMs are abstract constructs operating at the
   level of abstract entities referred to as concepts and represented by
   the individual nodes of the map. We introduce a mechanism to represent a
   numeric time series in terms of information granules constructed in the
   space of amplitude and change of amplitude of the time series, which, in
   turn, gives rise to a collection of concepts forming the corresponding
   nodes of the FCMs. Each information granule is mapped onto a node
   (concept) of the map. We identify two fundamental design phases of FCMs,
   namely 1) formation of information granules mapping numeric data (time
   series) into activation levels of information granules (viz., the nodes
   of the map), and 2) optimization of information granules at the
   parametric level, viz., learning (estimating) the weights between the
   nodes of the map. The learning is typically realized in a supervised
   mode on a basis of some experimental data. A construction of information
   granules is realized with the aid of fuzzy clustering, namely fuzzy
   C-means. The optimization is realized with the use of particle swarm
   optimization. The proposed approach is illustrated in detail by a series
   of experiments using a collection of publicly available data.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Wide-bandgap, metal-oxide thin-film transistors have been limited to
   low-power, n-type electronic applications because of the unipolar nature
   of these devices. Variations from the n-type field-effect transistor
   architecture have not been widely investigated as a result of the lack
   of available p-type wide-bandgap inorganic semiconductors. Here, we
   present a wide-bandgap metal-oxide n-type semiconductor that is able to
   sustain a strong p-type inversion layer using a high-dielectric-constant
   barrier dielectric when sourced with a heterogeneous p-type material. A
   demonstration of the utility of the inversion layer was also
   investigated and utilized as the controlling element in a unique
   tunnelling junction transistor. The resulting electrical performance of
   this prototype device exhibited among the highest reported current,
   power and transconductance densities. Further utilization of the p-type
   inversion layer is critical to unlocking the previously unexplored
   capability of metal-oxide thin-film transistors, such applications with
   next-generation display switches, sensors, radio frequency circuits and

Title = {{Evaluation of the hemocompatibility and rapid hemostasis of (RADA)(4)
   peptide-based hydrogels}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{71-79}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{(RADA)(4) peptides are promising biomaterials due to their high degree
   of hydration (<99.5\% (w/v)), programmability at the molecular level,
   and their subsequent potential to respond to external stimuli.
   Interestingly, these peptides have also demonstrated the ability to
   cause rapid (similar to 15 s) hemostasis when applied directly to
   wounds. General hemocompatibility of (RADA)(4) nanofibers was
   investigated systematically using clot formation kinetics, C3a
   generation, and platelet activation (morphology and CD62P) studies.
   (RADA)(4) nanofibers caused a rapid clot formation, but yielded a low
   platelet activation and low C3a activation. The study suggests that the
   rapid hemostasis observed when these materials are employed results
   principally from humoral coagulation, despite these materials having a
   net neutral charge and high hydration at physiological conditions. The
   observed rapid hemostasis may be induced due to the available nanofiber
   surface area within the hydrogel construct. In conclusion, our
   experiments strongly support further development of (RADA)(4) peptide
   based biomaterials.
   Statement of Significance
   Biomedicine based applications of (RADA)(4) peptides are being
   extensively studied for the purpose of improving drug carriers, and 3D
   peptide nanofiber scaffolds. However, this peptide's biocompatibility
   has not been investigated till now. One particular study has reported a
   revolutionary and very desirable ability of (RADA)(4) peptide to achieve
   complete and rapid hemostasis, nevertheless, the literature remains
   inconclusive on the underlying molecular mechanism. In this manuscript
   we bridge these two main knowledge gaps by providing the much needed
   systematic biocompatibility analysis (morphology analysis, platelet and
   C3a activation) of the (RADA)(4) based hydrogels, and also investigate
   the underlying hemostatic mechanism of this peptide-induced hemostasis.
   Our work not only provides the much needed biocompatibility of the
   peptide for applicative research, but also explores the molecular
   mechanism of hemostasis, which will help us design novel biomaterials to
   achieve hemostasis. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel design of circularly polarized antenna based on
   Koch fractal geometry is presented and experimentally investigated.
   Circular polarization and size reduction are achieved by placing two
   asymmetric Koch fractal geometries on x- and y-planes of the
   single-probe-feed square radiator. Further, to tune resonant frequency
   around the 911-MHz, four arrow-shaped slots are inserted in diagonal
   axes of the square radiator. It is perceived that compact size of the
   antenna can be achieved by increasing the overall size of the
   arrow-shaped slots and indentation angles of Koch fractal geometry. The
   antenna is fabricated on FR4 substrate with a size of 54 x 54 x 1.6
   mm(3) (0.162 lambda(0) x 0.162 lambda(0) x 0.0048 lambda(0) at 900 MHz)
   and tested to validate the proposed design. The 3-dB axial-ratio
   bandwidth and impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna design are
   found to be 8 MHz (907.0-915 MHz) and 37.0 MHz (891.0-928.0 MHz),
   respectively. The measured results confirm that the proposed design
   covers US radio-frequency identification (RFID) band (902-928 MHz) and
   can be used for RFID short-range reading applications.}},

Abstract = {{A new proton-conducting ethane fuel cell (PC-EFC) anode material
   comprised of double-layered perovskite
   (Pr0.4Sr0.6)(3)(Fe0.86Mo0.15)(2)O-7 (DLP-PSFM) with uniformly dispersed
   in situ exsolution of Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles was prepared by
   annealing cubic perovskite Pr0.4Sr0.6Co0.2Fe0.7Mo0.1O3-delta in a 10\%
   H-2/N-2 reducing atmosphere at 900 degrees C. The
   BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte-supported PC-EFC single cell
   fabricated with the new DLP-PSFM anode material has achieved a maximal
   output power density of 496.2 mW cm(-2) in H-2 and 348.84 mW cm(-2) in
   C2H6 at 750 degrees C. In the meantime, a high ethylene yield,
   increasing from 13.2\% at 650 C to 41.5\% at 750 degrees C with a
   remarkable ethylene selectivity over 91\% and no CO2 emission, was
   achieved because of the considerably efficient catalysis of in situ
   Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles that were homogeneously distributed on the
   DLP-PSFM backbone. Furthermore, a single cell under a constant current
   load of 0.65 A cm(-2) reached a stable power output at 750 degrees C in
   C2H6 during the 100 h stability test. This indicates an excellent coking
   resistance, which is also supported by Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction
   patterns, and scanning electron microscopy image analyses. The results
   clearly indicate that the DLP-PSFM anode material possesses high ethane
   partial dehydrogenation activity, enhanced electrocatalytic activity,
   and good stability. On the basis of its remarkable performance in
   cogeneration of electricity and ethylene in PC-EFC, DLP-PSFM ceramic
   material is an attractive anode for a directly hydrocarbon-fueled solid
   oxide fuel cell.}},

Abstract = {{A reactive magnesia (MgO) was used to stabilize a natural soil; the
   MgO-stabilized soil was subjected to forced carbonation with pressurized
   gaseous CO2 in a triaxial cell set-up. The change of physical
   properties, including bulk density, moisture content, dry density,
   specific gravity, and porosity, of the stabilized soil during
   carbonation was studied. The mechanical and microstructural properties
   of the carbonated MgO-stabilized soil were also investigated through
   unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test, X-ray diffraction analysis
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mercury intrusion
   porosimetry (MIP). The results indicated that the carbonation of
   MgO-stabilized soil consumed CO2 and water, and produced expansive
   carbonation products; this consequently increased the dry density, and
   reduced the moisture content, specific gravity, and porosity of the
   stabilized soil. After being carbonated for only 1.5 h, the
   MgO-stabilized soil yielded remarkable strength, with UCS higher than
   that of the 28 day ambient cured Portland cement-stabilized soil, mainly
   due to the high binding effect of carbonation products and the low
   porosity of carbonated MgO-stabilized soil. The carbonated
   MgO-stabilized soil achieved a high degree of carbonation in a few hours
   (<= 12 h), with the maximum CO2/MgO ratio in a range of 0.76-1.07.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of solvents from the vapour phase to solid substrates is
   important in producing heavy oil and bitumen, particularly from the oil
   sands. We investigated the sorption and desorption equilibrium and
   kinetics of cyclohexane, toluene, and water on kaolinite, fine solids,
   and organic-rich fine solids isolated from Athabasca oil sands over a
   wide range of solvent vapour concentrations using a gravimetric method.
   The isotherms for both adsorption and desorption of solvent vapour were
   determined, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation was used to fit the
   experimental data. The initial kinetic rate constants for the adsorption
   and desorption of solvent vapour were determined with the linear driving
   force model. The results were compared and discussed in terms of the
   type of solvent, the content of organic materials, and the surface area
   of the solid substrates. The results suggest that, in addition to the
   adsorption of solvent on mineral surfaces, the contribution from solvent
   partitioning in the organic materials and the porosity resulting from
   high amounts of organic materials are significant factors for solvent
   uptake and kinetic rate constants. In mixed solvent vapours, the
   competitive sorption of water and cyclohexane was observed in the solid
   substrates. However, the degree of competitiveness decreased with an
   increase in the content of organic materials in the substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the impact of thermophoresis on soot
   capture in the clean cordierite porous wall of a diesel particulate
   filter (DPF). A three-step numerical model was developed, consisting of:
   (1) numerically reconstructing a representative volume of the cordierite
   porous wall, (2) computing gas flow through the porous wall using the
   lattice Boltzmann method, and (3) predicting of the DPF capture
   efficiency based on the time-dependent solution of a modified Langevin
   equation that takes thermophoresis into account. The validity of the
   approach was verified by carefully comparing the permeability
   predictions of a reconstructed cordierite porous wall to data from the
   literature. The impact of the magnitude and orientation of the
   thermophoretic force on the capture of soot particles of various sizes
   under different flow conditions was investigated. The thermophoretic
   force applied in or against the flow direction significantly affected
   the particle capture for the highest particle sizes and flow velocity
   investigated. Our results suggested that thermophoresis can potentially
   affect soot deposition uniformity in DPFs. Since the thermophoretic
   force mainly impacted soot capture efficiency in the presence of
   particle and flow inertia, a dimensionless criterion defined as the
   product of Stokes and Reynolds numbers is proposed to predict the onset
   of what can be called thermophoresis-enhanced inertial impaction. While
   similar results have been reported by others using simple flow
   geometries, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that this
   phenomenon is reported for a complex cordierite porous wall.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a successful on-site approach for design and construction
   of stream modifications that addressed challenging remote-site
   conditions of limited field data and available construction materials.
   Fish habitat connectivity enhancements were constructed within an Arctic
   headwater stream containing a naturally impassable cascade section with
   13\% slope, which was bypassed in a newly constructed channel at 5\%
   slope with nature-like fishpass structures. Primary design
   considerations included (1) creating suitable hydraulic characteristics
   for fish passage in periods of high and low discharges; (2) reducing
   drop heights and creating unimpeded flow paths; (3) improving hydraulic
   complexity for a variety of stream habitats; and (4) salvaging and
   incorporating vegetation disturbed from construction activities into
   riparian and in-stream habitat structures. In high gradient reaches
   (2.5\%-5\%), we constructed boulder weirs, boulder chokes, and
   deflection boulders to overcome migration impediments. In medium
   gradient reaches (1.5-2.5\%), rock ramps, boulder chokes, and deflection
   boulders were constructed to control hydraulic characteristics to ensure
   an unimpeded flow path, suitable hydraulic complexity, and resting
   zones. At lower gradients (<1.5\%), we incorporated a softer approach
   using riparian vegetation and in-stream woody debris to ensure a similar
   quality of fish habitat as created in the higher gradient reaches.
   Initial hydraulic responses to the modifications indicated this
   reconstructed channel provided suitable hydraulic and habitat
   characteristics for habitat connectivity throughout the entire stream.
   Our findings advance understanding of headwater stream hydraulics in the
   Canadian Arctic and will assist in designing future stream restoration
   and fish habitat compensation projects on small and remote systems. This
   case study supports the feasibility of successfully constructing future
   habitat compensation projects in challenging remote environments when
   using an on-site, adaptive design and construction approach.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed power transformer electromagnetic transient model would help

   generated in finite-element method (FEM) tools to depict the major flux

   saturation, hysteresis, and eddy currents are captured in the
   transformer hardware emulation whose modules were developed in a 32-b
   floating point precision VHDL. The developed HR-MEC model and nonlinear
   numerical solution have been fully parallelized in hardware to achieve
   the lowest latency in the real-time implementation. The hysteresis in
   the transformer core is modeled using Preisach theory, and eddy currents
   are incorporated using a frequency-dependent network. The real-time

   The model is also verified by both simulation and laboratory

   has both harmonic source characteristic and harmonic impedance
   characteristic. Furthermore, the harmonic emission of PV inverters is
   affected by two grid operating conditions, namely the grid impedance and
   background harmonic voltage. The case studies demonstrate that the
   harmonic emission of a PV inverter without special harmonic control

Abstract = {{Interface management (IM) is an emerging construction management
   practice that industry finds necessary for megaprojects that have become
   more complex and global. Defined as the appropriate management of
   communications, relationships, and deliverables among stakeholders,
   effective IM is integral to project success. Yet, because it is an
   emerging discipline, IM implementation has varied widely across the
   industry. Furthermore, the effect of IM on project performance is still
   unclear. To address these gaps, the construction industry institute
   (CII) chartered a research team, to identify the current state of IM and
   to investigate the relationship between systematic IM and project
   performance. To accomplish this, the authors conducted structured
   interviews for 46 projects. The study results showed that IM practices
   are most often found in industrial projects, with dollar values of more
   than one billion. In addition, IM adoption is positively correlated with
   the project dollar value and number of interface stakeholders. In terms
   of performance, projects with systematic IM tend to have lower mean and
   less dispersed cost growth, compared with projects without systematic
   IM. These results contribute to an understanding of the potential
   benefits of IM and its appropriate application as it further develops
   and is used in practice. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal stormwater retention ponds are a means of managing stormwater
   in urban settings. Numerous contaminants collect in stormwater retention
   ponds, creating problems such as odor. Because of the complex and

   components used a multidisciplinary approach, focused on both water
   chemistry and microbiological methods to analyze the existing conditions

   stormwater retention ponds in terms of water quality and sediment
   microbial communities in Edmonton, Canada to determine methods to reduce
   sulfate levels, which are believed to stimulate generation of the toxic
   hydrogen sulfide. The field study comparison was followed by laboratory
   studies focused on methods of suppressing sulfide production. Nitrate
   amendments were found to be effective in suppressing sulfate production;
   however, the addition of a carbon source stimulated greater sulfide
   production. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The Christensen criterion, originally introduced in materials science,
   has a simple mathematical form and uniaxial tensile and compressive
   strength as the only parameters, making it an attractive candidate for
   rock engineering purposes. In this study, the applicability of the
   criterion to rock materials is examined. Explicit equations for
   application of the criterion under biaxial, triaxial compression,
   triaxial extension, and polyaxial states of stresses are derived. A
   comprehensive strength data set including the results of tests on
   synthetic rock, chert dyke, Carrara marble and Westerly granite is
   utilized to examine the accuracy of the Christensen criterion to the
   failure of rock material. The two surprising findings about the
   Christensen criterion are the zero values of tensile strength and the
   very low slopes of the failure envelope obtained from fitting analyses
   for chert dyke and Westerly granite. It is shown that the two problems
   are interrelated and the values of tensile strength tend to zero to
   produce higher slopes. It is then mathematically proven that the maximum
   initial slope of the Christensen failure envelope is limited to 4 in
   triaxial compression and 2.5 in triaxial extension which is considerably
   lower than the slope of experimental data. The accuracy of the
   Christensen criterion was found to be significantly lower than the
   well-established Hoek-Brown criterion. The circular pi-plane
   representations and brittle-to-ductile transition limits from the
   Christensen criterion are also inconsistent with the observed behavior
   of rocks.}},

Title = {{A Stochastic ANP-GCE Approach for Vulnerability Assessment in the Water
   Supply System With Uncertainties}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{78-90}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Water supply systems around the world are becoming increasingly
   vulnerable as a consequence of rising climate instability and the
   systems' intrinsic complexity. Assessing the vulnerability of such
   systems is the primary and fundamental step for mitigating the negative
   impacts of environmental incidents. There are two main challenges in
   this context. First, since water supply systems are coupled with
   human-environment systems, the corresponding vulnerability assessment
   requires consideration of a host of multidimensional criteria in terms
   of the structures and management. Second, due to the uncertain and
   dynamic nature of environmental incidents, available information is not
   sufficient for experts to make accurate real-time judgments for the
   weights of criteria. To the best of our knowledge, few weight
   calculation approaches are able to deal with both uncertainties and
   subjectivities of experts' judgments under varied scenarios of the
   incident. These problems are solved by developing new assessment
   approaches consisting of four steps: 1) developing an analytical network
   process (ANP) criteria framework; 2) proposing a weight calculation
   approach by integrating game cross evaluation with stochastic ANP based
   on the proposed criteria framework; 3) calculating the weighted
   vulnerability values, rating and visualizing the vulnerability grades
   accordingly; and 4) performing assessment simulations and sensitivity
   analysis for possible scenarios. A case study of the Shanghai water
   supply system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches,
   which provides guides for improvement of system performances based on
   the trends of variations in the vulnerability grades and the dominating
   criterion identified for each component.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread adoption of energy efficient but harmonic-producing loads
   in residential homes has led to increased injection of harmonic currents
   into transmission systems. In response to this situation, a novel
   filtering scheme that can reduce the harmonic penetration into
   transmission systems is proposed. The scheme utilizes the tertiary
   winding of a substation transformer to construct a tuned low-impedance
   path for the harmonic currents. The proposed scheme is capable of
   trapping two zero-sequence harmonics and three nonzero-sequence
   harmonics simultaneously. A design procedure has been developed.
   Performance of the scheme is evaluated and demonstrated through
   simulation studies. In addition, economic analysis reveals that the
   scheme is a cost-effective solution in comparison with other applicable
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces two new cells for logic-in-memory (LiM) operation.
   The first novelty of these cells is the resistive random access memory
   configuration that utilizes a programmable metallization cell as
   nonvolatile element. CMOS transistors and ambipolar transistors are used
   as processing and control elements for the logic operations of the LiM
   cells. The first cell employs ambipolar transistors and CMOS in its
   logic circuit (7T2A1P), while the second LiM cell uses only MOSFETs
   (9T1P) to implement logic functions, such as AND, OR, and XOR. The
   operational mode of the proposed cells is voltage-based, which is much
   different from the previous designs in which a LiM cell operates on a
   current mode. Extensive simulation results using HSPICE are provided for
   the evaluation of these cells; comparison shows that the proposed two
   cells outperform previous LiM cells in metrics, such as logic operation
   delays, power delay product, circuit complexity, write time, and output
   swing.}},

Abstract = {{Although methods for modelling steel shear connections under column

Abstract = {{In this paper, the boundary effect on crack kinking in a piezoelectric
   strip with a central crack vertical to the boundary under in-plane
   loadings has been investigated. By using integral transform techniques
   the present mixed boundary value problem was reduced to the solution of
   dual integral equations, which can be further reduced to solving
   Fredholm integral equations. Analytical solutions can be obtained when
   the width of the piezoelectric strip are of infinite size. The
   asymptotic fields around crack tips have been provided for the
   electrically impermeable and permeable crack boundary conditions,
   respectively. Crack kinking phenomenon is investigated by applying the
   criterion of maximum hoop stress intensity factor. Numerical results
   show that the material properties, the geometry of the cracked strip and
   the electric mechanical loading significantly affect the singular field
   distributions around the crack. Crack kinking is found for the
   impermeable crack case while no kinking for the permeable crack. Crack
   kinking angles for different piezoelectric materials under the
   impermeable crack surface condition have been predicted with certain
   loading and boundary conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Tire-derived aggregate (TDA) has been used in many civil engineering
   applications. Despite its successful use in the past, the amount of
   experimental research available on TDA applications is not sufficient to
   provide data for the evaluation of an appropriate constitutive model.
   The majority of TDA constitutive models have been developed from
   laboratory tests performed on tire chips smaller than those used in
   field applications. In this study, nonlinear elastic material models,
   with an elastic modulus that varies as a function of vertical stress,
   have been developed for TDA produced from passenger and light truck tire
   (PLTT) and off-the-road (OTR) vehicle tires. The material model for TDA
   is established based on previous large-scale laboratory constrained
   compression tests conducted on TDA up to 300 mm in size. The model is
   used in a finite-element (FE) analysis using geotechnical software to
   predict the settlement of full-scale test embankment during
   construction. The results indicate that the settlements obtained from
   the FE analysis agree with the settlements measured in the field during
   construction of full-scale test embankment. This paper also provides
   design charts to compute overbuild required on top of TDA layer(s) to
   compensate immediate compression under an applied load during the
   placement of cover on top of (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Obtaining fundamental variables has critical importance in solving
   engineering problems, and analysis of experimental data aids
   more-efficient experimentation. Drag reduction in pipelines is
   particularly useful in efforts to reduce energy losses. In the present
   study, statistical procedures are used to analyze some drag reduction
   experimental data to determine the degree to which each variable and its
   interactions with the others contribute to drag reduction. The
   experiments in this study incorporate parameters such as Reynolds number
   and temperature of fluid, concentration of different drag reducing
   agents and relative roughness of pipes. A proposed model has been
   developed by applying response surface methodology to historical data.
   The statistical analysis shows that the model is statistically
   acceptable (R-2=96.78\%). Results of analysis show that 95\% of
   variation in the friction factor can be described only by Reynolds
   number and concentration of drag reducing agent and their interactions.
   Finally for operational applications, a nomograph has been presented to
   evaluate friction factor simply. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{CO2 microbubbles - A potential fluid for enhanced oil recovery: Bulk and
   porous media studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{160-173}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide foam flooding is a conventional process to increase the
   quantity of extracting oil. The short-term stability and relatively low
   viscosity of CO2 foam motivate the researchers to find a more stable
   fluid. Colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs) are microbubbles confined by the
   surfactant multilayer and the viscous water layer. One of the most
   important characteristics of CGA is their gas-blocking ability. They
   increase the stability of the surfactant/polymer solution as well as
   reduce the mobility of CO2 gas. Accordingly, CGA has been recently used
   in the petroleum industry (drilling operation, production management
   etc.). The CO2 enhanced oil recovery and sequestration can be one of the
   major interests of CO2 gas microbubbles. The pressure-volume-temperature
   (PVT) relationship of CO2 microbubbles is of particular interest, due to
   the presence of gas in the form of microbubbles in the bulk of the
   fluid.
   This paper discusses the phase behavior, rheological characterization,
   and microbubble size analysis of CO2 microbubbles at different
   conditions. A PVT cell was used to analyze the stability of CO2 micro
   bubbles after encountering elevated pressure and temperature. The
   rheological properties and micro bubble size analysis of this fluid were
   performed both before and after the PVT study to demonstrate the effect
   of compression/decompression and temperature on CO2 microbubbles
   properties. Furthermore, macro- and micro-scale porous media experiment
   were performed to analyze the behavior of micro bubbles during heavy oil
   recovery.
   Microbubble size analysis revealed that most of the initial microbubbles
   located within a diameter range of 100-120 um. After PVT tests, fewer
   amounts of large microbubbles (due to the coalescence of small bubbles)
   existed compared to that of preserved samples under low pressure
   condition. This result demonstrates good capability of CO2 microbubbles
   to maintain their stability under the high pressure and temperature
   conditions. Compression/decompression of microbubbles revealed that
   microbubbles can survive up to at least a pressure of 2000 psi,
   demonstrating its potential for subterranean applications. However,
   above 50 degrees C (122 degrees F), the stability of microbubbles was
   decreased after compression/decompression up to 2000 psi. Higher
   temperatures decrease viscosity and elastic/viscous moduli of
   microbubbles and this study showed that temperature above 50 degrees C
   can be critical for rheological properties and the P-V relation of CO2
   microbubbles. Furthermore, PVT studies showed that the lower
   compression/decompression rate drastically affects the stability of CO2
   microbubbles and the higher temperature enhances this effect. Finally,
   the flow resistance characteristic of microbubbles as well as their
   favorable injectivity indicated the potential of this fluid to enhance
   heavy oil recovery, particularly in heterogeneous reservoirs with low
   sweep efficiency. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Capturing the effects of secondary fractures on production data using

Abstract = {{Many fractured horizontal wells are completed in tight oil/gas or shale
   gas reservoirs which have significant networks of interconnected
   secondary fractures. However, the existing linear transient dual- and
   triple-porosity models do not properly account for secondary fractures.
   While the dual-porosity model assumes negligible secondary fractures,
   the linear sequential triple-porosity model assumes negligible fluid
   transfer between the rock matrix and hydraulic fractures. Hence, the
   application of these models for production data analysis of fractured
   horizontal wells could result in unreasonable reservoir/fracture
   parameter estimates and hydrocarbon forecast. For this reason, the
   quadrilinear flow model (QFM) was developed to account for
   matrix-hydraulic fracture communication. Although QFM properly accounts
   for the contribution of secondary fractures during reservoir depletion,
   reservoir parameter estimation from its type-curve matching procedure
   has a high degree of uncertainty. This paper proposes simplified QFM
   flow regime equations to reduce the uncertainty associated with
   reservoir parameter estimation.
   This study carefully analyses the general QFM solution by observing the
   flow regions from dimensionless rate and pressure type-curves. This
   solution is simplified by eliminating dimensionless parameters with
   negligible contribution to fluid depletion within the duration of each
   flow region. The resulting simplified analysis equations are
   analytically inverted from Laplace space to time space. The
   simplification process yields (i) analysis equations for different
   flow-regions of the specialised rate-normalised pressure and pressure
   derivative plots and (ii) explains the possible physics behind the
   flow-regions.
   The effect of secondary fracture networks on reservoir depletion can be
   investigated by applying QFM analysis equations on specialised
   rate-normalised pressure and pressure derivative production data plots.
   The choice of these plots is based on operational well constraints and
   observable flow regions. The QFM analysis equations are applied to
   interpret production data of two multifractured horizontal wells
   completed in the Cardium and Bakken Formations. The results estimate
   effective half-length of hydraulic fractures, investigate the
   presence/absence of secondary fractures and propose a workflow for
   handling the uncertainty in reservoir parameter estimation when applying
   the specialised analysis equations. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The properties and impacts of aggregated aerosol particles (i.e., soot,
   metal oxide fumes) depend on their morphology, as characterized by
   fractal dimension, prefactor, and primary particle diameter. The
   morphology may be measured directly by time-consuming ex situ microscopy
   or rapid but indirect in situ methods. Previously, it was found that
   particle mass and mobility measurements could be used for the estimation
   of the primary particle diameter of zirconia aggregates, using plausible
   assumptions related to the fractal structure (specifically, prefactor
   k(a) and exponent D-alpha). Since the formation and growth of zirconia
   aggregates are different from carbon soot, here we compare primary
   particle diameters measured directly from transmission electron
   microscopy analysis of soot particles with the diameters estimated from
   mass-mobility measurements. Performing extensive measurements on soot
   emissions from two reciprocating engines over a range of operating
   conditions, we found that there are no universal values of k(a) and
   D-alpha that can be used for all conditions. However, new optimized
   values of k(a) and D-alpha are estimated here for soot particles. The
   variation of the primary particle diameter with particle size is also
   taken into consideration and is shown to be essential to obtain
   physically realistic results. Using optimized values of k(a) and
   D-alpha, the average primary particle sizing error is reduced for all
   soot types. This suggests that with some calibration, in situ sizing of
   the primary particle diameter, using mass and mobility measurements, can
   provide useful accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering design changes constantly occur in complex engineering
   design processes. Designers need appropriate measures to handle the
   numerous design changes in order to realize consistent and completely
   validated product models so that successful product development is
   assured. In this paper, a time-based mathematic model is presented to
   characterize the sequential change propagation process, and then the
   shortest path algorithm is given to find the most timesaving routes for
   changes to propagate to other dependent design tasks. An analysis method
   is introduced to compute the sensitivities of change impacts on the
   affected design tasks, which indicates that the more time consumed by a
   change to take its effect, the more sensitive the change impacts on
   those downstream dependent tasks. A case study of change propagations in
   motorcycle engine design process was presented to demonstrate the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium MRI is particularly interesting given the key role that sodium
   ions play in cellular metabolism. To measure concentration, images must
   be free from contrast unrelated to sodium density. However, spin 3/2 NMR
   is complicated by more than rapid biexponential signal decay. Residual
   quadrupole interactions (described by frequency Q) can reduce M-xy
   development during RF excitation. Three experiments, each performed on
   the same four healthy volunteers, demonstrate that residual quadrupole
   interactions are of concern in quantitative sodium imaging of the brain.
   The first experiment shows a reliable increase in the rate of excitation
   flipping' (1\%-6\%), particularly in white matter with tracts running
   superior-inferior (i.e. parallel to B-0). Increased flip-rates imply an
   associated signal loss and are to be expected when Q(-1). The second
   experiment shows that a prescribed flip-angle decrease from 90 degrees
   to 20 degrees, with concomitant decrease in T-E from 0.25ms to 0.10ms
   and no T-1 weighting, results in a 14\%-26\% saline calibration phantom
   normalized signal (S-N) increase in the white matter regions. The third
   experiment shows that this (S-N) increase is primarily due to a residual
   quadrupole effect, with a small contribution from T-2 weighting. There
   is an observed deviation from the spin 3/2 biexponential curve, also
   suggesting Q dephasing. Using simulation to explain the results of all
   three experiments, a model of brain tissue is hypothesized. It includes
   one pool (50\%) with Q = 0, and another (50\%) in which Q has a Gaussian
   distribution with a standard deviation of 625Hz. Given the result of the
   second experiment, it is suggested that the use of reduced flip-angles
   with large (1) will provide more accurate measures of sodium
   concentration than standard' methods using 90 degrees pulses.
   Alternatively, further study of sodium Qmay provide a means to explore
   tissue structure and organization. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Economic competitiveness is one of the key factors in making decisions

   MSW (FUNNEL-Cost-MSW), compares nine different waste management
   scenarios, including landfilling and composting, in terms of economic
   parameters such as gate fees and return on investment. In addition, a
   geographic information system (GIS) model was developed to determine
   suitable locations for waste conversion facilities and landfill sites
   based on integration of environmental, social, and economic factors.
   Finally, a case study on Parkland County and its surrounding counties in
   the province of Alberta, Canada, was conducted and a sensitivity

Abstract = {{Objectives - The viscoelastic response of the midpalatal suture during
   maxillary expansion treatment has been sparsely studied. The aim of our
   study was to use viscoelastic models to investigate the effect of
   appliance mechanics on sutural tissue.
   Materials and Methods - Four creep-strain models were utilized in
   predicting the midpalatal suture's response to a constant-force
   application during expansion treatment. The functional forms included a
   three-term separable, three-term inseparable, two-term inseparable, and
   single-term arrangement. The functions were then transformed into
   subsequent stress-relaxation representations to predict suture response
   as a result of 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 mm displacements. Finally, the
   single-term creep-strain representation was altered to simulate
   treatment decaying force during treatment. A force that decays 30 and
   10\% of an initially applied 0.98 N was considered for decaying
   functions over a 6-week period, and compared to strain resulting from a
   constant-force application.
   Results - This analysis illustrated that the decay in suture strain
   closely followed decay in force and that the path of decay had minimal
   impact on overall results. Also, it was found that a single screw
   activation would likely not cause suture soft tissue failure, even for a
   0.25 mm displacement, and that suture stress rapidly decayed within
   minutes of activation.
   Conclusion - Results from this study support the notion of maintaining a
   low-magnitude constant traction on the suture during treatment to avoid
   soft tissue failure and promote tissue remodeling.}},

   Poly(alpha-carboxylate-co-alpha-benzylcarboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone)-
   PEG-poly(alpha-carboxylate-co-alpha-benzylcarboxylate-epsilon-caprolacto
   ne) (PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL) was synthesized through ring opening
   polymerization of alpha-benzyl carboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone by PEG,
   followed by 30\% debenzylation of the lateral blocks. The effect of Tris
   buffer and pH on the sol-gel transition temperature of PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL
   was assessed. The temperature/pH responsive release of
   tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (TMR-D) (10 and 40 kDa) from
   PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL was investigated.
   Replacement of water with Tris buffer reduced PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL sol-gel
   transition temperature. Thermo-reversible hydrogels were only formed at
   pHs a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 5.0, but
   PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL transition temperature was not affected by pH above pH
   5.0. In contrast to Pluronic F127 that released 100\% of TMR-D within 2
   h, PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL hydrogel controlled TMR-D release efficiently at pH =
   7.4 and 37A degrees C (similar to 27 and 11\% TMRD 10 and 40 kDa release
   within 150 h, respectively). At 50A degrees C or pH = 9.0, TMR-D release
   was increased slightly, while at room temperature or pH = 5.0, no
   control over TMR-D release was observed by PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL hydrogel.

Abstract = {{At atmospheric pressure, hydrocarbon resources, such as bitumen and Maya
   and other heavy oils, have been shown to exhibit non-Newtonian behavior
   at or below typical ambient temperatures. This work is devoted to
   investigating the effect of pressure on the non-Newtonian rheological
   properties of Maya crude oil (a commercial heavy oil blend from Mexico).
   Measurements were performed from 258 to 333 K, using a stress-controlled
   rheometer, at pressures up to 150 bar and over a broad range of shear
   rates. Maya crude oil was shown to be a shear-thinning fluid below 313 K
   exhibiting thixotropy below 293 K, at atmospheric pressure, in a prior
   work. At fixed temperature, the magnitude of the non-Newtonian behaviors
   of Maya crude Oil appears to increase with increasing pressure, and
   shear thinning is shown to persist to higher pressures below 313 K.
   Boundaries of the non-Newtonian region with respect to temperature,
   pressure, and viscosity are identified and discussed. The thixotropic
   behavior of Maya crude oil is also shown to persist at higher pressure,
   and the recovery of the moduli at rest appears to be faster at elevated
   pressures than at atmospheric pressure.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{766-772}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the rheological properties of mixtures of heavy oil or
   bitumen and diluents, specifically at low temperatures, is key in
   designing different processes employed in the production or
   transportation of these resources reliably and efficiently. The effect
   of diluents (n-heptane, toluene, and toluene + butanone (50:50 vol \%))
   on the non-Newtonian behavior of Maya crude oil including shear thinning
   and thixotropy at temperatures from 258 to 333 K are discussed. Toluene
   + butanone (50:50 vol \%) addition to Maya crude oil induces the
   greatest reduction in shear thinning behavior irrespective of
   temperature. Thixotropic properties of mixtures of Maya crude oil and
   diluent were studied through startup experiments. It was shown that
   toluene + butanone (50:50 vol \%) is the best diluent in moderating the
   thixotropic effect, whereas n-heptane showed the most pronounced
   thixotropic effect. It was shown that toluene + butanone (50:50 vol \%)
   is more promising in decreasing Oil viscosity in comparison to two other
   diluents tested. Less of this diluent is required to decrease the
   viscosity to a certain value, which confirms its potential to be used in
   the industry as a diluent. The results presented also provide a reliable
   database for model development and evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Markov clustering (MCL) is a commonly used algorithm for clustering
   networks in bioinformatics. It shows good performance in clustering
   dynamic protein-protein interaction networks (DPINs). However, a
   limitation of MCL and its variants (e.g, regularized MCL and soft
   regularized MCL) is that the clustering results are mostly dependent on
   the parameters whose values are user-specified. In this study, we
   propose a new MCL method based on the firefly algorithm (FA) to identify
   protein complexes from DPIN. Based on three-sigma principle, we
   construct the DPIN and discuss an overall modeling process. In order to
   optimize parameters, we exploit a number of population-based
   optimization methods. A thorough comparison completed for different
   swarm optimization algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   and firefly algorithm (FA) has been carried out. The identified protein
   complexes on the DIP dataset show that the new algorithm outperforms the
   state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy of protein complex
   identification. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ternary nanocomposites of polypropylene/polyamide 6/layered silicate
   were prepared through three different processing procedures. X-ray
   diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the
   nanostructure of the samples, and tensile and impact strength
   measurements were conducted to assess the mechanical properties. It was
   shown that processing route has a significant effect on the delamination
   of clay platelets. Fully exfoliated nanostructure was achieved through a
   certain two-step processing route. Compatibilization of the blends
   affected microstructure as well as nanostructure. Mechanical properties
   were affected by changing the processing route, to a great degree.
   Modification of the nanostructure, i.e. more effective dispersion of
   silicate layers in polyamide particles, mainly enhanced elastic modulus.
   Changing the microstructure, or finer dispersion of polyamide particles
   in the polypropylene matrix, had a major effect on yield strength.
   Combination of these two effects successfully created a sample with
   superior overall tensile properties. Impact strength, however,
   deteriorated with better dispersion of clay. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   variations etc. for the implementation of oxy-fuel combustion

   rates, the mass loss rate of coal in CO2 was higher than in that of a
   N-2 environment. This may be due to one additional step of coal
   gasification i.e. char gasification by CO2 at higher temperature. More
   importantly, during the reaction with CO2 the formations of perfectly
   hexagonal nanorods at the particular temperature of 773 K were observed.
   However, the amount of these nanorods decreases and the dimensions i.e.
   size and shape change (smaller aspect ratio) with the increase of flow
   rate and temperature as well. The formation of these nanorods are

Abstract = {{Two experimental waste-rock piles (test piles), each 15 m in height x 60
   m x 50 m, were constructed at the Diavik diamond mine in Northern Canada
   to study the behavior of low-sulfide content waste rock, with a
   similarly low acid-neutralization potential, in a continuous permafrost
   region. One test pile with an average of 0.035 wt.\% S (< 50 mm
   fraction; referred to as Type I) and a second test pile with an average
   of 0.053 wt.\% S (< 50 mm fraction; referred to as Type III) were
   constructed in 2006. The average carbon content in the < 50 mm fraction
   of waste rock in the Type I test pile was 0.031 wt.\% as C and in the
   Type III test pile was 0.030 wt.\% as C. The NP:AP ratio, based on the
   arithmetic mean of particle-size weighted NP and AP values, for the Type
   I test pile was 12.2, suggesting this test pile was non-acid generating
   and for the Type III test pile was 2.2, suggesting an uncertain
   acid-generating potential. The Type I test pile maintained near-neutral
   pH for the 4-year duration of the study. Sulfate and dissolved metal
   concentrations were low, with the exception of Ni, Zn, Cd, and Co in the
   fourth year following construction. The pore water in the Type III test
   pile contained higher concentrations of SO42- and dissolved metals, with
   a decrease in pH to < 4.7 and an annual depletion of alkalinity. Maximum
   concentrations of dissolved metals (20 mg L-1 Ni, 2.3 mg L-1 Cu, 3.7 mg
   L-1 Zn, 35 mgL(-1) Cd, and 3.8 mg L-1 Co) corresponded to decreases in
   flow rate, which were observed at the end of each field season when the
   contribution of the total outflow from the central portion of the test
   pile was greatest. Bacteria were present each year in spite of annual
   freeze/thaw cycles. The microbial community within the Type I test pile
   included a population of neutrophilic S-oxidizing bacteria. Each year,
   changes in the water quality of the Type III test-pile effluent were
   accompanied by changes in the microbial populations. Populations of
   acidophilic S-oxidizing bacteria and Fe-oxidizing bacteria became more
   abundant as the pH decreased and internal test pile temperatures
   increased. Irrespective of the cold-climate conditions and low S content
   of the waste rock, the geochemical and microbiological results of this
   study are consistent with other acid mine drainage studies; indicating
   that a series of mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions controls pH
   and metal mobility, and transport is controlled by matrix-dominated flow
   and internal temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   secondary Cr7C3 and Cr23C6 carbides, austenite, and a small amount of
   ferrite. Defects in CCO, such as cracks, porosity, and clusters of
   particles known in the industry as ``rice crispies{''} are observed near
   the top surface of the CCO. The undissolved Cr7C3 particles with
   surrounding porosity seem to have provided the preferential nucleation
   sites for the initial micro-cracks. These initial cracks are observed to
   propagate along the interface between the austenite and Cr7C3 carbides.

Abstract = {{Derating is the operation of an item at a stress that is lower than its
   rated design value. Previous research has indicated that reliability can
   be increased from operational derating. In order to derate an item in
   field operation, however, an engineer must rate the design of the item
   at a stress level higher than the operational stress level, which
   increases the item's nominal failure rate and development costs. At
   present, there is no model available to quantify the cost and
   reliability that considers the design uprating as well as the
   operational derating. In this paper, we establish the reliability
   expression in terms of the derating level assuming that the nominal
   failure rate is constant with time for a fixed rated design value. The
   total development cost is expressed in terms of the rated design value
   and the number of tests necessary to demonstrate the reliability
   requirement. The properties of the optimal derating level are explained
   for maximizing the reliability or for minimizing the cost. As an
   example, the proposed model is applied to the design of liquid rocket
   engines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic study on the fine particular matter emissions from coal
   combustion of four kinds of coals of different ranks (lignite,
   sub-bituminous, bituminous, coking coal), including three typical
   Canadian coals and a Chinese coal have been presented. The results show
   that a tri-modal mass size distribution (coarse, fine and ultrafine
   mode) was commonly identified, and it was confirmed by size-segregated
   elemental distributions. The tri-modal distribution is of temperature
   and coal ranks independence. Coarse particles (Da similar to 5 mu m)
   presented as round-shaped sphere with smooth surface. Both round-shaped
   particles and irregular-shaped particles were observed in fine particles
   (Da similar to 0.5 mu m). Clusters of nano-particles (Da similar to 0.05
   mu m) were identified in the ultrafine mode. The concentration of fine
   particles (Da < 1 mu m) generated from the TECK coal is the highest
   (about 150 mg/Nm(3)), while fine particles (Da < 10 mu m) generated from
   Boundary coal (about 580 mg/Nm(3)) is highest among the four coals.
   Higher volatile content in coals gives priority for enhancing the
   formation of fine particles. Excluded minerals would mostly fragmented
   to form ash residual with irregular shapes, while part of them would
   experience coalescence individually to form round-shaped particles with
   size larger than 10 mu m. Included minerals adhered firmly on the
   surface of char particles contribute greater in the irregular-shaped
   particles in fine mode, while the shedding included minerals from char
   particles should take the major responsibility for the round shaped
   particles in fine mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report a silicon photonic refractometric CO2 gas sensor operating at
   room temperature and capable of detecting CO2 gas at atmospheric

   refractive index change upon absorption and release of CO2 gas
   molecules, and does not require the presence of humidity to operate. By
   functionalizing a silicon microring resonator with a thin layer of the
   polymer, we could detect CO2 gas concentrations in the 0-500ppm range
   with a sensitivity of 6 x 10(-9) RIU/ppm and a detection limit of 20ppm.
   The microring transducer provides a potential integrated solution in the
   development of low-cost and compact CO2 sensors that can be deployed as

Pages = {{1128-1138}},

Abstract = {{A rapid, efficient technique for the attachment of bacteriophages
   (phages) onto polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) surfaces has been developed and
   compared to three reported methods for phage immobilization. Polymer
   surfaces were modified to facilitate phage attachment using (1) plasma
   treatment alone, (2) plasma treatment followed by activation by
   1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and
   N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS), (3) plasma-initiated acrylic acid
   grafting, or (4) plasma-initiated acrylic acid grafting with activation
   by EDC and sulfo-NHS. The impact of each method on the surface chemistry
   of PHA was investigated using contact angle analysis and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. Each of the four treatments was shown to
   result in both increased hydrophilicity and in the modification of the
   surface functional groups. Modified surfaces were immersed in
   suspensions of phage T4 for immobilization. The highest level of phage
   binding was observed for the surfaces modified by plasma treatment
   alone. The change in chemical bond states observed for surfaces that
   underwent plasma treatment is suspected to be the cause of the increased
   binding of active phages. Plasma-treated surfaces were further analyzed
   through phage-staining and fluorescence microscopy to assess the surface
   density of immobilized phages and their capacity to capture hosts. The
   infective capability of attached phages was confirmed by exposing the
   phage-immobilized surfaces to the host bacteria Escherichia coli in both
   plaque and infection dynamic assays. Plasma-treated surfaces with
   immobilized phages displayed higher infectivity than surfaces treated
   with other methods; in fact, the equivalent initial multiplicity of
   infection was 2 orders of magnitude greater than with other methods.
   Control samples - prepared by immersing polymer surfaces in phage
   suspensions (without prior plasma treatment) - did not show any
   bacterial growth inhibition, suggesting they did not bind phages from
   the suspension.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{A novel class of all-organic nanoscale porphyrin nanodroplet agents is
   presented which is suitable for multimodality ultrasound and
   photoacoustic molecular imaging. Previous multimodality
   photoacoustic-ultrasound agents are either not organic, or not yet
   demonstrated to exhibit enhanced accumulation in leaky tumor
   vasculature, perhaps because of large diameters. In the current study,
   porphyrin nanodroplets are created with a mean diameter of 185 nm which
   is small enough to exhibit the enhanced permeability and retention
   effect. Porphyrin within the nanodroplet shell has strong optical
   absorption at 705 nm with an estimated molar extinction coefficient >5 x
   10(9) m(-1) cm(-1), allowing both ultrasound and photoacoustic contrast
   in the same nanoparticle using all organic materials. The potential of
   nanodroplets is that they may be phase-changed into microbubbles using
   high pressure ultrasound, providing ultrasound contrast with
   single-bubble sensitivity. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging allows
   visualization of nanodroplets when injected intratumorally in an HT1080
   tumor in the chorioallantoic membrane of a chicken embryo. Intravital
   microscopy imaging of Hep3-GFP and HT1080-GFP tumors in chicken embryos
   determines that nanodroplets accumulated throughout or at the periphery
   of tumors, suggesting that porphyrin nanodroplets may be useful for
   enhancing the visualization of tumors with ultrasound and/or
   photoacoustic imaging.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously identified a novel intra-tumoral dichotomy in breast
   cancer based on the differential responsiveness to a Sox2 reporter
   (SRR2), with cells responsive to SRR2 (RR) being more stem-like than
   unresponsive cells (RU). Here, we report that RR cells derived from MCF7
   and ZR751 displayed a higher tolerance to oxidative stress than their RU
   counterparts, supporting the concept that the RR phenotype correlates
   with cancer stemness. Sox2 is directly implicated in this differential
   H2O2 tolerance, since siRNA knockdown of Sox2 in RR cells leveled this
   difference. Interestingly, H2O2 converted a proportion of RU cells into
   RR cells, as evidenced by their expression of luciferase and GFP,
   markers of SRR2 activity. Compared to RU cells, converted RR cells
   showed a significant increase in mammosphere formation and tolerance to
   H2O2. Converted RR cells also adopted the biochemical features of RR
   cells, as evidenced by their substantial increase in Sox2-SRR2 binding
   and the expression of 3 signature genes of RR cells (CD133, GPR49 and
   MUC15). Lastly, the H2O2-induced RU/RR conversion was detectable in a
   SCID mouse xenograft model and primary tumor cells. To conclude, the
   H2O2-induced RU/RR conversion has provided a novel model to study the
   acquisition of cancer stemness and plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{With the widespread use of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) in various
   applications, new challenges have arisen in terms of designing its
   control system. One of such challenges is caused by wheel slippage. This
   study proposes a new method for haptic teleoperation control of a WMR
   with longitudinal slippage (not including sliding). In this
   teleoperation system, the mobile robot's linear velocity follows the
   master haptic interface's position. The proposed teleoperation
   controller also includes an acceleration-level control law for the
   mobile robot such that the velocity loss caused by slippage is
   compensated for. Information about the magnitude and timing of slippage
   is displayed to the human operator through haptic (force) feedback.
   Despite the functional benefits of displaying slippage information as
   haptic feedback to the user, there are system stability related concerns
   that have been addressed using the proposed controller. Experiments of
   the proposed controller demonstrate that it results in stable bilateral
   teleoperation with a satisfactory tracking performance.}},

Title = {{Robust detection of heartbeats using association models from blood
   pressure and EEG signals}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Backgrounds: The heartbeat is fundamental cardiac activity which is
   straightforwardly detected with a variety of measurement techniques for
   analyzing physiological signals. Unfortunately, unexpected noise or
   contaminated signals can distort or cut out electrocardiogram (ECG)
   signals in practice, misleading the heartbeat detectors to report a
   false heart rate or suspend itself for a considerable length of time in
   the worst case. To deal with the problem of unreliable heartbeat
   detection, PhysioNet/CinC suggests a challenge in 2014 for developing
   robust heart beat detectors using multimodal signals.
   Methods: This article proposes a multimodal data association method that
   supplements ECG as a primary input signal with blood pressure (BP) and
   electroencephalogram (EEG) as complementary input signals when input
   signals are unreliable. If the current signal quality index (SQI)
   qualifies ECG as a reliable input signal, our method applies QRS
   detection to ECG and reports heartbeats. Otherwise, the current SQI
   selects the best supplementary input signal between BP and EEG after
   evaluating the current SQI of BP. When BP is chosen as a supplementary
   input signal, our association model between ECG and BP enables us to
   compute their regular intervals, detect characteristics BP signals, and
   estimate the locations of the heartbeat. When both ECG and BP are not
   qualified, our fusion method resorts to the association model between
   ECG and EEG that allows us to apply an adaptive filter to ECG and EEG,
   extract the QRS candidates, and report heartbeats.
   Results: The proposed method achieved an overall score of 86.26 \% for
   the test data when the input signals are unreliable. Our method
   outperformed the traditional method, which achieved 79.28 \% using QRS
   detector and BP detector from PhysioNet. Our multimodal signal
   processing method outperforms the conventional unimodal method of taking
   ECG signals alone for both training and test data sets.
   Conclusions: To detect the heartbeat robustly, we have proposed a novel
   multimodal data association method of supplementing ECG with a variety
   of physiological signals and accounting for the patient-specific lag
   between different pulsatile signals and ECG. Multimodal signal detectors
   and data-fusion approaches such as those proposed in this article can
   reduce false alarms and improve patient monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates FeCo-based alloy glass formability by high

   Impulse Atomization was used to generate
   \{(Fe60Co40)(75)B20Si5\}(96)Nb-4 powders of different sizes that
   correspond to different cooling rates and undercoolings. The amorphous
   fraction and kinetic crystallization properties of the investigated
   powders were determined by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry
   and Neutron Diffraction. The enthalpy of crystallization of a close to
   amorphous powder produced by gas atomization was used as a reference for
   the calculation of amorphous fraction by calorimetry in atomized
   powders. Thus, a quantitative estimation of cooling rate corresponding
   to each powder size and the variation of amorphous fraction with cooling
   rate are presented. Higher cooling rate promoted by smaller powder size
   and helium atomization atmosphere is found to yield higher amorphous
   fraction. At relatively high cooling rates Neutron Diffraction technique
   yields higher amorphous fractions than the Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry technique. The critical cooling rate for amorphous phase
   formation under unconstrained solidification conditions using Impulse
   Atomization is found to be similar to 15,000 Ks(-1) which corresponds to
   a powder size of about 100 mu m atomized in nitrogen or about 200 mu m
   atomized in helium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{173}},
Pages = {{1154-1162}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we discuss a design of fuzzy associative structures
   (memories) realized within the framework of fuzzy clustering.
   Associative memories are inherently direction-free structures (and the
   recall of objects can be realized for any variable or a subset of
   variables). Fuzzy clustering being direction-free comes here as a sound
   design alternative. Two recall proposals are studied: one involves
   prototypes (being the key descriptors of the structure of the data) and
   their activation in the presence of partially available data to be
   recalled whereas the second proposal involves fuzzy correlation matrices
   and in principle exhibits some resemblance with a standard correlation
   associative memories. In the setting of associative memories, Fuzzy
   C-Means (FCM) is studied. The recall error is discussed with regard to
   the essential parameters of the FCM (the number of clusters and the
   fuzzification coefficient). Furthermore we discuss an optimization of
   the distance function used in the clustering algorithm realized with
   regard to the recall error. Experimental results are provided along with
   a comparative study involving correlation-based associative memories.

   combined adsorption/biodegradation processes despite the lack of
   research investigating their individual contributions. Presently, the
   NAs removals due to the individual processes of adsorption and
   biodegradation in OSPW bioreactors were determined using sodium azide to
   inhibit biodegradation. For raw OSPW, after 28 days biodegradation and
   adsorption contributed 14\% and 63\% of NA removal, respectively. For
   ozonated OSPW, biodegradation removed 18\% of NAs while adsorption
   reduced NAs by 73\%. Microbial community 454-pyrosequencing of
   bioreactor matrices indicated the importance of biodegradation given the
   diverse carbon degrading families including Acidobacteriaceae,
   Ectothiorhodospiraceae, and Comamonadaceae. Overall, results highlight
   the ability to determine specific processes of NAs removals in the
   combined treatment process in the presence of diverse bacteria metabolic
   groups found in GAC bioreactors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{An Assessment of Six Muscle Spindle Models for Predicting Sensory
   Information during Human Wrist Movements}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: The muscle spindle is an important sensory organ for
   proprioceptive information, yet there have been few attempts to use
   Shannon information theory to quantify the capacity of human muscle
   spindles to encode sensory input.
   Methods: Computer simulations linked kinematics, to biomechanics, to six
   muscle spindle models that generated predictions of firing rate. The
   predicted firing rates were compared to firing rates of human muscle
   spindles recorded during a step-tracking (center-out) task to validate
   their use The models were then used to predict firing rates during
   random movements with statistical properties matched to the ergonomics
   of human wrist movements. The data were analyzed for entropy and mutual
   information.
   Results: Three of the six models produced predictions that approximated
   the firing rate of human spindles during the step-tracking task. For
   simulated random movements these models predicted mean rates of 16.0 4.1
   imp/s (mean SD), peak firing rates <50 imp/s and zero firing rate during
   an average of 25\% of the movement. The average entropy of the neural
   response was 4.1 + 0.3 bits and is an estimate of the maximum
   information that could be carried by muscles spindles during
   ecologically valid movements. The information about tendon displacement
   preserved in the neural response was 0.10 0.05 bits per symbol: whereas
   1.25 0.30 bits per symbol of velocity input were preserved in the neural
   response of the spindle models.
   Conclusions: Muscle spindle models, originally based on cat experiments,
   have predictive value for modeling responses of human muscle spindles
   with minimal parameter optimization. These models predict more than 10
   fold more velocity over length information encoding during ecologically
   valid movements. These results establish theoretical parameters for
   developing neuroprostheses for proprioceptive function.}},

Title = {{The general theory of decisions}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{327}},
Pages = {{125-148}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{The majority of the existing decision theories, starting from von
   Neumann and Morgenstern Expected Utility theory, are based on sound
   mathematical background and yielded good results. However, they are
   developed for solving particular decision situations. Consequently,
   nowadays there is no theory to unite main directions of decision
   analysis. The existing main theories suffer from several important
   disadvantages: (i) use of numerical techniques which contrast with
   real-world imperfect information; (ii) the assumptions of wellstructured
   knowledge about future objective conditions; (iii) the use of
   probability measures whereas real-world probabilities are imprecise;
   (iv) the use binary logic-based preference relations, whereas real
   preferences may be vague; (v) no account for the fact that a human being
   reasons with linguistic description of information; (vi) parametrical
   modeling of behavioral determinants without account for interaction;
   (vii) missing partial reliability of real decision-relevant information.
   Thus, it becomes needed to develop a general theory of decisions that
   would be free of the limitations outlined above. In this paper, we
   propose the fundamentals of the new general theory of decisions which is
   based on complex consideration of imperfect decision-relevant
   information issues and behavioral aspects. We illustrate that the
   existing theories including Expected Utility of von Neumann and
   Morgenstern, Prospect Theory, Choquet Expected Utility, Cumulative
   Prospect Theory and other theories are special cases of the suggested
   general theory of decisions. We provide axioms and principles, the
   corresponding mathematical methodologies of decision analysis and
   auxiliary formal techniques. The application of the suggested theory is
   illustrated with the aid of a benchmark complex decision problem. (C)

Abstract = {{A ceramic-ceramic (CERCER) fuel is selected as a dedicated composite
   fuel for an Accelerator Driven System (ADS), with
   minor-actinide-enriched ceramic fuel particles dispersed in a ceramic
   MgO matrix. The multi-scale simulation method of the irradiation-induced
   thermo-mechanical behavior evolution in the CERCER fuel pellets is
   developed. The semi-analytical fission-induced gaseous swelling model is
   established with considering recrystallization process and gas atom
   resolution in fuel grain scale. It is involved in the macro-scale
   three-dimensional large-deformation incremental constitutive relation
   for fuel particles. The stress update algorithms are developed
   respectively for the fuel, and the MgO matrix in which different
   fission-induced creep effects are taken into account. The user
   subroutines to define their mechanical constitutive relations are
   correspondingly written and validated. The simulation results indicate
   that (1) recrystallization leads to accelerated intergranular bubble
   swelling, and the maximum bubble swelling locates in the central
   particle where the temperature is the highest; (2) the creep coefficient
   in the MgO fission-induced creep model has a remarkable effect on its
   mechanical behavior evolution; and it can be determined by the fracture
   pattern in the matrix; (3) the matrix can effectively shorten the radial
   deformation of the composite pellet. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   determine the volume fraction of the phase that forms before bainite,
   i.e., quasi-polygonal ferrite. BIT analysis is applied to continuous
   cooling where a two phase microstructure is formed of quasi-polygonal
   ferrite and mixed bainitic ferrite and bainite/martensite. The estimated
   intrinsic hardness of the components based on BIT is compared with
   isothermal transformation results and the hardness is calculated based
   on the contribution of strengthening mechanisms. (C) 2015 Published by

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-80}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Sustaining high data rates over an indoor broadband power line
   communication (PLC) link is a challenging task due to the significant
   attenuation of high frequency signals transmitted over power cables.
   Repeaters are often used to alleviate the problem of signal attenuation,
   however, this comes at a loss of multiplexing gain. On the other hand,
   modern relaying concepts, as used in wireless systems, are not as
   effective in PLC setups due to the absence of diversity improvement. In
   this study, the authors address this issue and propose a new approach to
   improve the multiplexing gain of relay-aided PLC systems. The authors
   consider a multi-user indoor PLC scenario where all users want to share
   their data. For this setup, the authors then advocate the application of
   amplify-and-forward (AF) multi-way relaying (MWR). Considering the
   practical constraints of an indoor PLC system, the authors study the
   achievable data rates of AF MWR, and compare them to those achievable
   with direct (non-cooperative) transmission and conventional relaying
   schemes. The simulations demonstrate that depending on the network
   topology, MWR can result in significant performance improvement. The
   authors further discuss how their rate analysis can be exploited to
   decrease the energy consumption in the system.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis (PCA) serves as the most fundamental
   technique in multivariate statistical process monitoring. However, other
   than determining contributions to a fault from each variable based on
   the pre-selected major principal components (PCs), the PCA-based fault
   diagnosis with an optimal selection of PCs is seldom investigated. This
   paper presents a novel Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and optimal
   principal components (OPCs)-based Bayesian method for efficient
   multimode fault diagnosis. First, the GMM and Bayesian inference is
   utilized to identify the operating mode, and then local PCA model is
   established in each mode. Second, given that the various principal
   components (PCs) may contain distinct fault signatures, the behavior of
   each PC in local PCA is examined and the OPCs are selected through
   stochastic optimization algorithm. Based on the OPCs, a Bayesian
   diagnosis system is then formulated to identify the fault statuses in a
   probability manner. Performance of GMM-OPC Bayesian diagnosis is
   examined through a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman challenge
   process. The efficiency and feasibility are demonstrated. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel sequential scenario reduction framework for
   general optimization problem is proposed. The proposed method extends
   the previous work (Li and Floudas, 2014) and aims to tackle optimization
   problems with a large number of uncertain parameters and a huge number
   of scenarios generated from the factorial combination. The proposed
   method first ranks the uncertain parameters based on their effects on
   the optimal objective using global sensitivity analysis. Then, the
   parameters are sequentially considered in generating uncertainty
   scenarios. This method can essentially reduce the computational efforts
   needed for evaluating the objective values of all scenarios, which is
   often impractical for a huge number of scenarios. Criteria for
   quantifying the quality of scenario reduction are also proposed based on
   robust optimization and scenario optimization. Case studies are
   presented to illustrate the sequential scenario reduction framework and
   the results verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2015
