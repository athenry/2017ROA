Abstract = {{To better elucidate the role of macrophages in bone morphogenetic
   protein (BMP)-induced bone repair, this study evaluated the effects of
   macrophages on the migration, metabolic activity and BMP-2-induced
   osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).
   Human monocytes were induced into a macrophage phenotype, and the
   conditioned media (CM) from undifferentiated monocytes and
   differentiated macrophages were collected for treatment of hMSCs.
   Expression levels of osteoblastic marker genes, alkaline phosphatase
   (ALP) activity and mineral deposition were assessed. The migration of
   hMSCs was significantly decreased after treatment with the macrophage CM
   (but not monocyte CM), in a dose-dependent manner. Significant
   inhibition of hMSC metabolism was observed on days 3 and 7 after
   treatment with the macrophage CM. The osteoblastic marker genes analyzed
   (ALP, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and runt-related transcription
   factor-2) after exposure of hMSCs to BMP-2 were all significantly
   downregulated in cells treated with the macrophage CM. The hMSCs treated
   with macrophage CM showed significantly decreased enzymatic activity of
   ALP and calcium content compared with those treated with monocyte CM or
   basal medium. High levels of interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha found in macrophage CM may mediate these observed effects
   on hMSCs. We conclude that macrophage CM suppressed the BMP-2-induced
   osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, suggesting that macrophages might
   contribute to decreased osteogenic effects of BMPs in a clinical
   setting. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Title = {{Adhesion mechanism in a DOPA-deficient foot protein from green mussels}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{5640-5648}},
Abstract = {{The holdfast or byssus of Asian green mussels, Perna viridis, contains a
   foot protein, pvfp-1, that differs in two respects from all other known
   adhesive mussel foot proteins (mfp): (1) instead of the hallmark
   L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) residues in mfp-1, for example,
   pvfp-1 contains C-2-mannosyl-7-hydroxytryptophan (Man7OHTrp). (2) In
   addition, pvfp-1 chains are not monomeric like mfp-1 but trimerized by
   collagen and coiled-coil domains near the carboxy terminus after a
   typical domain of tandemly repeated decapeptides. Here, the contribution
   of these peculiarities to adhesion was examined using a surface forces
   apparatus (SFA). Unlike previously studied mfp-1s, pvfp-1 showed
   significant adhesion to mica and, in symmetric pvfp-1 films, substantial
   cohesive interactions were present at pH 5.5. The role of Man7OHTrp in
   adhesion is not clear, and a DOPA-like role for Man7OHTrp in metal
   complexation (e.g., Cu2+, Fe3+) was not observed. Instead, cation-pi
   interactions with low desolvation penalty between Man7OHTrp and lysyl
   side chains and conformational changes (raveling and unraveling of
   collagen helix and coiled-coil domains) are the best explanations for
   the strong adhesion between pvfp-1 monomolecular films. The strong
   adhesion mechanism induced by cation-pi interactions and conformational
   changes in pvfp-1 provides new insights for the development of
   biomimetic underwater adhesives.}},

Journal = {{BIOFOULING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{417-431}},
Abstract = {{The impact of cranberry juice was investigated with respect to the
   initial adhesion of three isogenic strains of the bacterium Burkholderia
   cepacia with different extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) producing
   capacities, viz. a wild-type cepacian EPS producer PC184 and its mutant
   strains PC184rml with reduced EPS production and PC184bceK with a
   deficiency in EPS production. Adhesion experiments conducted in a
   parallel-plate flow chamber demonstrated that, in the absence of
   cranberry juice, strain PC184 had a significantly higher adhesive
   capacity compared to the mutant strains. In the presence of cranberry
   juice, the adhesive capacity of the EPS-producing strain PC184 was
   largely reduced, while cranberry juice had little impact on the adhesion
   behavior of either mutant strain. Thermodynamic modeling supported the
   results from adhesion experiments. Surface force apparatus (SFA) and
   scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies demonstrated a strong
   association between cranberry juice components and bacterial EPS. It was
   concluded that cranberry juice components could impact bacterial initial
   adhesion by adhering to the EPS and impairing the adhesive capacity of
   the cells, which provides an insight into the development of novel
   treatment strategies to block the biofilm formation associated with
   bacterial infection.}},

   The kinetics of the reaction of chloride salts with steam in diluted

   solid salt particles. Four inhibitors based on alkaline-earth compounds
   were effective in reducing the initial rate of hydrolysis, thereby

Pages = {{291-307}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether the order or
   the strategy of management system standards (MSSs) implementation in an
   organization determines the level of integration of its standardized
   MSSs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Groups of organizations that follow
   different implementation sequences have been obtained descriptively
   using a sample of 435 Spanish organizations, registered to two MSSs (ISO
   9001 and ISO 14001) at the minimum. Differences with respect to the size
   of the organizations are also studied.
   Findings - The results obtained show six different groups of
   organizations that follow different sequences of implementation and that
   have different levels of integration of their MSSs. Among the more
   interesting findings, organizations that had implemented quality and
   environmental MSSs simultaneously and have 50 employees or less achieve
   higher levels of integration compared to other organizations in the
   sample.
   Originality/value - The paper analyses those sequences of management
   systems implementation that allow organizations to achieve higher levels
   of integration and presents a possible pattern for the companies
   initiating the integration process.}},

Pages = {{271-276}},
Abstract = {{A steel plate shear wall dual system consists of a moment resisting
   frame plus thin infill shear panels. In the literature, it is stated
   that the ultimate lateral load bearing capacity of such a dual system
   can be evaluated by a simple addition of the discrete frame, brought
   about by the formation of plastic hinges and that of detached infill
   panel evaluated when yield patterns form along their diagonal tension
   folds. However, more recent studies show that there is an interaction
   effect between the wall and the frame and that the combined system can
   resist additional loads. In other words, the principle of superposition
   does not apply to this dual lateral load resisting system. This super
   added value may arise from two factors: (a) the influence of beam and
   column rigidities on the buckling and ultimate load bearing capacity of
   panel, and (b) the influence of the panel on the frame. This article
   studies the latter effect, otherwise known as the gusset plate effect in
   shear-walled frames.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a combination of two
   novel switched reluctance generators (SRG) as a suitable prototype to
   produce electrical energy using natural, renewable and variable speed
   energy resource. The paper focuses on the voltage generation analysis of
   two special SRGs.
   Design/methodology/approach - To evaluate the proposed configurations,
   their structures are introduced firstly, and the output voltages of both
   two generators are analyzed numerically via three dimensional finite
   element method. After that the obtained results are validated on
   laboratory set up. Moreover, the main parameters of each one causing the
   output voltages are studied. The proposed generators have been
   manufactured within a common physical framework. This framework consists
   of two magnetically independent stator and rotor sets (layers), where
   each stator set includes four salient poles, while the rotor comprises
   of two salient poles with almost equal arc lengths and no windings. The
   first generator called Field assisted SRG which has a stationary reel,
   and so the field coil wrapped around it, and it is placed between the
   two-stator sets, whereas in the second type named Self excited SRG,
   there is no field coil.
   Findings - Via experimental and numerical analysis, it is substantiated
   that this interesting combination can help users to produce electrical
   energy from low speeds to high speeds of performance through employing
   each of these generators in special case of study and application
   separately.
   Originality/value - This beneficial characteristic of two proposed SRGs
   can be noticed as a suitable trait in different industries such as
   aerospace, automobile and production of electrical energy via windmills.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a theoretical model for a cascade two-stage Peltier
   device based on the electrothermal dynamics of Peltier modules and the
   heat balance equations of the interfacing materials. Both open-and
   closed-loop data are used to tune the scaling factors of the nonlinear
   model. The effectiveness of the model is validated over a large
   temperature range with the experimental data from a thermal cycling
   application of the Peltier device used to perform the polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR), a genetic amplification technique having important
   medical diagnostic applications. Based on the theoretical model, two
   novel nonlinear controllers are designed for a PCR cycling temperature
   profile. The first controller is an extension of conventional
   input-to-state feedback linearization design to a class of nonlinear
   systems that is not only affine on the control but also affine on the
   square of control inputs. The desired performance is achieved by tuning
   the parameters to control the convergent rates of the tracking errors.
   The second one is a switching controller design, which switches between
   a nonlinear pseudo-proportional-integral-differential (PID)/state
   feedback controller and a linear time-invariant proportional-integral
   (PI)/state feedback controller. A Lyapunov function method is used to
   develop the algorithm for the nonlinear controller, whose parameter
   values at the switching time are used in the linear controller. Such a
   combination of linear and nonlinear controllers could reduce the
   calculation burden and minimize the steady-state errors. Both
   controllers are tested with our simulation model and implemented in a
   microcontroller. We verified the designs with improved temperature
   tracking performances compared to our earlier linear switching design on
   reduced overshoots (<0.5 degrees C) and settling time (8-10 s faster).
   The modeling methodology and the feedback linearization-based controller
   design are scalable and both nonlinear designs can avoid future local
   model identifications when applied to different references, therefore,
   are easily extended to other thermal applications.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids, NAs (classical formula CnH2n+zO2, where n is the
   carbon numbers, z represents zero or negative even integers), found in
   oil sands process waters (OSPWs), are toxic to aquatic environments
   depending upon several factors such as pH, salinity, molecular size and
   chemical structure of NAs. Among various available methods,
   biodegradation seems to be generally the most cost-effective method for
   decreasing concentrations of NAs (n <= 21) and reducing their associated
   toxicity in OSPW, however the mechanism by which the biodegradation of
   NAs occurs are poorly understood. Ozonation is superior over
   biodegradation in decreasing higher molecular weight alkyl branched NAs
   (preferentially, n >= 22, -6 >= z >= -12) as well as enabling
   accelerated biodegradation and reducing toxicity. Photolysis (UV at 254
   nm) is effective in cleaving higher molecular weight NAs into smaller
   fragments that will be easier for microorganisms to degrade, whereas
   photocatalysis can metabolize selective NAs (0 >= z >= -6) efficiently
   and minimize their associated toxicity. Phytoremediation is applicable
   for metabolizing specific NAs (O-2, O-3, O-4, and O-5 species) and
   minimizing their associated toxicities. Petroleum coke (PC) adsorption
   is effective in reducing the more structurally complex NAs
   (preferentially 12 >= n >= 18 and z = -10, -12) and their toxicity in
   OSPWs, depending upon the PC content, pH and temperature. Several
   factors have influence on the degradation of NAs in OSPWs and aquatic
   environments, which include molecular mass and chemical structure of
   NAs, sediment structure, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients,
   and bacteria types.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for etching millimetre-deep trenches in
   commercial grade PMMA using deep-UV at 254 nm. The method is based on
   consecutive cycles of irradiation and development of the exposed areas,
   respectively. The exposure segment is performed using an inexpensive,
   in-house built irradiation box while the development part is
   accomplished using an isopropyl alcohol (IPA):H2O developer. The method
   was tested and characterized by etching various dimension square test
   structures in commercial grade, mirrored acrylic. The undercut of the
   sidewalls due to the uncollimated nature of the irradiation light was
   dramatically alleviated by using a honeycomb metallic grid in between
   the irradiation source and the acrylic substrate and by rotating the
   latter using a direct current (DC) motor-driven stage. By using an
   extremely affordable set-up and non-toxic, environmentally friendly
   materials and substances, this process represents an excellent
   alternative to microfabricating microfluidic devices in particular and
   high aspect ratio structures in general using PMMA as substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Rotary comb-drive electrostatic actuators with smooth vertical sidewalls
   were designed and fabricated for photonic applications. Silicon on
   insulator (SOI) wafers with device layer thicknesses of up to 100 mu m
   and oxide layers of 1-2 mu m were used. Structures were fabricated
   through bulk micromachining of the handle layer followed by removal of
   the buried oxide. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of the device layer
   defined the comb structure with simultaneous release of the moving arm.
   Thick photoresist and oxide masking layers were used for the high aspect
   ratio deep etches. Notching effects or depth variations of device layers
   were not observed. Etch/passivation cycles in DRIE were optimized to
   obtain smooth sidewalls. Traces of etch scallops were confined only to
   the first few microns of the top and bottom edges of the reflecting
   sidewall. A movable arm length of 2 mm with a maximum rotation of 2.8
   degrees was achieved. The edge deflection was over 100 mu m at 100
   volts. The fabricated structure provides a long reflecting sidewall that
   is accessible for hybrid integration in three dimensional space. The
   fabricated structures can be reliably operated in the kilohertz range.}},

Abstract = {{A smart approach has been developed to form nanoassemblies with tunable
   shell's functions by simply mixing three different block copolymers with
   a common temperature-responsive segment at 25 degrees C. The formation
   of nanoassemblies and their thermodynamic stability are driven by the
   hydrophobic interaction of the common
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-(isobutoxymethyl) acrylamide) (P
   (NIPAAm-co-BMAAm)) segment which has a lower critical solution
   temperature (LCST) below 25 degrees C. Three series of copolymers with
   different polymer structures, acrylamide-type
   P(NIPAAm-co-N-(hydroxymethyl) acrylamide (HMAAm))-b-P(NIPAAm-co-BMAAm),
   poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-b-P (NIPAAm-co-BMAAm), and methacrylate-type
   poly(2-lactobionamidoethyl methacrylate)
   (PLAMA)-b-P(NIPAAm-co-HMAAm)-b-P(NIPAAm-co-BMAAm), were successfully
   polymerized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)
   polymerization. Regardless of the block copolymer types the selected
   block copolymers successfully formed a stable core-shell assembly with
   the collapsed common segments forming the inner core by simple mixing in
   aqueous solutions. The size distributions were monodisperse and
   relatively narrow when all or two of these three block copolymers were
   mixed, while addition of free-copolymers without the common segment did
   not affect the assembly formation. The ratio of functional segments into
   shell could be easily tuned by changing the mixing ratio of three block
   copolymers. This system is highly expected to find use as smart
   nano-carriers for encapsulation, targeting, and triggered release of
   drug under control through a combination of temperature-responsive
   chains, accessible functionality, and choice of sugar moiety.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{1078-1105}},
Abstract = {{Albeit weather surveillance radar (WSR)-88D stage III radar rainfall
   (RR) data can generally capture the spatial variability of precipitation
   fields, its rainfall depth for cold seasons dominated by stratiform
   storms tends to be underestimated. This study proposed merging WSR-88D
   stage III data with rain gauge data using the Haar wavelet scheme and
   compared its with that merged by the statistical objective analysis
   (SOA) scheme. The idea is to exploit the strength of radar that better
   captures the spatial variability of rainfall and that of rain gauges
   that measure the rainfall depth more accurately. A Haar wavelet was used
   because of its simplicity and the appealing physical interpretation of
   its coefficients as directional gradients of rainfall, whose spatial
   correlation structure was accounted for through a polynomial function.
   From analysing 89 storms over the Blue River Basin (BRB), Oklahoma,
   during 1994-2000, the results show that the underestimation problem of
   WSR-88D RR was generally more pronounced during the cold season
   dominated by stratiform storms than warm season dominated by convective
   storms. The wavelet scheme was better than SOA in reducing the radar's
   underestimation of rainfall depths while maintaining the spatial
   variability of the original radar data, as shown by its merged rainfall
   patterns and the more accurate stream-flow hydrographs simulated by a
   semi-distributed, physics-based rainfall-runoff model - semi-distributed
   physics-based hydrologic model using remote sensing (DPHM-RS) - driven
   by the merged data.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{82-88}},
Abstract = {{Herein, a coupled depth-averaged (DA) and Reynolds-averaged
   Navier-Stokes (RANS) model is developed for steady plane open-channel
   flows with or without the assumption of hydrostatic pressure (HP).
   Initially, the water surface and the DA velocity are estimated using a
   DA model by neglecting non-uniform velocity (NUV) and non-HP (NHP).
   Then, in the RANS model, the horizontal momentum and the continuity
   equations are solved for the horizontal and vertical velocity
   components, respectively, with the water surface as a fixed
   zero-pressure boundary. For the non-hydrostatic RANS model, the pressure
   Poisson equation is solved for NHP. A correction term is introduced in
   the Reynolds horizontal momentum equation for mass balance. Once the
   RANS model results are available, the DA model results are updated
   iteratively by incorporating the effects of NUV and NHP. The agreement
   between the model and experimental data is quite satisfactory along with
   an excellent computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the amount of energy dissipation that can be achieved by
   simple jet diffusion in a confined environment has considerable
   practical importance. Previous works on jets in confined enclosures have
   indicated that the entrainment of a recirculating fluid greatly enhances
   the dissipation of the inflow kinetic energy and reduces the length of
   the potential core. In the present experimental work, a vertical jet
   issuing into a rectangular chamber is investigated under two types of
   confinement and three locations of entry. Detailed velocity measurements
   for an eccentric jet are obtained to assess the evolution of the axial
   jet centreline velocity and the turbulent characteristics. These results
   are compared with classical jet behaviour and jets under other confined
   conditions. A method to predict the energy dissipation attained by jet
   diffusion in a confined chamber is also proposed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POROUS MEDIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{In this study, generalized transport equations are combined with
   partition concepts to construct modified transport equations for the
   immiscible, incompressible, and vertical three-phase flow of fluids.
   These equations are used to demonstrate that failure to include
   interfacial coupling in the mathematical description of such flow can
   introduce significant amounts of model error into the equations used to
   describe vertical three-phase flow through porous media. It was found
   that when the magnitudes of the potential gradient and the net buoyant
   force for the wetting phase were of the same order, failure to account
   for interfacial coupling introduced a significant amount of model error
   into the analysis. The model error for the wetting phase was found to be
   larger than that for the two nonwetting phases. If the potential
   gradient for the wetting phase was an order of magnitude larger than the
   net buoyant force, neglect of interfacial coupling effects introduced
   smaller amounts of model error into the analysis. Also, it was found
   that a failure to take proper account of interfacial coupling in the
   mathematical description of three-phase countercurrent flow resulted in
   the introduction of more model error than was the case for cocurrent
   flow. Finally, it was determined that the modified transport equations
   describing three-phase countercurrent flow were case dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Process system design, such as those engineering projects being
   developed in the global energy sector, involves well-established
   empirical engineering knowledge, standards and industrial codes. Their
   effective and efficient implementation has critical consequences to the
   success of projects. In a mechanical engineering domain, process system
   design covers process-flow modelling, pressure vessel and piping layout
   design, detailed structure design, etc. The authors are motivated to
   investigate an effective method for achieving the knowledge-driven
   design to address the efficiency drawback in traditional process system
   design applications. This article proposes a systematic method to embed
   in-depth engineering knowledge and to realise smart design changes in a
   unified feature-based approach. To prove the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed method, a process fuel and water supply
   system has been comprehensively designed in the conceptual design stage.
   The findings of this research work are presented with some critical
   discussions at the end of this article. The authors believe that this

Abstract = {{The optimization of biomass and oil productivities in heterotrophic
   cultures of Auxenochlorella protothecoides was achieved using a
   non-linear model-based approach. A 10-fold increase in the average
   biomass productivity, and a 16-fold increase in the maximum
   productivity, was observed with respect to batch cultures as a result of
   the proposed optimization strategy. Final cell density in the optimized
   culture was 144 g/L (dry weight), with 49.4\%w/w oil content. Maximum
   lipid productivity was 20.16 g/L d, achieved during the exponential
   growth phase at an average cell density of 86 g/L. Lipid productivity in
   the optimized microalgal culture was higher than previously reported
   values for other oleaginous microorganisms. Oil composition analysis
   showed that the oil has a high quality as biodiesel precursor. The
   higher productivity and excellent lipid profile of the optimized
   microalgal culture make A. protothecoides an exceptional source for

Abstract = {{Resource scheduling, or the allocation of resources over time, is a
   challenging problem in large-scale or multiple-project environments.
   Traditional network scheduling techniques are ineffective in modeling
   the dynamic nature and resource interactions of large or multiunit
   projects. This paper presents a simulation-based auction protocol (SBAP)
   to solve resource scheduling problems in large-scale construction
   projects. SBAP is a hybrid framework that integrates multi agent
   resource allocation (MARA) in a simulation environment. SBAP deploys a
   centralized resource allocation approach, referred to as an auction
   protocol, whereby agents bid on different combinations of resources at
   the start of a simulation cycle. Agents attempt to improve their
   individual welfare by acquiring a combination of resources; an
   auctioneer looks at the entire system and allocates resources to the
   agents using a combinatorial algorithm to maximize an overall objective
   function (e.g., maximizing the system's revenue or minimizing total
   costs). The auction is repeated on a regular basis. Simulation is also
   employed in large-scale projects to track the availability of resources,
   capture and release the resources, and satisfy constraints of the
   problem. This paper demonstrates the architecture of the SBAP framework
   and discusses implementation of SBAP in a real case study of crane
   allocation in an industrial project. DOI:

Abstract = {{The effects of different aspects of working hours on performance,
   including length of work and rest periods, time of day, and amount of
   set overtime, have been studied separately by scholars from different
   disciplines, including construction. Most of these studies have
   accounted for specific factors and for specific types of work. Current
   approaches fall short of enabling a work manager to estimate the impact
   of various working-hour arrangements on productivity with a reasonable
   degree of accuracy. We have developed a dynamic modeling tool that can
   be used for estimating expected productivity in a range of construction
   jobs for different working-hour arrangements. Through this dynamic
   modeling tool, construction managers can see the expected effects of
   working-hour changes on productivity and adjust work-hour schedules to
   improve productivity. To test the applicability of the model, it has
   been applied to a real construction case, and the effects of different
   working-hour arrangements on productivity have been investigated. DOI:

   Production by Suppression of the AP-1/p38 Pathway}},
Journal = {{MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Nanostructured, self-assembling peptides hold promise for a variety of
   regenerative medical applications such as 3D cell culture systems,
   accelerated wound healing, and nerve repair. The aim of this study was
   to determine whether the self-assembling peptide K5 can be applied as a
   carrier of anti-inflammatory drugs. First, we examined whether the K5
   self-assembling peptide itself can modulate various cellular
   inflammatory responses. We found that peptide K5 significantly
   suppressed the release of tumor-necrosis-factor-(TNF-) alpha and
   prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) from RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal
   macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similarly, there was
   inhibition of cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 mRNA expression assessed by
   real-time PCR, indicating that the inhibition is at the transcriptional
   level. In agreement with this finding, peptide K5 suppressed the
   translocation of the transcription factors activator protein (AP-1) and
   c-Jun and inhibited upstream inflammatory effectors including mitogen
   activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38, and mitogen-activated protein
   kinase kinase 3/6 (MKK 3/6). Whether this peptide exerts its effects via
   a transmembrane or cytoplasmic receptor is not clear. However, our data
   strongly suggest that the nanostructured, self-assembling peptide K5 may
   possess significant anti-inflammatory activity via suppression of the
   p38/AP-1 pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are pursued for cell-based
   therapies of bone defects. Successful use of hMSCs will require them to
   be osteogenically differentiated before transplantation. This study was
   intended to determine the optimal combination(s) of supplements needed
   for inducing osteogenesis in hMSCs.
   Methods: The hMSCs were cultured with combinations of
   beta-glycerophosphate, dexamethasone (Dex), vitamin D3 (Vit-D3), basic
   fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and bone morphogenetic protein-2
   (BMP-2) to assess cell growth and osteogenesis. Osteogenic responses of
   the supplements were evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity,
   mineralization, and gene expression of ALP, Runx2, bone sialoprotein,
   and osteonectin. Adipogenesis was characterized based on Oil Red O
   staining, gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated
   receptor.2, and adipocyte protein-2.
   Results: Dex was found to be essential for mineralization of hMSCs.
   Cultures treated with Dex (100 nM), Vit-D3 (10/50 nM), and BMP-2 (500
   ng/mL) demonstrated maximal calcification and up-regulation of ALP and
   bone sialoprotein expression. However, adipogenesis was up-regulated in
   parallel with osteogenesis in these cultures, as evident by the presence
   of lipid droplets and significant up-regulation of peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor.2 and adipocyte protein-2 expression. An
   optimal condition was obtained at Dex (10 nM) and BMP-2 (500 ng/mL) for
   mineralization without increasing adipogenesis-related markers. The bFGF
   mitigated osteogenesis and enhanced adipogenesis. Vit-D3 appears
   essential for calcification only in the presence of bFGF.
   Conclusion: Treatment of hMSCs with appropriate supplements at optimal
   doses results in robust osteogenic differentiation with minimal
   adipogenesis. These findings could be used in the cultivation of hMSCs
   for cell-based strategies for bone regeneration.}},

Volume = {{520}},

Abstract = {{Chromium thin films were deposited on SiO2/Si wafers using two
   sputtering systems with different levels of cleanliness, and at argon
   sputtering pressures varying between 0.13 and 0.93 Pa. Films from the
   two systems grown under identical sputtering conditions had
   significantly different resistivity values that are shown to be due to
   differences in residual oxygen in the chambers. Electrical transport
   measurements were conducted on the series of grown films to investigate
   the influence of argon pressure on film electrical resistivity. The
   films morphology, microstructure and composition were characterized
   using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   Significant differences were found in Cr thin films sputtered at
   different sputtering pressures; differences in resistivity performance
   and microstructure were noted. This change was shown to be due to the
   transition from porous structure to a denser microstructure. The Cr
   films sputtered at high pressure contained large quantities of oxygen
   when exposed to air. Some of the oxygen is added to the film during the
   deposition depending on the deposition rate and the base pressure of the
   sputtering system. The rest is incorporated into the film once it is
   exposed to air. The amount of oxygen added at this stage depends on the
   structure of the film and would be minimal for the films deposited at
   low sputtering pressures. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and analysis result for asynchronous
   rendezvous control of multiagent systems with continuous-time dynamics
   and intermittent interactions. The protocol-designing strategies only
   impose weak restrictions on anticipated-way-point sets (from which the
   way-points are selected) and path-planning of each agent and can be
   applied to the networks of arbitrary dimensional subsystems. Explicitly,
   the anticipated-way-point sets are in a polytope-like form and the path
   between any two consecutive way-points is required to be included within
   the minimum convex region covering the two associated
   anticipated-way-point sets. Under the assumption of directed and
   switching interaction topology and the assumption of intermittent and
   asynchronous interactions with time-varying delays, we perform the
   set-valued consensus analysis on the evolution of anticipated-way-point
   sets with respect to update times and provide mild sufficient conditions
   for the solvability of the asynchronous rendezvous problem. The proof
   techniques rely much on graph theory and nonnegative matrix theory. The
   obtained result extends greatly the existing work in the literature and
   several examples demonstrate its broad potential applications.
   Particularly, additional distributed control rules, different from the
   circumcenter algorithm, are devised for network connectivity

Abstract = {{We applied a multiscale modeling approach that involves the
   statistical-mechanical three-dimensional reference interaction site
   model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure approximation (3D-RISM-KH
   molecular theory of solvation) as well as density functional theory
   (DFT) of electronic structure to study the role of water in aggregation
   of the asphaltene model compound
   4,4'-bis(2-pyren-1-yl-ethyl)-2,2'-bipyridine (PBP) {[}X. Tan, H. Fenniri
   and M. R. Gray, Energy Fuels, 2008, 22, 715]. The solvation free energy
   and potential of mean force predicted by 3D-RISM-KH reveal favorable
   pathways for disaggregation of PBP dimers in pure versus water-saturated
   chloroform solvent. The water density distribution functions elucidate
   hydrogen bonding preferences and water bridge formation between PBP
   monomers. The Delta G(298) values of -5 to -7 kcal mol(-1) for transfer
   of water molecules in chloroform to a state interacting with PBP
   molecules are in agreement with experimental results. Geometry
   optimization and thermochemistry analysis of PBP dimers with and without
   water bridges using WB97Xd/6-31G(d, p) predict that both PBP
   dimerization and dimer stabilization by water bridges are spontaneous
   (Delta G(298) < 0). The H-1 NMR chemical shifts of PBP monomers and
   dimers predicted using the gauge-independent atomic orbital method and
   polarizable continuum model for solvation in chloroform are in an
   excellent agreement with the experimental results for dilute and
   concentrated PBP solutions in chloroform, respectively {[}X. Tan, H.
   Fenniri and M. R. Gray, Energy Fuels, 2009, 23, 3687]. The DFT
   calculations of PBP dimers with explicit water show that bridges
   containing 1-3 water molecules lead to stabilization of PBP dimers.
   Additional water molecules form hydrogen bonds with these bridges and
   de-shield the PBP protons, negating the effect of water on the H-1(C3)
   NMR chemical shift of PBP, in agreement with experiment. The Delta
   G(298) results show that hydrogen bonding to water and water-promoted
   polynuclear assembly bridging is as important as p-p interactions for
   asphaltene aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Far- and mid-infrared photoacoustic (PA) spectra of tetracene,
   pentacene, perylene and pyrene were acquired in this study. Far-infrared
   data were obtained at wavenumbers down to similar to 80cm(-1) using
   large-amplitude phase modulation in a step-scan spectrometer; many
   previously unreported bands were observed in these spectra. For each
   compound, the fingerprint region of the mid-infrared spectrum
   (approximately 400-2000cm(-1)) contained a large number of bands
   correlated with vibrations that are predicted to be either infrared or
   Raman active. In addition, numerous combination and overtone bands
   appeared in the mid-infrared spectra. This PA investigation provides the
   most detailed spectral data known for these four aromatic compounds.

Abstract = {{In a 1-D linear vehicular ad hoc network (1-DL-VANET), some vehicles may
   leave the network (e. g., at highway exits), which may make the
   1-DL-VANET disconnected. Thus, it is important to analyze the
   connectivity of the 1-DL-VANET. When removal of any (k-1) arbitrary
   nodes from a network does not disconnect the network, the network is
   said to be k-connected. In this paper, we investigate the k-connectivity
   of the 1-DL-VANET. Sufficient and necessary conditions are derived for
   the 1-DL-VANET to be k-connected, and based on this, a method is
   provided, with the help of matrix decomposition, to obtain expression of
   the probability of the 1-DL-VANET being k-connected. The expectation of
   the maximum number of tolerable vehicle departures is also derived.
   Simulation results confirm the accuracy of our analysis and indicate
   that the expectation of the maximum number of tolerable vehicle
   departures almost linearly increases with the total number of vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively low success rates of X-ray crystallography, which is the most
   popular method for solving proteins structures, motivate development of
   novel methods that support selection of tractable protein targets. This
   aspect is particularly important in the context of the current
   structural genomics efforts that allow for a certain degree of
   flexibility in the target selection. We propose CRYSpred, a novel
   in-silico crystallization propensity predictor that uses a set of 15
   novel features which utilize a broad range of inputs including charge,
   hydrophobicity, and amino acid composition derived from the protein
   chain, and the solvent accessibility and disorder predicted from the
   protein sequence. Our method outperforms seven modern crystallization
   propensity predictors on three, independent from training dataset,
   benchmark test datasets. The strong predictive performance offered by
   the CRYSpred is attributed to the careful design of the features,
   utilization of the comprehensive set of inputs, and the usage of the
   Support Vector Machine classifier. The inputs utilized by CRYSpred are
   well-aligned with the existing rules-of-thumb that are used in the
   structural genomics studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new connectivity-preserving protocol in terms of
   rectangle-like regions. The protocol consists of a set of distributed
   control rules; their working together guarantees the network
   connectivity as well as rendezvous of a discrete-time multi-agent
   system. It is assumed that all agents share a common minimum sensing
   radius, but the information exchange may suffer from link failure and
   recovery. Consequently, the interaction topology is in fact directed and
   time-varying. By rigorous mathematical arguments, we show the
   effectiveness and robustness of the protocol in the presence of
   alignment errors in local coordinate orientations of agents and
   measurement errors in relative positions of neighbors. We also present
   simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

   a model system}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2746-2759}},
Abstract = {{The hydrophobic interaction plays a critical role in a wide range of
   molecular phenomena in numerous biological and engineering systems.
   Using a Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA) coupled with a top-view optical
   microscope, we have directly measured and visualized the interactions
   between two polystyrene surfaces in different electrolyte solutions
   (i.e., NaCl, CaCl2, HCl and CH3COOH). It is evident that the long-range
   hydrophobic interaction measured is due to bridging of microscopic and
   sub-microscopic bubbles on polystyrene surfaces. The range of the
   hydrophobic interaction decreases with increasing the electrolyte
   concentration for NaCl and CaCl2, but shows no significant change for
   HCl and CH3COOH, which is related to the formation and stability of
   bubbles on hydrophobic surfaces due to the ion specificity. The range of
   the hydrophobic interactions was reduced to about 10-20 nm by degassing
   the aqueous solutions, but gradually recovered when re-exposing the
   degassed solution to air. Our results indicate that dissolved gasses in
   solutions play a crucial role in the hydrophobic interactions of polymer
   surfaces, and support a three-regime hydrophobic interaction model
   proposed. More interesting, spontaneous cavitation of water between two
   interacting polystyrene surfaces was directly observed in degassed
   aqueous solution at a separation of <= 20 nm. The interfacial energy of
   polystyrene in various aqueous solutions was determined to be gamma = 42
   +/- 5 mJ m(-2), close to the values measured in air. Interesting
   fracture patterns were also observed associated with the separation of
   two hydrophobic polymer surfaces in aqueous solutions, but not in air,
   indicating that hydrophobic force plays an important role in
   adhesion-induced fracture of polymer surfaces and thin films. Our study
   provides new insight into the basic hydrophobic interaction mechanism of
   polymers and biomacromolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization
   technique was used for the fabrication of stable core cross-linked
   micelles (CCL) with thermoresponsive and degradable cores. Well-defined
   poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine), poly(MPC) macro RAFT
   agent, was first synthesized with narrow molecular weight distribution
   via the RAFT process. These CCL micelles (termed as nanogels) with
   hydrophilic poly(MPC) shell and thermoresponsive core consisting of
   poly(methoxydiethylene glycol methacrylate) (poly(MeODEGM) and
   poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylamide hydrochloride) (poly(AEMA) were then
   obtained in a one-pot process by RAFT polymerization in the presence of
   an acid degradable cross-linker. These acid degradable nanogels were
   efficiently synthesized with tunable sizes and low polydispersities. The
   encapsulation efficiencies of the nanogels with different proteins such
   as insulin, BSA, and beta-galactosidase were studied and found to be
   dependent of the cross-linker concentration, size of protein, and the
   cationic character of the nanogels imparted by the presence of AEMA in
   the core. The thermoresponsive nature of the synthesized nanogels plays
   a vital role in protein encapsulation: the hydrophilic core and shell of
   the nanogels at low temperature allow easy diffusion of the proteins
   inside out and, with an increase in temperature, the core becomes
   hydrophobic and the nanogels are easily separated out with entrapped
   protein. The release profile of insulin from nanogels at low pH was
   studied and results were analyzed using bicinchoninic assay (BCA).
   Controlled release of protein was observed over 48 h.}},

Pages = {{19-31}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a series of laboratory experiments conducted at the
   University of Alberta Cold Room Facility, investigating the use of
   upward looking sonars to measure frazil ice concentration. Two upward
   looking sonars, one high (546 kHz) frequency and one low (235 kHz)
   frequency were deployed on the bottom of a custom built frazil ice tank
   located in the cold room. A step by step procedure is provided for
   processing the raw sonar signal to compute the volume backscatter
   strength. A sieving technique was used to make direct measurements of
   frazil ice concentrations in the tank and sieved frazil ice particles
   were examined under a microscope to determine their average shape and
   size. Measured mass concentrations ranged from 0.012\% to 0.135\% and
   the majority of observed frazil particles were disk shaped, varying in
   diameter from 0.25 to 4.25 mm. The sonar measurements showed that the
   high frequency model is more sensitive to the presence of suspended
   frazil particles than the low frequency model, especially at lower
   concentrations. The depth averaged volume backscatter strength, computed
   from both the high and low frequency data, was found to be correlated
   with the frazil ice concentration and the resulting regression equations
   are provided. These correlations need to be tested in the field prior to
   being used for quantitative measurements of frazil ice concentration in
   rivers. The applicability of simplified theoretical backscatter models
   to estimate frazil ice properties is also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{32-42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the onset of breakup is an essential component of any ice jam
   flood forecasting system, yet it presents a difficult challenge due to
   the complex nature of the relationship between meteorological
   conditions, streamflow hydraulics and ice mechanics. For this research,
   data extracted from historical hydrometric and meteorological records
   were used to develop and assess a three-layer feed-forward artificial
   neural network (ANN) model for predicting the onset of breakup, using
   the Hay River in northern Canada as the demonstration site. The
   calibration results illustrate the potential of the ANN model for
   successful forecasting of the onset of river ice breakup, i.e. the first
   transverse cracking of the ice cover. However, rigorous validation also
   indicates that the accuracy of such ANN models can be optimistically
   overestimated by their performance during the calibration phase. The
   possible reasons for this poor predictive capability of the ANN model
   are also discussed. Despite this caveat, the proposed model shows
   improved performance as compared to the more conventional multiple
   linear regression (MLR) techniques typically applied to this problem.

Abstract = {{Co-gasification of oil sand fluid coke with sub-bituminous coal was
   performed in an entrained-flow gasifier. The underlying objective of
   this work was to assess the combined effects of the operating variables
   (i.e., temperature and oxygen and steam concentrations) and coal/coke
   blending ratio in an entrained-flow gasification process, where the
   focus was to quantify the relationships between the response variables
   and vital operating factors. With a view to the shortcomings of the
   classical ``one-factor-at-a-time{''} method in identification of the
   effect of experimental factors and their interactions, a statistical
   design of the experiment based on response surface methodology (RSM) was
   used. The response variables used in this work were H-2, CO, H-2/CO
   ratio, gasification efficiency, and carbon conversion. Experiments were
   conducted over a temperature range of 1000-1400 degrees C, using steam
   and oxygen to carbon weight ratios of 0.9-4.3 and 0-0.4, respectively,
   equivalent to 15-50 vol \% steam and 0-3 vol \% oxygen in N-2 carrier
   gas. All of the response variables were successfully fitted to either a
   two-factor interaction or quadratic model. Using RSM, the effects of
   individual operating factors and their interactions were categorically
   determined, which were not otherwise possible by the classical design of
   experiment methodology. Using the resultant response variable
   correlations, H-2 production was optimized as a function of the
   temperature, steam and oxygen concentration, and different blending
   ratios. The full potentiality of Canadian oil sand coke for
   entrained-flow gasification was successfully investigated via RSM. The
   results of this work, however, are only applicable to entrained-flow
   gasification systems.}},

Abstract = {{The similarity of the Hildebrand or Hansen solubility parameter is
   frequently used in petroleum science as a measure of the compatibility
   of constituents and for interpreting and correlating properties of
   asphaltene + diluent mixtures. A partial specific volume at near
   infinite dilution and enthalpies of solution are sensitive measures of
   solute solvent interactions derived from high precision density and
   calorimetry measurements for dilute mixtures. In this contribution, the
   partial specific volumes and enthalpies of solution of pyrene and
   various Athabasca and Maya asphaltenes at near infinite dilution on a
   mole fraction basis, in decane, toluene, 1-methylnaphthalene, quinoline,
   anisole, 2,6-lutidine, pyridine, methylene chloride, and tetrahydrofuran
   are reported over the temperature range of 20-80 degrees C. At 20
   degrees C, these diluents possess solubility parameters ranging from 15
   MPa0.5 (decane) to 22 MPa0.5 (quinoline). The properties of pyrene +
   diluent mixtures are used to illustrate the application and
   misapplication of the regular solution theory to such mixtures.
   Thermodynamic measurements, partial specific volume, and enthalpy of
   solution are shown to be independent of both Hildebrand and Hansen
   solubility parameter values. These results do not support the use of the
   solubility parameter or other simple solution thermodynamic concepts to
   describe asphaltene + diluent mixture behavior. The need for a more
   detailed description of physiochemical phenomena arising upon mixing
   asphaltenes with diluents is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy oil usually contains percentage levels of sulfur. Most of the
   sulfur in heavy oil is found in bulky thiophenic structures. Thiophenic
   sulfur is difficult to remove by catalytic hydrodesulfurization, but it
   can readily be oxidized. The sulfoxides and sulfones produced from
   sulfur oxidation can be solvent extracted from the heavy oil as a result
   of their increased polarity. Oxidative desulfurization of heavy oil was
   studied using Canadian Cold Lake bitumen (5\% S, 1100 kg/m(3)), with air
   as oxidant. At the conditions investigated, namely, autoxidation at
   145-175 degrees C followed by water washing, 46-47\% of the sulfur in
   the bitumen could be removed. This is equivalent to >20 kg sulfur per
   ton oil. Part of the sulfur was removed as SO2 and part as water
   extracted sulfur-containing compounds. Lower autoxidation temperatures
   led to better desulfurization. The main challenge was to prevent free
   radical addition reactions that cause a viscosity increase and bitumen
   hardening. Autoxidation of undiluted bitumen and bitumen-water mixtures
   resulted in hardening. Hardening was prevented when bitumen was diluted
   with naphtha (n-heptane). However, the oxidized sulfur compounds could
   not be extracted with water from the bitumen-heptane phase, and some
   material was precipitated as a result of solvent deasphalting. Oxidation
   selectivity was studied using a model dibenzothiophene and n-heptane
   mixture. Some precipitation was also observed, and the chemistry was
   analogous to the precipitation chemistry (gum formation) that undermines
   storage stability of transportation fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Carsharing is an innovative travel alternative that has recently
   experienced considerable growth and become part of sustainable
   transportation initiatives. Although carsharing is becoming increasingly
   a popular alternative transportation mode in North America, it is still
   an under-researched area. Current research is aimed at better
   understanding of the behavior of carsharing users. For every member, a
   two-stage approach microsimulates the probability of being active in any
   month using a binary probit model and given that a particular member is
   active during a month, the probability of that member using the service
   multiple times using a random utility-based model. The model is
   estimated using empirical data from one of the largest carsharing
   companies in North America. The model estimates reveal that the activity
   persistency of members is positively linked to previous behaviors for up
   to 4 months, and that the influence of previous months weakens over
   time. It also shows that some attributes of the traveler (gender, age,
   and language spoken at home) impact his or her behaviors. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The impact of porous support morphology on the electrochemical
   performance of LSM-infiltrated symmetrical cells was investigated. Five
   distinctly different porous YSZ supports were developed using different
   YSZ powders (as received or calcined-milled), pore formers (polymethyl
   methacrylate, graphite and carbon black) and sintering conditions, while
   the total volume fraction of open porosity was identically kept in the
   range of 50-55\% for all the cells. The influence of size, connectivity
   and distribution of the pores as well as the configuration of YSZ
   particles on the surface area and three phase boundary length was
   analyzed qualitatively by scanning electron microscopy and
   quantitatively by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller technique both before and
   after LSM infiltration into the support. Ac impedance spectroscopy
   studies revealed that ohmic and polarization resistance of the cells
   were quite varied. It was found that a calcined YSZ-based structure had
   the most uniform morphology and the lowest ohmic resistance (225 m
   Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C). Low temperature sintered cells with an as
   received YSZ-based structure, however, exhibited the lowest polarization
   resistance (60 m Omega.cm(2) at 800 degrees C). The significance of
   using calcined YSZ-based structures in the practical development of
   porous YSZ supports is discussed. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of aluminum oxide thin films on chromium
   substrates was studied using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE).
   The study of the initial stages of ALD film growth on metal surfaces is
   an important topic in the emerging field of metal-insulator-metal (MIM)
   fabrication. Chromium substrates were prepared by DC magnetron
   sputtering and were transferred under vacuum into an ALD reaction
   chamber. Formation of a thin layer of chromium oxide was observed during
   the initial cycles of plasma-enhanced ALD of aluminum oxide. The
   thickness of this interfacial oxide layer depends on various process
   parameters including deposition temperature, order of precursors and
   plasma pulse length. The interfacial oxide layer was absent during
   thermal ALD. FTIR measurements confirmed that the Cr/Al2O3 interface is
   affected by the type of ALD (thermal or plasma-enhanced). (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Proteins fold through a two-state (TS), with no visible intermediates,
   or a multi-state (MS), via at least one intermediate, process. We
   analyze sequence-derived factors that determine folding types by
   introducing a novel sequence-based folding type predictor called FOKIT.
   This method implements a logistic regression model with six input
   features which hybridize information concerning amino acid composition
   and predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility. FOKIT
   provides predictions with average Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)
   between 0.58 and 0.91 measured using out-of-sample tests on four
   benchmark datasets. These results are shown to be competitive or better
   than results of four modern predictors. We also show that FOKIT
   outperforms these methods when predicting chains that share low
   similarity with the chains used to build the model, which is an
   important advantage given the limited number of annotated chains. We
   demonstrate that inclusion of solvent accessibility helps in
   discrimination of the folding kinetic types and that three of the
   features constitute statistically significant markers that differentiate
   TS and MS folders. We found that the increased content of exposed Trp
   and buried Leu are indicative of the MS folding, which implies that the
   exposure/burial of certain hydrophobic residues may play important role
   in the formation of the folding intermediates. Our conclusions are
   supported by two case studies.}},

Abstract = {{In a vehicular delay tolerant network, the problem of scheduling the
   traffic from a roadside unit to passing-by vehicles is studied. A cost
   function is associated with a scheduled transmission. And if a delay
   bound is violated, a penalty cost is charged. The optimal stopping
   theory is applied to decide when the roadside unit should schedule its
   accumulated traffic to a passing-by vehicle such that the rate of cost
   is minimized. It is shown that the optimal scheduling strategy is a
   pure-threshold strategy, i.e., upon a vehicle arrival, if the queueing
   delay at the roadside unit is above a threshold, it is optimal to
   schedule a transmission via the vehicle. Simulation results validate the
   effectiveness of the derived optimal rule.}},

Abstract = {{The results of 26 plate load tests carried out at the Bakhtiary dam site
   were analyzed to define and characterise the mechanisms governing the
   rock mass deformation during the tests. Tests were categorized into
   groups based on the relative direction of loading to the orientation of
   major discontinuity sets running through the rock mass. Five mechanisms
   were distinguished as the main modes controlling deformations of the
   rock mass during the tests. These mechanisms were based on analysis of
   the shape of stress-deformation curves, total and plastic deformation,
   anisotropy and deformation hysteresis. This study shows that part of the
   scatter commonly observed in the moduli calculated from plate load tests
   can be attributed to the different deformation mechanisms that are
   mobilized during the tests. Incompatibility of the theoretical
   assumptions, made for the interpretation of the test results, with
   actual deformation mechanisms is shown to be another factor causing
   scatter in the calculated moduli. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Varying the morphological parameters of the nanotube arrays allows

   profile. Surface heterogeneity is modeled as alternate bands of
   attractive and repulsive regions on the channel wall to facilitate
   systematic continuum type evaluation. The results indicate that
   particles tend to preferentially collect at the leading edge of the
   favorable sections and the extent of this deposition can be controlled
   by changing Peclet number. Also, it is shown that particles tend to
   travel further along the microchannel length for heterogeneous channels
   compared to homogeneously favorable channels. In addition, the study
   evaluates the effect of the frequency of these stripes on the transport
   behavior and provides the average collection rate depending on favorable
   surface coverage fraction. This analysis shows how the existing
   microchannel/capillary transport models could possibly be modified by
   incorporating surface interactions and chemical heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed theoretical model of capillary transport in rectangular
   microchannels is proposed. Two important aspects of capillary transport
   are revisited, which are considered with simplified assumption in the
   literature. The capillary flow is assumed as a low Reynolds number flow
   and hence creeping flow assumptions are considered for majority of
   analyses. The velocity profile used with this assumption results into a
   steady state fully developed velocity profile. The capillary flow is
   inherently a transient process. In this study, the capillary flow
   analysis is performed with transient velocity profile. The pressure
   field expression at the entrance of the microchannel is another aspect
   which is not often accurately represented in the literature. The
   approximated pressure field expression at the entrance of the
   rectangular microchannel is widely used in the literature. An
   appropriate entrance pressure field expression for a rectangular
   microchannel is proposed. For both analyses, the governing equation of
   the capillary transport in rectangular microchannel is derived by
   applying the momentum equation to the fluid control volume along the
   microchannel. The non-dimensional governing equations are obtained, each
   for a transient velocity profile and a newly proposed pressure field,
   for analyzing the importance of such velocity profile and pressure field
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental technique to quantify velocity field at pore scale with
   in microporous media, formed by packing of microglass spheres of size
   200 mu m inside a glass micro-model, is presented. A microparticle image
   velocimetry (mu-PIV) system is used to study velocity fields at four
   different spatial regions in the microporous medium. A combined particle
   image velocimetry (PIV) and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) scheme
   is used to quantify velocity within a typical pore size of 10-50 mu m.
   The experiments are conducted at four different flow rates. Two
   different measurement planes are selected for obtaining the detailed
   pore scale velocity field-one close to the glass wall and the other
   inside the porous medium at a distance 100 mu m below the glass wall.
   The image processing technique for dealing with noisy data and sparse
   vector field has been discussed in detail. Probability density functions
   of transverse and axial velocity components are compared with available
   results in literature. The pore scale velocity field obtained can
   provide insight to flow properties in microporous media and can be a
   powerful tool to validate existing numerical results for flow through
   porous media.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Pages = {{89-98}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In the construction bonding business, a complex and comprehensive
   prequalification or assessment process is done to evaluate contractor,
   project, and contractual risks. Previous studies have focused mainly on
   contractor prequalification from the owner's or consultant's
   perspective. There remains a need for a model to evaluate the contractor
   and project-specific aspects (i.e., project team and contractual risks)
   from the surety bonding perspective. This paper identifies and
   classifies the most relevant evaluation criteria that surety
   underwriters and brokers consider when evaluating a specific
   construction project for bonding purposes. Several data collection
   techniques (questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, and interacting group
   meetings), with highly experienced surety experts, were conducted to
   compile a comprehensive and detailed list of the evaluation criteria.
   Both fuzzy logic and expert systems are combined to develop a decision
   support system (DSS) for use in contractor and project evaluation. An
   approach for fuzzy membership function estimation is presented using a
   traditional membership function estimation technique, integrated with
   data of contractor prequalification cases. Thirty-eight alternative
   system configurations are investigated to determine the most accurate
   one. The system is validated using 32 prequalification cases, and the
   accuracy of the system is found to be 84.0\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Simulation is often used to model production processes with the aim of
   understanding and improving them. In many cases, however, information
   produced by simulation is not detailed enough and can be misinterpreted.
   The use of visualization in combination with simulation can provide
   project participants with a detailed-level model to prevent
   misinterpretation of information and to understand the production
   process. The purpose of this research is to automate the visualization
   process as a post-simulation tool through sharing interactive
   information between simulation and visualization. The proposed
   methodology has been applied to the production line of modular buildings
   with the output of lean, simulation, and visualization in the form of
   animation. Based on the new scheduling developed by applying lean
   principles, a simulation model was built and its output was extracted to
   an ASCII file to be used as input for visualization. 3D visualization
   was developed using Maxscript in 3D Studio Max for automation of the
   visualization process. The proposed methodology has been applied to a

Abstract = {{We propose and validate a new multiscale technique, the extrapolative

   It nontrivially combines the multiple time step decomposition operator
   method with a specific extrapolation of intermolecular interactions,
   complemented by an extended isokinetic Nose Hoover chain approach in the
   presence of translational and orientational degrees of freedom. The EINO
   algorithm obviates the limitations on time step size in molecular
   dynamics simulations. While the best existing multistep algorithms can
   advance from a 5 fs single step to a maximum 100 Is outer step, we show
   on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P water that
   our EINO technique overcomes this barrier. Specifically, we have
   achieved giant time steps on the order of 500 fs up to 5 ps, which now
   become available in the study of equilibrium and conformational
   properties of molecular liquids without a loss of stability and

Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to empirically analyse whether there is

   A sample of 362 organisations registered, at least, to both ISO

   is applied to their responses to a mailed survey. Two different groups
   are studied depending on the number of management systems implemented:
   two systems for the first group and three for the second.
   The results demonstrate that organisations with three implemented
   management systems face difficulties in the integration process that
   affect the level of integration, while this relationship is not
   significant for those organisations with two management systems.
   This paper is one of the first studies focussing on integration

Abstract = {{Low-pressure cold spraying was used to deposit aluminum particles
   (similar to 25 mu m diameter) on to low carbon steel, and the
   particle-particle interactions of the aluminum coating were analyzed. A
   simplified energy conservation model was developed to estimate the
   temperature at the interface of the deformed particle during deposition
   of the powder. The Johnson-Cook model was used to calculate the particle
   flow stress, which was used to estimate the total energy dissipated via
   plastic deformation during impact and spreading of the particle.
   Microstructural analysis was conducted to show that plastic deformation
   occurred mainly at the interfacial regions of the deformed particles. By
   coupling microstructural observations of the cold-sprayed particles with
   the energy conservation model, it was found that the interface between
   the aluminum particles contained recrystallized ultra-fine and
   nanocrystalline grain structures that were likely formed at temperatures
   above 260 A degrees C, but the majority of particles likely achieved
   interfacial temperatures which were lower than the melting point of
   aluminum (660 A degrees C). This suggests that local melting is not
   likely to dominate the inter-particle bonding mechanism, and the
   resulting interfacial regions contain ultra-fine grain structures, which
   significantly contribute to the coating hardness.}},

   was 463 mW cm(-2) when using H2S-containing H-2 as fuel. The presence of
   H2S in the syngas significantly decreased the polarization resistance

Abstract = {{In applications such as super-resolution imaging and mosaicking,
   multiple video sequences are registered to reconstruct video with
   enhanced resolution. However, not all computed registration is reliable.
   In addition, not all sequences contribute useful information towards
   reconstruction from multiple non-uniformly distributed sample sets. In
   this paper we present two algorithms that can help determine which low
   resolution sample sets should be combined in order to maximize
   reconstruction accuracy while minimizing the number of sample sets. The
   first algorithm computes a confidence measure which is derived as a
   combination of two objective functions. The second algorithm is an
   iterative ranked-based method for reconstruction which uses confidence
   measures to assign priority to sample sets that maximize information
   gain while minimizing reconstruction error. Experimental results with
   real and synthetic sequences validate the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithms. Application of our work in medical visualization and
   super-resolution reconstruction of MRI data are also presented. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Image database creation for infrastructure management is an
   interdisciplinary endeavor in computer vision, database, and structural
   engineering. In response to increasing demands for multimedia
   information in infrastructure management, image databases are becoming
   an ever more active research area. This paper proposes an automated
   system for creating an urban infrastructure 3D model using an image
   database; the system is built by images shot in public areas to record
   changes of urban infrastructure in three-dimensional (3D) space, such as
   the addition of new buildings, new overpasses, loss of traffic signs,
   and growth/change of trees. The system architecture is presented with an
   emphasis on a 3D information capture and extraction module. Initial
   experiments with the 3D information capture module show that the
   proposed system has the potential to efficiently develop a large-scale
   3D model of the streets of a municipality.}},

Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{146-160}},

Abstract = {{An efficient transistor level implementation of a flexible, programmable
   Triangular Function (TF) that can be used as a Triangular Neighborhood
   Function (TNF) in ultra-low power, self-organizing maps (SOMs) realized
   as Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is presented. The
   proposed TNF block is a component of a larger neighborhood mechanism,
   whose role is to determine the distance between the winning neuron and
   all neighboring neurons. Detailed simulations carried out for the
   software model of such network show that the TNF forms a good
   approximation of the Gaussian Neighborhood Function (GNF), while being
   implemented in a much easier way in hardware. The overall mechanism is
   very fast. In the CMOS 0.18 mu m technology, distances to all
   neighboring neurons are determined in parallel, within the time not
   exceeding 11 ns, for an example neighborhood range, R, of 15. The TNF
   blocks in particular neurons require another 6 ns to calculate the
   output values directly used in the adaptation process. This is also
   performed in parallel in all neurons. As a result, after determining the
   winning neuron, the entire map is ready for the adaptation after the
   time not exceeding 17 ns, even for large numbers of neurons. This
   feature allows for the realization of ultra low power SOMs, which are
   hundred times faster than similar SOMs realized on PC. The signal
   resolution at the output of the TNF block has a dominant impact on the
   overall energy consumption as well as the silicon area. Detailed system
   level simulations of the SOM show that even for low resolutions of 3 to
   6 bits, the learning abilities of the SUM are not affected. The circuit
   performance has been verified by means of transistor level Hspice
   simulations carried out for different transistor models and different
   values of supply voltage and the environment temperature - a typical
   procedure completed in case of commercial chips that makes the obtained
   results reliable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We combine the statistical-mechanical 1D/3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of
   solvation with DFT electronic structure calculations and MD and
   coarse-grained DPD simulations, and apply them to study association
   phenomena in synthetic organic soft matter and biomolecular systems.
   This combined approach from electronic to molecular structure and
   coarse-graining allows us to address complex processes occurring in
   solution on very long timescales, such as protein-ligand binding,
   distributions of electrolyte solution species in ion channels, and
   oligomeric polyelectrolyte gelation. The statistics of rare events
   involving supramolecular solute and solvent is accounted for
   analytically within the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation. The
   hybrid MD/3D-RISM-KH method for molecular dynamics of the biomolecule in
   the potential of mean force obtained with the molecular theory of
   solvation has been implemented in the Amber package. The 3D molecular
   theory of solvation also replaces MM/GB(PB)SA post-processing using
   empirical treatment of non-polar contributions with MM/3D-RISM-KH
   evaluation of the solvation thermodynamics. The 3D-RISM-KH theory
   accurately yields the solvation structure for biomolecular systems as
   large as the GroEL chaperonin complex, GLIC ion channel, and 3D maps of
   ligand binding affinity of antiprion compound to mouse PrPC prion
   protein at once without phenomenological approximations. We apply the
   DFT/1D-3D-RISM-KH/DPD multiscale approach to investigate the structural
   and dynamical properties and gelation ability of oligomeric
   polyelectrolyte gelators, towards understanding of the gelation

   under grid and filter parameter variation; 2) suppression of
   grid-induced distortion without a-priori knowledge of the grid
   background distortion and unbalance via real-time generation of the
   frequency modes and disturbances that should be eliminated from the
   closed-loop current control system; 3) robust deadbeat digital control
   performance that maximizes the dynamic performance of the converter; and
   4) robustness against interaction dynamics between active damping and
   current tracking controllers. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme
   facilitates line-voltage sensorless current control and
   grid-synchronization performance, which enhances the reliability and
   costmeasures of the DG interface. Theoretical analysis and comparative
   evaluation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling naturally fractured reservoirs (NFRs) requires an accurate
   representation of fracture network permeability (FNP). Conventionally,
   logs, cores, seismic, and pressure transient tests are used as a data
   base for this. Our previous attempts showed that a strong correlation
   exists between the fractal parameters of 2-D fracture networks and their
   permeability (Jafari and Babadagli, SPE 113618, Western Regional and
   Pacific Section AAPG joint meeting, 2008; Jafari and Babadagli, SPE
   Reserv Eval Eng 12(3):455-469, 2009a). We also showed that 1-D well
   (cores-logs) and 3-D reservoir data (well test) may not be sufficient in
   FNP mapping and that 2-D (outcrop) characteristics are needed (Jafari
   and Babadagli, SPE 124077, SPE/EAGE reservoir characterization and
   simulation conference, 2009b). This paper is an extension of those
   studies, where only 2-D (single-layer, uniform fracture characteristics
   in z direction) representations were used. In this paper, we considered
   a more complex and realistic 3-D network system. Two-dimensional random
   fractures with known fractal and statistical characteristics were
   distributed in the x- and y directions. A variation of fracture network
   characteristics in the z direction was presented by a multilayer system
   representing three different facieses with different fracture
   properties. Wells were placed in different locations of the model to
   collect 1-D fracture density and pressure transient data. In addition,
   five different fractal and statistical properties of the network of each
   layer were measured. The equivalent FNP was calculated using a
   commercial software package as the base case. Using available 1-D, 2-D,
   and 3-D data, multivariable regression analyses were performed to obtain
   equivalent FNP correlations for many different fracture network
   realizations. The derived equations were validated against a new set of
   synthetic fracture networks, and the conditions at which 1-D, 2-D and
   3-D data are sufficient to map FNP were determined. The importance of
   the inclusion of each data type, i.e., 1-D, 2-D and 3-D, in the
   correlations was discussed. It was shown that using only 3-D data are
   insufficient to predict the FNP due to wide spatial heterogeneity of the
   fracture properties in the reservoir, which cannot be captured from
   single-well tests. Incorporating all types of data (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D)
   would result in better prediction. Also, it is recommended that the 2-D
   data of the most conductive layer in reservoir, which has longer
   fractures with a higher density, should be incorporated in the
   correlations.}},

Abstract = {{As part of IEEE's mission to further engineering education and support
   faculty and student development, the IEEE Educational Activities Board
   (EAB) along with the IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) Committee created
   the Real-World Engineering Projects (RWEP) program. The goal of the RWEP
   program is to provide university educators of electrical engineering
   (EE), computer engineering (CE), computer science (CS), biomedical
   engineering (BE) and electrical engineering technology (EET) with a
   library of high-quality, tested, hands-on, team-based, and
   society-focused projects for first-year students.
   These projects are designed to increase the recruitment, persistence to
   degree, and satisfaction of all students, in baccalaureate EE, CE, CS,
   BE and EET degree programs. In many EE/CE/CS/BE/EET programs, current
   first-year curricula focus on the theoretical and mathematical
   components of engineering. The vehicle for change is a series of
   IEEE-approved hands-on projects that educators are able to use in the
   first-year classroom in order to acquaint their students to the practice
   of these disciplines.
   The projects clearly demonstrate a benefit to society in general and
   also involve the students at a more intimate level than a typical
   lecture. Research has shown the recruitment of women gains significantly
   from the illustration of how electrical and computer engineers and
   computer scientists benefit society. The persistent under-participation
   of women in engineering and computer science is an area of continued
   concern to governments, industry leaders, policy making bodies, and
   professional associations.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous simulation games have been developed since the 60's by
   researchers within the construction domain. These games were developed
   for a specific purpose and possess a unique implementation strategy and
   structure. This paper summarizes some of these games and further
   discusses a subset of them, particularly those developed within the
   COnstruction SYnthetic Environment (COSYE). A prototype for a game
   development framework was proposed based on review of these games. It is
   proposed to implement this prototype within a distributed simulation
   environment to ensure consistency, interoperability, and reusability of
   the components and the game as a whole. COSYE is chosen to provide such
   an environment because it has the necessary ingredients for developing
   and maintaining such a prototype. The paper further discusses some
   concepts of distributed simulation, the features that exist within the
   COSYE framework, and the standards on which the COSYE framework operates

Pages = {{13-27}},
Abstract = {{Information granules and ensuing Granular Computing offer interesting
   opportunities to endow processing with an important facet of
   human-centricity. This facet implies that the underlying processing
   supports non-numeric data inherently associated with the variable
   perception of humans. Systems that commonly become distributed and
   hierarchical, managing granular information in hierarchical and
   distributed architectures, is of growing interest, especially when
   invoking mechanisms of knowledge generation and knowledge sharing. The
   outstanding feature of human centricity of Granular Computing along with
   essential fuzzy set-based constructs constitutes the crux of this study.
   The author elaborates on some new directions of knowledge elicitation
   and quantification realized in the setting of fuzzy sets. With this
   regard, the paper concentrates on knowledge-based clustering. It is also
   emphasized that collaboration and reconciliation of locally available
   knowledge give rise to the concept of higher type information granules.
   Other interesting directions enhancing human centricity of computing
   with fuzzy sets deals with non-numeric semi-qualitative characterization
   of information granules, as well as inherent evolving capabilities of
   associated human-centric systems. The author discusses a suite of
   algorithms facilitating a qualitative assessment of fuzzy sets,
   formulates a series of associated optimization tasks guided by
   well-formulated performance indexes, and discusses the underlying
   essence of resulting solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a vast amount of research has been conducted on health
   monitoring of existing structures such as buildings, bridges and other
   civil structures. Furthermore, in Japan, natural disasters like typhoons
   and earthquakes occur frequently increasing the importance of the damage
   assessment of the existing structures. In order to evaluate the damage
   state of structures, health monitoring technology is quite promising to
   provide useful information. However, there are still some research needs
   in modeling, analysis and experimental examination before routine
   applications of health monitoring systems. In this paper, an attempt is
   made to develop a damage detection approach system by the learning
   ability. This learning ability facilitates a monitoring paradigm without
   a need for preliminary investigation of the underlying structure and
   environment. In other words, it is not necessary to use the precise
   modeling and analysis methods before conducting the health monitoring.
   The proposed system learns the vibration response by using AdaBoost
   technique that uses fuzzy-neural networks as a weak learner. By using
   AdaBoost technique, the network can respond to various types of external
   forces and the prediction accuracy increases. The fuzzy reasoning
   predicts the next state of structural behavior such as displacement,
   velocity and acceleration from the current state of structural behavior
   and external force. Previously, a health monitoring system that can
   adapt to the structural systems and environments through the learning
   ability was developed with the recognition rate of over 80\% using
   numerical simulations. However, experimental verification is needed
   before real life application of the proposed system. In this paper,
   results from laboratory experiments are presented to show the
   effectiveness of the methodology. It is observed that the proposed
   system can recognize the change of structural characteristics and

Abstract = {{A real-time technique that does not rely on chemical interfaces or
   biological receptors for molecular identification of picogram quantities
   of biomaterials such as DNA molecules in a high throughput fashion is
   described. This technique combines the extremely high sensitivity of
   microfabricated bi-material cantilever beams with the high selectivity
   of mid infrared (IR) spectroscopy to nanomechanically transduce the
   photon absorption-induced temperature variations of the molecules.
   Picogram amounts of target molecules were first adsorbed on the
   cantilever without using any receptors. Illuminating a bi-material
   cantilever sequentially with a mid-IR radiation results in photon
   absorption by the molecule at a certain wavelength, which results in a
   small temperature variation, and the resultant deflection of the
   bi-material cantilever. A plot of cantilever deflection as a function of
   an illuminating wavelength closely follows the IR absorption spectrum of
   the target molecules. We have used this technique to rapidly identify
   different DNA strands.}},

Abstract = {{Gasification of oil sand delayed coke with sub-bituminous and lignite
   coals was performed in an atmospheric entrained flow gasifier using
   steam and oxygen as gasifying agents. The underlying objective of this
   work was to assess the effects of the operating variables (i.e.
   temperature, oxygen and steam concentrations) and coal/coke blending
   ratio on gasification performance in a high-temperature in order to find
   the possible synergies in co-gasification of the fuels. Experiments were
   conducted at 1400 degrees C, using steam and oxygen to carbon weight
   ratios of (0.36-1.08) and (0.07-0.2), respectively in N-2 carrier gas.
   The coke to coal weight ratios of 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 were used for the
   blending tests. Particle size of 53-90 micron with d(50)=75 micron were
   used. In terms of char reactivity, blending did not show any significant
   positive effect. Slight deviations from linear additive line are in the
   order of experiment error. Gasification efficiency was also following a
   linear additive trend once more pointing out the lack of synergy in
   entrained flow gasification systems. The results however, showed that
   higher coke content clearly favored the H-2 production.}},

   dual-phase structure containing perovskite and spinel systems.
   Microstructure observed by SEM showed the spinel phase as intergrowth
   structure in the dominantly perovskite phase. Thermogravimetric studies
   show a higher desorption rate and sorption capacity compared to the
   similar perovskite sorbents which with a lower CO2 uptake can produce an
   optimum sorbent material for air separation in oxyfuel power generation.
   Sintering temperature also showed an effect on oxygen
   sorptive/desorptive properties. Improved properties can be explained

   (deterministic and nondeterministic) and fuzzy automata. It leads to

   of using finite automata in classification problems stems from ways of

Abstract = {{Current residential and office buildings account for 25-30\% of total
   energy related CO2 emissions and 40\% of total energy use in Europe.
   Europe's objective under the Kyoto Protocol, Copenhagen Summit (COP 15)

   while also decreasing the current dependence on imported energy due to
   the fact that the EU currently imports 82\% of its oil and 57\% of its
   gas, making it the world's leading importer of these fuels. One possible
   solution to both the above problems is to reduce energy consumption by
   improving energy efficiency. Apart from meaningful building insulation
   measures, the only means of achieving marked improvements in the energy
   efficiency of buildings is to make use of efficient building automation
   technologies which comprises performance monitoring, analysis and
   intelligent control. In this research a new integrated information
   management system will be described coupled with open and extensible

Abstract = {{The European Union currently imports two third of its oil and gas which
   makes it the world's leading importer of these fuels. Due to increasing
   energy prices and relatively high percentage of building related energy
   consumption much effort is invested for energy efficient buildings.
   Current studies show that improved building energy monitoring and
   optimization systems can contribute to the reduction of building energy
   consumption by 15 to 40\%. This research addresses the need for
   integration concepts, holistic monitoring and analysis methodologies,
   life-cycle oriented decision support and scenario based control
   strategies through the seamless integration of ubiquitous sensing
   infrastructures, simulation tools, BIM tools, service oriented
   architectures and data warehouse technologies. This paper discusses a
   model driven approach integrating IT systems at design, construction and
   operation stages of buildings so that monitoring, analysis and
   optimization of building energy performance can be achieved. The first

   square-wave-approximated aortic flow signal}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a model based approach to estimation of cardiac
   output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR). In the proposed
   approach, the response of cardiovascular system (CVS), described by the
   windkessel model, is tuned to the measurements of systolic, diastolic
   and mean arterial blood pressures (BP) so as to yield optimal
   individual- and time specific system time constant that is used to
   estimate CO and TPR. Unique aspects of the proposed approach are that it
   approximates the aortic flow as a train of square waves and that it also
   assumes pressure-dependent arterial compliance, as opposed to the
   traditional windkessel model in which aortic flow is approximated as a
   train of impulses and constant arterial compliance is assumed. It was
   shown that the proposed model encompasses the standard windkessel model
   as a limiting case, and that it also yields more realistic BP waveform
   response than the standard windkessel model. The proposed approach has
   potential to outperform its standard counterpart by treating systolic,
   diastolic, and mean BP as independent features in estimating CO and TPR,
   rather than solely resorting to pulse pressure as in the case of the
   standard windkessel model. Experimental results from In-VIVO data
   collected from a number of animal subjects supports the viability of the
   proposed approach in that it could achieve approximately 29\% and 24\%
   reduction in CO and TPR errors when compared with its standard
   counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted in rock engineering that the strength of a rock
   mass decreases as the volume increases. There are two contributors to
   the rock mass strength: the strength of the intact rock, and the
   strength of the fractures. When creating a synthetic rock mass, the
   intact rock is first scaled to the volume of interest using published
   empirical scaling relationships. These intact-rock scaling laws are
   reviewed and it is shown that these scale effect are limited to 80\% of
   the standard laboratory uniaxial compressive strength. The effect of
   fractures on rock mass strength is examined using model studies and
   numerical discrete element software. It is shown that rock mass strength
   decreases as the fracture intensity increases. However, the lower limit
   to this decrease is controlled by the orientation of a single through
   going fracture relative to the direction of loading, and not the
   fracture intensity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, segregation related to the application of high
   centrifugal acceleration and the effect of thixotropy in modelling the
   settling behaviour of slurry/soft soils using a centrifuge are examined.
   Settling column and centrifuge tests were conducted on slurry/soft soils
   at various sand fines ratios (SFR) to define a segregation boundary
   using the ternary diagram. A segregation boundary based on centrifuge
   and settling column tests are established and the results indicate that
   the application of high gravity in centrifuge tests prompts and enhances
   segregation. It is also found that the segregation boundary of high
   gravity tests is a function of applied acceleration level, grain size of
   sand, the percentage fines and clay contents. The application of
   formulas that estimate the maximum size of sand that remain in
   suspension are evaluated and found conservative at high gravity tests.
   The shear strength of slurry/soft soils at various SFR and age were
   evaluated to assess the effect of non-gravity, time-dependent behaviour
   on strength and settling behaviour of slurry/soft soils. The results of
   the shear strength tests at various ages and composition indicate that
   strength gain is mainly due to thixotropy. The gain in shear strength
   due to thixotropy may not be properly modelled in centrifuge testing and
   may create difficulty in extrapolating centrifuge test results to
   prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) was grafted with the thermo-responsive
   polymer poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (Nipaam) via living radical
   polymerization. Various techniques were used to characterize the
   physical, chemical, morphological and thermal properties of the
   resulting material. The viscoelastic properties and the stability of the
   functionalized NCC were compared to the unmodified NCC using rheometry.
   The shear viscosity of the NCC suspension decreased slightly with an
   increase in temperature from 20 degrees C to 45 degrees C, indicating a
   stable system. The storage modulus and shear viscosity values both
   exhibited a burst increase at about 32.5 degrees C, which is assigned to
   be the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly(Nipaam). This
   indicates the successful functionalization of Nipaam polymer chains on
   NCC. In addition, the thermodynamic property of poly(Nipaam) also
   prevailed on the grafted NCC.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we describe the use of a composite material made of a
   renewable source and metallic nanoparticles for biosensing applications.
   NCC is a product isolated from natural cellulose fibers, which is of
   approx. 100 nm long and 10 nm wide in size. We augmented the surface
   area and chemical affinity of NCC by optimally dressing it with gold
   nanoparticles (AuNP). The deposition of AuNP on NCC was controlled by
   using cationic Polyethylenimine (PEI). AuNPs were thio-funtionalized
   prior to enzyme immobilization and the enzyme (glucose oxidase) was
   conjugated on the composite by carbodiimide (EDC)/NHS coupling. Using
   UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy in the presence of a specific
   substrate we monitored the activity of the immobilized enzymes, and its
   efficiency was compared with that of the enzyme in free form. Our
   results using FT-IR and SEM show that thiol-AuNPs were attached to the
   surface of NCC. The enzymes activity were measured and quantified using
   different kit assays and proved that the enzymes were attached to the
   support and maintained their activity.}},

Abstract = {{LS-SVR is widely used in time series prediction. For LS-SVR, the
   selection of appropriate kernel function is a key issue, which has a
   great impact with the prediction accuracy. Compared with some other
   feasible kernel functions, Gaussian RBF is always selected as kernel
   function due to its good features. As a distance functions-based kernel
   function, Gaussian RBF also has some drawbacks. In this paper, we
   modified the standard Gaussian RBF to satisfy the two requirements of
   distance functions-based kernel functions which are fast damping at the
   place adjacent to the test point and keeping a moderate damping at
   infinity. The simulation results indicate preliminarily that the
   modified Gaussian RBF has better performance and can improve the
   prediction accuracy with LS-SVR.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal lobe epilepsy patients with unilateralmesial temporal sclerosis
   (TLE + uMTS) have been demonstrated to have extensive white matter
   abnormalities both ipsilateral and contralateral to the seizure onset
   zone. However, comparatively less is known about the white matter
   integrity of TLE patients without MTS (non-lesional TLE, nl-TLE). The
   purpose of the study was to investigate the diffusion properties of
   thirteen major white matter tracts in patients with TLE + uMTS and
   nl-TLE. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed on 23 TLE + uMTS
   (15 left MTS and 8 right MTS), 15 nl-TLE and 21 controls. Thirteen
   tracts were delineated by tractography and their diffusion parameters
   compared for the two TLE groups relative to controls, with left and
   right hemispheres combined per tract. A subgroup analysis investigated
   left and right MTS separately. Compared to controls, reduced anisotropy
   was detected in ten tracts for TLE+ uMTS, but only the parahippocampal
   cingulum and tapetum for nl-TLE. Right MTS subgroup showed reduced
   anisotropy in 7 tracts bilaterally (3 limbic, 3 association, 1
   projection) and 2 tracts ipsilaterally (1 association, 1 projection) and
   the body of the corpus callosum whereas the left MTS subgroup showed
   reduced anisotropy in 4 tracts bilaterally (2 limbic, 1 association, 1
   projection) and 2 tracts ipsilaterally (1 limbic, 1 association).
   Diffusion abnormalities in tracts were observed within and beyond the
   temporal lobe in TLE+ uMTS and were more widespread than in nl-TLE.
   Patients with right MTS had more extensive, bilateral abnormalities in
   comparison to left MTS. These findings suggest different dysfunctional
   networks in TLE patients with and without MTS. (C) 2012 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Intrinsic disorder in proteins plays important roles in transcriptional
   regulation, translation, and cellular signal transduction. The
   experimental annotation of the disorder lags behind the rapidly
   accumulating number of known protein chains, which motivates the
   development of computational predictors of disorder. Some of these
   methods address predictions of certain types/flavors of the disorder and
   recent years show that consensusbased predictors provide a viable way to
   improve predictive performance. However, the selection of the base
   predictors in a given consensus is usually performed in an ad-hock
   manner, based on their availability and with a premise that more is
   better. We perform first-of-its-kind investigation that analyzes
   complementarity among a dozen recent predictors to identify
   characteristics of (future) predictors that would lead to further
   consensus-based improvements in the predictive quality. The
   complementarity of a given set of three base predictors is expressed by
   the differences in their predictions when compared with each other and
   with their majority vote consensus. We propose a regression-based model
   that quantifies/predicts quality of the majority-vote consensus of a
   given triplet of predictors based on their individual predictive
   performance and their complementarity measured at the residue and the
   disorder segment levels. Our model shows that improved performance is
   associated with higher (lower) similarity between the three base
   predictors at the residue (segment) level and to their consensus
   prediction at the segment (residue) level. We also show that better
   consensuses utilize higher quality base methods. We use our model to
   predict the best-performing consensus on an independent test dataset and
   our empirical evaluation shows that this consensus outperforms
   individual methods and other consensus-based predictors based on the
   area under the ROC curve measure. Our study provides insights that could
   lead to the development of a new generation of the consensus-based
   disorder predictors.}},

Abstract = {{Surface enhanced Raman scattering is a promising technique for high

   have to be addressed in order to make SERS a reliable technique such as
   the optimization of conditions for any given analyte, understanding the

   nanostructures and understanding the evolution and coagulation of the
   nanostructures, in the case of colloidal solutions. The background
   electrolyte is a very important factor in SERS experiments. Here we
   report a detailed study of the influence of the addition of different
   types of electrolytes on the amplitude and kinetics of the SERS signal
   in silver colloids. Different amino acids and organic dyes were used as
   test molecules in the concentration range of 10(-8) to 10(-4) M. We
   found that a new proposed electrolyte containing HCO3, CO3, Cl and SO4
   ions provides very high enhancement of Raman signal in organic molecules
   we studied. The advantages of the composite electrolyte are especially
   noticeable at low concentration of tryptophan where we observed 10(8)
   enhancement of Raman signal, approximately 300 times larger than for the

   circuits have attracted significant attention due to advantages in
   information density and operating speed. In this paper, a pseudo
   complementary MVL design is initially proposed for implementations using
   carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFETs). This design utilizes
   no resistors in its operation. To account for the properties and
   fabrication non-idealities of CNTFETs, a transistor-level reliability
   analysis is proposed to accurately estimate the error rates of MVL
   gates. This approach considers gate structures and their operation, so
   it yields a more realistic framework than a logic-level analysis of
   reliability. To achieve scalability, stochastic computational models are
   developed to accurately and efficiently analyze MVL gates; the extension

Abstract = {{This paper considers the average consensus problem in networks of
   multiple integrators with unidirectional information links. To reduce
   the communication cost, we set up a scheme of sampled-data control
   driven by edge events for distributed state consensus. These edge events
   are defined independently for each information link, and their
   occurrence activates the mutually state sampling and controller update
   of the corresponding two neighboring agents. A set of event-triggering
   rules are first proposed for the asynchronous data sampling. They are
   implemented in a complete distributed fashion and no more information
   exchange is needed between event times. Then this result is further
   revised to incorporate periodically time-driven event detection. This
   treatment eliminates the possibility of infinitesimal inter-event time
   periods and also makes the presented protocol valid in the traditional
   sampled-data control framework.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure drop through micro-pillar-integrated mini/microchannels is
   studied experimentally and analytically. Following our previous studies,
   the low aspect ratio micropillars embedded in a microchannel are modeled
   as a porous medium sandwiched between channel walls. The pressure drop
   is expressed as a function of the salient geometrical parameters such as
   channel dimension, diameter and spacing between the adjacent cylinders
   as well as their arrangement. To verify the developed model, several
   silicon/glass samples with and without integrated pillars are fabricated
   using the deep reacting ion etching (DRIE) technique. Pressure drop
   measurements are performed over a range of water flow rates ranging from
   0.1 ml/min to 0.5 ml/min. The proposed model is successfully verified
   with the present experimental data. A parametric study is performed by
   employing the proposed model, which shows that the flow resistance has a
   reverse relationship with the micro-pillar diameter and the
   mini/microchannel porosity. In addition, staggered arrangements have a
   significantly lower flow resistance than squared arrays of pillars
   especially in dense structures.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental system for understanding the flow field near the
   meniscus during the capillarity or under capillary action is developed.
   Capillary flow is one of the mechanisms for driving fluid in a
   microfluidic device. The literature highlights that a significant amount
   of work has been done on the theoretical understanding of the capillary
   transport in rectangular microchannels. However, these models for
   capillary flow neglect the flow behavior at the liquid-air interface,
   which may have a significant influence in terms of the velocity field
   and the transience of the penetration depth in the micro-capillary. The
   objective of the present study is to understand the flow development
   during the advancement of the meniscus. The aim is to elucidate the
   dynamics of the three phase contact line and other micro-scale effects
   during the capillarity. A mu- PIV technique has been used to study the
   flow development near the meniscus and the results are further refined
   using a hybrid mu-PIV/PTV technique. Effects of surface tension in the
   fully developed flow regime during the advancement of meniscus are
   studied in detail. Variations in the centreline velocity of the
   progression of the meniscus and temporal variations in the development
   of flow are identified as possible areas for departure from theory.}},

Title = {{Effects of the gas phase molecular weight and bubble size on
   effervescent atomization}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-52}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effervescent atomization from an industrial Coker feed nozzle is
   compared for two different gas densities (air and mixed gas of 81.4
   vol.\% helium/18.6 vol.\% nitrogen) at equivalent operating
   temperatures. The application is to observe the similarity of lab tests
   using air at 20 C to the industrial process using steam at 300-400
   degrees C. The effects of operating conditions, such as gas to liquid
   mass ratio, mixing pressure and void fraction on the flow regime, bubble
   size, and droplet size distribution were also examined in this study.
   The experiments were performed using mixtures of water with air or mixed
   gas, which resulted in gas to liquid mass ratios ranging from 1\% to
   4\%.
   Stroboscopic back scattered imagery (SBSI) indicates that the average
   bubble size inside the nozzle conduit is similar when air and water are
   used as the process fluids, when compared to the case when mixed gas and
   water are used as the process fluids. Under similar conditions, the
   Phase Doppler Particle Anemometer (PDPA) data indicate that the droplet
   size in the spray is similar when using either mixed gas or air as the
   atomization gas.
   Experimental results obtained by high-speed video shadowgraphy (HSVS)
   indicate that the flow pattern inside the nozzle feeding conduit was
   slug flow with a tendency to attain annular flow with increased air to
   liquid mass ratios. Thus, from the experimental results it is evident
   that the smaller molecular weight of the mixed gas versus air (8.4
   versus 29) does not significantly reduce the bubble (<+/- 10\%
   difference) and droplet size (<+/- 1.5\% difference), indicating a weak
   dependence of the gas phase density on two-phase atomization. This
   confirms that laboratory experiments on effervescent nozzles using air
   have reliable similarity to systems that use high temperature steam for
   the gas phase. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The role of order within a porous separation matrix on the separation
   efficiency of DNA was studied systematically. DNA separation was based
   on a ratchet mechanism. Monodisperse colloidal suspensions of
   nanoparticles were used to fabricate highly ordered separation media
   with a hexagonal close-packed structure. Doping with a second particle
   size yielded structures with different degrees of disorder, depending
   upon the volume fraction of each particle size. Radial distribution
   functions and orientational order parameters were calculated from
   electron micrographs to characterize the scale of disorder. The peak
   separation distance, band broadening, and separation resolution of DNA
   molecules was quantified for each structure. DNA separation parameters
   using pulsed fields and the ratchet effect showed a strong dependence on
   order within the porous nanoparticle array. Ordered structures gave
   large separation distances, smaller band broadening and better
   resolution than highly disordered, nearly random, porous structures. The
   effect dominated these three parameters when compared to the effect of
   pore size. However, the effect of order on separation performance was
   not monotonic. A small, but statistically significant improvement was
   seen in structures with short range order compared to those with long
   range order.}},

Abstract = {{Since superconducting coils cause the current decay due to connection
   resistance and intrinsic characteristic in the persistent current mode,
   various current compensations should be required to maintain stable
   property in the superconducting magnet system. As an achievable
   solution, we fabricated a new prototype power supply, i.e., linear-type
   superconducting power supply (LISPS) and we carried out the operating
   characteristics of LISPS in the small scale magnets. In order to apply
   the LTPSP for real scale magnet, charging characteristics for various
   magnet scales should be expected. In the paper, based on the
   experimental results, we design a modeling of charging characteristic of
   LISPS using a granular-based radial basis function neural networks
   (RBFNNs) realized with aid of the granular techniques. In contrast with
   the plethora of existing approaches, here we consider a development
   strategy in which a topology of the network is predominantly based upon
   a collection of information granules formed on a basis of available
   experimental data. The underlying design tool guiding the development of
   the granular-based RBFNN is based on two categories of methods such as
   K-means clustering and the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method. As
   shown in the experimental studies, the granular-based RBFNN possesses
   essential properties of universal approximation. The model of charging
   characteristic of LISPS constructed is concerned with a limited dataset
   (where the limitations are associated with high costs of acquiring data)
   as well as strong nonlinear characteristics of the underlying
   phenomenon. For modeling and evaluation of the performance of the SPS
   neural network, in advance we also run experiments for other publicly
   available data such as a well-known NASA software project data as well
   as synthetic nonlinear data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mining maximal frequent itemsets is of paramount relevance in many of

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with developing an online algorithm for
   detecting and estimating systematic errors (gross errors) in mass and
   energy balances from measurement data. This method has its application
   in diagnosing problems in an oil sands process. Conventional techniques
   for detecting gross errors presently exist for offline application. The
   proposed online method entitled Dynamic Bayesian Gross Error Detection
   (DBGED) is a dynamic Bayesian analogue of traditional gross error
   detection, and can be considered as a type of Switching Kalman Filter.
   As such, related topics such as Kalman Filtering, observability and
   Dynamic Bayesian Inference are discussed. In addition to detecting gross
   errors, the DBGED also estimates detected gross error magnitudes in real
   time (as an augmented state variable) so that future measurements can be
   corrected. When the estimate converges to yield satisfactory prediction
   errors, gross error estimation is stopped and instruments are corrected
   with a constant gross error correction term. DBGED performance is
   demonstrated through a simulation example and an example of an
   industrial application. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the optimal boundary control problem for
   diffusion-convection-reaction processes modeled by partial differential
   equations (PDEs) defined on time-dependent spatial domains is
   considered. The model of the transport system with time-varying domain
   arises in the context of high energy consuming Czochralski crystal
   growth process in which the crystal temperature regulation must
   successfully account for the change in the crystal spatial domain due to
   the crystal growth process realized by the pulling crystal out of melt.
   Starting from the first principles of continuum mechanics and transport
   theorem the time-varying parabolic PDE describing temperature evolution
   is derived and represented as a nonautonomous parabolic evolution system
   on an appropriately defined function space which is exactly transformed
   in the infinite-dimensional boundary control problem for which a
   boundary linear quadratic regulator is proposed. Properties of the
   solution of the time-varying parabolic PDEs given by the two-parameter
   evolutionary system are utilized in the synthesis of the optimal
   boundary regulator, and the control law is applied to the model given by
   a two-dimensional partial differential equation in the cylindrical
   coordinates representing the Czochralski crystal growth process with
   one-dimensional growth direction. Finally, numerical results demonstrate
   optimal stabilization of the two-dimensional temperature distribution in
   the crystal. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The increased penetration of nonlinear loads and power-electronics-based
   distributed generation (DG) systems may introduce power quality issues
   to the distribution power system. However, if controlled and regulated
   properly, the DG-grid interfacing converters are able to improve the
   distribution system efficiency and power quality. This paper focuses on
   the distribution system harmonic control through the DG-grid interfacing
   converters. Two alternative DG systems, namely, current-controlled DG
   and voltage-controlled DG, are considered. While most of the previous
   works on harmonic compensation are based on the current-controlled
   method, a novel harmonic control scheme using a voltage-controlled
   method is developed in this paper. The voltage-controlled method is more
   flexible and has similar compensation performance compared to the
   conventional current-controlled method. In addition, by avoiding the
   implementation of a harmonic current tracking loop, the proposed
   voltage-based method can be seamlessly incorporated into a
   voltage-controlled DG unit, which is important to provide direct voltage
   and frequency support in a microgrid. Moreover, the possible harmonic
   circulating current among multiple DG systems is also investigated in
   this paper. Simulations and experimental results from a three-phase
   5-kVA laboratory DG prototype are provided to validate the discussion.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares three configurations of wind turbines to produce a

   years. Alternatives under study are: installing twenty Endurance (EN) 5
   kW, or five Jacobs (JA) 20 kW, or one Northern Power (NP) 100 kW
   turbines in the Halkirk region of Alberta, Canada. The comparison has
   been done taking life cycle energy, environment and economic aspects
   into consideration. Each parameter has been quantified corresponding to
   a functional unit (FU) of 1 kWh. Life cycle energy requirement for NP is
   found to be 133.3 kJ/kWh, which is about 69\% and 41\% less than EN and
   JA respectively. Global warming impact from NP is found to be 17.8
   gCO(2eq)/kWh, which is around 58\% and 29\% less respective to EN and
   JA. The acidification (SO(2eq)/kWh) and ground level ozone {[}(VOC +
   NOx)/kWh] impacts from NP are also found significantly less compared to
   EN and JA configuration. The difference in relative environmental
   impacts from configurations is found to be less while performing
   uncertainty analysis, but does not alter the ranking of configurations.
   At 10\% internal rate of return (IRR), electricity price for NP is
