Abstract = {{We examine the role of crack-tip conditions in the reduction of stress
   at a crack tip in a theory of linear elasticity with surface effects.
   The maximum number of allowable end conditions for complete removal of a
   stress singularity is demonstrated for both plane and anti-plane
   problems. In particular, we show that the necessary and sufficient
   conditions for bounded stresses at a crack tip cannot be satisfied with
   a first-order (curvature-independent) theory of surface effects, which
   leads, at most, to the reduction of the classical strong square-root
   singularity to a weaker logarithmic singularity.}},

   the interplay between disorder and structure, the genomic distribution

   available in a unified format for download as flat files or SQL tables
   either by genome, by predictor, or for the complete set. An interactive
   website provides a graphical view of each protein annotated with the

Abstract = {{Experiments with a nonlinear trajectory-tracking controller for marine
   unmanned surface vessels are reported. The tracking controller is
   designed using a nonlinear robust model-based sliding mode approach. The
   marine vehicles can track arbitrary desired trajectories that are
   defined in Cartesian coordinate as continuous functions of time. The
   planar dynamic model used for the controller design consists of 3
   degrees of freedom (DOFs) of surge, sway, and yaw. The vessel only has
   two actuators, so the vessel is underactuated. Therefore, only two
   outputs, which are functions of the 3-DOF, can be controlled. The
   Cartesian position of a control point on the vessel is defined as the
   output. The orientation dynamics is not directly controlled. It has been
   previously shown that the orientation dynamics, as the internal dynamics
   of this underactuated system, is stable. The result of field experiments
   show the effectiveness of tracking control laws in the presence of
   parameter uncertainty and disturbance. The experiments were performed in
   a large outdoor pond using a small test boat. This paper reports the
   first theoretical development and experimental verification of the
   proposed model-based nonlinear trajectory-tracking controller.}},

Abstract = {{To understand and predict the in situ brittle rock mass damage process
   induced by a coupled thermo-mechanical loading, the knowledge of rock
   mass yielding strength, scaling relationship between laboratory and in
   situ and microstructure characterization is required. Difficulties have
   been recognized due to the seldom availability of in situ experiment and
   appropriate numerical methodologies. The A{''}spo Pillar Stability
   Experiment was used to monitor the evolution of rock mass damage in a
   pillar of rock separating two 1.75-m diameter vertical boreholes. The
   loading of the pillar was controlled using the in situ stresses,
   excavation geometry, and locally increasing the rock temperature. The
   induced loading resulted in a complex discontinuum process that involved
   fracture initiation, propagation, interaction and buckling, all
   dominated by a tensile mechanism. Tracking this damage process was
   carried out in two steps. Initially, a three-dimensional numerical model
   was used to generate the stresses from the excavation geometry and
   thermal loading. The plane strain stresses, at selected locations where
   detailed displacement monitoring was available, were then used to track
   the evolution of damage caused by these induced stresses. The
   grain-based discrete element modeling approach described in Lan et al.
   (2010), which captures the grain scale heterogeneity of the rock, was
   used to establish the extent of damage. Good agreement was found between
   the predicted and measured temperatures and displacements. The
   grain-based model provided new insights into the progressive failure
   process.}},

   dynamic heterogeneity and collective atomic motion}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{1254-1265}},
Abstract = {{Most condensed materials exhibit a significant fraction of atoms,
   molecules or particles that strongly interact with each other, while
   being configured geometrically at any instant of time in an `amorphous'
   state having a relatively uniform density. Recently, both simulations
   and experiments have revealed that the dynamics of diverse condensed
   amorphous materials is generally characterized by significant
   heterogeneity in the local mobility and by progressively increasing
   collective motion upon cooling that takes the form of string-like
   collective particle rearrangements. The direct experimental observation
   of this type of collective motion, which has been directly linked to the
   growing relaxation times of glass-forming materials, and its
   quantification under different thermodynamic conditions, have so far
   been restricted to colloidal and driven granular fluids. The present
   work addresses the fundamental problem of how to determine the scale of
   this type of collective motion in materials composed of molecules or
   atoms. The basic premise of our work is that large scale dynamic
   particle clustering in amorphous materials must give rise to large
   fluctuations in particle mobility so that transport properties,
   especially those related to particle mobility, should naturally exhibit
   noise related to the cooperative motion scale. In our initial
   exploratory study seeking a relationship of this kind, we find
   1/f(alpha) or `colored noise', in both potential energy and particle
   displacement fluctuations of the atoms within the glassy interfacial
   layer of Ni nanoparticles (NPs). A direct relationship between the
   particle displacement (mobility) noise exponent alpha and the average
   polymerization index of the string-like collective motion L is observed
   for a range of NP sizes, temperatures and for surface doping of the NPs
   with other metal atoms (Ag, Au, Pt) to change the fragility of the
   glassy interfacial layer at the surface of the Ni NPs. We also introduce
   a successful analytic model to understand this relationship between
   alpha and L.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of the dynamics of diverse condensed amorphous materials
   have indicated significant heterogeneity in the local mobility and a
   progressive increase in collective particle motion upon cooling that
   takes the form of string-like particle rearrangements. In a previous
   paper (Part I), we examined the possibility that fluctuations in
   potential energy E and particle mobility mu associated with this
   `dynamic heterogeneity' might offer information about the scale of
   collective motion in glassy materials based on molecular dynamics
   simulations of the glassy interfacial region of Ni nanoparticles (NPs)
   at elevated temperatures. We found that the noise exponent associated
   with fluctuations in the Debye-Waller factor, a mobility related
   quantity, was directly proportional to the scale of collective motion L
   under a broad range of conditions, but the noise exponent associated
   with E(t) fluctuations was seemingly unrelated to L. In the present
   work, we focus on this unanticipated difference between potential energy
   and mobility fluctuations by examining these quantities at an atomic
   scale. We find that the string atoms exhibit a jump-like motion between
   two well-separated bands of energy states and the rate at which these
   jumps occur seems to be consistent with the phenomenology of the
   `slow-beta' relaxation process of glass-forming liquids. Concurrently
   with these local E(t) jumps, we also find `quake-like' particle
   displacements having a power-law distribution in magnitude so that
   particle displacement fluctuations within the strings are strikingly
   different from local E(t) fluctuations. An analysis of these E(t)
   fluctuations suggests that we are dealing with `discrete breather'
   excitations in which large energy fluctuations develop in arrays of
   non-linear oscillators by virtue of large anharmonicity in the
   interparticle interactions and discreteness effects associated with
   particle packing. We quantify string collective motions on a fast caging
   timescale (picoseconds) and explore the significance of these collective
   motions for understanding the Boson peak of glass-forming materials.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic spontaneous imbibition (DSI) plays an important role in oil

Abstract = {{Effect of artificial weathering on the surface structural changes of
   birch (Betule papyrifera) wood, heat-treated to different temperatures,
   was studied using the fluorescence microscopy and the scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). Changes in the chemical structure of wood components
   were analyzed by FTIR in order to understand the mechanism of
   degradation taking place due to heat treatment and artificial
   weathering. The results are compared with those of the untreated
   (kiln-dried) birch. The SEM analysis results show that the effect of
   weathering on the cell wall of the untreated birch surface is more than
   that of heat-treated samples. The FTIR spectroscopy results indicate
   that lignin is the most sensitive component of heat-treated birch to the
   weathering degradation process. Elimination of the amorphous and highly
   crystallised cellulose is observed for both heat-treated and untreated
   wood during weathering. It is also observed that heat treatment
   increases the lignin and crystallised cellulose contents, which to some
   extent protects heat-treated birch against degradation due to
   weathering. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multidrug resistance (MDR) is among the major mechanisms leading to
   failure in chemotherapy of cancer patients. The ATP-binding cassette
   proteins are major contributors to MDR, involved in the active efflux of
   xenobiotics out of cancer cells. Among them, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is
   the most dominant protein involved in the efflux of drugs. For more than
   30 years, scientists have searched for the ideal P-gp inhibitor to
   modulate drug resistance activity of P-gp. This inhibitor should be
   tissue and cell specific with side effects on other tissues, must not
   provoke immune responses from the host, should provide sustained
   inhibition, and must be synthesized readily with low cost. Chemical P-gp
   inhibitors tested to date, have shown nonspecific toxic effects limiting
   their clinical applications. Sequence-specific P-gp gene silencing by
   RNA interference (RNAi) may provide a more effective approach for
   downregulation of specific protein targets due to high specificity,
   limited toxicity and immunogenicity, and relative ease in synthesis.
   RNAi can be implemented by delivery of synthetic small interfering RNAs
   (siRNAs) or by gene expression of short hairpin RNAs using gene
   expressing vectors. Specific delivery systems and expression vectors
   have been designed for this purpose and many researchers have explored
   their effectiveness for P-gp downregulation. In this report, we review
   the efficiency of various methods for siRNA delivery and transfection
   for P-gp downregulation in cancer cells for MDR reversal. Novel ideas
   and observations by different research groups were discussed for future
   improvement in this essential field. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   and Ru-Pd bimetallic nanocatalysts prepared by simultaneous reductions.
   The particle size (mostly within 2 nm) and their monodispersity were
   confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, while X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy indicated the bimetallics' alloy structure. Pd catalysts
   displayed the lowest activity in the ring opening; Ru showed the highest
   formation of undesired o-xylene and lights. Monometallic Ir displayed
   the highest activity and selectivity toward 2-ethyltoluene and
   n-propylbenzene. In bimetallic structures, higher Ir content led to
   improved catalytic performance. Next to the monometallic Ir catalyst,
   the newly developed Ru1Ir4/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst (with 1 : 4 molar ratio
   of Ru to Ir) displayed superior single cleavage selectivity as well as
   lower cracking activity compared to industrial Pt-Ir catalysts at a
   comparable indan conversion. The study can pave the way in the
   development of Pt-free Ru-containing catalysts with narrow size
   distributions for selective ring opening, especially taking into
   consideration a possibility of their higher S-resistance as compared to
   the Pt catalysts.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{308-320}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments has been designed and conducted to study the
   effect of three operating factors, namely, coal feedrate, coal particle
   size, and steam/O-2 ratio, and their interactions on the quality of
   syngas produced from fluidized bed gasification of lignite coal. The
   quality of syngas is evaluated based on five indices including carbon
   conversion, H-2/CO ratio, CH4/H-2 ratio, gas yield, and gasification
   efficiency. The design of experiment tool based on the response surface
   methodology (RSM), which is believed to be more accurate than the common
   one-factor-at-a-time approach, is used to facilitate the comparison of
   the effect of all factors. The factors are tested in the ranges of
   0.036-0.063 g/s, 70-500 mu m, and 0.5-1.0, for coal feedrate, coal
   particle size, and steam/O-2 ratio, respectively. The carbon conversion,
   H-2/CO ratio, CH4/H-2 ratio, gas yield, and gasification efficiency are
   found to range from 91\% to 97\%, 0.776 to 1.268, 0.0517 to 0.0702, 3.4
   to 3.7 m(3) gas/kg coal, and 56\% to 67\%, respectively. The effects of
   individual operating factors and their interactions on each syngas
   quality index are discussed using RSM tools. A set of operating
   conditions to achieve syngas with a desired quality for different
   applications is also proposed by optimization of the response surface of
   each index. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The growing demand for electricity and the restructuring of power
   markets is forcing the power industry to change the way that power
   systems are planned and operated. Traditionally, transmission lines have
   been operated based on fixed deterministic thermal ratings, causing
   underutilization of their potential capacity. Efforts to overcome this
   limitation led to the development of alternative rating strategies based
   on probabilistic and dynamic methods.
   In this paper, a probabilistic static thermal rating method based on
   typical weather conditions along a transmission line is described and
   analyzed. The results of load and energy throughput analyses show that
   the use of this rating approach can significantly increase line
   throughput compared to traditional deterministic rating methods.
   However, this approach can also substantially increase the risk of
   thermal overload.
   To identify the problems associated with the use of a probabilistic
   static thermal rating method, we performed a sensitivity study.
   Statistical analysis of weather parameters shows that line ratings
   calculated from typical weather data are inflated. Additional results
   confirm that values of risk tolerance and wind direction incorporated
   into the rating method significantly affect the resulting rating values.
   We suggest values for these parameters that minimize the risk of line
   overloading. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Power dissipation has become a significant issue for integrated circuit
   design in nanometric CMOS technology. To reduce power consumption,
   approximate implementations of a circuit have been considered as a
   potential solution for applications in which strict exactness is not
   required. In inexact computing, power reduction is achieved through the
   relaxation of the often demanding requirement of accuracy. In this
   paper, new approximate adders are proposed for low-power imprecise
   applications. These adders are based on XOR/XNOR gates with multiplexers
   implemented by pass transistors. The proposed approximate XOR/XNOR-based
   adders (AXAs) are evaluated and compared with respect to energy
   consumption, delay, area and power delay product (PDP) with an accurate
   full adder. The metric of error distance is used to evaluate the
   reliability of the approximate designs. Simulation by Cadence's Spectre
   in TSMC 65nm process has shown that the proposed designs consume less
   power and have better performance (such as a lower propagation delay)
   compared to the accurate XOR/XNOR-based adder, while the error distance
   remains similar or better than other approximate adder designs.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we discuss the high-field magnetoresistance effects and
   temperature-dependent spin relaxation in rubrene nanowire spin valves.
   Rubrene thin film spin valves have been studied by several groups in the
   past since this material can potentially offer long spin relaxation
   length (L-s). However, the Ls values reported so far have been low,
   typically similar to 10 nm at low temperatures (similar to 10K).
   Recently we have reported a vertical spin valve device using rubrene
   spacer, in which rubrene is patterned in a nanowire array geometry. Such
   patterning leads to significant suppression of spin relaxation and we
   have reported spin relaxation length of 47 nm at similar to 10K in
   rubrene nanowires. In this work we present the high field
   magnetoresistance measurements performed on rubrene nanowires and
   discuss the possible origins of these effects. Further, we discuss
   possible origin of the observed temperature-dependence of spin

Abstract = {{Nonlinear systems under uncertainty are difficult to regulate with
   guaranteed stability and optimality. This study presents a switching
   control strategy, which consists of robust control Lyapunov
   function-based predictive controller and approximate. dynamic
   programming-based controller. The former guarantees the robust stability
   within a level set, referred to as region of attraction (ROA). The
   latter improves optimality and reduces computational complexity in
   solving Bellman equation when the system is outside the ROA. The
   suggested approach is illustrated on a continuous stirred tank reactor

Abstract = {{Outliers are the observations which do not follow the regular pattern of
   system, and usually generated by the mechanical faults, measurement
   error, changes in system behavior. For the precise demand with the
   dynamic modeling, it is necessary to remove outliers from the measured
   raw data before constructing the model. Traditional statistical
   parameter estimation often fail to detect outliers in the functional
   profile. In this paper we propose a practical approach to outlier
   detection, which are based on the characteristics of time-dependent
   signal. The proposed algorithm included the change rate of signal
   calculation, statistical parameters estimation, signal recovering. A
   bioinformatic application demonstrates powerfulness of the proposed
   algorithm. The most advantage of the propose method is that it only
   clean (i.e., detects and recovers) outliers and preserves all other
   information in the observations.}},

Abstract = {{From 2009 to 2012, the author contributed to the team teaching of
   computer programming to thousands of first-year engineers at the
   University of Alberta. Despite a complex scenario, his main objectives
   were to improve both the course material and his teaching evaluations.
   Through productive collaborations with colleagues and administrators, he
   succeeded via a transition from procedural C++, with a virtual robot
   called Karel, to MATLAB, with a video game called Gorillas. These two
   versions of the course are compared and contrasted, with a focus on the
   author's own contributions. Furthermore, the pedagogical approach is
   compared and contrasted with that of relevant literature. As with the
   state of the art, the work argues in favour of teaching introductory
   programming using MATLAB. Unlike the state of the art, the proposed
   approach exploits video game design and iterative and incremental
   development. Effectiveness of the contributions are demonstrated through
   student, peer, and self assessments.}},

   incorporates the robot's kinematics and dynamics, along with

   improve the estimation performance in terms of memory use and model fit.

   is to identify undesirable terms in the sample covariance matrix which
   cause perturbations in the estimation of the signal and noise subspaces.
   These terms are then diminished in an iterative manner. The proposed
   method is studied by investigating the mean squared error, the detection
   probability, and the mean squared error in case of successful detection.

   power constraint for each relay. We formulate the PN-SNR maximization
   problem with a received SNR constraint to maintain the quality of
   service (QoS) and propose a low complexity algorithm for a suboptimal
   solution. The average PN-SNR and average throughput of the proposed
   design are simulated and compared with existing designs. We also
   simulate the probability of no transmission with the proposed design for
   an arbitrary SNR level. We observe that the proposed design is more
   power efficient than existing ones with comparable performance in
   average throughput. When the transmitter power is moderate, with higher
   QoS constraint, the probability of no transmission gets higher; the
   average throughput decreases, but the PN-SNR of the network increases.}},

Abstract = {{In order to mitigate the problem of crowded radio spectrum, dynamic
   spectrum access (DSA) has become the solution and a research focal
   point. The number of works in wideband spectrum sensing is dramatically
   increasing recently due to its importance in cognitive radio (CR)
   networks. Most works assume that secondary users (SUs) are synchronous
   with the primary users' (PUs) network. However, in many practical
   systems the SUs will have no information about the PUs' communication
   protocols. Furthermore, it is also possible that communications among
   PUs are not based on synchronous operation. In order to address such
   problems, a contention-based wideband DSA algorithm with asynchronous
   cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), called the DySac, is proposed. In
   this scheme, the SUs need not maintain synchronism with the PUs, and the
   SUs who intend to access the primary network compete among each other
   for available channels. Performance analysis and simulations are
   conducted to evaluate the proposed DySac.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity gains of cooperative relay networks are degraded in the
   presence of co-channel interference (CCI), which is the principal
   limiting factor in a properly planned cellular network. Optimum
   combining (OC) can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of CCI, which
   enables achieving diversity gains when CCI is present. The performance
   of OC in a channel state information (CSI) assisted amplify-and-forward
   (AF) relay network is analyzed when the destination node is affected by
   CCI, with the aid of a tight approximation for the
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the destination node.
   Closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability and the
   moment generating function for the approximated SINR. It is proved that
   OC results in a diversity gain of M, where M is the number of relay
   nodes. OC shows significant performance improvements over maximal-ratio
   combining (MRC), which reaches error floors at low-to-medium power
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study a cellular network, in which multiple-antenna
   users communicate with multiple-antenna base stations (BSs) through
   fixed infrastructure-based multiple antenna relay stations (RSs). With
   cooperation among the BSs and linear processing at the RSs, we aim to
   find the optimal precoding matrices at the users and the beamforming
   matrices at the RSs that jointly maximize the system sum rate. Unlike
   for the conventional uplink (without relays), the sum-rate optimization
   is non-convex. More so, there is cross-coupling of the RSs' channels due
   to the forwarded interferences by the RSs. Firstly, we incorporate
   interference pre-cancelation into the RSs' beamforming designs.
   Secondly, we match each RS's beamforming matrix to the corresponding
   backward and forward channels such that the end-to-end channel is
   diagonalizable. Furthermore, we propose an iterative alternating
   minimization based algorithm to maximize the system sum rate. Finally,
   we consider two user-RS scheduling/mapping schemes namely the
   ``random{''} and ``channel-aware{''} schemes. Simulation results show
   that the channel-aware scheme outperform the random scheme with the
   performance gap unchanged with increasing number of antennas at the

Abstract = {{Cooperative relaying achieves a wide range of advantages including
   diversity gain, coverage extension and mitigation of shadowing.
   Nevertheless, the performance advantages of cooperative relaying
   diminish considerably if co-channel interference is present. Optimum
   combining (OC) can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of co-channel
   interference in wireless communications. The performance of optimum
   combining in a decode-and-forward relay network with N equal-power
   interferers is analyzed. The probability density function of the output
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is obtained and a closed-form
   expression for the exact outage probability is derived for N >= M + 1
   where M is the number of relay nodes. An approximation for the symbol
   error rate (SER) is presented. The performance results and closed-form
   expressions for outage probability and for SER suggest that the
   asymptotic diversity gain of OC is equal to M, which is a significant
   improvement over maximal-ratio combining, whose asymptotic diversity
   gain is equal to zero when operating in co-channel interference.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative spectrum sensing is a promising technology for spectrum
   sensing with superior performance. Previous work has assumed that
   secondary users (SUs) are synchronous with the primary users' (PUs)
   network. However, on one hand, the SUs may have no information about the
   PUs' communication protocols. On the other hand, in some cases
   communications among PUs are not based on synchronous operation. In
   order to address such problems, an asynchronous cooperative sensing
   scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the SUs need not synchronize with
   the PUs when dynamically sensing and accessing primary channels. The
   channel-usage pattern is modeled as an ON-OFF process and the SUs'
   average throughput of each asynchronous case is analyzed based on the
   detection and false alarm probability. The optimal sensing period for
   the sensing scheme is achieved by maximizing the SUs' average
   throughput. Simulation results evaluate the performance of the scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately logging oil sands core is a challenging process because
   sedimentary and biogenic features are difficult to see in
   bitumen-saturated strata. A suite of oil sands core was scanned using
   the SisuROCK hyperspectral imaging system. Analysis of the spectral
   imagery revealed that in the shortwave infrared we can ``see through{''}
   thin bitumen at the surface and readily identify structures and fabrics
   that are not visible to the unaided eye. In the spectral data, we
   identify broad spectral classes that correlate to lithofacies, which are
   then used to create rudimentary lithological maps. Greyscale ore-grade
   maps are also created using an existing spectral model for the
   determination of bitumen content. Developing an automated method for the
   removal of man-made materials from the hyperspectral imagery, based on a
   spectral library developed during this study, remains a research
   preoccupation. Future work will investigate the discrimination of
   individual clay minerals, particularly swelling vs. non-swelling.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronous distributed generators are prone to operate islanded after
   contingencies, which usually is not allowed due to safety and power
   quality issues. Thus, there are several anti-islanding techniques;
   however, most of them present technical limitations so that they are
   likely to fail in certain situations. Therefore, it is important to
   quantify and determine whether the scheme under study is adequate or
   not. In this context, this paper proposes an index to evaluate the
   effectiveness of anti-islanding frequency-based relays commonly used to
   protect synchronous distributed generators. The method is based on the
   calculation of a numerical index that indicates the time period that the
   system is unprotected against islanding considering the global period of
   analysis. Although this index can precisely be calculated based on
   several electromagnetic transient simulations, a practical method is
   also proposed to calculate it directly from simple analytical formulas
   or look-up tables. The results have shown that the proposed approach can
   assist distribution engineers to assess and set anti-islanding
   protection schemes.}},

   array of pixels with modulation in amplitude and phase, and the Fourier
   transform of this array is created optically and recorded in a
   holographic medium. However, if the stored image contains high intensity
   peaks, the material can saturate, and on readout, the reconstructed data
   array will contain errors. Therefore, in this paper we present a coding
   technique to reduce the severity of Fourier domain peaks in the recorded
   images by enforcing a sparsity constraint on the data array prior to
   creating the Fourier transform image. We limit our consideration to
   hybrid-ternary modulated (HTM) data arrays.}},

Abstract = {{The wireless magnetic sensor network is scalable and deployable for
   traffic surveillance. But active magnetic sensors of the wireless sensor
   node have high energy consumption which cannot be ignored. It is
   necessary to save energy of the wireless magnetic sensor node for
   vehicle detection. In this paper, based on compressed sensing (CS) by
   random down sampling matrix, an energy-efficient sub-Nyquist sampling
   method in magnetic sensor network is proposed for vehicle detection.
   With this new sampling method, the active magnetic sensor's average
   frequency is less than the Nyquist standard sampling frequency, which
   reduces the energy consumption of the active sensor, while extending the
   lifetime of the wireless sensor nodes. When the Compressed Radio (CR)
   meets the maximum value of 60\%, the new sampling method doubles the
   wireless magnetic sensor node's lifetime and maintains vehicle detection
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{To fulfill the needs of construction quality, progress control and
   sustainable development of the underground space, it is desirable to
   collect and visualize as-built tunnel information in real time. In the
   current practice, the as-built model of a tunnel is produced either by
   using advanced technologies like 3D laser scanning after construction
   ends, or by employing specialist tunnel surveyors to directly measure
   the invert positions. However, limitations of commonly applied as-built
   tunnel survey methods are identified in terms of accuracy, cost, or
   modeling speed. In this paper, we propose a new approach to enabling
   as-built modeling and visualization of tunnels based on real-time TBM
   tracking and positioning data. With a tunnel alignment automation
   control system being implemented, the TBM is turned into a ``sensor{''}
   to map out as-build information in real time, without incurring extra
   labor cost or survey equipment. The proposed approach was field-tested
   and preliminary findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation games are effective tools for training and interactive
   learning but require significant development effort. A Construction
   project management game has been developed to provide an interactive
   simulation environment to assist in construction project management
   learning. The objective of this game is to help users understand the
   effects of their resource allocation decisions on project time and cost
   performance. A distributed approach using High Level Architecture (HLA)
   has been used in developing this game. The game federation consists of
   four federates (Progress simulator, Resources simulator, Controller, and
   User Interface). A Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) application
   ``Microsoft project 2007 (R){''} is used as the main user interface for
   this game. The use of a common COTS reduces the effort needed for
   building a dedicated graphical interface from scratch and provide a
   familiar interface for users. This paper describes the development
   process of this game, potential use, and future extensions.}},

Abstract = {{Haulage cost typically accounts for around 30\% of the total cost of
   mass earthmoving projects. The temporary road network is a major factor
   influencing haulage cost and production efficiency. The simulation of
   earthmoving operations considering temporary road networks, not only
   facilitates the site formation design but also leads to realistic,
   cost-effective construction plans. Utilizing the Floyd-Warshall
   algorithm and linear programming, this study formulates the temporary
   road network problem and sheds light on the potential benefits of
   selecting routes and directions for handling earthmoving jobs. An
   optimization approach for temporary road networks is further proposed.
   It reduces the total cost of the project and shortens its duration.
   Simulation models were used to prove the effectiveness and feasibility
   of optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial construction projects have recently moved more towards
   tighter schedules and fast-tracked engineering and construction. This
   leads to overlap between work packages, increased occurrences of
   resource over-allocation and site congestion, which pose challenges to
   project planners in scheduling construction works and dynamically
   allocating resources considering the construction site conditions. Most
   previous research related to scheduling and resource allocation assumes
   that allocated resources remain consistent throughout the execution of
   work packages. This paper presents a workface planning system that
   allows for variable resource allocation and variable durations in
   execution of a work package, while holding logic relationships and space
   congestion constraints. A case study from a real industrial project is
   presented and results show that the proposed system reduces resource
   idle time as well as returns shorter project duration than traditional
   scheduling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we undertook numerical simulations to predict the uplift
   ground surface induced by CO2 injection into sedimentary rocks
   formations. Ainoura and Berea sandstone cases were selected to represent
   low and moderate permeability cases, respectively. Numerical simulations
   were conducted by employing a geohydrological analysis of multiphase
   phase flow and thermal transport simulation of TOUGH2 (Pruess et al.
   1999), and a rock and soil mechanics with hydromechanical and
   thermomechanical interactions computation of FLAC3D (FLAC3D, 2005). A 3D
   model of formations with the size of 3200 m 3200 m and the depth of 1600
   m was generated. The input of hydrological data of the model, including
   density, permeability, porosity, relative permeability data and
   capillary pressure were obtained from laboratory core tests. The rock
   formation was assumed to be homogeneous without fractures. Pore
   pressure, overburden pressure, and temperature were generated across the
   model in order to mimic the reservoir conditions.
   A CO2 injection well located at the centre of model surface, deeply down
   to the depth of 800 meters. The injection with the rate of 0.35 kg/s was
   simulated over the injection period of 5, 10, and 25 years. The
   temporal-spatial stresses and strains in the model were examined. It was
   found that, over the same flow rate of injection, the uplift induced by
   CO2 injection to Ainoura sandstone is higher than that to Berea
   sandstone. The increased pressure induced by CO2 injection into Ainoura
   sandstone was more pronounced at the vicinity of the injection point
   whereas the increased pressure induced in Berea sandstone was found to
   be more spreading from the injection point, even though it is very low
   due to low flow rate of injection. The increase of pressure altered the
   stress and strain in the rock formations, creating uplift in the
   overlying layers and subsidence in the underlying layers of the
   injection point. The uplift in the Ainoura sandstone maximized in a
   certain distance above the injection point and declines as it moves the
   surface. On the other hand, the uplift in Berea sandstone increased from
   the injection point to the surface. The uplift in Ainoura sandstone was
   higher than the uplift in Berea sandstone.
   The results also indicated that, the injection rate and permeability
   play important role in the pressure and ground deformation generated by
   injection. Overall, Berea sandstone performed a better storage capacity,
   yet it has poor in confinement. On the other hand, Ainoura sandstone
   showed well confinement but relatively poor storing capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of bi-material interface bonding strengths has drawn
   considerable attentions because damages or failures are most likely to
   occur at the interfaces in many advanced materials and structures.
   However, the measurement of the interface bonding strength is hindered
   by the presence of the stress singularity at the interface corner. In
   order to determine the actual bonding strength of hi-material interface,
   the determination/elimination of the stress singularity is thus very
   crucial. This paper presents an analytical model for the determination
   of the stress singularity and its elimination for a
   viscoelastic/viscoelastic bonded joint. Two viscoelastic materials with
   different material properties are considered for this study. Each
   material is modelled as a standard linear solid and the properties of
   both materials are considered as time-dependent. The
   elastic-viscoelastic corresponding principle is used to find the
   analytical solution for the subjected viscoelastic/viscoelastic bonded
   joint from the available analytical solution for an elastic/elastic
   bonded joint. The developed solution is applied for a bonded joint
   between Polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) and Epoxy materials. It is found that
   the stress singularity at the interface corner may increase with time
   due to the viscoelasticity of the materials. Finite element analyses
   have also been carried out to verify the results obtained from the
   analytical solution and the two results are in good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic is one of the most common tools used to control the
   transport phenomena in micro/nanofluidic devices. To design a successful
   process, it is important to have a precise knowledge of parameters
   affecting electrokinetic transport. One of these parameters is the
   applied electric field. When the local values of the electric field
   deviate significantly from the nominal values, the assumption of a
   homogeneous field is an oversimplification resulting in failed or low
   efficiency processes. In this manuscript, the sources of inducing field
   gradients and their implications were investigated. Of particular
   interests are micro-fabricated arrays used extensively in microfluidic
   devices either as sieving matrices or mixing enhancers. A comprehensive
   parametric study was conducted to understand how the posts arrangements
   (hexagonal and square), distance and size, and surface charge change the
   field gradients. Our results provide criteria at which the assumption of
   uniform field is valid, which can have important implications in
   designing microfluiclic units where either a high field gradient is
   favored (mixing) or not (separation).}},

Abstract = {{When droplets collide in a shear flow, they may coalesce or remain
   separate after the collision. At low Reynolds numbers, droplets coalesce
   when the capillary number does not exceed a critical value. We present
   three-dimensional simulations of droplet coalescence in a simple shear
   flow. We use a free-energy lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and study the
   collision outcome as a function of the Reynolds and capillary numbers.
   We study the Reynolds number range from 0.2 to 1.4 and capillary numbers
   between 0.1 and 0.5. We determine the critical capillary number for the
   simulations (0.19) and find that it is does not depend on the Reynolds
   number. The simulations are compared with experiments on collisions
   between confined droplets in shear flow. The critical capillary number
   in the simulations is about a factor of 25 higher than the experimental
   value.}},

Abstract = {{A preliminary kinetic model was developed for polymer electrolyte
   membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) catalyst inks in order to understand their
   particle stability. The Derjaguin Landau Verwey Overbeck (DLVO) model
   containing van der Waals attractive and electrostatic repulsive
   interaction energy was applied to the aqueous ink dispersions, while a
   modified DLVO type interaction containing a Coulombic term instead of
   the electrostatic term was applied to the non-aqueous dispersions.
   Solvents were compared based on their particle size distribution and
   stability ratios. Results show that the carbon black particles are
   stable in a higher dielectric medium whereas they tend to aggregate in a
   lower dielectric medium. A low ionic concentration for the aqueous
   medium also helped to improve the ink stability by providing a better
   electrostatic particle repulsion. Experiments conducted with ethyl
   acetate, iso-propanol and deionized water agree with the model
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Planetary gears are widely used in aeronautic and industrial
   applications because of the properties of compactness and high
   torque-to-weight ratios. Due to high service load, harsh operating
   conditions or simply fatigue, faults may develop in gears. If the faults
   cannot be detected early, the health condition will continue to degrade,
   even the consequence of big economic loss or catastrophic accident. In
   this study, the vibration properties of a planetary gear set for
   different crack levels in the sun gear are investigated through dynamic
   simulation. A simplified crack growth model is proposed for the sun gear
   and the time-varying mesh stiffness of a planetary gear set with the
   crack on the sun gear is analytically derived using the potential energy
   method. Through analyzing the simulated vibration signals, a new method
   is proposed to estimate the crack growth without requiring the
   comparison with the vibration signals when the gear box is running in
   the perfect conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Bearing is the most frequently and easily failed component in any
   rotating machine. The extraction of the bearing feature signal is
   critical for signal analysis and fault diagnosis of bearings. In this
   paper, an adaptive signal processing method is proposed to extract a
   weak bearing signal from a raw vibration signal. To provide sufficient
   extremes for signal decomposition using the ensemble empirical mode
   decomposition (EEMD) method, a spectral-kurtosis-based band-pass filter
   is firstly used to process the raw signal, and the EEMD method with
   parameter optimization is then used to further extract the weak bearing
   signal. Experimental results of a faulty bearing demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Fault or health trend prediction using time series is an effective way
   to protect the safe operation of highly reliable systems. Least squares
   support vector regression (LS-SVR) has been widely applied in time
   series prediction. However there is one of the main drawbacks of LS-SVR,
   which is lack of sparseness. This drawback impacts on its application if
   the number of training samples is large. So a new pruning method based
   on linear correlation is proposed, which reduces the number of support
   vectors by judging the linearly correlation among the sample data after
   they are mapped into high dimension feature space. This method can
   efficiently control the loss of useful information of sample data,
   improve the generalization capability of prediction model and reduce the
   prediction time simultaneously. And it also avoids the difficulty of
   reasonable selection of parameters. Simulation experiment results show
   that the computing time and prediction accuracy are both satisfied with
   the approach, which proves the efficiency of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing problem in getting quality water for developing
   countries. Water system is contaminated and without proper treatment, it
   has been consumed as drinking water It is a big problem for health.
   Escherichia coli (E.coli) is the main cause for the contamination of
   water and illness in people. Early detection of E.coli presence in the
   drinking water followed by subsequent treatment for elimination of
   E.coli can solve this problem. The present work developed a new method
   for detecting E.coli in contaminated water using microspot with
   integrated wells (MSIW). The method involves the fabrication of MSIW,
   coating the MSIW with enzyme substrates such as 4-MUG substrate
   (4-Methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide, trihydrate) and Red-Gal
   substrate(6-Chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactoside) in proper medium and
   dispensing the contaminated water into MSIW GlucuronidaseA (gusA) gene
   in E.coli encodes the beta- D-Glucuronidase (GUS) to hydrolyze the
   substrate 4-MUG enzymatically which leads to the generation of the
   fluorigenic compound 4-MU. beta-galactosidase enzyme in E.coli produces
   red color when it reacts with Red-Gal substrate. Using portable optical
   readers, average color/fluorescence intensity emitting by MSIW is
   measured and quantified. Comparing obtained intensity values with
   calibrated intensity values, the level of contamination can be predicted
   for early warnings.}},

Abstract = {{The flow structure around a cylinder group in cross flow was
   investigated experimentally. The experiments were conducted in an open
   channel. The cylinder group was consisted of 19 identical cylinders
   arranged symmetrically in two concentric circles and one located in the
   centre. Wake flow structure behind the cylinder group was measured with
   an Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry. For comparison, the wake flow structure
   of a single cylinder with an equal diameter to the external diameter of
   the cylinder group was also measured. The results show that the flow
   pattern around the cylinder group has some significant differences
   compared to a single cylinder. There exists vortex shedding behind the
   cylinder group, and the vortex formation length of the cylinder group is
   longer than that of a single cylinder. The flow through the gap of the
   cylinder group plays an import role in the wake, which is the mainly
   factor causing the differences. The velocity profiles measured along the
   transverse reveal a larger defect for the case of cylinder group
   compared to that for a single cylinder. The power spectral density
   distributions show that the Strouhal number based on the external
   diameter of the cylinder group is smaller than the that of a single
   cylinder.}},

Abstract = {{This study present falling head tests on sediment erosion behavior
   through a circular orifice. The setup is a rectangular box of 50x50x60
   cm. Two classes of uniformly screened sand (d(p) = 0.13, 0.25 mm) were
   used as the sediment material. By changing water head (h(w) = 2, 4, 6
   cm) above the sand surface, the geometry of the erosion void were
   measured after the discharge finishes. Experimental findings include: 1)
   the erosion process can be generally divided into three stages: initial
   stage, steady stage, and seepage stage.; 2) water head has significant
   influences on the erosion void geometry including the volume and width,
   while particle size has more influences on the sand and water discharge
   rates; 3) during discharge, the sand and water discharge rates are
   linearly related before the test end.}},

Abstract = {{Flow field induced by hydropower intakes has significant influence on
   release water temperature and entrainment risk of fish in the reservoir
   forebay. The complex flow patterns upstream of intakes related to the
   operations of intakes and spillway tunnels were investigated in the
   present study to enhance the understanding of hydrodynamic
   characteristics and to outline potential risky zones for fish
   entrainment. Implications of the forebay hydraulics on fish entrainment
   risk assessment were discussed herein. The hydropower station studied in
   this study is located on lower reaches of a river in China. Up to nine
   powerhouse intakes have been proposed on both the left and the right
   banks, and three tunnel spillways on the left bank. A three-dimensional
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model (using ANSYS CFX) was used to
   study the hydraulic performances upstream of the intakes under a number
   of operating conditions. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations
   were solved in this numerical code and closed with k-epsilon equations.
   For the verification and validation of the CFD model, experimental
   measurements were conducted using a physical model with a scale 1:50.
   The numerical results were then used to assess the fish entrainment risk
   associated with different hydropower operation modes.}},

Abstract = {{The creation of large complex fracture networks by hydraulic fracturing
   is imperative for enhanced oil recovery from tight sand or shale
   reservoirs, tight gas extraction, and Hot-Dry-Rock (HDR) geothermal
   systems to improve the contact area to the rock matrix. Although
   conventional fracturing treatments may result in hi-wing fractures,
   there is evidence by microseismic mapping that fracture networks can
   develop in many unconventional reservoirs, especially when natural
   fracture systems are present and the differences between the principle
   stresses are low. However, not much insight is gained about fracture
   development as well as fluid and proppant transport in naturally
   fractured tight formations. In order to clarify the relationship between
   rock and treatment parameters, and resulting fracture properties,
   numerical simulations were performed using a commercial Discrete
   Fracture Network (DEN) simulator.
   A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is presented to identify typical
   fracture network patterns resulting from massive water fracturing
   treatments in different geological conditions. It is shown how the
   treatment parameters influence the fracture development and what type of
   fracture patterns may result from different treatment designs. The focus
   of this study is on complex fracture network development in different
   natural fracture systems. Additionally, the applicability of the DFN
   simulator for modeling shale gas stimulation and HDR stimulation is
   critically discussed.
   The approach stated above gives an insight into the relationships
   between rock properties (specifically matrix properties and
   characteristics of natural fracture systems) and the properties of
   developed fracture networks. Various simulated scenarios show typical
   conditions under which different complex fracture patterns can develop
   and prescribe efficient treatment designs to generate these fracture
   systems.
   Hydraulic stimulation is essential for the production of oil, gas, or
   heat from ultratight formations like shales and basement rocks (mainly
   granite). If natural fracture systems are present, the fracturing
   process becomes more complex to simulate. Our simulation results reveal
   valuable information about main parameters influencing fracture network
   properties, major factors leading to complex fracture network
   development, and differences between HDR and shale gas/oil shale
   stimulations.}},

Abstract = {{Crew scheduling problem is the problem of assigning crew members to the
   flights so that total cost is minimized while regulatory and legal
   restrictions are satisfied. The crew scheduling is an NP-hard
   constrained combinatorial optimization problem and hence, it cannot be
   exactly solved in a reasonable computational time. This paper presents a
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm synchronized with a local
   search heuristic for solving the crew scheduling problem. Recent studies
   use genetic algorithm (GA) or ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve
   large scale crew scheduling problems. Furthermore, two other hybrid
   algorithms based on GA and ACO algorithms have been developed to solve
   the problem. Computational results show the effectiveness and
   superiority of the proposed hybrid PSO algorithm over other algorithms.

Abstract = {{Porous metal fiber sintered sheets (MFSSs) are a type of low density
   cellular materials promising for functional and structural applications.
   A micromechanics random beam model is proposed to investigate the
   elasto-plastic behavior of MFSSs. The relative density dependence of the
   elastic constants and yield strength of MFSSs is predicted and found to
   agree well with available experimental results. Fiber stretching is
   identified as the dominant deformation mechanism under uniaxial and
   multiaxial loading. When compared with two-dimensional Voronoi foams and
   honeycombs, the stretching deformation dominated MFSSs exhibit higher
   stiffness and tensile strength, but lower compressive strength due to
   long fiber buckling. With the developed micromechanics model, the
   multiaxial elasto-plastic responses of MFSSs are simulated. A
   macroscopic phenomenological constitutive model with a segmented yield
   function is proposed to describe the predicted multiaxial responses. The
   yield function and its evolution can be fully calibrated in terms of the
   uniaxial tension and compression responses rather than complex
   multiaxial loading responses, which can greatly facilitate practical
   applications of the model. This constitutive model is also expected to
   be applicable to other fiber sintered materials with hydrostatic
   pressure sensitive and asymmetric tension-compression yielding
   behaviors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Interior point optimization and model predictive control along with
   moving horizon estimator are used to maximize and regulate lipid
   production in a fed-batch heterotrophic microalgae cultivation of
   Auxenochlorella protothecoides. Motivation for microalgae bioreactor
   optimal control arises from the need to increase lipid production rate,
   which results in economic feasibility of microalgae bio-fuel production
   process. A complex time-varying microalgae fed-batch growth and lipid
   production model (De la Hoz Siegler et al., 2011) is used and a
   large-scale nonlinear programming optimization along with moving horizon
   estimator and model predictive control are applied to maximize the lipid
   concentration in the bioreactor. An optimal feeding strategy for lipid
   production is determined using the state-of-the-art interior point
   optimizer (IPOPT) solver. Moving horizon estimator (MHE) and model
   predictive controller (MPC) are used to estimate unmeasurable state
   (nitrogen concentration) and provide regulation of a highly nonlinear
   and time-varying microalgae growth process as a realizable real-time
   control strategy. In addition to the constrained large-scale
   optimization, naturally present input constraints (lower and upper bound
   on feed rates) and state constraints (lower bound on all concentration
   related states and upper bound on glucose concentration) are accounted
   for in an explicit manner with moving horizon estimator and model
   predictive controller. The estimator and controller design is based on a
   set of linearized models in microalgae growth fed-batch process. The
   paper provides a reliable and computationally efficient optimization,
   estimation and regulation procedure suitable for the real-time
   microalgae bioreactor operation. The procedure takes into account
   present constraints on inputs and states, and measurement noises present
   in the realistic operation conditions and is computationally efficient,
   along with the improvement in results with respect to previous methods.

   migrated to the surfaces. However, such behavior was not observed in the
   cases in which water thin films contained multiple molecular layers of
   water. Interestingly, the corresponding calculated multimolecular layer
   works of adhesion of water were the highest among the compounds of
   interest. Analysis of the simulation data on both basal surfaces
   suggests that such observation is attributed to the water/water
   long-range charge-charge (69\%, averaged over the two basal surfaces)
   and short-range hydrogen-bond (31\%) interactions. Here, interfacial
   hydrogen bonds play a relatively minor role in the wetting behavior of
   water.}},

Abstract = {{Metal oxides such as niobium oxides have been demonstrated as
   alternative support materials for Pt and non-precious metal catalysts in
   fuel cells. High surface area and columnar niobium oxide catalyst
   support structures were produced by the glancing angle deposition (GLAD)
   technique on 5 mm diameter glassy carbon disks. The columnar structures
   have lengths of about 500 nm, diameters of 50 nm and an areal density of
   about 10(9) cm(-2). Annealing under different gas mixtures (Ar/H-2) led
   to the formation of various oxides (Nb2O5, NbO2, or NbO + NbO2). Pt
   catalyst, with a loading of 0.1 mg(pt) cm(-2), was deposited onto these
   structures by magnetron sputter deposition. Rotating disk electrode
   characterization of the samples, performed in 0.1M HClO4 electrolyte at
   room temperature, revealed surface enhancement factors of up to 11 and
   oxygen reduction specific activities of >= 1 mA cm(pt)(-2) at 0.9 V (vs.
   RHE). The impact of annealing on Nb-O phase formation, conductivity,
   oxygen reduction activity and stability are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nb-doped TiO2 (TNO) has been widely explored as an alternative

   0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.24) compositions were synthesized, pressed into
   pellets, and deposited as thin films via electron beam evaporation. The
   thin films were characterized for composition by energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and for crystallinity
   by X-ray diffraction for the different Nb contents explored.
   Transparency, conductivity, and Haacke transparent conductor figure of
   merit values are reported for the evaporated TNO films as a function of
   Nb content, substrate heating temperature, and post deposition annealing
   conditions. Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) is used to demonstrate
   nanostructuring of evaporated TNO based on physical shadowing.
   Nanostructured GLAD TNO films of increased morphological complexity can

Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{335}},

Abstract = {{The Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) is widely used for modeling
   phase behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures. When applied to heavy
   hydrocarbons and their mixtures, however, the PR EOS can exhibit
   erroneous phase behavior predictions. In this research, we develop new
   correlations for critical temperatures (T-C), critical pressures (P-C),
   and acentric factors (omega) that enable the PR EOS to accurately
   predict phase behavior of n-alkanes up to C-100.
   Predictions using the PR EOS with the new correlations give 3.0\%
   average absolute deviation (AAD) for 3583 density data, and 3.4\% MD for
   1525 vapor pressure data for n-alkanes from C-7 to C-100. Significant
   improvement is also observed for bubble point pressure and density
   predictions for n-alkane mixtures. The new correlations developed for
   T-C, P-C, and omega are then applied for characterizing 25 different
   reservoir oils. Results show that, compared to the conventional critical
   parameter correlations in the literature, our correlations give more
   accurate phase behavior predictions while requiring less adjustment of
   the parameters. The optimum T-C and Pc developed for n-alkanes can serve
   as useful lower limits for T-C and P-C of pseudo components of reservoir
   oils that are characterized using the PR EOS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{6, 2}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze the inviscid regime (for which viscosity is
   unimportant and the flow occurs due to the balance between the capillary
   and the inertial effects) that invariably precedes the classical
   century-oldWashburn regime during capillary filling. We demonstrate that
   a new nondimensional number, namely, the product of the Ohnesorge number
   and the ratio between the filling length (l) and the radius of the
   capillary (R), dictates the occurrence of this regime and the other
   well-known regimes in a capillary filling problem. We also identify that
   this inviscid regime occurs for the time that is of the order of the
   capillary time scale and, as has been quantified before {[}Quere, Eur.
   Phys. Lett. 39, 533 (1997); Joly, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 214705 (2011)], is
   characterized by the filling length being linearly proportional to the
   filling time. We establish the universality of this regime by
   pinpointing the existence of this regime (showing appropriate
   dependencies of the capillary radii and density) from existing
   experimental and Molecular Dynamics Simulation results that signify
   disparate ranges of length and time scales.

   Robust System-Oriented Control Approach}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1800-1811}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust system-oriented control design approach for
   distributed generation (DG) converters in microgrids. The conceptual
   design of the proposed interface is to provide control system robustness
   against system-level interactions without strict knowledge of complete
   microgrid system dynamics. To increase the robustness against
   converter-microgrid interactions, the microgrid system is modeled by a
   dynamic equivalent circuit, which might include uncertainties induced
   due to microgrid impedance variation and interactions with the
   equivalent microgrid bus-voltage. The equivalent microgrid model along
   with local load interactions and uncertainties are augmented with the DG
   interface power circuit model to develop a robust voltage controller. To
   account for power angle interaction dynamics, an angle feed-forward
   control approach is adopted, where the angle of the equivalent microgrid
   bus, as seen by each DG unit, is estimated and used for feed-forward
   control. Unlike conventional droop controllers, the proposed scheme
   yields two-degree-of-freedom controller, resulting in stable and smooth
   power sharing performance over a wide range for the static droop gain
   and also at different loading conditions. A theoretical analysis and
   comparative simulation and experimental results are presented to
   demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control
   scheme.}},

   constraints-A case study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{41-49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Two important goals of reservoir management are responsible stewardship
   of the resource and finding a high net present value during the forecast
   period of reservoir assessment. The first step of reservoir management
   is characterization of the reservoir through history matching. Even with
   a history matched model, a robust production optimization algorithm is
   required to find an optimal value of net present value (NPV).
   Field-scale optimization problems consist of a highly complex reservoir
   model with many unknown control variables. Finding a high value for NPV
   in a reasonable time depends on the efficiency of the optimization
   algorithm. There are many optimization algorithms and in this paper
   three efficient algorithms for optimization are investigated. These are
   steepest ascent (SA), sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the
   interior point (IP) methods. We found that although each iteration of
   the steepest ascent approach is relatively inexpensive, the method was
   unable to achieve a high value of the NPV because of the neglect of
   constraints in the gradient. In contrast, the sequential quadratic
   programming (SQP) often found a high NPV, but the computation cost of
   each iteration was substantial due to the need to identify active
   constraints.
   The interior point method is introduced for development planning in this
   paper. Although the final NPV achieved with the interior point method
   may not be as high as the NPV achieved with SQP, it is greater than the
   NPV obtained from the steepest ascent method with similar computation
   cost. Application of these methods to the Brugge field with 4560 total
   fluid rate constraints demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of
   these algorithms. In all of these methods, gradient of controls has been
   computed using ensemble based method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of delay-distribution-dependent stability is
   investigated for continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CRNNs) with
   stochastic delay. Different from the common assumptions on time delays,
   it is assumed that the probability distribution of the delay taking
   values in some intervals is known a priori. By making full use of the
   information concerning the probability distribution of the delay and by
   using a tighter bounding technique (the reciprocally convex combination
   method), less conservative asymptotic mean-square stable sufficient
   conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
   Two numerical examples show that our results are better than the

Abstract = {{With the dramatic development of image processing technology, a growing
   number of traffic flow detection and analyses have been conducted by
   using video data. Time to collision (TTC) and postencroachment time
   (PET) are two major parameters used to indicate the severity of a
   potential collision and to capture an imminent vehicular accident.
   However, microlevel pedestrian-involved collisions are less studied
   because they are hard to observe or record. This paper tries to extract
   the traffic object locations from video data, to define the time
   difference to collision (TDTC) parameter as a variation from TTC and PET
   to fit the pedestrian-involved potential collisions/conflicts, analyze
   the interaction behavior between pedestrian and vehicles, and validate
   the TDTC parameter in indicating pedestrian safety performance by using
   100 groups of interaction data. The results show that the interaction
   cases with larger TDTC values are safer, whereas the cases with
   continuously closer to zero TDTC values are more dangerous. About 80\%
   of the cases classified by the TDTC parameter have the same result with
   the independent observation; if TDTC is combined with vehicle speed, the
   classification result can be improved. More mixed traffic scenes will be
   conducted based on this research in the future.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Temperature-responsive glycopolymer brushes were designed to investigate
   the effects of grafting architectures of the copolymers on the selective
   adhesion and collection of hypatocytes. Homo, random and block sequences
   of N-isopropylacrylamide and 2-lactobionamidoethyl methacrylate were
   grafted on glass substrates via surface-initiated atom transfer radical
   polymerization. The galactose/lactose-specific lectin RCA(120) and HepG2
   cells were used to test for specific recognition of the polymer brushes
   containing galactose residues over the lower critical solution
   temperatures (LCSTs). RCA(120) showed a specific binding to the brush
   surfaces at 37 degrees C. These brush surfaces also facilitated the
   adhesion of HepG2 cells at 37 degrees C under nonserum conditions,
   whereas no adhesion was observed for NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. When the
   temperature was decreased to 25 degrees C, almost all the HepG2 cells
   detached from the block copolymer brush, whereas the random copolymer
   brush did not release the cells. The difference in releasing kinetics of
   cells from the surfaces with different grafting architectures can be
   explained by the correlated effects of significant changes in LCST,
   mobility, hydrophilicity and mechanical properties of the grafted
   polymer chains. These findings are important for designing `on-off' cell
   capture/release substrates for various biomedical applications such as
   selective cell separation.}},

Abstract = {{Surface flow and water transport models of a northern small scale region
   on Mars have been developed with two main objectives, (1) to locally
   resolve water vapor transport in a shallow regolith, and (2) to
   introduce a method for calculating water vapor flux to the atmosphere by
   means of a non-dimensional interfacial Sherwood number. This number can
   be used to provide improved boundary conditions for atmospheric general
   circulation models. The near surface atmospheric flow and water
   transport models were three dimensional, capable of resolving complex
   terrain geometries, and included a layer of porous regolith. The models
   were used to simulate two different local atmospheric flows, the near
   surface thermal convection caused by early morning solar heating, and
   horizontal dry winds. Using these models, analyses were performed to
   study the effects of several parameters on the water transport process.
   For the simulations in this study, the NASA Phoenix Mars Lander landing
   site was selected. Variable parameters were regolith thickness, ambient
   pressure and temperature, imposed wind velocity and surface temperature.
   Results of the numerical simulations were summarized by means of the
   interfacial Sherwood number that can be used to readily calculate water
   flux from the regolith to the atmosphere. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{A deformation-mechanism-based energy partitioning approach for
   measurement of plane-stress fracture toughness of low-density
   polyethylene}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{179-191}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A previously proposed energy partitioning approach, based on deformation
   mechanisms involved in the fracture process, is applied to
   double-edge-notched tensile (DENT) test to determine plane-stress
   fracture toughness for a commercial low-density polyethylene (LOPE).
   Test results show that mechanical behaviour of LOPE is affected by
   unloading-reloading cycles introduced in the DENT test. Therefore,
   modification is made for determining the residual elastic energy. The
   modified energy partitioning approach yields much lower specific energy
   consumption for fracture than that from the essential work of fracture
   (EWF) method. Support to this approach comes from the close agreement
   between the specific energy consumption for necking in the DENT test and
   the specific deformation energy in the simple tensile test at the same
   strain level. The paper also analyzes the energy consumption for each
   mechanism involved in the fracture process and its dependence on the
   specimen ligament length. The analysis suggests that the non-essential
   part of energy consumption for crack growth is not purely a function of
   the square of ligament length. Therefore, the EWF method should not be
   used to determine fracture toughness for polymers when necking is
   involved during the crack growth. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the context of process industries, online monitoring of quality
   variables is often restricted by inadequacy of measurement techniques or
   low reliability of measuring devices. Therefore, there has been a
   growing interest in the development of inferential sensors to provide
   frequent online estimates of key process variables on the basis of their
   correlation with real-time process measurements. Representation of
   multi-modal processes is one of the challenging issues that may arise in
   the design of inferential sensors. In this paper, Bayesian procedures
   for the development and implementation of adaptive multi-model
   inferential sensors are presented. It is shown that the application of a
   Bayesian scheme allows for accommodating the overlapping operating modes
   and facilitating the inclusion of prior knowledge. The effectiveness of
   the proposed procedures are first demonstrated through a simulation case
   study. The efficacy of the method is further highlighted by a successful
   industrial application of an adaptive multi-model inferential sensor
   designed for real-time monitoring of a key quality variable in an oil

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To develop a computer-aided robust nuclei segmentation
   technique for quantitative histopathological image analysis.
   STUDY DESIGN: A robust nuclei segmentation technique for
   histopathological image analysis is proposed. The proposed technique
   uses a hybrid morphological reconstruction module to reduce the
   intensity variation within the nuclei regions and suppress the noise in
   the image. A local region adaptive threshold selection module based on
   local optimal threshold is used to segment the nuclei. The technique
   incorporates domain-specific knowledge of skin histopathological images
   for more accurate segmentation results.
   RESULTS: The technique is compared to the manually labeled nuclei
   locations and nuclei boundaries for the performance evaluations. On
   different histopathological images of skin epidermis with complex
   background, containing more than 3000 nuclei, the technique provides a
   good nuclei detection performance: 88.11\% sensitivity rate, 80.02\%
   positive prediction rate and only 5.34\% under-segmentation rate
   compared to the manually labeled nuclei locations. Compared to the 110
   manually segmented nuclei regions, the proposed technique provides a
   good segmentation performance (in terms of the nucleus area, perimeter,
   and form factor).
   CONCLUSION: The proposed technique is able to provide more accurate
   segmentation performance compared to the existing techniques and can be
   employed for quantitative analysis of the histopathological images.

Abstract = {{The mineral stability of two bentonites was studied in the presence of
   pyrite concentrate to simulate the possible reactions between the
   bentonite barrier used in a high-level nuclear waste (El LW) repository
   and host rock containing up to 5 wt.\% of admixed pyrite. Smectite was
   the only bentonite mineral affected by pyrite treatment under the
   experimental conditions used. Bentonites reacted differently with pyrite
   due to the different nature of the smectites. The distinct crystal
   chemistry of the smectites controlled by the composition of the parent
   rocks influenced the smectite surface properties (cation exchange
   capacity and layer charge distribution) which resulted in a different
   response of the bentonites to pyrite treatment. A partial transformation
   of the original smectites into H-smectites represented the initial stage
   of smectite destabilization on acid attack. Rising non-equivalent
   isomorphous substitution in the octahedral sheets of the smectites
   enhanced smectite reactivity and thus the reaction between bentonite and
   pyrite, causing lower stability of the bentonite containing high-charge
   smectite.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of reliable communication over non-binary
   insertion/deletion channels where symbols are randomly deleted from or
   inserted in the received sequence and all symbols are corrupted by
   additive white Gaussian noise. To this end, we utilize the inherent
   redundancy achievable in non-binary symbol sets by first expanding the
   symbol set and then allocating part of the bits associated with each
   symbol to watermark symbols. The watermark sequence, known at the
   receiver, is then used by a forward-backward algorithm to provide soft
   information for an outer code which decodes the transmitted sequence.
   Through numerical results and discussions, we evaluate the performance
   of the proposed solution and show that it leads to significant system
   ability to detect and correct insertions/deletions. We also provide
   estimates of the maximum achievable information rates of the system,
   compare them with the available bounds, and construct practical codes
   capable of approaching these limits.}},

Abstract = {{Modern wireless technology applies several powerful but complex
   techniques - such as multiple-antenna systems, orthogonal

   however, the growing complexity of modern wireless systems and the
   tendency of wireless standards to evolve even after product development
   has started have greatly increased the required simulation times to the
   extent that software-based simulation is now the major bottleneck in

   show the resultant economic (cash and productivity) losses and adverse

   Reynolds numbers}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{An alternative numerical method for suspension flows with application to
   sedimenting suspensions at finite-particle Reynolds numbers Re-p is
   presented. The method consists of an extended lattice-Boltzmann scheme
   for discretizing the locally averaged conservation equations and a
   Lagrangian particle tracking model for tracking the trajectories of
   individual particles. The method is able to capture the main features of
   the sedimenting suspensions with reasonable computational expenses.
   Experimental observations from the literature have been correctly
   reproduced. It is numerically demonstrated that, at finite Re-p, there
   exists a range of domain sizes in which particle velocity fluctuation
   amplitudes <Delta V-parallel to,V-perpendicular to > have a strong
   domain size dependence, and above which the fluctuation amplitudes
   become weakly dependent. The size range strongly relates with Re-p and
   the particle volume fraction phi(p). Furthermore, a transition in the
   fluctuation amplitudes is found at Re-p around 0.08. The magnitude and
   length scale dependence of the fluctuation amplitudes at finite Re-p are
   well represented by introducing new fluctuation amplitude scaling
   functions C-1,C- (parallel to,C-perpendicular to)(Re-p, phi(p)) and
   characteristic length scaling function C-2(Re-p, phi(p)) in the

Title = {{Toxicity of untreated and ozone-treated oil sands process-affected water

Abstract = {{Due to a policy of no release, oil sands process-affected water (OSPW),
   produced by the surface-mining oil sands industry in North Eastern
   Alberta, Canada, is stored on-site in tailings ponds. Currently,
   ozonation is considered one possible method for remediation of OSPW by
   reducing the concentrations of dissolved organic compounds, including
   naphthenic acids (NAs), which are considered the primary toxic
   constituents. However, further work was needed to evaluate the
   effectiveness of zonation in reducing the toxicity of OSPW and to ensure
   that ozonation does not increase the toxicity of OSPW. This study
   examined effects of untreated, ozone-treated, and activated
   charcoal-treated OSPW (OSPW, O3-OSPW, and AC-OSPW) on the early life
   stage (ELS) of fathead minnow (Pime-phales promelas). Success of
   hatching of eggs, spontaneous movement, and incidences of hemorrhage,
   pericardial edema, and malformation of the spine of embryos were
   examined. To elucidate the mechanism of toxicity, concentrations of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured, and the abundances of
   transcripts of genes involved in biotransformation of xenobiotics,
   response to oxidative stress, and apoptosis were quantified by real-time
   PCR. Compared to the control group, which had an embryo survival rate of
   97.9 +/- 2.08\%, survival was significantly less when exposed to OSPW
   (43.8 +/- 7.12\%). Eggs exposed to untreated OSPW exhibited a
   significantly greater rate of premature hatching, and embryos exhibited
   greater spontaneous movement. Incidences of hemorrhage (50.0 +/-
   3.40\%), pericardial edema (56.3 +/- 7.12\%), and malformation of the
   spine (37.5 +/- 5.38\%) were significantly greater in embryos exposed to
   OSPW compared to controls. These effects are typical of exposure to
   dioxin-like compounds, however, abundance of transcripts of cyp1a was
   not significantly greater in embryos exposed to OSPW. Significantly
   greater concentrations of ROS, and greater abundances of transcripts
   cyp3a, gst, sod, casp9, and apopen compared to controls, indicated that
   exposure to OSPW caused oxidative stress, which can result in damage to
   mitochondria and promote activation of caspase enzymes and apoptotic
   cell death. Removal of dissolved organic constituents by ozone
   treatment, or by activated charcoal, significantly attenuated all of the
   adverse effects associated with untreated OSPW. The results suggest that
   the organic fraction of OSPW can negatively impact the development of
   fathead minnow embryos through oxidative stress and apoptosis, and that
   zonation attenuates this developmental toxicity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic tomography is a promising imaging modality offering high
   ultrasonic resolution with intrinsic optical contrast. However,
   quantification in photoacoustic imaging is challenging. We present an
   algorithm for quantitative photoacoustic estimation of optical
   absorption and diffusion coefficients based on minimizing an error
   function between measured photoacoustic channel data and a calculated
   forward model with a multiple-illumination pattern. Unlike many other
   algorithms, the proposed method does not require the erroneous
   assumption of ideal tomographic reconstruction of initial pressures and
   to our knowledge is the first demonstration of the efficacy of
   multiple-illumination photoacoustic tomography requiring only transducer
   channel data. Simulations show promise for numerically robust optical
   property estimation as illustrated by well-conditioned Hessian singular
   values in 2D examples. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the relationship between childhood febrile seizures (CFSs)

   structural abnormalities previously demonstrated in TLE were present in
   adults with isolated CFS. Twenty-three adults with past CFS but no
   history of non-febrile seizures and 21 controls underwent research MRI
   for measurement of volume, T2 and mean diffusivity of the hippocampus
   and fractional anisotropy of the fornix and cingulum. No significant
   group differences were found in any of the measured parameters. These
   findings suggest that structural abnormalities of the hippocampus and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Topographic attributes have been identified as the most important factor
   in controlling the initiation and distribution of shallow landslides
   triggered by rainfall. As a result, these landslides influence the
   evolution of local surface topography. In this research, an area of 2.6
   km(2) loess catchment in the Huachi County was selected as the study
   area locating in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The landslides inventory and
   landslide types were mapped using global position system (GPS) and field
   mapping. The landslide inventory shows that these shallow landslides
   involve different movement types including slide, creep and fall.
   Meanwhile, main topographic attributes were generated based on a high
   resolution digital terrain model (5 m x 5 m), including aspect, slope
   shape, elevation, slope angle and contributing area. These maps were
   overlaid with the spatial distributions of total landslides and each
   type of landslides in a geographic information system (GIS),
   respectively, to assess their spatial frequency distributions and
   relative failure potentials related to these selected topographic
   attributes. The spatial analysis results revealed that there is a close
   relation between the topographic attributes of the post-landsliding
   local surface and the types of landslide movement. Meanwhile, the types
   of landslide movement have some obvious differences in local topographic
   attributes, which can influence the relative failure potential of
   different types of landslides. These results have practical significance
   to mitigate natural hazard and understand geomorphologic process in
   thick loess area.}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present a study of the thermal and mechanical properties of the
   negative photoresist KMPR and the influence of processing conditions on
   those properties. The process parameters chosen all relate to the
   cross-linking level of the photoresist: the UV exposure dose, the baking
   temperature and the bake length. The stability of KMPR at high
   temperatures was also examined. The glass transition temperature was
   measured using dynamic mechanical analysis, with a maximum measured
   value of 128 degrees C achieved in our tests. Relating the glass
   transition temperature to the cross-linking level of the material,
   exposure doses higher than 2 J cm(-2) were shown to have a negligible
   effect on the cross-linking (for 80 mu m thick films). Using
   thermogravitmetric analysis, KMPR has been shown to lose significant
   mass when heated above 200 degrees C. Young's modulus of KMPR was
   measured to be between 2.0 GPa for samples hard-baked at 100 degrees C
   and 2.7 GPa for samples baked at 150 and 200 degrees C. Creep behavior
   for KMPR held under strain was studied for samples prepared under a
   range of processing temperatures. Finally the thermally-induced
   cross-linking of unexposed KMPR was studied, with samples post-exposure
   baked at 150 degrees C, or 120 degrees C for at least an hour,
   cross-linking sufficiently to prevent development.}},

Abstract = {{A xanthation-modified polyacrylamide (PAM), named PAM-X, was
   synthesized. In single mineral flotation tests. PAM-X exhibited unique
   selectivity between galena and Cu-activated sphalerite. The adsorption
   mechanisms were investigated via attenuated total reflectance Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). It was observed that PAM-X
   had different absorption band shifts when adsorbed onto galena and
   Cu-activated sphalerite, indicating the formation of different
   adsorption bonds between PAM-X and the minerals. The analysis by
   ATR-FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that PAM-X
   was a mixture composed of partially hydrolyzed PAM and a low molecular
   weight sulfur-bearing compound. The observed selectivity of PAM-X to
   galena and Cu-activated sphalerite was attributed to the adsorption of
   the PAM-X and the synergistic effect of its two components. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Hydraulic geometry and resistance to flow of headwater streams in the
   Northwest Territories of Canada are presented in this paper. Power
   functions describe at-a-station hydraulic geometry relationships very
   well, where positive exponents of width, depth, and velocity have mean
   values of 0.14, 0.17, and 0.65, respectively. These values were found to
   be lower, much lower, and higher than corresponding mean values of
   width, depth, and velocity exponents found in the literature. The mean
   velocity exponent is greater than mean width and depth exponents
   combined, demonstrating the dominant role of velocity in accommodating
   varying discharge in all streams evaluated in this study. Darcy-Weisbach
   resistance factor (f) and Manning's n individually vary over three
   orders of magnitude, 1.0-267 and 0.085-1.37, respectively. Despite large
   ranges, hydraulic relations are described effectively through power

   8 mol.\% Y2O3) added was evaluated in static and flowing supercritical
   water (SON) environments. It was found that the corrosion behavior of
   Cr2O3-based ceramics was affected by their morphologies as well as SCW
   test variables. The results of loop tests showed that Cr2O3-based
   ceramics were stable at 650 degrees C in flowing SCW with low to
   moderate oxygen concentration (8 ppb to 8 ppm). However, these ceramics
   suffered obvious degradation when exposed to SON with higher oxygen
   concentrations (4 vol.\% hydrogen peroxide). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this note, the problem of rate control in multiuser multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) interference systems is formulated as a
   multicriteria optimization (MCO) problem. The Pareto rate region of the
   MCO problem is first characterized by giving a sufficient condition for
   the convexity of the Pareto rate region. Second, various rate region
   convexification approaches including a multistage interference
   cancellation and a full projection (FP)-based interference avoidance
   scheme are analyzed. An achievable rate region based on FP is also given
   for MIMO interference systems. Third, Nash bargaining (NB) is applied to
   transform the MCO problem into a single-objective problem. The
   characteristics of the NB over MIMO interference systems such as the
   uniqueness and optimality of different type NB solutions are
   investigated. A method to determine the optimality of FP-and
   time-division multiplexing-based NB solutions is presented as well.
   Finally, the convexity of the rate region and the existence of the
   FP-based NB solution for MIMO interference systems are examined
   numerically.}},

Abstract = {{Highly parallel VLSI implementations of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
   decoders have a large number of interconnections, which can result in
   designs with low logic density. Bit-serial architectures have been
   developed that reduce the number of wires needed, however, they do not
   fully realize the potential for deeply pipelined serial data processing.
   Digit-online arithmetic allows operations to be performed in a serial,
   digit-by-digit manner, making it ideal for use in implementing a
   digit-serial LDPC decoder. Digit-online circuits for the primitive
   operations required for an offset min-sum LDPC decoder are simple, and
   allow deep pipelining at the digit level. A new hardware architecture
   for LDPC decoding is demonstrated, using redundant number systems for
   the internal representation of values.
   We present post-layout decoder results for the (2048, 1723) 10GBASE-T
   LDPC code in a general-purpose 65 nm CMOS technology. The decoder
   requires a core area of 10.89 mm(2) and operates at a clock frequency of
   980 MHz. The decoder can simultaneously decode two 4-bit frames at 41.8

Abstract = {{This paper deals with optimal joint user power control and relay
   distributed beamforming for two-way relay networks, where two end-users
   exchange information through multiple relays, each of which is assumed
   to have its own power constraint. The problem includes the design of the
   distributed beamformer at the relays and the power control scheme for
   the two end-users to optimize the network performance. Considering the
   overall two-way network performance, we maximize the lower
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the two communication links. For
   single-relay networks, this maximization problem is solved analytically.
   For multi-relay networks, we propose an iterative numerical algorithm to
   find the optimal solution. While the complexity of the optimal algorithm
   is too high for large networks, two sub-optimal algorithms with low
   complexity are also proposed, which are numerically shown to perform
   close to the optimal technique. It is also shown via simulation that for
   two-way networks with both single relay and multiple relays, proper user
   power control and relay distributed beamforming can significantly
   improve the network performance, especially when the power constraints
   of the two end-users in the networks are unbalanced. Our approach also
   improves the power efficiency of the network largely.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast
   relay channel (BRC), in which a multiple-antenna base station (BS)
   communicates withmultiple-antenna users through an infrastructure-based
   multiple-antenna relay station (RS). Applying dirty paper coding (DPC)
   at the BS and linear processing at the RS, our aim is to find the input
   covariance matrices and the RS beamforming matrix that maximize the
   system sum-rate. To solve this non-convex problem, a more tractable dual
   multiple access relay channel (MARC) is investigated and an
   alternating-minimization algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, the mapping
   from the resulting covariance matrices for the MARC to the covariance
   matrices for the BRC is derived. Unlike other existing
   single-antenna-user schemes, our solution is applicable to a more
   general network with any number of antennas at the users. Compared with
   two such single-antenna-user schemes, simulations show that the proposed
   scheme outperforms the all-pass relay design and performs similarly to
   the SVD-relay design. Moreover, the proposed design performs close to
   the sum-rate upper bound with the performance gap decreasing with
   increasing number of antennas per user. It is also observed that having
   more antennas at the RS than at the BS is desirable for better system
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The simple Au-Si eutectic, which melts at 363 degrees C, can be used to
   bond Si wafers. However, faceted craters can form at the Au/Si interface
   as a result of anisotropic and non-uniform reaction between Au and
   crystalline silicon (c-Si). These craters may adversely affect active
   devices on the wafers. Two possible solutions to this problem were
   investigated in this study. One solution was to use an amorphous silicon
   layer (a-Si) that was deposited on the c-Si substrate to bond with the
   Au. The other solution was to use solid-state bonding instead of
   eutectic bonding, and the wafers were bonded at a temperature (350
   degrees C) below the Au-Si eutectic temperature. The results showed that
   the a-Si layer prevented the formation of craters and solid-state
   bonding not only required a lower bonding temperature than eutectic
   bonding, but also prevented spill out of the solder resulting in strong
   bonds with high shear strength in comparison with eutectic bonding.
   Using amorphous silicon, the maximum shear strength for the solid-state
   Au-Si bond reached 15.2 MPa. whereas for the eutectic Au-Si bond it was
   13.2 MPa. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To enhance image contrast in susceptibility phase imaging using
   a new method of background phase removal. Materials and Methods: A
   background phase removal method is proposed that uses the spatial
   gradient of the raw phase image to perform a moving window third-order
   local polynomial estimation and correction of the raw phase image
   followed by minimal high pass filtering. The method is demonstrated in
   simulation, 10 healthy volunteers, and 5 multiple sclerosis patients in
   comparison to a standard phase filtering approach. Results: Compared to
   standard phase filtering, the new method increased phase contrast with
   local background tissue in subcortical gray matter, cortical gray
   matter, and multiple sclerosis lesions by 67\% +/- 33\%, 13\% +/- 7\%,
   and 48\% +/- 19\%, respectively (95\% confidence interval). In addition,
   the new method removed more phase wraps in areas of rapidly changing
   background phase. Conclusion: Local phase gradient fitting combined with
   minimal high pass filtering provides better tissue depiction and more
   accurate phase quantification than standard filtering. J. Magn. Reson.

   of the HFC-PGA is to achieve not only the best neural network, but also
   a diversity of potential neural networks. A set of component neural
   networks is selected to build an ensemble such that the generalization
   error is minimized and the negative correlation is maximized. Finally,
   some experiments are carried out using several data sets to illustrate
   and quantify the performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable cation composition are
   important properties in defining water-sediment interactions in
   contaminant transport scenarios, such as the seepage of process-affected
   water from oil sands tailings impoundments. At present, detailed
   characterization of these properties has been overlooked in the
   surficial Pleistocene sediments of the Athabasca Oil Sands region in
   Canada. Although a great variety of methods for determining CEC exist
   and continue to be developed, there is a deficiency in detailed
   comparisons amongst these methods in the literature, and consequently
   uncertainty still remains as to which extractants/methods are most
   suitable for use with sediments containing partially soluble carbonate
   salts. The present study (1) conducts an up-to-date evaluation of
   several distinct methods for their suitability in characterizing cation
   exchange properties in mildly calcareous sediments; using them to (2)
   evaluate the sorptive capacity and easily displaceable cations of mildly
   calcareous, surficial sediments near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Four
   conceptually different CEC methods were chosen: (a) a summation method
   (Lithium Chloride extractant); (b) a method that displaces an index
   cation after intermediary washes (Sodium Acetate-Ammonium Acetate); (c)
   a method using a high affinity cation complex (Silver Thiourea); and (d)
   a titration method using an organic cationic dye (Methylene Blue).
   Exchangeable cations were characterized using the Lithium Chloride and
   Silver Thiourea methods. Analysis suggests that the Methylene Blue test
   is least impacted by the presence of carbonate mineral phases. Results
   from field sediments suggest that the exchangeable cations, in
   decreasing abundance, consist of Ca > Mg > K > NH4 > Na; while the CEC
   was found to be 4.7 +/- 2.7 meq 100 g(-1) in the clay-rich glacial till,
   0.7 +/- 0.0 meq 100 g(-1) in the underlying sand and 4.1 +/- 2.3 meq 100
   g(-1) in the till-sand transition zone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study presents the design of soft sensors for estimation of bitumen
   froth quality in an oil sands natural froth lubricated (NFL)
   transportation process. One of the most important quality indexes for
   bitumen froth is the water content. Due to the variation in oil sands
   composition and the nature of multi-phase process conditions, existing
   hardware sensors are not reliable enough to provide on-line accurate
   water content measurement. Laboratory analysis result is obtained
   off-line with large sampling interval and irregular time delay.
   Therefore, it is not sufficient for real-time monitoring and control. To
   overcome these limitations, Bayesian information synthesis approach is
   proposed to fuse all the existing information to produce more reliable
   and more accurate real-time froth quality information. This technique
   has been applied in Syncrude Canada Extraction operations; both
   monitoring and control performance illustrate the promising perspectives

Abstract = {{The oxidation of NO, CO and hydrocarbons (HC) individually, in mixtures,
   and with NO2 were investigated over a monolith-supported Pt/Al2O3
   catalyst under oxidising conditions. Although competitive adsorption and
   inhibition by other species on oxidation reactions is a relatively
   well-known phenomenon, this study represents a more comprehensive
   examination of such effects between key components in vehicle exhaust
   gases. NO7 was completely reduced by CO and C3H6, under NO2 limited
   conditions, at temperatures as low as 110 degrees C and at temperatures
   above 140 degrees C with dodecane and m-xylene. NO2 was then again
   observed once the extent of oxidation of the other species by oxygen was
   significant. Under the conditions tested, NO, CO and HC oxidation was
   inhibited by NO2 in the feed gas mixture. HC were also found to inhibit
   the oxidation of NO and other HC species due to site adsorption
   competition. For CO, HC did not change the onset of oxidation, but did
   inhibit the extent after their light off began. At low temperatures, CO
   was initially found to inhibit NO oxidation, but at higher temperatures,
   once CO oxidation was significant, CO promoted NO conversion to NO2. The
   observed inhibition effects of the different gases on HC oxidation were
   not additive, indicating one species would cause inhibition, but once
   its inhibition ended, another species could still then cause inhibition.
   The combined effect of C3H6, NO and NO2 on CO conversion was found to be
   additive. This is because CO oxidation started prior C3H6. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are believed to be the major toxic component of
   oil sands process water (OSPW). Different OSPW preparations have
   distinct NA compositions, and additional organics, that differ from the
   commercial NAs (C-NAs) often used for toxicology studies. To evaluate
   whether C-NAs are an adequate model to study OSPW toxicity in complex
   organisms, we compared the effects of C-NAs and the extractable organic
   fraction of OSPW (OSPW-OF) on mice immune mechanisms. Mice were orally
   exposed to different C-NA doses, or OSPW-OF at the same NA dose, for up
   to 8?weeks, and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in different
   organs was determined using quantitative PCR. C-NAs and OSPW-OF altered
   the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, inducing either expression
   down-regulation or up-regulation, depending on the organ examined and
   time after exposure. The time at which gene expression alterations
   occurred, and the specific sets of genes whose expression was altered,
   were very different between animals exposed to C-NAs or to OSPW-OF. We
   evaluated the ability of mouse peritoneal macrophages to phagocytose
   yeast cell wall, as a measure of the ability of mice to mount a central
   function of the innate immune response. Phagocytosis was significantly
   reduced in animals exposed to C-NAs, but enhanced in mice exposed to
   OSPW-OF. Our results indicate that studies using C-NAs may not
   necessarily reflect the possible effects induced in animals by process
   water from tailing ponds. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new adaptive controller design scheme for
   nonlinear telerobotic systems with varying time delays where the delays
   and their variation rates are unknown. The designed controller has the
   ability to synchronize the state behaviors of the local and the remote
   robots. In this paper, asymptotic stability in the presence of varying
   time delays is of interest. Using the proposed controller, asymptotic
   stability of the bilateral telerobotic system subject to any bounded yet
   unknown varying delay with a bounded yet unknown rate of change can be
   guaranteed. Besides the varying time delay, the proposed adaptive
   controller has the ability to adapt to the parameter variations in the
   local and the remote robots' dynamics. It is shown that position and
   velocity errors between the local and the remote manipulators converge
   to the zero asymptotically, thus ensuring teleoperation transparency.
   Experimental and simulation results with a pair of PHANToM haptic
   devices and a pair of planar manipulators under varying time delays in
   the communication channel demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic interfacial friction of an inclined, multiwalled carbon
   nanotube (MWCNT) array surface fabricated on a commercial electrostatic
   adsorption film substrate has been experimentally studied. As a typical
   case, the friction force of steel ball/inclined MWCNT along the inclined
   direction is 40\% larger than that against the inclined direction. The
   significant interfacial friction anisotropy remains stable even after
   nearly 4000 sliding cycles. While the tilt of MWCNT close to the top
   surface layer significantly affected the interfacial friction, the
   underlying nanotubes only has limited effects. Based on the van der
   Waals interaction between the MWCNT and the steel ball, the achieved
   anisotropic interfacial friction at different sliding directions is
   quantitatively modeled and explained. The interplay between the lateral
   friction and normal adhesion force has also been found during the
   unloading process of friction test. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies with rodent cells and animal models indicate that
   noggin inhibits osteogenesis by antagonizing bone morphogenetic proteins
   (BMPs); however, the effect of noggin on osteogenesis of human cells
   remains ambiguous. This study aims to examine the effects of noggin
   suppression on viability and BMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of
   human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro. Noggin
   expression in human MSCs was suppressed by noggin-specific small
   interfering RNA (siRNA), and viability of human MSCs was determined by
   measuring the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, cellular DNA content
   and protein amount. The BMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of
   human MSCs was assessed by analyzing the expression levels of several
   osteoblastic genes, enzymatic alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and
   calcification. Our study showed that noggin suppression significantly
   decreased human MSC metabolism and DNA content on Days 3 and 6, and
   decreased total protein amount on Day 14. Noggin suppression also
   reduced the expression levels of osteoblastic genes, ALP,
   integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP), muscle segment homeobox gene
   (MSX2), osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN), and runt-related
   transcription factor-2 (RUNX2). Significantly decreased enzymatic ALP
   activity in noggin-suppressed group was evident. Moreover, noggin
   suppression decreased calcium deposits by BMP-2-induced osteoblasts.
   Collectively, this study showed that noggin suppression decreased
   viability and BMP-2-induced osteogenic differentiation of human MSCs,
   which suggests that noggin is stimulatory to osteogenesis of human MSCs.

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{25-36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We describe a method for the direct simulation of
   high-solids-volume-fraction (up to 45\%) suspensions of non-spherical
   rigid particles that are non-colloidal and slightly denser than the
   interstitial fluid. The lattice-Boltzmann method is used to solve for
   the flow of the interstitial Newtonian fluid, and the immersed boundary
   method is used to enforce a no-slip boundary condition at the surface of
   each particle. The surface points for the immersed boundary method are
   also employed for collision handling by applying repulsive forces
   between the surface points of nearby particles. We also discuss methods
   for integrating the equations of particle motion at low density ratios
   and propose a method with improved accuracy. The methods are used to
   simulate rigid particles shaped like red blood cells. We report on the
   effect of the solids volume fraction on the sedimentation rate using a
   Richardson-Zaki model, and we describe the orientation of the particles
   during sedimentation. The particles settle in a preferentially vertical
   orientation at terminal particle Reynolds numbers near one. We compare a
   simulation at a 35\% solids volume fraction with typical erythrocyte
   sedimentation rates, a common blood test. We find an order of magnitude
   lower sedimentation rate than the value for healthy adults. The
   discrepancy is attributed to the omission of agglomeration-inducing
   inter-cellular forces and the treatment of the red blood cells as rigid
   particles in the simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{94-114}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The characteristics of sand-water slurry jets in water were investigated
   by a validated numerical model. Predictions of the main properties of
   the jet such as axial and radial velocities and particle concentration
   agreed well with laboratory measurements. The effect of sand particles
   on slurry jet spreading rate, axial velocity decay, decay of
   concentration and turbulence properties was studied, and the results
   were compared with the corresponding single-phase water jets and plumes.
   It was found that the width of slurry jets grows linearly from the
   nozzle up to a certain distance and then the growth rate became
   non-linear. At particle volume concentrations larger than 2.4\% or with
   particle sizes larger than 505 mu m, the spreading rate of sand phase
   was found to be only about one third of that of the water phase.
   Empirical formulations are proposed to describe the effects of
   controlling parameters on the axial velocity decay of slurry jets. Some
   integral properties were computed from numerical results such as
   entrainment and drag coefficients. The absolute entrainment coefficient
   was introduced and computational results indicated that slurry jets were
   more efficient in mixing than single-phase jets. From the computed
   values of drag coefficient, the grouping effect of particles was found
   to reduce the drag coefficient by half. Turbulent shear stresses of both
   sand-phase and water-phase were also estimated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   those, very few systematically investigate their non-fouling behavior.
   In this work, single protein adsorption studies as well as protein
   adsorption from complex solutions (i.e. human plasma) were used to
   evaluate the non-fouling potential of PCBMA grafted silica wafers
   prepared by nitroxide-mediated free radical polymerization. PCBMAs used
   for surface grafting varied in charge separating spacer groups that
   influence the overall surface charges, and chain end-groups that
   influence the overall hydrophilicity, thereby, allows a better
   understanding of these effects towards the protein adsorption for
   thesematerials. In situ ellipsometry was used to quantify the adsorbed
   layer thickness and adsorption kinetics for the adsorption of four
   proteins from single protein buffer solutions, viz, lysozyme,
   a-lactalbumin, human serum albumin and fibrinogen. Total amount of
   protein adsorbed on surfaces differed as a function of surface
   properties and protein characteristics. Finally, immunoblots results
   showed that human plasma protein adsorption to these surfaces resulted,
   primarily, in the adsorption of human serum albumin, with total protein
   adsorbed amounts being the lowest for PCBMA-3 (TEMPO). It was apparent
   that surface charge and chain hydrophilicity directly influenced protein
   adsorption behavior of PCBMA systems and are promising materials for
   biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its medical applications, the mechanisms responsible for the
   osseointegration of bioactive glass (45S5) have yet to be fully
   understood. Evidence suggests that the strongest predictor for
   osseointegration of bioactive glasses, and ceramics, with bone tissue as
   the formation of an apatitic calcium phosphate layer atop the implanted
   material, with osteoblasts being the main mediator for new bone
   formation. Most have tried to understand the formation of this apatitic
   calcium phosphate layer, and other bioresponses between the host and
   bioactive glass 45S5 using Simulated Body Fluid; a solution containing
   ion concentrations similar to that found in human plasma without the
   presence of proteins. However, it is likely that cell attachment is
   probably largely mediated via the adsorbed protein layer. Plasma protein
   adsorption at the tissue bioactive glass interface has been largely
   overlooked. Herein, we compare crystalline and amorphous bioactive glass
   45S5, in both melt-derived as well as sol-gel forms. Thus, allowing for
   a detailed understanding of both the role of crystallinity and powder
   morphology on surface ions, and plasma protein adsorption. It was found
   that sol-gel 45S5 powders, regardless of crystallinity, adsorbed 3-5
   times as much protein as the crystalline melt-derived counterpart, as
   well as a greater variety of plasma proteins. The devitrification of
   melt-cast 45S5 resulted in only small differences in the amount and
   variety of the adsorbed proteome. Surface properties, and not material
   crystallinity, play a role in directing protein adsorption phenomena for
   bioactive glasses given the differences found between crystalline
   melt-cast 45S5 and sol-gel derived 45S5.}},

   play essential roles in biology, medicine, ecology, biotechnology, food

Abstract = {{Reference-current-based active compensation techniques are widely used
   to actively damp the negative admittance effect associated with constant
   power loads in power electronic systems. These methods, however, yield
   strong coupling among the active compensator, speed, and current control
   dynamics when applied to motor drives. To overcome these difficulties, a
   new reference-voltage-based active compensator (RVC) is proposed to
   mitigate the negative admittance effect in permanent-magnet synchronous
   motor drives with tight-speed regulation. The proposed RVC suppresses
   the interaction dynamics between the compensator and motor drive
   dynamics in the low- and medium-frequency regions and maintains
   stability and effective damping performance along the whole loading
   trajectory of the motor drive. In addition, the proposed compensator has
   a very simple structure, and it can easily be augmented to existing
   motor drives with minimal interactions with existing drive control
   strategy and parameters. A theoretical comparative analysis and test
   results are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of
   the proposed technique.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{241}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of the kinetic diameter (KD) of the
   reference adsorbate on the accuracy of the Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R)
   equation for predicting the adsorption isotherms of organic vapors on
   microporous activated carbon. Adsorption isotherms for 13 organic
   compounds on microporous beaded activated carbon were experimentally
   measured, and predicted using the D-R model and affinity coefficients.
   The affinity coefficients calculated based on molar volumes, molecular
   polarizabilities, and molecular parachors were used to predict the
   isotherms based on four reference compounds (4.3 <= KD <= 6.8 angstrom).
   The results show that the affinity coefficients are independent of the
   calculation method if the reference and test adsorbates are from the
   same organic group. Choosing a reference adsorbate with a KD similar to
   that of the test adsorbate results in better prediction of the
   adsorption isotherm. The relative error between the predicted and the
   measured adsorption isotherms increases as the absolute difference in
   the kinetic diameters of the reference and test adsorbates increases.
   Finally, the proposed hypothesis was used to explain reports of
   inconsistent findings among published articles. The results from this
   study are important because they allow a more accurate prediction of
   adsorption capacities of adsorbents which allow for better design of
   adsorption systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1266}},
Pages = {{168-174}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Reversed phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) or high performance thin
   layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates modified with C18, C8 or C2 to
   provide the silica-gel stationary phase with different polarities are
   available on the market, however, reversed phase plates with tunable
   polarity have not been reported. Given the limited variety of reversed
   phase plates, mobile phase composition optimization is necessary to
   obtain better separation of analytes with similar characteristics, which
   is often a time consuming step. We present polarity-adjustable reversed
   phase ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC) plates, which simplifies the
   mobile phase screening process and greatly expands the selection of
   reversed phase plates. The plates were fabricated on glass substrates
   with SiO2 nanopillars deposited using the glancing angle deposition
   (GLAD) technique. SiO2 nanopillars were functionalized with
   octadecyltrichlorosilane to generate a super hydrophobic stationary
   phase. Unlike commercial silica-gel based stationary phases, the
   isolated nanopillar architecture presented here exposes a high surface
   area to post-fabrication surface treatments. In our work, an O-2 plasma
   treatment at different powers, pressures and exposure times was used to
   shorten the silane carbon chain and introduce COOH groups to the
   surface, producing plates with finely tunable polarities. Separation of
   a model dye mixture of Sudan blue and Sudan IV confirmed the tuning of
   surface polarities by measurement of retention behavior changes. The dye
   elution order reversed as a result of the change in surface polarity.
   When the same plasma treatment process was tested on commercial reversed
   phase plates, separation behavior did not change because the disordered
   and tortuous silica gel restricts the accessible surface area. Plasma
   treatment of GLAD structures with highly accessible surfaces improved
   control over interfacial properties, producing better reverse phase
   separations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents an improved layered space-time symbol detection
   algorithm for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems.
   The proposed detection scheme utilises a different layer-ordering
   strategy than the so-called optimal ordering used in the conventional
   Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (BLAST) algorithm. To calculate the
   nulling vectors and their associated ordering, instead of using direct
   numerical techniques, the authors utilise a numerically stable iterative
   solution. It is shown that the performance of the proposed detector
   approaches closely that of an optimal maximum-likelihood detector at the
   expense of greater computational complexity compared with BLAST.
   Utilising the proposed parameterisable detector, one can trade off
   between the computational requirement and the error-rate performance.}},

Number = {{5, 2}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{In a recent paper {[}Das et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 046311 (2012)], we
   delineated the role of electrokinetic transport in modifying the
   classical ``coffee stain{''} effect. In this study, we extend this
   calculation to incorporate the consequences of a generalized
   electromagnetohydrodynamic transport in the coffee stain phenomenon. The
   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect enhances the velocities at the
   beginning of the drop life, whereas the electrokinetic effect increases
   the ``disordering{''} effect in particle deposition at the end of the
   drop, triggered by a velocity divergence. For a suitable combination of
   the strength of the MHD and electrokinetic transport, however, this
   disordering effect is substantially enhanced, and, most nonintuitively,
   such velocity divergence and the disordering effect may occur at a time
   that is much earlier than the end of the drop life, or may occur even
   instantaneously after the start of the drop evaporation. This work will
   provide useful insight in the understanding of the dynamics of
   mesoscopic patterns formed as the magnetic nanocrystals deposit in the
   presence of a combined transport driven by evaporation and magnetic
   field effects.}},

Abstract = {{Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy has found widespread application due
   to a number of attractive features including phase-sensitive detection
   and subpicosecond temporal resolution. Recently, the application of this
   technique to study ensembles of sub-wavelength ferromagnetic particles
   resulted in the observation of novel and unusual effects. The shape,
   relative transmission amplitude, and time delay of a broadband terahertz
   waveform were sensitive to the magnitude and direction of an applied
   magnetic field and to the magnetization states of the particles.
   Furthermore, the addition of a thin coating of nonmagnetic metal (Au) at
   the surface of the particles had a profound effect on these
   characteristics. To better understand the new phenomena, a terahertz
   time-domain spectroscopy investigation of ensembles of ferromagnetic
   particles is presented in which the test range of magnetic field is
   extended, including significantly larger magnitude as well as both field
   polarities. By sweeping the applied field continuously through zero,
   hysteretic effects are now observed. Furthermore, we show that the
   effects of a thin nonmagnetic metal coating are not unique to Au. These
   effects are also observed in particle ensembles in which the
   ferromagnetic particles are coated with thin Al or Ag films. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Alarms are important for safe and reliable operation in process
   industries. Periodic alarm assessment is a crucial step in alarm

   Similarity Color Map (ASCM) highlights related and redundant alarms in a
   convenient manner. The proposed graphical tools are instrumental in
   performance assessment of industrial alarm systems in terms of
   effectively identifying nuisance alarms such as chattering and related
   alarms based on routinely collected alarm event data. The special
   features and advantages of the proposed graphical tools are illustrated
   by successful application to two large scale industrial case studies,

Abstract = {{Inverse ligand binding prediction utilizes a few protein-ligand (drug)
   complexes to predict other secondary therapeutic and off-targets of a
   given drug molecule on a proteomic scale. We adapt two binding site
   predictors, FINDSITE and SMAP, to perform the inverse predictions and
   evaluate them on over 30 representative ligands. Use of just one complex
   allows the identification of other protein targets; the availability of
   additional complexes improves the results. Both methods offer comparable
   quality when using three complexes with diverse proteins. SMAP is better
   when fewer complexes are available, while FINDSITE provides stronger
   predictions for smaller ligands. We propose a consensus that combines
   (and outperforms) the two complementary approaches implemented by
   FINDSITE and SMAP. Most importantly, we demonstrate that these methods
   successfully find distant targets that belong to structurally different
   folds compared to the proteins in the input complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent laboratory and field-scale experiments demonstrated the potential
   for brominated industrial solid waste from biomass combustion (Br-Ash)
   to be an efficient, cost-effective alternative to activated carbon for
   capturing mercury from coal-fired power plants. To develop this
   attractive alternative technology to a commercially sustainable level, a
   better understanding of mercury capture mechanisms by Br-Ash is
   required. For this purpose, X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS)
   spectra of Br-Ash were collected at the Hg L-III-edge, Br K-edge and S
   K-edge, and analyzed to determine the local bonding environment of
   mercury atoms. The coordination environment of Hg was compared with that
   on a commercial brominated activated carbon. Our results indicate that
   the mercury was captured by chemisorption on both the commercial and
   biomass ash sorbents; however, the mercury binding environment was
   different for each sorbent. Mercury was found to bind to the reduced

Abstract = {{Geostatistical modelling aims at providing unbiased estimates of the
   grades of elements of economic interest in mining operations, and
   assessing the associated uncertainty in these resources and reserves.
   Conventional practice consists of using the data as error-free values
   and performing the typical steps of data analysis - domaining,
   semivariogram analysis, and estimation/simulation. However, in many
   mature deposits, information comes from different drilling campaigns
   that were sometimes completed decades ago, when little or no quality
   assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures were available.
   Although this legacy data may have significant sampling errors, it
   provides valuable information and should be combined with more recent
   data that has been subject to strict QA/QC procedures.
   In this paper we show that ignoring the errors associated with sample
   data considerably underestimates the uncertainty (and consequently the
   economic risk) associated with a mining project. We also provide a
   methodology to combine data with different sampling errors, thus
   preserving the relevant global and local statistics. The method consists
   of constructing consistent simulated sets of values at the sample
   locations, in order to reproduce the error of each drilling campaign and
   the spatial correlation of the grades. It is based on a Gibbs sampler,
   where at every sample location, the actual sample value (with error) is
   removed and a conditional distribution is calculated from simulated
   values at nearby sample locations. A value is drawn from that
   distribution and kept only if it satisfies some statistical
   requirements-specifically, the global relative error and local means and
   variances must be reproduced. All sample locations are visited and
   simulated sample values are generated iteratively, until the required
   statistics are satisfactorily attained over all sample locations. This
   generates one realization of possible sample values, respecting the fact
   that the actual samples are known to carry an error given by the global
   relative error. Multiple realizations of simulated sample values can be
   obtained by repeating the procedure. At the end of this procedure, at
   every sample location a set of simulated sample values is available that
   accounts for the imprecision of the information. Furthermore, within
   each realization, the simulated sample values are consistent with each
   other, reproducing the spatial continuity and local statistics. These
   simulated sets of sample values can then be used as input to
   conventional simulation on a full grid to assess the uncertainty in the
   final resources over large volumes. The methodology is presented and
   demonstrated using a synthetic data-set for clarity.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced process control strategy
   which is widely applied in many industries and it is often implemented
   in two levels; steady-state target calculation and dynamic optimization.
   Target calculation level computes the optimal steady-state targets of
   the process and sends them to dynamic optimization for implementation.
   The existence of uncertainty or variation in the parameters of the
   target calculation layer can lead to unstable or cyclic targets which
   can significatively affect the overall performance of the controller.
   Many methods have been proposed to deal with model uncertainty using
   robust optimization. In this study, a new approach using post-optimality
   analysis is proposed to study the effect of uncertainty or variation in
   problem parameters on the optimal solution of linear target calculation.
   This approach can compute the stability limits, for simultaneous
   variations in objective function coefficients or process limitations,
   before the optimal target or basis are changed. It aims to improve the
   closed-loop robustness of MPC by assessing the required accuracy of
   parameter estimates and variation limits before the calculated target
   start cycling. The proposed approach offers a design-phase test for
   targets stability.}},

Abstract = {{The facile encapsulation of biomolecules along with efficient
   formulation and storage makes nanogels ideal candidates for drug and
   gene delivery. So far, nanogels have not been used for the codelivery of
   plasmid DNA and proteins due to several limitations, including low
   encapsulation efficacy of biomolecule of similar charges and the size of
   cargo materials. In this study, temperature and pH sensitive
   carbohydrate-based nanogels are synthesized via reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization technique
   and are studied in detail for their capacity to encapsulate and
   codeliver plasmid DNA and proteins. The temperature sensitive property
   of nanogels allows the facile encapsulation of biomaterials, while its
   acid-degradable profile allows the burst release of biomolecules in
   endosomes. Hence these materials are expected to serve as efficient
   vectors to deliver biomolecules of choice either alone or as codelivery
   system. The nanogels produced are relatively monodisperse and are around
   30-40 nm in diameter at 37 degrees C. DNA condensation efficacy of the
   nanogels is dependent on the hydrophobic property of the core of the
   nanogels. The DNA-nanogel complexes are formed by the interaction of
   carbohydrate residues of nanogels with the DNA, and complexes are
   further stabilized with linear cationic glycopolymers. The DNA-nanogels
   complexes are also studied for their protein loading capacity. The
   degradation of the nanogels and the controlled release of DNA and
   proteins are then studied in vitro. Furthermore, the addition of a
   nontoxic, cationic glycopolymer to the nanogel-DNA complexes is found to
   improve the cellular uptake and hence to improve gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Off-site construction has become increasingly popular in industrial
   construction projects over the past decade due to its advantages: higher
   productivity, better quality, better safety, and improved time and cost
   effectiveness. The fast-paced nature of off-site construction
   environments and the constraints induced by the construction site, along
   with the existing limitations within the shop, make the control process
   of off-site construction quite challenging. High-quality real-time data
   provided by utilizing new technologies can significantly improve and
   speed up the process of monitoring projects and identifying possible
   deviations; however, to be effective, decisions on corrective measures
   have to be made as quickly as possible. This paper presents an enhanced
   method based on the control theory concept for taking timely corrective
   actions to control the dynamic and fast-paced environments of off-site
   construction shops. The proposed method allows project managers to
   perform punctual nonlinear data analysis and predict the behavior of the
   performance of the shop. This leads to promptly determining the best
   corrective action in the case of variance to achieve a desired
   performance level with minimum cost. To illustrate its feasibility and
   potential for improving project control, the proposed approach was
   successfully implemented in an actual off-site structural steel

Abstract = {{Numerous steam-assisted gravity-drainage (SAGD) optimization studies
   published in the literature combined numerical simulation with graphical
   or analytical techniques for design and performance evaluation. Efforts
   have integrated the simulation exercise with global optimization
   algorithms. Some studies focused on optimization of cumulative steam/oil
   ratio (cSOR) in SAGD by altering steam-injection rates, while others
   focused on optimization of net cumulative energy/oil ratio (cEOR) in
   solvent-additive SAGD by altering injection pressures and fraction of
   solvent in the injection stream. Several studies also considered total
   project net-present-value (NPV) calculation by changing total project
   area, capital-cost intensities, solvent prices, and risk factors to
   determine the well spacing and drilling schedule. Optimization
   techniques commonly used in those studies were scattered search,
   simulated annealing, and genetic algorithm (GA). However, applications
   of hybrid GA were rarely found.
   In this paper, we focused on optimization of solvent-assisted SAGD using
   various GA implementations. In our models, hexane was selected to be
   coinjected with steam. The objective function, defined on the basis of
   cSOR and recovery factor, was optimized by changing injection pressures,
   production pressures, and injected solvent/steam ratio. Techniques,
   including orthogonal arrays (OA) for experimental design (e.g.,
   Taguchi's arrays) and proxy models for objective-function (F)
   evaluations, were incorporated with the GA method to improve
   computational and convergence efficiency. Results from these hybrid
   approaches revealed that an optimized solution could be achieved with
   less central-processing-unit time (e.g., fewer number of iterations)
   compared with the conventional GA method. Sensitivity analysis was also
   conducted on the choice of proxy model to study the robustness of the
   proposed methods.
   To investigate the effects of heterogeneity in the design process,
   optimization of solvent-assisted SAGD was performed on various synthetic
   heterogeneous reservoir models of porosity, permeability, and shale
   distributions. Our results highlight the potential application of the
   proposed techniques in other solvent-enhanced heavy-oil-recovery
   processes.}},

   (visbreaking) of Athabasca bitumen (Chan et al. 2006). In that work, the
   major reaction pathways followed during visbreaking were identified.
   This approach is being extended in the current work to model the
   visbreaking behaviour of five different oils from different geographical
   locations around the world. This paper shows the correlation of residue
   conversion with the contents of different carbon types for five heavy
   oils from four continents.
   During visbreaking runs, operators intend to maximize process yields.
   This is achieved through increasing process severity by raising
   temperature. However, if the temperature is too high, coke forms. This
   maximum temperature varies with different crude oils; therefore, as
   refinery feedstock composition changes, so does the onset of coking
   temperature. Coke is a hydrocarbon material that has low hydrogen
   content and is insoluble in the oil. Consequently, this precipitates in
   the reactor, eventually causing an unscheduled unit shutdown. We have
   found that contents of specific carbon types in the feed oils correlate
   with coke formation. This correlation allows prediction of the
   quantities of coke that will form under the chosen visbreaking (mild
   thermal) conditions and the ``maximum{''} quantities of coke that would
   form under coking (severe thermal) conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic study was performed over thermally aged and steam-aged Pt and
   Pt-Pd catalysts to investigate the effect of temperature, and methane
   and water concentrations on the performance of catalysts in the range of
   interest for environmental applications. It was found that both
   catalysts permanently lose a large portion of their initial activity as
   result of exposure to S vol.\% water in the reactor feed. Empirical
   power-law and LHHW type of rate equations were proposed for methane
   combustion over Pt and Pt-Pd catalysts respectively. Optimization was
   used to determine the parameters of the proposed rate equations using
   the experimental results. The overall reaction orders of one and zero in
   methane and water concentration was found for stabilized steam-aged Pt
   catalyst in the presence and absence of water. The apparent
   self-inhibition effect caused by methane over Pt-Pd catalyst in the
   absence of water was associated with the inhibiting effect of water
   produced during the combustion of methane. A significant reversible
   inhibition effect was also observed over steam-aged Pt-Pd catalyst when
   5 vol.\% water vapor was added to the reactor feed stream. A significant
   reduction in both activity and activation energy was observed above
   temperatures of approximately 550 degrees C for steam-aged Pt-Pd
   catalyst in the presence of water (the activation energy dropped from a
   value of 72.6 kJ/mol to 35.7 kJ/mol when temperature exceeded 550
   degrees C). (C) 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach to system identification and
   closed-loop control of end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure
   (PETCO2) in mechanically ventilated patients. An empirical model
   consisting of a linear dynamic system followed by an affine transform is
   proposed to derive a low-order and high-fidelity representation that can
   reproduce the positive and inversely proportional dynamic input-output
   relationship between PETCO2 and minute ventilation in mechanically
   ventilated patients. The predictive capability of the empirical model
   was evaluated using experimental respiratory data collected from 18
   mechanically ventilated human subjects. The model predicted PETCO2
   response accurately with a root-mean-squared error of 0.22 +/- 0.16 mmHg
   and a coefficient of determination r(2) of 0.81 +/- 0.18 (mean +/- SD)
   when a second-order rational transfer function was used as its linear
   dynamic component. Using the proposed model, a closed-loop control
   method for PETCO2 based on a proportional-integral (PI) compensator was
   proposed by systematic analysis of the system root locus. For the 18
   mechanically ventilated patient models identified, the PI compensator
   exhibited acceptable closed-loop response with a settling time of 1.27
   +/- 0.20 min and a negligible overshoot (0.51 +/- 1.17\%), in addition
   to zero steady-state PETCO2 set point tracking. The physiologic
   implication of the proposed empirical model was analyzed by comparing it
   with the traditional multicompartmental model widely used in
   pharmacological modeling.}},

   using cube and cylinder specimens. Four-point flexural tests of
   unnotched prism specimens and direct shear tests of notched specimens
   were completed. In all cases, specimens with a size range of up to 2
   were used. The peak strengths and post-peak ductility in compression,
   flexure, and direct shear were all found to increase significantly as
   the fiber volume fraction increased. Normalized strengths decreased for
   increases in specimen size, with a more pronounced size influence found
   at greater fiber contents. The measured test results were further

Abstract = {{We utilized transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, with a
   cryogenically cooled sample stage, to detail the microstructure of
   partially transformed pure and titanium fluoride-catalyzed magnesium
   hydride powder during hydrogenation cycling. The TiF3-catalyzed MgH2
   powder demonstrated excellent hydrogen storage kinetics at various
   temperatures, whereas the uncatalyzed MgH2 showed significant
   degradation in both kinetics and capacity. TEM analysis on the partially
   hydrogen absorbed and partially desorbed pure Mg(MgH2) revealed a large
   fraction of particles that were either not transformed at all or were
   completely transformed. On the other hand, in the MgH2+TiF3 system it
   was much easier to identify regions with both the hydride and the metal
   phase coexisting in the same particle. This enabled us to establish the
   metal hydride orientation relationship (OR) during hydrogen absorption.
   The OR was determined to be (1 1 0)MgH2 parallel to (-1 1 0-1)Mg and
   {[}-1 1 1]MgH2 parallel to {[}0 1 - 1 1]Mg. During absorption the number
   density of the hydride nuclei does not show a dramatic increase due the
   presence of TiF3. Conversely, during desorption the TiF3 catalyst
   substantially increases the number of the newly formed Mg crystallites,
   which display a strong texture correlation with respect to the parent
   MgH2 phase. Titanium fluoride also promotes extensive twinning in the
   hydride phase. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Among the contenders for applications at terahertz frequencies are III-V
   high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs). In this paper, we report on
   a tendency for III-V devices with low effective-mass channel materials
   to exhibit a saturation in their unity-current-gain and unity-power-gain
   cutoff frequencies (f(T) and f(max)) with a downscaling of gate length.
   We focus on InGaAs and GaN HEMTs and examine gate lengths from 50 nm
   down to 10 nm. A self-consistent, quantum-mechanical solver based on the
   method of nonequilibrium Green's functions is used to quasistatically
   extract the f(T) for intrinsic III-V devices. This model is then
   combined with the series resistances of the heterostructure stack and
   the parasitic resistances and capacitances of the metal contacts to
   develop a complete extrinsic model, and to extract the extrinsic f(T)
   and f(max). It is shown that the f(T) and f(max) of III-V devices will
   saturate, i.e., attain a maximum value that ceases to increase as the
   gate length is scaled down, and that the saturation is caused by the low
   effective mass of III-V materials. It is also shown that the InGaAs
   HEMTs have faster f(T) at long gate lengths, but as a consequence of
   their lower effective mass, they experience a more rapid f(T) saturation
   than the GaN HEMTs, such that the two devices have a comparable f(T) at
   very short gate lengths (similar to 10 nm). On the other hand, due to
   favorable parasitics, it is shown that the InGaAs HEMTs have a higher
   f(max) at all the gate lengths considered in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) during electron beam
   lithography (EBL) produces small polymer fragments that dissolve rapidly
   during the development process. The resist dissolution behavior varies
   greatly depending on the nature of the developer (solvent) and therefore
   influences the selection of the EBL parameters, such as dose
   (sensitivity). A molecular scale examination of the development process
   is necessary to elucidate the resist-developer interaction mechanisms.
   In this work, the authors investigate the interaction of short PMMA
   chains (containing up to 10 MMA units) with common developer components
   methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). For this
   purpose, the authors conduct molecular dynamics simulations using the
   Accelrys Materials Studio package. The simulation results were used to
   characterize the mixtures in the spirit of the Flory-Huggins theory of
   polymers and also to extract the diffusivities. The authors found that
   the behavior of PMMA fragments differed considerably in MIBK as compared
   with IPA. PMMA fragments containing more than three monomers exhibit
   stronger attractive interaction with MIBK. For all fragment sizes
   simulated, the diffusivity of PMMA fragments is 60-160\% higher in MIBK
   as well. Similarly, the authors observed differences in the gyration
   radii. The authors conclude that the kinetic factor seems to be more
   significant as compared to affinity factor when accounting for
   differences in exposure sensitivities due to developer selection. (C)

Abstract = {{A finite difference method was used to simulate the electric fields
   induced in the model by a gradient wire pattern. The pattern simulated
   corresponded to a design used to perform peripheral nerves stimulation
   experiments. The size (187.8, 169.02, and 150.24 cm tall) and position
   (brain and neck mode) of the model, relative to the magnet, as well as
   the voxel dimensions (3, 6, and 9 mm) of the model were varied to assess
   the effect on the simulation. The locations of stimulation reported from
   an experiment were classified according to nerve branch and compared
   with the peak-simulated electric fields. Model size and location
   affected the magnitude of the electric field, but not the position.
   Model resolution affected the location of the peak field. For the
   smallest resolution investigated, the nerves affected by the locations
   of peak stimulations in the model correlated to the frequency of
   stimulation in experiments. Although adequate resolution is required in
   order to assess the electric fields induced by gradient coil operation,
   the simulation of electric fields may be useful in evaluating gradient
   coil design prior to construction. Magn Reson Med, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{Solvent extraction of coal is a coal-to-liquids conversion process
   whereby the organic matter in coal is dissolved in a solvent to produce
   a substantially mineral matter free product. The solvent extraction of
   Poplar lignite coal was studied with three model solvents (tetralin,
   quinoline, and 1-naphtol) and one industrial coal liquid derived
   solvent. Of interest was the fate of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, and
   mineral constituents during physical dissolution at 200 degrees C and
   during reactive dissolution at 400 degrees C. The hydrogen
   redistribution in all solvents at 400 degrees C was within a narrow
   range, even though hydrogen-donor solvents resulted in higher extraction
   yield and in a higher H/C ratio of the residue. Quinoline strongly
   interacted with the coal, which masked its high physical extraction
   yield at 200 degrees C and enabled more mineral matter to be stabilized
   in solution. This behavior is typical of nitrogen bases in the coal, but
   was amplified by quinoline. Nitrogen redistribution took place with all
   solvents to nitrogen enrich the residue. Little or no sulfur
   redistribution took place during solvent extraction at 200 degrees C
   with any of the solvents, but at 400 degrees C, sulfur was
   redistributed. Evidence that sulfur is removed from the mineral matter
   during solvent extraction was provided by an observed decrease in S/Fe
   ratio, decrease in sulfur content of the ash, and increase in S/C ratio
   of extraction residues.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to study the performance of a multicell
   vector perturbation (MVP) precoding technique under practical situations
   in a network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme employing
   joint transmission. The conventional perturbation strategy that
   minimizes the total power is considered, and the power at each base
   station (BS) is properly scaled to enforce per-BS power constraints. In
   our scenario, we consider multiple-antenna users and use block
   diagonalization (BD) as the linear front-end precoder for VP. The sum
   rate for the MVP in the case of uniformly distributed input and an
   asymptotic upper bound on the sum rate at high signal-to-noise ratios
   (SNRs) are derived. In addition, using the asymptotic upper bound on the
   individual user rates, we propose a proportionally fair (PF) user
   scheduling algorithm of lower complexity and better performance compared
   with the benchmark fair semiorthogonal user selection (SUS) algorithm.
   As opposed to the PF-SUS, the proposed PF scheduling algorithm requires
   no predefined correlation threshold. Furthermore, we study the impact of
   backhaul delay on the performance of both VP and BD by deriving bounds
   on the sum rate. The numerical results show that MVP in the case of
   perfect channel state information (CSI) outperforms multicell BD. In the
   presence of a backhaul delay, the performance of MVP significantly
   degrades, but the upper bound on the sum rate for MVP is still higher
   than for multicell BD.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the aches and pains of adults are the result of the long-term

   adolescence, which is an excessive rounding of the upper spine, may be
   one of the effects of poor standing and sitting habits. A smart garment,
   consisting of a harness and two data-sensor loggers, was developed to
   monitor and provide vibration feedback to wearers to improve their
   posture during daily activities. Laboratory tests verified that the
   garment could provide an accuracy of 2 +/- A 2A degrees during static
   measurement and 3 +/- A 2A degrees during stable or slowly changing
   posture activities and 4 +/- A 4A degrees during rapidly changing
   posture activities. Four volunteers wore the system for 3 h per day and
   for 4 consecutive days. The feedback was provided on the last 2 days and
   the kyphotic angle reduced by 8 +/- A 1A degrees and 8 +/- A 2A degrees
   on the last 2 days, respectively. Although the long-term effects of
   reminding the subjects' posture is still not clear, a short-term result

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the dynamic flexural response of sandstone from the
   Paskapoo formation in Alberta. Sandstone prisms were subjected to
   quasi-static flexure as per ASTM while a drop-weight impact tester was
   employed to generate stress rates up to 10(8) kPa/s. Companion testing
   under quasi-static compression on sandstone cylinders helped establish
   baseline properties including the compressive strength, elastic modulus,
   and Poisson's ratio. It was found that the flexural strength and
   fracture toughness of Paskapoo sandstone obey stress rate sensitive
   models developed originally for concrete. However, the fracture
   toughness was more stress rate sensitive than its flexural strength.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent weighted concept lattice (FWCL) is an interesting version of
   the WCL (weighted concept lattice), which helps realize knowledge
   extraction in a more efficient way. One of the open issues is that the
   completeness of FWCL cannot be ensured (namely, some nodes would be
   removed since their intent weights are lower than intent importance
   thresholds specified by the user, so that it can occur that the supremum
   of their parent nodes or the infimum of their child nodes might not
   exist). In this study, we first introduce a virtual node into the
   structure of FWCL to retain the completeness of FWCL. Next, an algebraic
   system of FWCL is presented by introducing two operations, which form
   the least frequent upper bound and the greatest frequent lower bound of
   the FWCL. Finally, we discuss some algebraic properties of FWCL and
   prove its completeness of knowledge representation in this way providing
   the theoretical foundations for applications of WCL. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   dimension from the phase space reconstruction, the chaotic behavior of
   EN is quantitatively evaluated. It is concluded that local corrosion
   shows a higher correlation dimension while passivation shows a lower
   correlation dimension. We propose that the correlation dimension
   increases with the complexity and uncertainty of the signals from

Abstract = {{Until recently, there was a substantial lack of reliable viscosity data
   for H2S, making the regression of an accurate H2S viscosity model
   significantly difficult. To derive a model for engineering applications
   (2008 H2S model), a corresponding states approach that related molecules
   of similar shape to H2S was applied to cover regions where no
   experimental data was available. Recently, new primary low-density
   experimental data and derived theoretical information have been
   published. Additionally, new high-pressure H2S viscosity measurements
   {[}at (373.15 and 423.15) K and up to 100 MPa] have also been reported.
   Based on this, a new revised correlation for the viscosity of H2S is
   presented in this work. The current correlation reproduces the primary
   H2S viscosity data to within experimental uncertainty. The precision of
   the new correlation varies from reference quality (better than +/- 0.20
   \%) at low-densities to an estimated +/- 5 \% at 100 MPa and
   temperatures between (373 and 423) K. Outside this range of temperature
   there are no data to validate the accuracy of the model at elevated
   pressures; therefore we have conservatively estimated an uncertainty of
   roughly 10 \% in the low-temperature and high-density region (T < 323 K
   up to 100 MPa) and 5 \% for the high-temperature region ( T > 450 K up
   to 100 MPa).}},

Abstract = {{While an effective non-viral gene carrier, 25 kDa branched
   polyethylenimine (PEI) is cytotoxic, and decreasing its toxicity while
   maintaining its functionality is vital. Conjugation of carriers with
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a common approach to decreasing toxicity
   and improving biodistribution; however, the effect of PEGylation on PEI
   transfection efficacy is contradictory at present. The aim of this work
   was to reveal the details of this dependence. Polymers were synthesized
   by grafting 2 kDa PEG to 25 kDa PEI at multiple ratios. Unlike typical
   investigations, parallel studies based on either total polymer weight or
   PEI-backbone weight were employed at the same time for accurate
   investigation into the specific effects of PEGylation. Polymers were
   assessed for toxicity and plasmid DNA (pDNA) binding, while polyplexes
   were formed at various polymer/pDNA weight ratios and monitored by
   dynamic light scattering (DLS) in the presence of serum. The efficacy of
   the polyplexes for pDNA delivery and transgene expression in HEK293
   cells was assessed by flow cytometry. This approach unexpectedly
   revealed that increased PEG substitution caused lower toxicity and
   pDNA-binding on a per total polymer weight basis, but not on a per
   PEI-backbone weight basis. DLS indicated that high PEGylation prevents
   an increase in polyplex size in the presence of serum. Plasmid uptake
   and transgene expression were found to have a complex relationship with
   PEG substitution, dependent on the polymer/plasmid-DNA weight ratio.
   PEGylation generally decreased the transfection efficacy of PEI, but
   under ideal conditions of PEG substitution and polymer/pDNA ratio,
   PEGylation provided more effective carrier formulations than the native
   PEI itself. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

   machine (LS-SVM) model based on online hyperparameters optimization is
   proposed, where the variance of effective noise of the sample is
   estimated, while a conjugate gradient algorithm is developed to optimize
   the width of Gaussian kernels and the regularization factor. To assess
   the quality of the proposed method, we experiment with a test function
   affected by additive noise and an industrial gas flow data from Shanghai
   Baosteel Company Ltd. A series of comparative experiments are reported
   as well. The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows the

Abstract = {{We propose an online, multiobjective optimization (MO) algorithm to
   efficiently schedule the nodes of a wireless sensor network (WSN) and to
   achieve maximum lifetime. Instead of dealing with traditional grid or
   uniform coverage, we focus on the differentiated or probabilistic
   coverage where different regions require different levels of sensing.
   The MO algorithm helps to attain a better tradeoff among energy
   consumption, lifetime, and coverage. The algorithm can be run every time
   a node failure occurs due to power failure of the node battery so that
   it may reschedule the network. This scheduling is modeled as a
   combinatorial, multiobjective, and constrained optimization problem with
   energy and noncoverage as the two objectives. The basic evolutionary
   multiobjective optimizer used is known as decomposition-based
   multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) which is modified by
   integrating the concept of fuzzy Pareto dominance. The performance of
   the resulting algorithm, which is called MOEA/DFD, is compared with the
   performance of the original MOEA/D, which is another very well known MO
   algorithm called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and
   an IBM optimization software package called CPLEX. In all the tests,
   MOEA/DFD is observed to outperform all other algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mechanisms of mitral valve regurgitation after
   atrioventricular septal defect repair are unclear.
   Methods: To gain further insight into mitral valve regurgitation,
   real-time three-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 53
   patients after atrioventricular septal defect repair (30 partial and 23
   complete) and 40 controls. Mitral valve \{x, y, z\} coordinates from the
   annulus, leaflet surface, papillary muscle, and chordal attachments were
   recorded. Vena contracta area of the regurgitant jet(s) and volume of
   leaflet prolapse and tethering were measured.
   Results: Twenty-three patients had mild (group 1) and 30 moderate (group
   2) mitral valve regurgitation. Patients in both groups 1 and 2 had more
   circular annuli than controls. Annular area was greater in group 2 than
   in group 1 and controls (P < .01). Group 2 had more frequent segmental
   prolapse in the superior-mural leaflet segment. The anterolateral
   papillary muscle was more laterally displaced in group 2 than in
   controls and group 1 at end-diastole (P = .01 and P = .05) and formed a
   more acute angle with the mitral valve annulus than in controls or group
   1 (P = .01).
   Conclusions: In patients with atrioventricular septal defects,
   significant mitral valve regurgitation is associated with leaflet
   prolapse, larger annular area, and lateral papillary muscle
   displacement. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2012;25:1231-44.)}},

Abstract = {{Scoliosis is a spinal deformity that affects millions of adolescents in
   the United States. Bracing is the most common non-surgical treatment
   method for scoliosis, but the biomechanics of such treatment is unclear.
   The objective of this study is to develop and validate a force logging
   system that can record forces at multiple locations inside a brace, as
   well as brace strap tension, and correlate these forces with different
   body positions. The force logging system can be used to investigate the
   biomechanics function of a brace to treat scoliosis during the treatment
   period.
   Two phases were completed in this study: design phase, involving custom
   development and calibration of strap tension transducers and
   modifications of in-brace force transducers; and validation phase,
   including preliminary testing on a subject with different postures.
   In-brace force load cell and tension transducer were tested and
   validated. Their sensitivities were 193.5 +/- 4.9 mV/N and 35.5 +/- 0.2
   mV/N, respectively, with both linear correlation coefficients were 0.99,
   reflecting high repeatability and linearity. Qualitative validation was
   also completed, allowing general relationships to be found between
   subject posture and force distribution. This study shows an excellent
   functionality and utility of the developed system. (C) 2011 IPEM.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we bring out the implications of a spatially varying
   magnetic field towards combined magnetohydrodynamic-magnetophoretic
   transport in narrow fluidic confinements. We first present a generic
   framework for describing the flow field that is generated under the
   combined influences of a driving pressure gradient, an axial electric
   field, and a spatially varying transverse magnetic field. As a
   demonstrative example, we derive analytical solutions for the flow
   field, based on a plausible choice of the mathematical form of the
   nature of spatial variation of the magnetic field. Proceeding further
   ahead, we also address the magnetophoretic motion of particles,
   subjected to such spatially varying magnetic fields. We depict the
   trajectories of representative spherical particles in the flow-field, as
   a combined consequence of the magnetohydrodynamic and magnetophoretic
   forcing mechanisms. We also demonstrate that such combined
   magnetophoretic and magnetohydrodynamic transport can be employed as a
   novel technique to separate particles based on sizes and electromagnetic
   properties.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},

Abstract = {{The slug flow characterized by large elongated bubbles also called
   Taylor bubbles is widely encountered in nuclear reactor steam
   generators, cooling plants, reboilers, etc. The analysis of slug flow is
   very important as the instability caused by such flows can affect the
   safety features of nuclear reactors and other two-phase flow equipments.
   In this paper, we study the motion of a Taylor bubble rising in stagnant
   fluids in a vertical oscillating pipe. The investigation is restricted
   to high Reynolds numbers and to an intermediate range of Bond numbers
   where the effects of surface tension can be considered. The Froude
   number ranged between 0.22 and 0.33. Firstly, detailed analysis of
   models proposed in the literature for the motion of a Taylor bubble in
   an unsteady acceleration field is realized. The velocity differential
   equation obtained in the case of potential and axisymmetric flow without
   surface tension given in the literature is first non-dimensionalized to
   highlight dimensionless numbers. Then, the instantaneous velocity of the
   bubble is numerically determined. Mean and fluctuating velocities as
   well as the phase shift ((U) over bar (b), U-f and phi) are estimated by
   using a technique based on the nonlinear least squares method. Results
   enable a discussion on the role played by dimensionless numbers on the
   dynamics of the bubble. It is found that the two parameters, the
   relative acceleration and the Bond number (a and Bo) have a governing
   role on the evolution of mean and fluctuating velocities while the ratio
   of the oscillation amplitude to the pipe diameter (b/D) has little
   influence when b/D > 10(-1). Further, the velocities (U) over bar (b)
   and (U) over bar (f) as well as the phase shift phi are experimentally
   investigated. Correlations allowing the prediction of mean and
   fluctuating velocities as well as the phase shift depending on the Bond
   number and relative acceleration are proposed. The correlations are
   found to be in good agreement with our experimental results obtained in
   a previous work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of artificial weathering on the wettability of three heat-treated
   North American wood species (jack pine, aspen, and birch) is studied
   from the point of view of the structural and chemical changes taking
   place on the wood surface. Weathering increases wettability of all three
   heat-treated woods by water. Changes in wettability during artificial
   weathering differ according to heat treatment procedure and wood species
   and are likely due to combination of structural and chemical changes of
   the surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis indicates that
   cracks form due to degradation taking place during weathering. As a
   result, water has easier entry into the cell wall, which consequently
   increases wettability. IR spectra suggest that the OH/CH2 ratio for
   heat-treated specimens is inversely proportional to the contact angle
   regardless of the type of wood species. The presence of cellulose-rich
   layer on wood surface and increasing amount of amorphous cellulose
   transformed from crystallized cellulose due to weathering result in
   increase in hydroxyl; consequently, it increases heat-treated wood
   wettability.}},

Abstract = {{In this research YSZ porous support and thin dense functional
   electrolyte layers are fabricated via a slip-casting method for fuel
   cell applications. The results show that calcination of YSZ starting
   powder is a crucial step in developing an effective porous structure
   having an interconnected void network for fuel cell applications. It is
   found that due to high surface area and high sinterability, as-received
   Tosoh YSZ powder is not a suitable candidate for production of
   interconnected porous structures even with the addition of pore former.
   Calcination at 13001500 degrees C coarsens the YSZ powder and leads to
   the growth of particles to 15100 mu m. However, subsequent ball milling
   of the calcined powder for 72 h reduces the particle size to 400800 nm
   (similar to 240 nm for uncalcined Tosoh YSZ) and increases the
   subsequent surface area, correlating with the temperature of
   calcination. With high-temperature calcination, it is possible to
   generate interconnected porous structures after sintering at
   temperatures lower than the calcination temperature. The bodies made of
   powder calcined at 1300 degrees C become dense following sintering at
   1350 degrees C, which makes this material suitable as a dense fuel cell
   electrolyte. Using calcined powders, a multiple slip-casting procedure
   enables a dense electrolyte to be coated directly on a highly porous
   support. With this simple and inexpensive technique, high-quality
   strongly adhered YSZ layers can be engineered.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapidly growing demand for monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based
   products, new technologies are urgently needed to increase mAb
   production while reducing manufacturing costs. To solve this problem, we
   report our research findings of using low-intensity pulsed ultrasound
   (LIPUS) to enhance mAb production. LIPUS with frequency of 1.5 MHz and
   pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz, as well as duty cycle of 20\%, was
   used to stimulate hybridoma cells to enhance the production of mAb,
   anti-CD4 (hybridoma GK1.5). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   results show a 60.42 +/- 7.63\% increase of mAb expression in hybridoma
   cells. The evidence of structural changes of the cellular outer membrane
   in both transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy images and the more than 20\% lactate dehydrogenase release
   indicates that the increased mAb production is related to the increased
   cell permeability induced by LIPUS. This value-added ultrasound
   technology provides a potential cost-effective solution for
   pharmaceutical companies to manufacture mAb-based drugs. The technology,
   in turn, can reduce the drug manufacturing costs and decrease health
   care spending. (E-mail: jzxing@ualberta.ca) (C) 2012 World Federation

Volume = {{98-99}},

Abstract = {{Heavy oil and bitumen recovery cost are excessive mainly due to high
   energy requirement to generate heat and its environmental impacts. Steam
   Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is an example of this case. The
   determination of optimal operating conditions, such as injection rates
   and well locations, based on reservoir and fluid characteristics is
   essential in the design of field applications.
   Many Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) optimization studies
   published in the literature combined numerical simulation with graphical
   or analytical techniques for design and performance evaluation. There
   have been limited efforts that integrated the simulation exercise with
   global optimization algorithms. Some studies focused on optimization of
   cumulative steam-to-oil ratio (cSOR) in SAGD by altering steam injection
   rates, while others focused on optimization of cumulative net
   energy-to-oil ratio (cEOR) in solvent-additive SAGD by altering
   injection pressures and fraction of solvent in the injection stream.
   Typical scoring functions were the net present value per hectare of land
   (NPV/ha) by controlling steam and solvent rates. Several studies also
   considered total project net present value calculation by changing total
   project area, capital cost intensities, solvent prices, discount rate,
   and risk factors to determine the well spacing and drilling schedule.
   Optimization techniques commonly used in those studies were scattered
   search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithm (GA). In continuation
   of these efforts, we focused on optimizing the SAGD process and its
   extension to solvent-additive SAGD and several optimization techniques
   including simulated annealing and genetic algorithm were tested and
   compared. Additional procedures were incorporated to improve the
   implementation configuration and initial population or seed. The
   objective function was defined to obtain the lowest cumulative steam-oil
   ratio (cSOR) and highest recovery factor. It was used later as a scoring
   function by changing solvent-to-steam ratio and steam injection rates.
   The results in this paper can be implemented directly in the efforts of
   minimization of cost and environmental impacts while accelerating the
   recovery in SAGD. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{231}},

Abstract = {{Understanding YSZ powder behaviour in different processing conditions
   such as calcination and subsequent milling is crucial in developing the
   dense and porous microstructures required for fuel cell applications. In
   this research, as received and calcined Tosoh YSZ (ZrO2 stabilised with
   8 mol\% Y2O3) was milled in water and characterised by SEM, TEM, XRD,
   light-scattering particle size. BET, zeta potential and acid-base
   titration. It is found that YSZ crystals and particles enlarge with
   increasing calcination temperature and as expected, shrink following
   milling. Calcination-milling leads to formation of particles with higher
   surface charge and shifts the isoelectric point (IEP) towards lower pH
   values. YSZ suspensions show a high viscosity and larger agglomerates at
   basic pHs which lead to significant porosity formation. This is despite
   the high zeta potential of the suspension and is attributed to increased
   hydrogen bonding which causes strong particle agglomeration. While
   acidic YSZ slips are suitable for slip casting, the basic YSZ slips are
   potential compositions for gel casting. Acid-base titration results
   indicate a direct relationship between powder surface area and the
   amount of acid/base used for pH adjustment. Crown Copyright (C) 2012

Pages = {{11801-11807}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a concept of feature space reduction, in
   which the reduction process is guided by a criterion of structure
   retention. In other words, the features forming the reduced space are
   selected in such a way that the original structure present in the highly
   dimensional space is retained in the reduced space to the highest
   possible extent. The quality of structure retention is quantified by
   means of the reconstruction criterion, which dwells on an idea of
   granulation and degranulation and quantifies an extent to which the
   information granules are capable of representing original patterns while
   being expressed by them. Fuzzy clustering (and Fuzzy C-Means, FCM, in
   particular) is used as an algorithmic vehicle of information
   granulation. The quality of information granules (and the granular
   structure, in general) is expressed by the reconstruction error. Given
   the combinatorial character of the selection process, the underlying
   optimization process is realized through the use of evolutionary
   optimization (Genetic Algorithms) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
   Experiments are provided. We show that, depending upon the specific data
   set, their structural content can be preserved even for a relatively
   significant reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper a new deconvolution method is presented for the detection
   of gear and bearing faults from vibration data. The proposed maximum
   correlated Kurtosis deconvolution method takes advantage of the periodic
   nature of the faults as well as the impulse-like vibration behaviour
   associated with most types of faults. The results are compared to the
   standard minimum entropy deconvolution method on both simulated and
   experimental data. The experimental data is from a gearbox with gear
   chip fault, and the results are compared between healthy and faulty
   vibrations. The results indicate that the proposed maximum correlated
   Kurtosis deconvolution method performs considerably better than the
   traditional minimum entropy deconvolution method, and often performs
   several times better at fault detection. In addition to this improved
   performance, deconvolution of separate fault periods is possible;
   allowing for concurrent fault detection. Finally, an online
   implementation is proposed and shown to perform well and be
   computationally achievable on a personal computer. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a threshold-system-based detector (TD) for
   detecting a known deterministic signal in independent non-Gaussian noise
   whose probability density function (pdf) is unknown but is symmetric and
   unimodal. The optimality of the proposed TD is proved under the
   assumptions of white noise, small signal, and a large number of samples.
   While previous TD designs need accurate information of the noise pdf,
   the proposed TD is independent of the noise pdf, and thus is robust to
   the noise pdf. The detection probability and the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) of the proposed TD are analyzed both theoretically
   and numerically. It is shown that even without knowing the noise pdf,
   the proposed TD has close performance to the optimal detector designed
   with the noise pdf information. It also performs significantly better
   than the matched filter (MF) when the noise pdf has heavy tails. The
   practical implementation, robustness to both the noise pdf and the
   signal, and region of validity of the proposed TD are also investigated.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{5672-5682}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{An overlap of the absorption spectrum of the hypochlorite ion (OCl-) and
   the ultraviolet (UV) end of the solar emission spectrum implies that
   solar photons can probably initiate the UV/chlorine advanced oxidation
   process (AOP). The application of this solar process to water and
   wastewater treatment has been investigated in this study. At the
   bench-scale, the OCl- photolysis quantum yield at 303 nm (representative
   of the lower end of the solar UV region) and at concentrations from 0 to
   4.23 mM was 0.87 +/- 0.01. Also the hydroxyl radical yield factor (for
   an OCl- concentration of 1.13 mM) was 0.70 +/- 0.02. Application of this
   process, at the bench-scale and under actual sunlight, led to methylene
   blue (MB) photobleaching and cyclohexanoic acid (CHA) photodegradation.
   For MB photobleaching, the OCl- concentration was the key factor causing
   an increase in the pseudo first-order rate constants. The MB
   photobleaching quantum yield was affected by the MB concentration, but
   not much by the OCl- concentration. For CHA photodegradation, an optimal
   OCl- concentration of 1.55 mM was obtained for a 0.23 mM CHA
   concentration, and a scavenger effect was observed when higher OCl-
   concentrations were applied. Quantum yields of 0.09 +/- 0.01 and 0.89
   +/- 0.06 were found for CHA photodegradation and OCl- photolysis,
   respectively. In addition, based on the Air Mass 1.5 reference solar
   spectrum and experimental quantum yields, a theoretical calculation
   method was developed to estimate the initial rate for photoreactions
   under sunlight. The theoretical initial rates agreed well with the
   experimental rates for both MB photobleaching and CHA photodegradation.

Abstract = {{A baffled high intensity agitation (BHIA) cell was used to generate
   submicron size bubbles of an average diameter around 500 nm by
   hydrodynamic cavitation. The generation of submicron size bubbles by
   BHIA cell was found to be largely dependent on the agitation speed of
   impellers. The duration of agitation and temperature showed only a
   marginal effect on generation of submicron size bubbles. Surface
   properties such as zeta-potential and stability of submicron size
   bubbles were found to be highly dependent on the chemistry of solutions
   in which the bubbles are generated. The presence of surfactant and
   frother in water was found to be beneficial for generating a larger
   number of submicron size bubbles that are more stable, having a life
   time of up to 24 h. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophobic modifications have emerged as a promising approach to
   improve the efficiency of non-viral gene delivery vectors (GDV).
   Functional GDVs from non-toxic polymers have been created with this
   approach but the mechanism(s) behind lipid-mediated enhancement in
   transfection remains to be clarified. Using a linoleic acid-substituted
   2 kDa polyethylenimine (PEI2LA), we aimed to define the cellular uptake
   pathways and intracellular trafficking of plasmid DNA in normal human
   foreskin fibroblast cells. Several pharmacological compounds were
   applied to selectively inhibit uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis
   (CME), caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and macropinocytosis. We
   found that PEI2LA complexes were taken up predominantly through CME, and
   to a lesser extent by CvME. In contrast, its precursor molecule. PEI2
   complexes was internalized primarily by CvME and macropinocytosis. The
   commonly used 25 kDa PEI 25 complexes utilized all endocytic pathways,
   suggesting its efficiency is derived from a different set of
   transfection pathways than PEI2LA. We further applied several endosome
   disruptive agents and found that hypertonic media enhanced the
   transfection of PEI2LA by 6.5-fold. We infer that lipid substitution
   changes the normal uptake pathways significantly and transfection with
   hydrophobically modified GDVs may be further enhanced by incorporating
   endosome disruptive elements into vector design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{With the recent significant advances in the field polymer chemistry, it
   is now possible to produce well-defined and non-toxic cationic polymers
   with advanced molecular structures of desired molecular weights and
   compositions. Carefully engineered polymer architectures are found to
   impact significantly their DNA condensation and gene delivery
   efficacies. In a previous study, the statistical carbohydrates based
   copolymers were found to show high gene expression and low toxicity,
   however there aggregation in the presence of serum proteins was a major
   drawback. In this study, carbohydrate and phosphorylcholine based
   cationic polymers having a different architecture, compositions and
   varying molecular weights are produced and are termed as cationic
   `block-statistical' copolymers. These cationic copolymers are evaluated
   for their gene delivery efficacies, interactions with serum protein,
   cellular uptake and nuclear localization ability. As compared to the
   statistical analogue, `block-statistical' copolymers showed high gene
   expression, low interactions with serum proteins, as well as low
   toxicity in hepatocytes and human dermal fibroblasts. In addition, 2-
   methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) based `block-statistical'
   copolymers and their sugar incorporated analogues were prepared and were
   found to serve as improved gene delivery vectors than their statistical

Abstract = {{Real-time digital simulation of electrical machines and drives is a
   cost-effective approach in evaluating the true behavior of newly
   designed machines and controllers before applying them in a real system.
   Although many studies exist regarding the optimized models of power
   electronic drives and digital controllers for real-time simulation, the
   real-time models of electrical machines are still limited to the lumped
   parameter electric circuit models. This is mainly due to the complexity
   of a detailed electrical machine model which makes it computationally
   expensive. This paper presents the modeling, real-time implementation,
   finite element analysis, and experimental validation of a nonlinear
   geometrical permeance network based induction machine model. A nonlinear
   permeance network model (PNM) is developed for the real-time simulation
   of a 3-hp squirrel cage induction machine with closed rotor slots.
   Several studies both under open-loop and closed-loop control conditions
   are conducted, and the results obtained from the offline and real-time
   simulations and the experiment are compared with each other to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed PNM model.}},

Abstract = {{Cold gas dynamic spraying at low pressure (1 MPa gage or 150 psig) was
   used to fabricate Al-Al2O3 metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings onto
   6061 Al alloy. The powder contained Al powder admixed with -10 mu m
   Al2O3 in fractions up to 90 wt.\%. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   Vickers microhardness testing, and image analysis were conducted to
   determine the microstructure, properties, and volume fraction of
   reinforcing particles in the coatings. The coatings were then
   friction-stir processed (FSP) at tool rotation speeds of 894 or 1723 RPM
   using a flat cylindrical tool. The Al2O3 content and hardness of the
   final MMC coatings increased with increasing fractions of Al2O3
   particles in the feedstock powder, resulting in a maximum Al2O3 content
   of 48 wt.\% and a hardness of 85 HV of the as-sprayed coating when 90
   wt.\% Al2O3 was used in the feed powder blend. After FSP, the hardness
   of the MMC increased to a maximum of 137 HV. The as-sprayed coatings
   contained Al2O3 particles that were segregated between the Al particles,
   and FSP was effective in dispersing these Al2O3 particles and decreasing
   their mean free path. It was suggested that this re-distribution and
   Al2O3 particle size refinement during FSP improved the hardness of the
   MMC coatings. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this theoretical research work, the fracture characteristics of

   three-dimensional representative volume element-based multiscale model
   was developed in a finite element environment. Graphene sheets were

   a continuum. Van der Waals interactions between the matrix and graphene
   sheets were simulated employing truss elements. Fracture characteristics
   of graphene/polymer nanocomposites were investigated in conjunction with
   the virtual crack closure technique. The results demonstrate that
   fracture characteristics in terms of the strain energy release rate were
   affected for a crack lying in a polymer reinforced with graphene. A
   shielding effect from the crack driving forces is considered to be the
   reason for enhanced fracture resistance in graphene-modified polymer

Abstract = {{Mixtures of asphaltene + polystyrene + toluene were recently shown to
   separate into asphaltene-rich and polystyrene-rich liquid phases over a
   broad range of global compositions at 293 K and atmospheric pressure,
   for polystyrene mean molar masses of M-w = 393,400 and M-w = 700,000
   g/mol. In this work, a model based on the lever rule is used to estimate
   the binodal curves and the critical points. Measured speed of sound
   values were compared with values calculated from estimated compositions
   and speed of sound mixing rules. Large deviations were obtained but the
   introduction of a parameter gamma, interpreted as the fraction of
   asphaltenes causing phase separation, improved the agreement between
   experimental and calculated speeds of sound in the coexisting phases.
   The best agreement was obtained for gamma = 0.63 and 0.49 for
   polystyrene molar masses M-w = 393,400 and M-w = 700,000 g/mol,
   respectively. A model for the depletion flocculation mechanism for
   mixtures of solvent (toluene), monodispersed colloidal particles and a
   non-adsorbing polymer (polystyrene) was used to calculate critical loci
   for cases of theta and good solvents. The mean radii of asphaltene
   particles active in the phase separation was estimated to fall in the
   6-11 nm range. Exogenous SAXS measurements for related asphaltene +
   aromatic solvent binary mixtures place 1/3-2/3 of asphaltene particles
   in this nominal size range. The need for coordinated phase equilibrium
   and asphaltene particle size measurements is underscored. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Anisotropic properties of columnar nanoporous thin films were utilized
   to design and fabricate interference mirrors with lossless
   omnidirectional reflection in the visible spectral range. Index graded
   columnar films with distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), sinusoidal, and
   Gaussian refractive index profiles were studied using finite-difference
   frequency-domain and finite-difference time-domain methods, with an
   emphasis on maximizing the omnidirectional reflection bandwidth.
   Titanium dioxide columnar films with sixteen period sinusoidal
   refractive index profile were fabricated using the glancing angle
   deposition technique and characterized by angle resolved transmittance
   measurements. Simulations and experimental measurements have shown the
   presence of the omnidirectional reflection band up to 5\% wide for a
   film with a maximum refractive index n(max) = 2.3 and refractive index
   contrast Delta n = 0.8. Simulations further showed that with the optimal
   choice of the refractive index variation range, the omnidirectional
   reflection band can reach 10.5\% width in TiO2 films with a sinusoidal
   index profile, 14.5\% with a DBR index profile, and 12\% with a Gaussian
   profile. Due to the optical anisotropy of the columnar films, the
   reflection bandwidth exceeded the corresponding value, observed in
   isotropic analogs, by a factor of three to four depending on the choice
   of the refractive index profile. {[}http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4759138]}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{434-446}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{High risk behaviors such as narcotic use or physical fighting can be
   caused by impulsive decision making in emotionally-charged situations.
   Improved neuroscientific understanding of how emotional context
   interacts with the control of impulsive behaviors may lead to advances
   in public policy and/or treatment approaches for high risk groups,
   including some high-risk adolescents or adults with poor impulse
   control. Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is an important contributor to
   response inhibition (behavioral impulse control). IFG also has a role in
   processing emotional stimuli and regulating emotional responses. The
   mechanism(s) whereby response inhibition processes interact with emotion
   processing in IFG are poorly understood. We used 4.7 T fMRI in 20
   healthy young adults performing a rapid event-related emotional Go/NoGo
   task. This task combined the Go/NoGo task, which is a classic means of
   recruiting response inhibition processes, with emotionally neutral and
   aversive distractor images. In IFG, both response inhibition in an
   emotionally neutral context (neutral NoGo trials) and aversive emotional
   picture processing (aversive Go trials) evoked activation greater than
   the simple response baseline (neutral Go trials). These results are
   consistent with the literature. Activation for response inhibition in
   aversive contexts (aversive NoGo-neutral Go trials) was approximately
   the sum of response inhibition activation (neutral NoGo-neutral Go) and
   aversive emotional distractor activation (aversive Go-neutral Go). We
   conclude that response inhibition and aversive emotional stimulus
   processing activities combine additively (linearly) in IFG, rather than
   interfering with each other (sub-linearly) or mutually-enhancing each
   other (super-linearly). We also found previously undocumented
   interaction effects between response inhibition (NoGo vs. Go) and
   emotional context (aversive vs. neutral distractor pictures) in
   bilateral posterior middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus, right
   frontal eye field, and other brain regions. These results may reflect
   the interaction of attention processes driven by emotional stimuli with
   conflict resolution processes related to Go/NoGo performance. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The high sequence diversity and heterogeneity observed within species or
   genotypes of Cryptosporidium requires phylogenetic approaches for the
   identification of novel sequences obtained from the environment. A
   long-term study on Cryptosporidium in the agriculturally-intensive South
   Nation River watershed in Ontario, Canada was undertaken, in which 60
   sequence types were detected. Of these sequence types 33 were considered
   novel with no identical matches in GenBank. Detailed phylogenetic
   analysis identified that most sequences belonged to 17 previously
   described species: Cryptosporidium andersoni, Cryptosporidium baileyi,
   Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium paruum, Cryptosporidium
   ubiquitum, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, muskrat I, muskrat II, deer
   mouse II, fox, vole, skunk, shrew, W12, W18, W19 and W25 genotypes. In
   addition, two new genotypes were identified, W27 and W28. C. andersoni
   and the muskrat II genotype were most frequently detected in the water
   samples. Species associated with livestock made up 39\% of the total
   molecular detections, while wildlife associated species and genotypes
   accounted for 55\% of the Cryptosporidium identified. The human
   pathogenic species C. hominis and C. parvum had an overall prevalence of
   1.6\% in the environment, indicating a small risk to humans from the
   Cryptosporidium present in the watershed. Phylogenetic analysis and
   knowledge of host parasite relationships are fundamental in using
   Cryptosporidium as a source-tracking or human health risk assessment
   tool. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Microcrack volumes in 87 granite-cored samples, obtained in the depth
   range from ground surface to 1000 m at Pinawa, Canada and Forsmark,
   Sweden, were quantified from stress-strain curves to assess the increase
   in microcrack volume with depth. Digital image analysis of 9 of these
   samples was used to examine the characteristics of these microcracks.
   The results indicate that at depths of less than 200 m, the dominant
   mode of microcracks can be classed as naturally occurring. The volume of
   stress-induced microcracks was found to increase linearly with sampling
   depth with the proportion of grain-boundary, intragranular and
   transgranular microcracks remaining relatively constant regardless of
   the depth. However, when the mean in-situ stress magnitudes normalized
   by the laboratory tensile strength was higher than 4, the proportion of
   intragranular and transgranular microcracks increased significantly for
   Lac du Bonnet granite. Moreover it was observed that most of the
   stress-induced transgranular microcracks formed in a plane perpendicular
   to the core axis. Thus the ratio horizontal to axial transgranular
   microcrack could be an indicator of the degree of stress-induced core
   damage. These stress-induced microcracks were responsible for the
   non-linear stress-strain behavior observed in the initial loading stage
   in laboratory tests. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   a major concern that may restrict the wide applications of these
   bio-inspired surfaces. Research on how geckos detach rapidly has
   inspired the design of novel adhesive surfaces with strong and
   reversible adhesion capabilities, which relies on further fundamental
   understanding of the peeling mechanisms. Recent studies showed that the
   peel-zone plays an important role in the peeling off of adhesive tapes
   or fibrillar surfaces. In this study, a numerical method was developed
   to evaluate peel-zone deformation and the resulting mechanical behaviour
   due to the deformations of fibrillar surfaces detaching from a smooth
   rigid substrate. The effect of the geometrical parameters of pillars and
   the stiffness of backing layer on the peel-zone and peel strength, and
   the strong attachment and easy-removal properties have been analysed to
   establish a design map for bio-inspired fibrillar surfaces, which shows
   that the optimized strong attachment and easy-removal properties can
   vary by over three orders of magnitude. The adhesion and peeling design
   map established provides new insights into the design and development of
   novel gecko-inspired fibrillar surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{XPS, adsorption density and ToF-SIMS measurements were performed on
   pyrochlore and calcite treated with octyl hydroxamic acid (OHA). XPS
   results indicated a slight shift of the binding energies of the Ca 2p
   electrons (0.19 eV) on calcite after OHA treatment but the N 1s binding
   energy spectrum of OHA did not change, showing a physical adsorption
   mechanism. On OHA-treated pyrochlore, the binding energies of both Nb 3d
   and Ca 2p electrons shifted (0.24 and 0.35 eV, respectively), and the N
   1s electron binding energy peak of OHA split from 400.3 eV to 400.7 and
   398.5 eV, representing the neutral R-NH-OH and the ionized R-NH-O-
   groups. The ratio of the integrated areas of the 400.7 eV peak to the
   398.5 eV peak was 3.8 to 1. Therefore OHA possibly adsorbed on
   pyrochlore by both physisorption and chemisorption, with the number of
   OHA molecules involved in the adsorption at 3.8 to 1. The adsorption
   isotherm of OHA on pyrochlore showed two plateaus, with the first
   plateau corresponding to a vertically oriented monolayer of OHA. The
   second plateau was 4 times higher than the first plateau. Therefore, the
   adsorption isotherm was consistent with XPS results, in that the
   vertically oriented monolayer (first plateau) formed the chemisorbed
   layer, and the second plateau contained mostly physisorbed OHA. The
   adsorption isotherm of OHA on calcite showed a lower plateau which
   corresponded to horizontally oriented OHA. ToF-SIMS positive ion images
   on OHA treated mixtures of pyrochlore and calcite confirmed that OHA
   preferentially adsorbed on pyrochlore. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The large volume of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) produced by
   the oil sands industry in Northern Alberta, Canada, is an environmental
   concern. The toxicity of OSPW has been attributed to a complex mixture
   of naturally occurring acids, including naphthenic acids (NAs). Highly
   cyclic or branched NAs are highly biopersistent in tailings ponds, thus
   understanding structure-reactivity relationship for NAs is very
   important for OSPW reclamation. In this study, we hypothesized that
   large, branched and cyclic NAs may be better oxidized in the UV/H2O2
   process than small, linear and acyclic NAs. Relative rate measurements
   using binary mixtures of model NA compounds confirmed that reactivity
   favored compounds with more carbons, and also favored NAs with one
   saturated ring, relative to the corresponding linear NA. However, for
   model compound with three rings, no increased reactivity was observed
   relative to monocyclic NA. UV/H2O2 treatment of OSPW confirmed our
   findings with model compounds, indicating that the compounds with more
   carbons are favored for degradation. However, increasing the number of
   rings (or double bond equivalents) in OSPW NAs did not show any clear
   structure reactivity. Microbial degradation studies of the UV/H2O2
   treated OSPW should be conducted to examine the overall benefit of this
   treatment for the real applications.}},

Abstract = {{Caprock integrity evaluation is critical to successful thermal recovery
   processes in oil sands. It is noted that continuous high pressure steam
   injection triggers drastic drop of effective stress of formations.
   Coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulations have become a key part for
   caprock integrity assessments. This study demonstrates the use of this
   method for caprock stability analysis to estimate the maximum
   sustainable injection pressure during geological sequestration of
   high-pressure steam. The simulation is divided into two major steps: the
   first one is CMG for multi-phase flow and then FLAC is adopted for
   stress analysis. The coupling reservoir-geomechanical simulation is
   established, where pressure and temperature from a thermal reservoir
   simulation are transferred to a geomechanical simulator with no feedback
   to iteratively coupled with thermal reservoir simulation results.
   Based on obtained stress results and Mohr Coulomb strength criteria, two
   caprock failure mechanisms are discussed and the concept of point safety
   factor for the caprock is given. From the results, it is illustrated
   that caprock becomes more and more frangible with the evolution of steam
   chamber and model mechanical properties have great influence on the
   planar shear failure. We conclude that a linked CMG-FLAC simulator can
   give comprehensive estimation for the space-time evolution of both in
   situ stresses and fluid pressure and therefore results in more accurate
   assessment of the maximum sustainable steam injection pressure, which is
   helpful for the development of oil sands.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted investigating submerged hydraulic
   jumps with baffle blocks. An extensive series of tests were completed
   that covered a range of Froude numbers, submergence factors, and block
   arrangements. Dimensional analysis was used to interpret the results and
   study the effect of each parameter. Two flow regimes, the deflected
   surface jet (DSJ) and reattaching wall jet (RWJ), were observed. The
   occurrence of a particular regime depends on the block shape and
   location as well as the Froude number and submergence factor. The DSJ
   regime was found to dissipate more energy due to the formation of the
   deflected jet and its impingement on the water surface. The DSJ regime
   is almost as efficient in dissipating energy as the free hydraulic jump.
   This flow regime also had a smaller reverse flow region compared to the
   RWJ regime. Empirical equations were derived for predicting the critical
   values of the submergence factor at which each flow regime forms. The
   efficiency of the submerged hydraulic jump with blocks in dissipating
   energy was compared with that of free without blocks as a function of
   submergence factor. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000587. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this article, we report a new method a sonication method to disperse
   iron oxide nanoparticles into smaller nanoparticles and make gold ions
   absorb onto the surface or trapped in the micropores of the iron oxide
   nanoparticles using sonication action. By using quick reduction of
   ascorbic acid and post-HCI solution treatment, gold covered magnetic
   nanoparticles (mGNPs) with spherical morphology and uniform size were
   synthesized in a water solution. The size of the mGNPs was found to be
   20-30 nm. Some ideal mGNPs possessed a core shell structure. The mGNPs
   were non-cytotoxic and mGNP-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) can enter
   KG-1 cells when driven by an external magnetic force, which was
   confirmed by confocal imaging. The confocal image also showed the FITC
   inside the KG-1 cells was near the nucleus. The fluorescein
   isothiocyanate (FITC) delivery efficiency is about 100\% according to
   the flow cytometry results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, three flotation approaches, bulk flotation followed by
   separation, selective Cu flotation followed by bulk flotation and then
   separation, and preferential Mo flotation followed by Cu flotation, were
   investigated to concentrate molybdenite from Dexing (Jiangxi Province,
   China) porphyry Cu-Mo ores. The bench-scale flotation results
   demonstrated that compared to other two flotation approaches, the
   preferential Mo flotation approach using a new non-thiol collector
   obtained a high recovery of molybdenite in a molybdenum circuit, while
   the tailing of molybdenum circuit was treated by a copper flotation
   circuit to obtain a high recovery of other co-present metal values. The
   industrial flotation tests indicated that compared to the bulk flotation
   approach, the preferential Mo flotation approach achieved an excellent
   cleaner concentrate containing 0.655\% Mo with 88.49\% Mo recovery, and
   increased Mo recovery and grade over 34.0\% and 0.4\% in the molybdenum
   circuit, respectively. For being uncontaminated with thiol collectors,
   this cleaner concentrate was readily treated to perform the Mo/Cu
   flotation separation which returned a superior Mo concentrate containing
   48.83\% Mo with 90.60\% Mo operation recovery as well as saved about 1/2
   Na2S consumption. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous reviews have been found related to individual studies on coal
   gasification (CG) and biomass gasification (BC). However, this review
   deals mainly with the CO-gasification (COG) of numerous types of coal
   and biomass and then compares their results with those obtained using
   coal and biomass gasification in detail. There are several process
   parameters which have a direct effect on the gasification process and
   among them temperature is the most significant one. In this paper, the
   production of H-2, CO2, CO, CH4, and other hydrocarbons in CG. BC and
   COG with the variation of temperature is reviewed in detail. As it
   mainly influences the gaseous products and their characteristic
   behaviour, this review takes into account the effect of temperature on
   various other parameters such as carbon conversion, gas yield, calorific
   value, cold gas efficiency as well as tar and char contents in various
   kinds of coals, biomasses and their mixtures under catalytic or
   non-catalytic conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of SiO2 nanostructured thin films grown by glancing angle
   deposition (GLAD) on the sensitivity of Love-wave surface acoustic wave
   (SAW) sensors was investigated for the first time. High-surface area,
   vertical post nanostructures of varying thicknesses were grown at an
   angle of 70 degrees relative to the substrate normal on top of the
   Love-wave devices. The SAW devices, operating at similar to 120 MHz,
   were placed in an oscillator circuit and the frequency was monitored as
   a function of relative humidity (RH) in the range of 0-90\%RH at room
   temperature. The effect of GLAD film thickness on sensitivity was also
   examined. The sensitivity increased exponentially with film thickness,
   and all devices with GLAD films exhibited higher sensitivities than any
   of the devices without. The device with the highest sensitivity had a
   705 nm thick film and showed a minimum sensitivity of 125 ppm/\%RH. (C)

Abstract = {{With growing interest in nanostructured thin films produced by glancing
   angle deposition (GLAD), it becomes increasingly important to understand
   their overall growth mechanics and nanocolumn structure. We present a
   new method of isolating the individual nanocolumns of GLAD films,
   facilitating automated measurement of their broadening profiles. Data
   collected for alpha = 81 degrees TiO2 vertical nanocolumns deposited
   across a range of substrate rotation rates demonstrates that these rates
   influence growth scaling parameters. Further, individual posts were
   found in each case that violate predicted Kardar-Parisi-Zhang growth
   scaling limits. The technique's current iteration is comparable to
   existing techniques in speed: though data were studied from 10,756
   individual objects, the majority could not be confidently used in
   subsequent analysis. Further refinement may allow high-throughput
   automated film characterization and permit close examination of subtle
   growth trends, potentially enhancing control over GLAD film broadening
   and morphology.}},

   surfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Experiments to understand the effect of surface wettability on impact
   characteristics of water drops onto solid dry surfaces were conducted.
   Various surfaces were used to cover a wide range of contact angles
   (advancing contact angle from 48 degrees to 166 degrees, and contact
   angle hysteresis from 5 degrees to 56 degrees). Several different impact
   conditions were analyzed (12 impact velocities on 9 different surfaces,
   among which 2 were superhydrophobic). Results from impact tests with
   millimetric drops show that two different regimes can be identified: a
   moderate Weber number regime (30 < We < 200), in which wettability
   affects both drop maximum spreading and spreading characteristic time;
   and a high Weber number regime (We > 200), in which wettability effect
   is secondary, because capillary forces are overcome by inertial effects.
   In particular, results show the role of advancing contact angle and
   contact angle hysteresis as fundamental wetting parameters to allow
   understanding of different phases of drop spreading and beginning of
   recoiling. It is also shown that drop spreading on hydrophilic and
   superhydrophobic surfaces occurs with different time scales. Finally, if
   the surface is superhydrophobic, eventual impalement, i.e., transition
   from Cassie to Wenzel wetting state, which might occur in the vicinity
   of the drop impact area, does not influence drop maximum spreading. (C)

Abstract = {{The concept of relay transmission is applied to land mobile satellite
   (LMS) communication, where a terrestrial relay node facilitates
   communication from the satellite to the mobile unit. A novel
   amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay
   system is proposed where the source, the relay, and the destination are
   all equipped with multiple antennas. The maximal ratio transmission
   (MRT)-selection combining (SC) diversity technique is used for the first
   hop and maximal ratio combining (MRC) is used for the second hop. We
   analyze the outage probability, the average symbol error rate (SER), and
   the ergodic capacity, for which accurate closed-form approximations are
   derived by considering the generalized correlated source-to-relay
   channel and arbitrary-correlated relay-to-destination channel. The
   system is also analyzed for an equally correlated source-to-relay
   channel, which is the special case of generalized correlation, by
   deriving exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability and
   average SER and highly accurate closed-form analytical approximation for
   the ergodic capacity. From high SNR asymptotic analysis, we show that
   the system achieves full diversity order. The impact of multiple
   antennas and their correlation on the performance are assessed via
   several examples.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider physical-layer network coding (PNC) in a
   multi-unicast wireless cooperative network with a single relay. We aim
   to deal with the NC noise, i.e., an additional noise term due to
   applying NC, with the objective of improving the network data rate. Our
   approaches are based on relay power-allocation and group-allocation
   techniques. To this end, we provide a mathematical framework for the
   achievable information rate of the system with the notion of power
   assignment at the relay. Based on this framework, we present a novel
   power-allocation scheme to maximize the total information rate among all
   the source-destination communication sessions in the network. Further,
   we provide a closed-form solution for the two-unicast case. Simulation
   results show that the proposed relay power allocation can significantly
   help alleviate the adverse effects of NC noise. Next, we propose a
   group-allocation scheme to assign sessions to different groups for
   performing PNC at the relay. We combine power allocation and group
   allocation to further improve performance. The formulated joint
   optimization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, a suboptimal heuristic
   algorithm is proposed and implemented at the relay to solve this
   problem. From the simulation results, the proposed joint group
   assignment and power-allocation scheme achieves up to 64\% overall data
   rate gain for the multi-unicast system compared with a single-group
   system with no relay power assignment. This observation shows that PNC
   can be efficiently harnessed in a multi-unicast cooperative network by
   exploiting proposed approaches.}},

Title = {{Optimizing the Periodic Inspection Interval for a 1-out-of-2 Cold
   Standby System Using the Delay-Time Concept}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we deal with a 1-out-of-2 system with a cold-standby
   component. The failure process of these two components is statistically
   identical and characterized by the delay-time concept, which divides the
   component's life into a two-stage process with a normal stage from new
   to a defect initiation point and a following failure delay stage from
   this point to failure. A fixed interval periodic inspection is carried
   out to check whether the working component is defective or not. If a
   defect is identified, the working component is shut down and sent to be
   repaired. The repair shop capacity is limited for repairing one
   component only. If the repair shop is occupied by the standby component
   (under repair) when the working one is failed, the system is shut down.
   There are five scenarios of the state of the system at an inspection
   epoch, which are derived analytically. The expected total cost per unit
   time of the system consists of the expected cost caused by preventive
   repair, unplanned failure repair, and system downtime. In this article,
   these three costs are determined and the optimal inspection interval
   with respect to the minimum of the expected total cost per unit time is
   found. To incorporate a nonexponential distribution for the normal time,
   delay stages, and repair time of the components, the elapsed time in the
   normal time, delay stages, and repair time at inspection is taken into
   consideration. A stationary distribution of the elapsed time exists, and
   it is calculated by an iteration method. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Yield of coke in thermal cracking of Athabasca vacuum residue in a
   continuous flow aerosol reactor was minimized by atomization of the feed
   into submicrometer droplets, which enhanced the vaporization and
   conversion of the heavy liquid phase with boiling point above 524
   degrees C. The reaction temperature ranged from 700 to 800 degrees C,
   and the pressure was atmospheric. The residence time varied from 100 to
   115 ms. The yield of coke was found to be insensitive to conversion,
   with an average value of 6.3 wt \%. The average size of the coke
   particles in the product was less than 190 nm. Alkenes were the dominant
   components among the gas products, with total yield of ethene and
   propene ranging from 5 to 18 wt \% with conversion. The molar ratio of
   hydrogen to carbon decreased monotonically with conversion from 1.4 for
   unconverted feed to 0.98 at 78\% conversion, consistent with high yields

Abstract = {{This brief presents a novel technique for bandwidth enhancement of
   on-chip transformers using the negative capacitance (NCAP) circuit.
   Since the coupling capacitance between the primary and secondary
   windings of an on-chip transformer limits its operating bandwidth,
   floating NCAP is added to compensate for the effect of the coupling
   capacitance on the transformer's performance. Fabricated in a 0.13-mu m
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, the 4:4 on-chip
   transformer with NCAP exhibits a wideband frequency response with 1.6 dB
   added gain compared with the transformer without NCAP. In addition, the
   input and output return losses (S-11 and S-22) values are well below -10
   dB over the bandwidth for the transformer with NCAP.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{90-97}},

Abstract = {{The performance of multiple quantum filters (MQFs) can be disappointing
   when the background signal also arises from coupled spins. Moreover, at
   3.0 T and even higher fields the majority of the spin systems of key
   brain metabolites fall into the strong-coupling regime. In this
   manuscript we address comprehensively, the importance of the phase of
   the multiple quantum coherence-generating pulse (MQ-pulse) in the design
   of MQFs, using both product operator and numerical analysis, in both
   zero and double quantum filter designs. The theoretical analyses were
   experimentally validated with the examples of myo-inositol editing and
   the separation of glutamate from glutamine. The results demonstrate that
   the phase of the MQ-pulse per se provides an additional spectral
   discrimination mechanism based on the degree of coupling beyond the
   conventional level-of-coherence approach of MQFs. To obtain the best
   spectral discrimination of strongly-coupled spin systems, therefore, the
   phase of the MQ-pulse must be included in the portfolio of the sequence
   parameters to be optimized. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   observations reveal that Pb impurity can enter anodic film, which
   results in substantial changes in the films structure via hindering the
   dehydration during the passivation and retarding the formation of spinel
   oxides. The presence of Pb-contamination can also increase hydrogen

Journal = {{NUCLEAR FUSION}},

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The nuclear fusion cross-section is modified when the spins of the
   interacting nuclei are polarized. In the case of deuterium-tritium it
   has been theoretically predicted that the nuclear fusion cross-section
   could be increased by a factor delta = 1.5 if all the nuclei were
   polarized. In inertial confinement fusion this would result in a
   modification of the required ignition conditions. Using numerical
   simulations it is found that the required hot-spot temperature and areal
   density can both be reduced by about 15\% for a fully polarized nuclear
   fuel. Moreover, numerical simulations of a directly driven capsule show
   that the required laser power and energy to achieve a high gain scale as
   delta(-0.6) and delta(-0.4) respectively, while the maximum achievable
   energy gain scales as delta(0.9).}},

Abstract = {{As an alternative to solvent addition to the steam-assisted gravity
   drainage process for bitumen recovery, coinjection of biodiesel with
   steam as a surfactant additive to reduce bitumen-water interfacial
   tension was considered. The density and viscosity of bitumen and
   bitumen-pentane mixtures up to 15 \% pentane concentrations by mass were
   measured at a 1 MPa pressure and up to 448 K temperature. The
   interfacial tension between bitumen, bitumen-pentane mixtures up to 15
   \% pentane concentrations, bitumen-biodiesel mixtures up to 0.3 \% and
   water, and process water was also measured at a 1 MPa pressure and up to
   423 K temperature. Laboratory tests showed that the density of
   bitumen-pentane mixtures decreased linearly with an increase in pentane
   content, and their viscosity decreased exponentially with the increase
   in temperature. A decrease in bitumen viscosity with an increase in
   pentane content was dramatic at low temperatures and became less
   sensitive at temperatures above 373 K. Interfacial tension measurements
   suggest that asphaltic acids naturally occurring in bitumen act as
   surfactants. The decay in interfacial tension with time is attributed to
   the diffusion of surfactant species in a bitumen droplet. The increase
   in interfacial tension of bitumen-pentane mixtures and water with an
   increase in pentane content and temperature needs further attention
   because of its commercial application.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the problem of distributed opportunistic channel access
   in wireless relaying is investigated. A relay network with multiple
   source-destination pairs and multiple relays is considered. All source
   nodes contend through a random access procedure. A winner source may
   give up its transmission opportunity if its link quality is poor. In
   this research, we apply the optimal stopping theory to analyze when a
   winner source should give up its transmission opportunity. By assuming
   the winner source has channel state information (CSI) of links from
   itself to relays and from relays to its destination, the existence of an
   optimal stopping strategy is rigorously proved. The optimal stopping
   strategy has a pure-threshold structure. The case when a winner source
   does not have CSI of links from relays to its destination is also
   studied. Two stopping problems exist, one in the main layer (for channel
   access of sources), and the other in the sub-layer (for channel access
   of relays). An intuitive stopping strategy, where the main layer (for
   the first hop) and sub-layer (for the second hop) maximize their
   throughput respectively, is derived. The intuitive stopping strategy is
   shown to be non-optimal. An optimal stopping strategy is then derived
   theoretically. In either the intuitive stopping strategy or the optimal
   stopping strategy, the main-layer stopping rule has a pure-threshold
   structure, while the sub-layer stopping rule has a threshold determined
   by the channel realization in the preceding first-hop transmission. Our
   research reveals that multi-user (including multi-source and
   multi-relay) diversity and time diversity can be utilized in a relay
   network by our proposed strategies. The effectiveness of the strategies
   is validated by numerical and simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution addresses the development of a linear quadratic (LQ)
   regulator in order to control the concentration profiles along a
   catalytic distillation column, which is modelled by a set of coupled
   hyperbolic partial differential and algebraic equations (PDAEs). The
   proposed method is based on an infinite-dimensional state-space
   representation of the PDAE system which is generated by a transport
   operator. The presence of the algebraic equations, makes the velocity
   matrix in the transport operator, spatially varying, non-diagonal, and
   not necessarily negative through of the domain. The optimal control
   problem is treated using operator Riccati equation (ORE) approach. The
   existence and uniqueness of the non-negative solution to the ORE are
   shown and the ORE is converted into a matrix Riccati differential
   equation which allows the use of a numerical scheme to solve the control
   problem. The result is then extended to design an optimal proportional
   plus integral controller which can reject the effect of load losses. The
   performance of the designed control policy is assessed through a
   numerical study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite numerous studies on modeling and detection of static friction

   limited. In this work, a stiction compensation framework is proposed
   which is based on the oscillation condition introduced in {[}17]. This
   condition was used as a tool to predict occurrence and severity of
   stiction-induced oscillations in control systems. The aim of this paper
   is to suggest re-tuning guidelines for controllers with regard to the
   presence of stiction in the control valve, to eliminate or reduce
   oscillations. A variety of processes and controllers are studied and
   recommendations are made in order to eliminate the stiction-induced
   oscillations. For oscillations that cannot be removed, the proposed
   method will reduce the frequency and magnitude of oscillations. This
   compensation framework has also been validated using two different
   pilot-scale experiments with different types of processes and an
   industrial control system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Strength Cond Res 26(10): 2820-2828, 2012-Resistance training is used to
   develop muscular strength and hypertrophy. Large muscle forces, in
   relation to the muscle's maximum force-generating ability, are required
   to elicit these adaptations. Previous biomechanical analyses of
   multi-joint resistance exercises provide estimates of muscle force but
   not relative muscular effort (RME). The purpose of this investigation
   was to determine the RME during the squat exercise. Specifically, the
   effects of barbell load and squat depth on hip extensor, knee extensor,
   and ankle plantar flexor RME were examined. Ten strength-trained women
   performed squats (50-90\% 1 repetition maximum) in a motion analysis
   laboratory to determine hip extensor, knee extensor, and ankle plantar
   flexor net joint moment (NJM). Maximum isometric strength in relation to
   joint angle for these muscle groups was also determined. Relative
   muscular effect was determined as the ratio of NJM to maximum voluntary
   torque matched for joint angle. Barbell load and squat depth had
   significant interaction effects on hip extensor, knee extensor, and
   ankle plantar flexor RME (p < 0.05). Knee extensor RME increased with
   greater squat depth but not barbell load, whereas the opposite was found
   for the ankle plantar flexors. Both greater squat depth and barbell load
   increased hip extensor RME. These data suggest that training for the
   knee extensors can be performed with low relative intensities but
   require a deep squat depth. Heavier barbell loads are required to train
   the hip extensors and ankle plantar flexors. In designing resistance
   training programs with multi-joint exercises, how external factors
   influence RME of different muscle groups should be considered to meet
   training objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The mutation rate in cells induced by environmental genotoxic hazards is
   very low and difficult to detect using traditional cell counting assays.
   The established genetic toxicity tests currently recognized by
   regulatory authorities, such as conventional Ames and hypoxanthine
   guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) assays, are not well suited
   for higher-throughput screening as they require large amounts of test
   compounds and are very time consuming. In this study, we developed a
   novel cell-based assay for quantitative analysis of low numbers of cell
   copies with HPRT mutation induced by an environmental mutagen. The HPRT
   gene mutant cells induced by the mutagen were selected by 6-thioguanine
   (6-TG) and the cell's kinetic growth curve monitored by a real-time cell
   electronic sensor (RT-CES) system. When a threshold is set at a certain
   cell index (CI) level, samples with different initial mutant cell copies
   take different amounts of time in order for their growth (or CI
   accumulation) to cross this threshold. The more cells that are initially
   seeded in the test well, the faster the cell accumulation and therefore
   the shorter the time required to cross this threshold. Therefore, the
   culture time period required to cross the threshold of each sample
   corresponds to the original number of cells in the sample. A mutant cell
   growth time threshold (MT) value of each sample can be calculated to
   predict the number of original mutant cells. For mutagenesis
   determination, the RT-CES assay displayed an equal sensitivity (p >
   0.05) and coefficients of variation values with good correlation to
   conventional HPRT mutagenic assays. Most importantly, the RT-CES
   mutation assay has a higher throughput than conventional cellular
   assays.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic systems model was used to generate parameters describing a
   phenotype of Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) behavior in a sample
   of 36 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and/or fibromyalgia
   (FM) and 36 case-matched healthy controls. Altered neuroendocrine
   function, particularly in relation to somatic symptoms and poor sleep
   quality, may contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders. Blood
   plasma was assayed for cortisol and ACTH every 10 min for 24 h. The
   dynamic model was specified with an ordinary differential equation using
   three parameters: (1) ACTH-adrenal signaling, (2) inhibitory feedback,
   and (3) non-ACTH influences. The model was ``personalized{''} by
   estimating an individualized set of parameters from each participant's
   data. Day and nighttime parameters were assessed separately. Two
   nocturnal parameters (ACTH-adrenal signaling and inhibitory feedback)
   significantly differentiated the two patient subgroups
   ({''}fatigue-predominant{''} patients with CFS only versus
   ``pain-predominant{''} patients with FM and comorbid chronic fatigue)
   from controls (all p's < .05), whereas daytime parameters and
   diurnal/nocturnal slopes did not. The same nocturnal parameters were
   significantly associated with somatic symptoms among patients (p's <
   .05). There was a significantly different pattern of association between
   nocturnal non-ACTH influences and sleep quality among patients versus
   controls (p < .05). Although speculative, the finding that patient
   somatic symptoms decreased when more cortisol was produced per unit
   ACTH, is consistent with cortisol's anti-inflammatory and
   sleep-modulatory effects. Patients' HPA systems may compensate by
   promoting more rapid or sustained cortisol production. Mapping
   ``behavioral phenotypes{''} of stress-arousal systems onto symptom
   clusters may help disentangle the pathophysiology of complex disorders
   with frequent comorbidity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Online estimation of the internal states is a perquisite for monitoring,
   control, and fault diagnosis of many engineering processes. A cost
   effective approach to monitor these variables in real time is to employ
   model-based state estimation techniques. Dynamic model-based state
   estimation is a rich and highly active area of research and many novel
   approaches have emerged over the last few years. In this paper, we
   review various recent developments in the area of nonlinear state
   estimators from a Bayesian perspective. In particular, we focus on the
   constrained state estimation (including systems modeled using
   differential-algebraic equations), the handling of multi-rate and
   delayed measurements and recent advances in model parameter estimation.
   Recent advances on the stability analysis of the estimation error
   dynamics are also briefly discussed. The review aims to provide an
   integrated view of important ideas, from the authors' perspective that
   have driven the research in this area in recent years. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Delayed and fluid oil sands cokes were used to prepare activated carbon
   through a fast activation process that uses microwave heating and KOH as
   activation agent. Activation parameters such as particle size, humidity

   studied for their impact on the quality of the activated cokes obtained.
   The iodine number, specific surface area, scanning electron microscopic
   images, elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were
   used to characterize the activated coke obtained. Small particle size,
   presence of humidity in the purge gas, and high KOH/coke ratio provided
   higher iodine number and BET surface area. Longer microwave heating time
   increased the iodine number and surface area of the activated coke, but
   not monotonically. The differences in the properties of the activated
   delayed and fluid cokes are related to the structural differences and
   volatile content of the raw cokes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The proliferation of power-electronic-based residential loads has
   resulted in significant harmonic distortion in the voltages and currents
   of residential distribution systems. There is an urgent need for
   techniques that can determine the collective harmonic impact of these
   modern residential loads. These techniques can be used, for example, to
   predict the harmonic effects of mass adoption of compact fluorescent
   lights. In response to the need, this paper proposes a bottom-up,
   probabilistic harmonic assessment technique for residential feeders. The
   method models the random harmonic injections of residential loads by
   simulating their random operating states. This is performed by
   determining the switching-on probability of a residential load based on
   the load research results. The result is a randomly varying harmonic
   equivalent circuit representing a residential house. By combining
   multiple residential houses supplied with a service transformer, a
   probabilistic model for service transformers is also derived.
   Measurement results have confirmed the validity of the proposed
   technique. The proposed model is ideally suited for studying the
   consequences of consumer behavior or regulatory policy changes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the harmonic impact of modern residential loads on
   the secondary power distribution systems. Several issues of concern to
   utilities, such as the neutral-to-earth voltage rise, the overloading of
   service transformers, the impact of compact fluorescent lights (CFL),
   and the benefits of adopting IEC 61000-3-2 limits, have been
   investigated. A bottom-up probabilistic harmonic assessment method
   proposed in the companion paper was applied to conduct the study.
   Several interesting results have been obtained. For example, the
   adoption of CFLs based on market trend could result in an increase of
   voltage total harmonic distortion by about 10\% per year over the next
   couple of years. Adopting the IEC limits on CFLs will drop the growth
   rate to 2\% per year. In addition to the results of interest to utility
   companies, this paper demonstrates the usefulness and necessity of a
   bottom-up-based approach to conduct harmonic assessment for residential
   loads.}},

   Solutions to a Class of DC Programming Problems}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Sum-rate maximization in two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) relaying belongs to the class of
   difference-of-convex functions (DC) programming problems. DC programming
   problems occur also in other signal processing applications and are
   typically solved using different modifications of the branch-and-bound
   method which, however, does not have any polynomial time complexity
   guarantees. In this paper, we develop two efficient polynomial time
   algorithms for the sum-rate maximization in two-way AF MIMO relaying.
   The first algorithm guarantees to find at least a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
   (KKT) solution. There is a strong evidence, however, that such a
   solution is actually globally optimal. The second algorithm that is
   based on the generalized eigenvectors shows the same performance as the
   first one with reduced computational complexity.
   The objective function of the problem is represented as a product of
   quadratic fractional ratios and parameterized so that its convex part
   (versus the concave part) contains only one (or two) optimization
   variables. One of the algorithms is called POlynomial Time DC (POTDC)
   and is based on semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation,
   linearization, and an iterative Newton-type search over a single
   parameter. The other algorithm is called RAte-maximization via
   Generalized EigenvectorS (RAGES) and is based on the generalized
   eigenvectors method and an iterative search over two (or one, in its
   approximate version) optimization variables. We derive an upper-bound
   for the optimal value of the corresponding optimization problem and show
   by simulations that this upper-bound is achieved by both algorithms. It
   provides an evidence that the algorithms find a global optimum. The
   proposed methods are also superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Concomitant gradient fields are transverse magnetic field components
   that are necessarily present to satisfy Maxwell's equations when
   magnetic field gradients are utilized in magnetic resonance imaging.
   They can have deleterious effects that are more prominent at lower
   static fields and/or higher gradient strengths. In diffusion tensor
   imaging schemes that employ large gradients that are not symmetric about
   a refocusing radiofrequency pulse (unlike StejskalTanner, which is
   symmetric), concomitant fields may cause phase accrual that could
   corrupt the diffusion measurement. Theory predicting the error from this
   dephasing is described and experimentally validated for both Reese
   twice-refocused and split gradient single spin-echo diffusion gradient
   schemes. Bias in apparent diffusion coefficient values was
   experimentally found to worsen with distance from isocenter and with
   increasing duration of gradient asymmetry in both a phantom and in the
   brain. The amount of error from concomitant gradient fields depends on
   many variables, including the diffusion gradient pattern, pulse sequence
   timing, maximum effective gradient amplitude, static magnetic field
   strength, voxel size, slice distance from isocenter, and partial Fourier
   fraction. A prospective correction scheme that can reduce concomitant
   gradient errors is proposed and verified for diffusion imaging. Magn

Abstract = {{A novel image analysis methodology based on infrared (IR) imaging was
   developed for simultaneous monitoring of ice accretion and thermography
   of airfoils. In this study, an IR camera was calibrated and used to
   measure the surface temperature of the energized airfoils, and monitor
   the ice accretion and growth pattern on the airfoils' surfaces. The
   methodology comprises the automatic processing of a series of IR video
   frames with the purpose of detecting ice pattern evolution during the
   icing test period. A specially developed MATLAB code was used to detect
   the iced areas in the IR images, and simultaneously monitor surface
   temperature evolution of the airfoil during an icing test. Knowing the
   correlation between the icing pattern and surface temperature changes
   during an icing test is essential for energy efficient design of thermal
   icing mitigation systems. Processed IR images were also used to
   determine the ice accumulation rate on the airfoil's surface in a given
   icing test. The proposed methodology has been demonstrated to work
   successfully, since the optical images taken at the end of icing tests
   from the airfoils' surfaces compared well with the processed IR images
   detecting the ice grown outward from the airfoils' leading edge area.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline copper is considered to be a candidate for electrical
   contacts for dynamic systems. Both experiments and simulations show that
   introducing nanoscale twins into nanocrystalline copper is an effective
   approach to improve strength while maintaining high electrical
   conductivity. The present study investigated the influence of twin
   boundary (TB) and grain size refinement on plastic deformation in
   polycrystalline copper. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with
   embedded-atom method potential for copper was performed to simulate a
   cell of {[}011] textured microstructure embedded with four hexagonal
   grains. Simulation results showed that strength and toughness (i.e.,
   energy per volume absorbed by system up to a certain strain in this
   study) of copper could be enhanced by introducing TBs within
   nanocrystalline grains. Nanotwins act as obstacles to dislocation motion
   that leads to strengthening, as well as sources of dislocation
   nucleation contributing to the toughness of the materials. The
   enhancement of the properties is apparently sensitive to the distance
   between TB and grain boundary (GB); i.e., it exhibits a maximum at an
   intermediate distance, while it decreases when TBs are far away or very
   close to GBs. This implies that the volume between TB and GB plays an
   important role on the plasticity of nanocrystalline copper. Moreover,
   the deformation behavior in different grains depends on their
   orientation with respect to the loading direction. The study has also
   confirmed that grain-size refinement in nanotwinned models would lead to
   an inverse Hall-Petch relationship.}},

Abstract = {{The overall performance of a mechanical device under random shocks,
   fatigue, and gradual degradation may continuously deteriorate over time,
   leading to multi-state health conditions. This deterioration can be
   represented by a continuous-time degradation process - with multiple
   discrete states - that reflects the relative degree of deterioration.
   This paper focuses on a condition-monitored device with multi-state
   deterioration, where its degradation state is not directly observable
   and only incomplete information is available through condition
   monitoring. After modeling this multi-state device, an unsupervised
   parameter estimation method is developed, which employs historical
   condition monitoring information to estimate the unknown characteristic
   parameters of the degradation process and the observation process. The
   results are evaluated through numerical experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A detached eddy simulation (DES), a large-eddy simulation (LES), and a
   k-e-based Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculation on the
   single phase turbulent flow in a fully baffled stirred tank, agitated by
   a Rushton turbine is presented. The DES used here is based on the
   Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model solved on a grid containing about a
   million control volumes. The standard k-e and LES were considered here
   for comparison purposes. Predictions of the impeller-angle-resolved and
   time-averaged turbulent flow have been evaluated and compared with data
   from laser doppler anemometry measurements. The effects of the
   turbulence model on the predictions of the mean velocity components and
   the turbulent kinetic energy are most pronounced in the (highly
   anisotropic) trailing vortex core region, with specifically DES
   performing well. The LESthat was performed on the same grid as the
   DESappears to lack resolution in the boundary layers on the surface of
   the impeller. The findings suggest that DES provides a more accurate
   prediction of the features of the turbulent flows in a stirred tank
   compared with RANS-based models and at the same time alleviates
   resolution requirements of LES close to walls. (c) 2011 American

Abstract = {{Simulations of solidliquid flow in an agitated tank have been performed.
   The simulations fully resolve the mildly turbulent liquid flow (Re
   approximate to 2000) in the tank, and the spherical solid particles
   suspended in the liquid. Full resolution of the particles sets the grid
   spacing and thereby limits the tank size and the number of particles (up
   to 3600 in this article) that are computationally affordable. The solids
   volume fraction is some 8\%. The lattice-Boltzmann method has been used
   to solve the flow dynamics; the particles move under the influence of
   resolved hydrodynamic forces, unresolved lubrication forces, net
   gravity, and collisions (with other particles, the tank wall, and the
   impeller). We show the start-up of the suspension process, demonstrate
   its dependency on a Shields number (that we interpret in terms of the
   Zwietering correlation) and show the impact of polydispersity on the

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{With its potential to produce stackable solids for backfill (land

   for recycle, filtration for treating mature fine tailings (MFT) using an
   in-house synthesized, organic-inorganic hybrid polymer (flocculant),
   Al-PAM, as a filtration aid was developed and tested on a MFT from oil
   sands operations. After proper dilution of the MFT from 30 wt\% to 10
   wt\% solids, Al-PAM was found to be an effective filtration aid. A
   two-step process: Al-PAM flocculation and thickening of diluted MET,
   followed by filtration of thickener underflow to produce a stackable
   filter cake and virtually solids-free filtrate was found to be the most
   appealing. This study clearly showed that Al-PAM assisted filtration is
   a viable solution to reduce the inventory of MET and associated
   liability while maximizing recovery (recycle) of process-affected water.

Abstract = {{The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is a key brain area in depressive
   symptomatology; specifically, glutamate (Glu) has been reported to play
   a significant role in major depression (MD) in this area. MPFC Glu
   levels are sensitive to ovarian hormone fluctuations and pregnancy and
   the postpartum period are associated with the most substantial
   physiological alterations of female hormones. It is therefore logical to
   measure MPFC Glu levels in women with postpartum depression (PPD). Using
   in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at a field strength of 3
   T, we acquired single-voxel spectra from the MPFC of 12 women with PPD
   and 12 healthy controls (HCs) matched for postpartum scan timing.
   Water-referenced MPFC Glu levels were measured using a MRS technique
   that allowed us to be specific for Glu with very little glutamine
   contamination. The concentrations of other water-quantified brain
   metabolites such as glycerophosphorylcholine plus phosphorylcholine,
   N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and creatine plus phosphocreatine were measured
   in the same MR spectra. MPFC Glu levels were higher in women with PPD
   (7.21 +/- 1.20) compared to matched HCs (6.04 +/- 1.21). There were no
   differences between groups for other brain metabolites measured. These
   findings suggest an association between Glu dysregulation in the MPFC
   and PPD. Whether the pathophysiology of PPD differs from the
   pathophysiology of MD remains to be determined. Further investigations
   are needed to determine the chronological associations between the
   occurrence of symptoms of PPD and the onset of changes in MPFC Glu
   levels. Neuropsychopharmacology (2012) 37, 2428-2435;

Abstract = {{The aim of this review article is to examine solutions and challenges
   associated with adhesively bonded fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) pipe
   sections. FRP materials have been used in piping systems for more than
   40 years. Higher specific mechanical properties and corrosion resistance
   of FRP makes it a potential candidate for replacing metallic piping
   structures. Another advantage of FRP structures is the large number of
   design variables available. Despite the advantages associated with FRP
   structures, their application is still limited, partly due to
   unsatisfactory methods for joining composite subcomponents and
   inadequate knowledge of failure mechanisms under different loading
   conditions. Adhesively bonded joints are attractive for many
   applications, since they offer integrated sealing and minimal part count
   and do not require pipe extremities with complex geometries such as
   threads or bell and spigot configurations. Normally, an adhesive joint
   results in more uniform stress distribution, undamaged fibre
   architecture, and smooth surface contours. In the present article, a
   comprehensive review of various joining techniques for FRP piping
   through adhesive bonding is presented and damage mechanisms for
   different loading conditions are examined. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fast and accurate determination of lipid content in microalgal cultures
   is a required step for algal bioprocess development and optimization. An
   improved high-throughput Nile Red staining protocol using a microplate

   when compared to previously reported staining protocols. Differences in
   the staining efficacy of Nile Red among different algal strains were
   observed, even though the performance of the proposed method was found
   to be satisfactory for the different Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae
   microalgal cultures evaluated. Therefore, the proposed Nile Red method
   should only be used for evaluating lipid content variations in
   previously standardized strains. BODIPY 505/515 was evaluated as a
   potential substitute for Nile Red, but was found to be unsuitable as a
   quantitative stain for algal lipids in the microplate-based staining

Abstract = {{The conventional K-best sphere decoder (KSD) keeps the best K nodes at
   each level of the search tree. In addition to retaining the best K
   nodes, we also consider all the nodes whose costs are within a certain
   margin of the cost of the Kth best node. The resulting algorithm is
   called improved K-best sphere decoder (IKSD). Three IKSD variants are
   considered in this letter, which are fixed threshold, normalized
   threshold and adaptive threshold IKSD. The proposed IKSD requires a
   smaller K (indicating lower complexity) while still achieving a better
   and near optimal performance compared to the conventional KSD. These
   gains are confirmed by the simulation results. For example, for the
   fixed threshold IKSD in a 4 x 4 16-QAM multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) system, with K = 2, it achieves the same performance as the
   conventional KSD (K = 16), yielding about 80\% complexity savings. For
   coded MIMO systems, the IKSD is also extended as a list sphere decoder
   for joint iterative detection and decoding.}},

Title = {{Horizontal Well pressure transient analysis in anisotropic composite

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{96-97}},
Pages = {{120-139}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A composite reservoir is one with multiple compartments, each having
   distinct rock properties separated by geologic discontinuities; these
   discontinuities regulate the degree of compartment distinctiveness
   depending on the amount of leakage -involved. Geologically, composite
   reservoirs separated by leaky faults are rife but literature containing
   detailed three dimensional analyses of such anisotropic systems is few.
   For the first time using transform methods, a general customizable three
   dimensional point source semi-analytical solution for the drawdown
   response in composite clastic systems separated by a leaky fault is
   developed. This solution is converted to line source for horizontal
   wells by integrating along the producing well length while treating the
   leaky fault as a thin finite conductivity fracture separating two
   reservoirs with different properties. An arbitrary well orientation to
   principal permeability direction is adopted to obtain a general solution
   in the anisotropic system and this semi-analytical solution is achieved
   using a simple computer program which generates type curves in a
   computationally cheap and effective manner.
   Sensitivity analysis conducted on the horizontal well drawdown signature
   with respect to areal permeability anisotropy, angle of orientation,
   well position, reservoir dimensions, dimensionless fault conductivity
   and mobility ratios in composite clastic reservoir systems reveals that
   the drawdown response is a convoluted function of reservoir properties
   from both compartments and the separating semi-permeable medium.
   Field data from the Niger Delta is used to validate this model and
   direct synthesis of reservoir parameters from the resulting equations is
   examined. The result of this work is attractive where formation
   juxtapositions separated by leaky faults in the reservoir are suspected
   to allow flow from adjacent fields and where vertical permeability plays
   a major role in depletion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In system modeling, knowledge management comes vividly into the picture
   when dealing with a collection of individual models. These models being
   considered as sources of knowledge, are engaged in some collective
   pursuits of a collaborative development to establish modeling outcomes
   of global character. The result comes in the form of a so-called
   granular fuzzy model, which directly reflects upon and quantifies the
   diversity of the available sources of knowledge (local models) involved
   in knowledge management. In this study, several detailed algorithmic
   schemes are presented along with related computational aspects
   associated with Granular Computing. It is also shown how the
   construction of information granules completed through the use of the
   principle of justifiable granularity becomes advantageous in the
   realization of granular fuzzy models and a quantification of the quality
   (specificity) of the results of modeling. We focus on the design of
   granular fuzzy models considering that the locally available models are
   those fuzzy rule-based. It is shown that the model quantified in terms
   of two conflicting criteria, that is (a) a coverage criterion expressing
   to which extent the resulting information granules ``cover{''} include
   data and (b) specificity criterion articulating how detailed (specific)
   the obtained information granules are. The overall quality of the
   granular model is also assessed by determining an area under curve (AUC)
   where the curve is formed in the coverage-specificity coordinates.
   Numeric results are discussed with intent of displaying the most
   essential features of the proposed methodology and algorithmic
   developments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time of flight (TOF) is widely used to locate and size faults in
   ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation (NDE). In this paper, we propose a
   novel model-based method for ultrasonic echo parameter estimation. The
   ultrasonic signal is assumed to be composed of an unknown number of
   Gaussian echoes corrupted by white Gaussian noise. Firstly, the Hilbert
   transform is used to extract the envelope of the signal. It is shown
   that the parameter estimation of the signal is improved by using the
   envelope. To estimate the parameters of the envelope of the signal,
   quasi maximum likelihood method is used. The number of echoes is
   estimated using consistent Akaike information criterion. Two measures
   are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method: (a)
   probability of detection of backscattered echoes and (b) the error of
   estimated time of flights. The proposed method is then compared to the
   cross-correlation method and the maximum likelihood method which uses
   the original signal. Simulated and experimental signals are used to
   evaluate the performance of each method. Both experimental and simulated
   results show that the proposed method can improve the parameter
   estimation which ultimately enhances the damage detection and
   assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel topology of loaded N-segment stepped-impedance
   resonator (SIR) is introduced to control the frequency ratio between the
   second and first resonance frequencies of such resonator. The
   fundamental characteristic of such resonators, the frequency ratio
   between the second and first resonance frequencies, is targeted as a key
   factor in arbitrary tuning the resonance frequencies. It is shown that
   this factor can be determined in a ratio of 6.7: 2.7: 2.25 for the
   proposed, the conventional dual-section and T-shaped SIRs using a
   five-segment SIR. This concept can be applied in the design of any
   dual-band microwave components where a wide branch-line couplers is
   chosen as a sample. It is demonstrated that the proposed topology not
   only provides more design flexibilities but also improves the
   performance of such components in terms of bandwidth enhancement, better
   return loss, and size reduction around 56\%. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The surface defect dominated visible emission from one-dimensional
   multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) nanowires (NWs) is characterized by
   photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The PL spectra of BFO NWs exhibit a
   weak near band emission (NBE) along with a strong defect-level emission
   (DLE). It is suggested that excess surface defects exist in BFO NWs
   which are responsible for strong visible green emission. Passivation of
   BFO NW surface with H-2 significantly improves the NBE emission while
   suppressing surface recombination. Such a surface enhanced emission
   promises many potential applications of BFO NWs not only in photonic
   devices such as LEDs but also in fluorescence-based chemical sensing.

Title = {{New ice lens initiation condition for frost heave in fine-grained soils}},
Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{8-13}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Frost heave results from ice segregation and ice lens formation and
   growth as a soil freezes. This formation is initiated by cracking of the
   soil in the frozen fringe. Therefore, evaluation of the ice lens
   initiation requires the determination of the crack initiation condition
   in the frozen fringe. A new fundamental approach is proposed to
   determine the ice lens initiation condition using the soil freezing
   characteristics curve (SFCC). It is demonstrated that an ice lens
   initiates close to the so-called ice-entry value defined using the SFCC.
   Ice lens initiation conditions for different boundary conditions were
   determined in a laboratory using the SFCC and were then compared with
   the ice lens initiation conditions from a one-dimensional open system
   frost heave tests. The results using the SFCC showed good agreement with
   the values determined experimentally. It was therefore concluded that
   the SFCC derived information can be used as an input parameter in
   existing frost heave models to establish the segregation temperature.

Volume = {{47}},

Pages = {{6823-6834}},

Abstract = {{Pitting corrosion was found to be the immature failure mechanism for a
   slurry pipe that has an internal surface hardened with
   induction-quenching technique. The metallographic examination shows that
   the microstructure of surface layer is a banded mixture of martensite,
   ferrite, and pearlite. The pits initiate preferably in the ferrite
   bands. Electrochemical measurements are conducted to evaluate the
   pitting susceptibility of each constituent. When the small amount of
   chloride is present, the breakdown potential of ferrite is lower than
   those of martensite and pearlite. The high likelihood of metastable pit
   initiation in ferrite is also demonstrated by the electrochemical noise
   records. The development of pits in ferrite in the mixed microstructure
   is further promoted by the galvanic effect when ferrite is coupled with
   pearlite or martensite. The passive film of steel is an n-type
   semiconductor. The Mott-Schottky measurements indicate that the passive
   film formed on the ferrite specimen contains more oxygen vacancies,
   suggesting that the lower breakdown resistance is likely due to a highly
   defective film structure. The high-to-low pitting susceptibility is
   ferrite > martensite > pearlite. The experimental observations of this
   study imply that a practical approach to improve the performance of
   tailing pipes is to eliminate the microstructural heterogeneity in the
   surface layer by modifying the induction-heating process.}},

Abstract = {{Selecting optimal location is a key decision problem in business and
   engineering. This research focuses to develop mathematical models for a
   special type of location problems called grid-based location problems.
   It uses a real-world problem of placing lights in a park to minimize the
   amount of darkness and excess supply. The non-linear nature of the
   supply function (arising from the light physics) and heterogeneous
   demand distribution make this decision problem truly intractable to
   solve. We develop ILP models that are designed to provide the optimal
   solution for the light post problem: the total number of light posts,
   the location of each light post, and their capacities (i.e.,
   brightness). Finally, the ILP models are implemented within a standard
   modeling language and solved with the CPLEX solver. Results show that
   the ILP models are quite efficient in solving moderately sized problems
   with a very small optimality gap. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   induction motor. This paper illustrates that the machines operate under

   divergent results when using I-Psi loops and dq techniques to calculate

   Titanosilicate-2 (Cu-ETS-2) has been found to be a superior H2S

   cation exchange capacity and copper dispersion. Cu-ETS-2 demonstrated
   higher utilization at room temperature when compared to fully developed
   commercial H2S adsorbents. In addition it was found that the adsorption

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{We synthesized a novel, multi-functional, radiosensitizing agent by
   covalently linking 6-fluoro-6-deoxy-D-glucose (6-FDG) to gold
   nanoparticles (6-FDG-GNPs) via a thiol functional group. We then
   assessed the bio-distribution and pharmacokinetic properties of
   6-FDG-GNPs in vivo using a murine model. At 2 h, following intravenous
   injection of 6-FDG-GNPs into the murine model, approximately 30\% of the
   6-FDG-GNPs were distributed to three major organs: the liver, the spleen
   and the kidney. PEGylation of the 6-FDG-GNPs was found to significantly
   improve the bio-distribution of 6-FDG-GNPs by avoiding unintentional
   uptake into these organs, while simultaneously doubling the cellular
   uptake of GNPs in implanted breast MCF-7 adenocarcinoma. When combined
   with radiation, PEG-6-FDG-GNPs were found to increase the apoptosis of
   the MCF-7 breast adenocarinoma cells by radiation both in vitro and in
   vivo. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that GNPs reach their maximal
   concentrations at a time window of two to four hours post-injection,
   during which optimal radiation efficiency can be achieved.
   PEG-6-FDG-GNPs are thus novel nanoparticles that preferentially
   accumulate in targeted cancer cells where they act as potent
   radiosensitizing agents. Future research will aim to substitute the F-18
   atom into the 6-FDG molecule so that the PEG-6-FDG-GNPs can also
   function as radiotracers for use in positron emission tomography
   scanning to aid cancer diagnosis and image guided radiation therapy
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the research article is to develop a representative volume
   element using finite elements to study the buckling stability of
   graphene/polymer nanocomposites. Research work exploring the full
   potential of graphene as filler for nanocomposites is limited in part
   due to the complex processes associated with the mixing of graphene in
   polymer. To overcome some of these issues, a multiscale modeling
   technique has been proposed in this numerical work. Graphene was herein
   modeled in the atomistic scale, whereas the polymer deformation was
   analyzed as a continuum. Separate representative volume element models
   were developed for investigating buckling in neat polymer and
   graphene/polymer nanocomposites. Significant improvements in buckling
   strength were observed under applied compressive loading when compared
   with the buckling stability of neat polymer.}},

   electric field is applied, so that the operating field strength across
   the membrane increases stepwise. In mode 2, a fixed electric field is
   applied throughout the experiment. In second mode of operation, about
   24\% flux enhancement is achieved compared to 14\% in mode 1. (c) 2012

Journal = {{FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{203}},
Pages = {{17-32}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce a concept of a granular representation of
   numeric membership functions of fuzzy sets, which offers a synthetic and
   qualitative view at fuzzy sets and their ensuing processing. The notion
   of consistency of the granular representation is formed, which helps
   regard the problem as a certain optimization task. More specifically,
   the consistency is referred to a certain operation phi, which gives rise
   to the concept of phi-consistency. Likewise introduced is a concept of
   granular consistency with regard to a collection of several operations.
   Given the essential role played by logic operators in computing with
   fuzzy sets, detailed investigations include and- and or-consistency as
   well as (and, or)-consistency of granular representations of membership
   functions with the logic operators implemented in the form of various
   t-norms and t-conorms. The optimization framework supporting the
   realization of the phi-consistent optimization process is provided
   through particle swarm optimization. Further conceptual and
   representation issues impacted processing fuzzy sets are discussed as

   perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic bisimide (C5Pe) with well-defined
   molecular structure containing fused aromatic rings and heteroatoms

   understand molecular interaction mechanisms of heavy oil components in
   aqueous solutions. A surface forces apparatus (SFA) was used to directly
   measure the molecular interactions of C5Pe. Solution pH, salt
   concentration and Ca2+ addition showed a strong impact on molecular
   interactions between C5Pe adsorbed on mica surfaces. The repulsion
   observed between the two adsorbed C5Pe molecular layers was shown to
   have a steric and electrosteric origin. The force-distance profiles at
   short separation distances under high compression force were well fitted
   with the Alexander-de Gennes (AdG) model. At pH >= 4, the repulsive
   forces measured over a long separation distance under low compression
   force were shown to deviate from the AdG model but could be fitted with
   the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, indicating an
   electrostatic origin of the observed repulsion due to ionization of
   -COOH groups. Adhesion between two C5Pe surfaces was shown to decrease
   sharply with increasing solution pH and salt concentration, being
   attributed to the decrease in surface hydrophobicity and hence
   hydrophobic attraction. Addition of Ca2+ ions induced the formation of
   large C5Pe aggregates due to strong bonding of Ca2+ with -COOH groups,
   leading to a longer range steric repulsion. Our results provide a new
   insight into the molecular interactions of polyaromatic surfactants at
   oil-water interfaces and in complex aqueous solutions.}},

   infrared spectroscopic analysis, and turbidity measurements were
   utilized to detect and quantify the acidity of starch digested with
   different concentrations of caustic (sodium hydroxide or potassium
   hydroxide). The results revealed the formation of acidic groups on the
   starch after digestion by the alkali hydroxide. The generated acidic
   groups on starch seem to have contributed to the adsorption of starch on

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{163-176}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper probes solids suspension mechanisms in stirred tanks. The
   hypothesis is that at the point where solids are just suspended a
   critical flow condition exists close to the bottom of the tank for a
   fixed solids content and similar geometries. The critical flow condition
   may be dominated by the turbulence or by the mean flow. Two Lightnin
   A310 impellers with diameters of D=T/3 and D=T/2 were tested at varying
   off-bottom clearances. The mean and the turbulent fluctuating velocities
   close to the bottom of the tank were determined using both Ply and LES.
   The results showed that the mechanism of solids suspension is different
   for the two impeller diameters. Turbulence is the dominant mechanism for
   the T/3 impeller. For the T/2 impeller some combination of turbulence
   and mean flow is required. A comparison between the two impeller
   diameters in terms of power consumption suggests that solids suspension
   is more efficient when the turbulence mechanism dominates. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Mercaptobenzoheterocyclic compounds: 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT).
   2-mercaptobenzoxazole (MBO) and 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) are widely
   used as corrosion inhibitors and flotation collectors, but the true
   nature of the adsorption selectivity and activity to solid surfaces is
   still unclear. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this
   study investigates the structure-reactivity relation of MBO, MBI and MBT
   as flotation collectors with sulfide minerals. The results demonstrate
   that the O, N and S heteratoms in MBO, MBI and MBT molecules can attend
   the chemical bond formation with metal atoms on mineral surfaces and
   significantly impact the chemical reactivity of these
   mercaptobenzoheterocyclic compounds, and the reactive power of the three
   compounds to metal and mineral surfaces is predicted to be MBT > MBI >=
   MBO. In addition, the chemical reactivity of the thione, thiol and
   ionized thiol species of these mercaptobenzoheterocyclic compounds in
   both vacuum and aqueous phases is also studied. The results show that
   the thione tautomers of MBO, MBI and MBT is more stable and reactive
   than their thiol tautomers, and in aqueous solutions, the ionized thiol
   exhibits the strongest reactivity. The theoretical results of
   structure-reactivity relations provide an atomic level understanding of
   the activity and selectivity observed by the experimental investigation
   of the adsorption of MBO, MBI and MBT on metal and sulfide surfaces. The
   further pyrite flotation tests indicate that MBT has the highest
   collecting power to pyrite, followed by MBI and then MBO, which is
   consistent with the theoretical prediction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Chitosan was recently found to be a potential replacement for toxic
   inorganic depressants commonly used in the flotation separation of Cu-Pb
   sulfide minerals. The current work focused on the interaction mechanisms
   and investigated the reasons for the preferential adsorption of chitosan
   on copper sulfide (chalcopyrite) over lead sulfide (galena). Attenuated
   total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR),
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed in the study. ATR-FTIR
   spectra of chitosan showed that the absorption peaks due to amino groups
   shifted upon adsorption on chalcopyrite. High resolution XPS spectra
   detected binding energy shifts of N 1s and O 1s electrons on
   chitosan-treated chalcopyrite. ToF-SIMS ion mass spectra revealed CuNH3
   as the dominant stable species as a result of chalcopyrite-chitosan
   interactions. It was therefore concluded that the adsorption of chitosan
   on chalcopyrite was due to a strong chemical interaction between the
   surface copper atoms and the protonated amine as well as the hydroxyl
   groups on chitosan. Such a strong chemical interaction was not observed
   on galena. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) produced by the surface mining
   oil sands industry in Alberta, Canada, is toxic to aquatic organisms.
   Ozonation of OSPW attenuates this toxicity. Altered concentrations of
   sex steroid hormones, impaired reproductive performance, and less
   prominent secondary sexual characteristics have been reported for fish
   exposed to OSPW. However, the mechanism(s) by which these effects occur
   and whether ozonation can attenuate these effects in fish was unknown.
   The objective of this in vivo study was to investigate the
   endocrine-disrupting effects of OSPW and ozone-treated OSPW on the
   abundances of transcripts of genes in the brain- gonad-liver (BGL) axis
   in male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Abundances of
   transcripts of genes important for synthesis of gonadotropins were
   greater in brains from both male and female fish exposed to untreated
   OSPW compared to that of control fish. In gonads from male fish exposed
   to untreated OSPW the abundances of transcripts of gonadotropin
   receptors and several enzymes of sex hormone steroidogenesis were
   greater than in control fish. The abundances of transcripts of
   estrogen-responsive genes were greater in livers from male fish exposed
   to untreated OSPW than in control fish. In female fish exposed to
   untreated OSPW there was less abundance of transcripts of gonadotropin
   receptors in gonads, as well as less abundance of transcripts of fish
   genes in livers. Many effects were either fully or partially attenuated
   in fish exposed to ozone-treated OSPW. The results indicate that (1)
   OSPW has endocrine-disrupting effects at all levels of BGL axis, (2)
   OSPW has different effects in male and female fish, (3) ozonation
   attenuates the effects of OSPW on abundances of transcripts of some
   genes, and the attenuation is more prominent in males than in females,
   but effects of ozonation on endocrine-disrupting effects of OSPW were
   less clear than in previous m vitro studies. The results provide a
   mechanistic basis for the endocrine-disrupting effects of OSPW from
   other studies.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation of a contaminated site to site-specific cleanup standard
   requires a good understanding of the geochemical characteristics of the
   site. In this study, the groundwater hydrochemical characteristics of a
   fuel-contaminated mine site in the Northwest Territories (Canada) was
   evaluated to understand the active geochemical processes and assess the
   groundwater quality in comparison to guidelines for the protection of
   freshwater aquatic life. Groundwater samples were taken from installed
   monitoring wells across the site and analyzed by field and laboratory
   methods for dissolved metals; ions; and benzene, toulene, ethylbenzene,
   and xylenes (BTEX) organic constituents. The results showed that the
   groundwater is Ca-SO4 type because of ubiquitous occurrence of gypsum
   dissolution and carbonate weathering. The last sampling at the site
   showed that the BTEX constituents of interest were above the guideline
   limits in some locations, but other geochemical indicators showed
   biodegradation is occurring at the site. The inorganic parameters of
   interest were generally less than the limits studied with few outliers
   except iron, aluminum, and nickel. Iron and aluminum have background
   concentrations above the studied limits. This study underscores the
   importance of mineralogical composition of the native bedrock on
   groundwater geochemical processes. DOI:

Abstract = {{The present study uses the dielectrophoresis (DEP) and electrothermal
   (ET) forces to develop on-chip micromixers and microconcentrators. A
   microchannel with rectangular array of microelectrodes, patterned either
   on its bottom surface only or on both the top and the bottom surfaces,
   is considered for the analysis. A mathematical model to compute
   electrical field, temperature field, the fluid velocity, and the
   concentration distributions is developed. Both analytical and numerical
   solutions of standing wave DEP (SWDEP), traveling wave DEP (TWDEP),
   standing wave ET (SWET), and traveling wave ET (TWET) forces along the
   length and the height of the channel are compared. The effects of
   electrode size and their placement in the microsystem on micromixing and
   microconcentrating performance are studied and compared to velocity and
   concentration profiles. SWDEP forces can be used to collect the
   particles at different locations in the microchannel. Under positive and
   negative DEP effect, the particles are collected at electrode edges and
   away from the electrodes, respectively, irrespective of the position,
   size, and number of electrodes. The location of the concentration region
   can be shifted by changing the electrode position. SWET and TWET forces
   are used for mixing and producing concentration regions by circulating
   the fluid at a given location. The effect of forces can be changed with
   the applied voltage. The TWDEP method is the better method for mixing
   along the length of the channels among the four options explored in the
   present work. If two layers of particle suspension are placed side by
   side in the channel, triangular electrode configuration can be used to
   mix the suspensions. Triangular and rectangular electrode configurations
   can efficiently mix two layers of particle suspension placed
   side-by-side and one-atop-the-other, respectively. Hence, SWDEP forces
   can be successfully used to create microconcentrators, whereas TWDEP,
   SWET, and TWET can be used to produce efficient micromixers in a
   microfluidic chip. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In oil sands mining, timely provisions of ore and tailings containment
   with less environmental footprints are the main drivers of profitability
   and sustainability. The recent Alberta Energy Resources Conservation
   Board Directive 074 requires oil sands waste disposal planning to be an
   integral part of mine planning. This requires the development of a well
   integrated strategy of directional mining and tailings dyke construction
   for in-pit and ex-pit tailings storage management. The objectives of
   this paper are to: 1) determine the order and time of extraction of ore,
   dyke material and waste that maximizes the net present value; 2)
   determine the destination of dyke material that minimizes construction
   cost; and 3) minimize deviations from the production goals of the mining
   operation. We have developed, implemented, and verified a theoretical
   optimization framework based on mixed integer linear goal programming
   (MILGP) to address these objectives. This study presents an integration
   of mixed integer linear programming and goal programming in solving
   large scale mine planning optimization problems using clustering and
   pushback techniques. Application of the MILGP model was presented with
   an oil sands mining case. The MILGP model generated a smooth and uniform
   mining schedule that generates value and provides a robust framework for
   effective waste disposal planning. The results show that mining
   progresses with an ore to waste ratio of 1:1.5 throughout the mine life,
   generating an overall net present value of \$14,237M. This approach
   improves the sustainable development of oil sands through better waste
   management.}},

Abstract = {{We explore a new approach in the rational design of specificity in
   molecular recognition of small molecules based on statistical-mechanical
   integral equation theory of molecular liquids in the form of the
   three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the
   Kovalenko-Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH). The numerically stable iterative
   solution of conventional 3D-RISM equations includes the fragmental
   decomposition of flexible ligands, which are treated as distinct species
   in solvent mixtures of arbitrary complexity. The computed density
   functions for solution (including ligand) molecules are obtained as a
   set of discrete spatial grids that uniquely describe the continuous
   solvent-site distribution around the protein solute. Potentials of mean
   force derived from these distributions define the scoring function
   interfaced with the AutoDocx program for an automated ranking of docked
   conformations. As a case study in terms of solvent composition, we
   analyze cooperative interactions encountered in the binding of a
   flexible thiamine molecule to the prion protein at near-physiological

Abstract = {{Performance of biodiesel in engines is well established and biodiesel is
   currently adjudged as a low carbon fuel with the most potential of
   replacing fossil fuels. The fossil fuel sources are dwindling in
   Pakistan resulting in importation of about 8.1 million tonnes at
   approximately US\$ 9.4 billion per annum. In the ambit of this
   justification, augmenting the energy scarce resources in Pakistan
   through intense harnessing of the varied biodiesel sources can
   adequately address the deficiency and can ensure energy security.
   Towards this end, the progress attained in biodiesel related researches
   in Pakistan are evaluated and presented with the view of highlighting
   ways of achieving the target set by the Government. A feedstock that
   drew less attention is spent triglycerides, and the little work reported
   by some organizations appeared promising. Now the onus is upon
   organizations such as the Alternative Energy Development Board and
   Pakistan State Oil to harness the research results from several
   indigenous Universities and develop a full-scale biodiesel economy in
   Pakistan. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium hydride combined with a new bimetallic Nb-V catalyst displays
   remarkably rapid and stable low temperature (200 degrees C) hydrogen
   storage kinetics, even after 500 full volumetric absorption/desorption
   cycles. The system is also able to fairly rapidly absorb hydrogen at
   room temperature at a pressure of 1 bar. This unprecedented absorption
   behavior was demonstrated for 20 cycles. We employed extensive
   cryo-stage transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis on fully and
   partially sorbed materials to provide insight into the rapid Mg to MgH2
   phase transformation. After extended cycling of what was initially a 1.5
   mu m thick fully dense alloy film, the sample structure becomes
   analogous to that of a weakly agglomerated nanocomposite powder. The
   cycled Mg-V-Nb structure consists of a dense distribution of catalytic
   Nb-V nanocrystallites covering the surfaces of larger Mg and MgH2
   particles. The partially absorbed 20 degrees C and 200 degrees C
   microstructures both show this morphology. TEM results combined with
   Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-type kinetic analysis point to the surface catalyst
   distribution and stability against coarsening as being a key influence
   on the two-stage hydriding kinetics. Remarkably, the mean size of the
   Nb0.5V0.5H nanocrystallites stays essentially invariant throughout
   cycling; it is 3 nm after 45 cycles and 4 nm after 500 cycles. A
   mechanistic description is provided for the cycling-induced
   microstructural evolution in the ternary alloy as well as in the binary
   baselines. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In most of fermentation processes, the substrate and biomass
   concentrations greatly influence the yield of the targeted product. In
   this paper, considering the nonlinear and non-Gaussian nature of the
   fermentation processes, the particle filter method is introduced to
   estimate the substrate and biomass states, and an algorithm integrating
   optimization strategy with resampling is proposed to deal with
   constraints on states. The proposed approach investigates the constraint
   directly on the estimated value rather than on particles. If the
   estimation violates constraints, the optimal estimation is firstly
   obtained by the optimization approach, and then, the resampling and
   optimization strategy are iteratively used to randomly draw a particle
   each time among the violated posterior particles and project it onto the
   feasible region. The resampling and optimization steps are iterated
   until the state estimation, derived from posterior particles, reaches
   better performance than that through previous optimization formulation
   or all the violated posterior particles have been projected onto the
   feasible region. Compared with the other previous optimization
   approaches, the proposed method results in a better balance between
   reducing the on-line computation load and obtaining more effective
   posterior particles. (c) 2012 Curtin University of Technology and John

Abstract = {{Mesophase formation in heavy oil fractions during thermal cracking was
   studied by a depolarized light scattering technique using a high
   temperature/high pressure stirred hot-stage reactor. The advantage of
   this technique relies on its ability to track the ordering of components
   at the molecular and nanoscale prior to the onset of observable
   mesophase. A mechanism for mesophase formation in pitches has been
   suggested based on the evaluation of the previous models for mesophase
   formation with the scattering results. The results suggest that
   mesophase formation does not follow a typical phase separation or
   nucleation process but instead is a result of the homogeneous
   self-assembly of planar aromatic molecules into clusters and finally
   spherical submicrometer domains that coalesce to form the final texture
   of micrometer-scale mesophase spheres. The scattering behavior of
   asphaltenes suggests that this material is more aggregated than the
   maltenes, at temperatures up to 350 degrees C. This new technique can be
   used in conjunction with traditional hot-stage microscopy to study the
   mechanisms of mesophase formation and predict the onset of mesophase
   formation during the cracking of heavy oil.}},

Abstract = {{In thermally enhanced oil recovery operations, particularly in
   steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), boiler blowdown (BBD) containing
   high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM), dissolved silica,
   and total dissolved solids (TDS) is generated. To develop efficient
   tools for managing this blowdown, a detailed understanding of its
   chemistry is required. In this study, BBD was evaporated to yield
   similar to 66\% condensate and similar to 33\% concentrate blowdown
   (CBD). Detailed characterization of the BBD and CBD water was conducted.
   The effect of acidification was also studied. The acidification
   coprecipitates the silica and DOM, with over 90\% of the silica and over
   40\% of the DOM precipitating at pH 4. Ultrafiltration treatment was
   also examined, and a major fraction of the silica and DOM in the CBD was
   found to foul a 100 kDa ultrafiltration membrane in the pH range of 7.5
   to 9. The analysis revealed that the dominant fouling mechanism was cake
   filtration, indicating the formation of a silica-DOM precipitate layer
   on the membrane surface. These studies can provide insight regarding
   management options for SAGD disposal water.}},

Abstract = {{Organic shales are exposed to treatment fluids during and after
   hydraulic fracturing operations. The fluid-shale interaction influences
   the petrophysical alteration of the fractured shale and the fate of the
   fracturing fluid. We systematically measured the spontaneous water and
   oil intake of five shale samples collected from the cores of two wells
   drilled in the Horn River basin. The samples represent three shale
   formations with different mineralogy and petrophysical properties. We
   characterize the samples by measuring the porosity, conducting X-ray
   diffraction, and interpreting the well logging data and scanning
   electron microscopy images. The water intake is higher than the oil
   intake for all samples. The excess water intake and the physical
   alteration degree correlate with the shale mineralogy and petrophysical
   properties. The ratio between the water and oil intake is much higher
   than the ratio between the water and oil capillary pressures, even for
   the non-swelling shales. The comparative study indicates that the water
   intake of organic shales is controlled by both adsorption and
   capillarity.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltene hierarchical aggregation contributes to water-in-oil (W/O)

   well-defined hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails and, thus, do not
   have amphiphilic character. Therefore, they are not similar to
   surfactants and cannot stabilize emulsions the way classic emulsifiers

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a perturbation-based theoretical model on the

   the rate of average transport, quantified by the corresponding band
   velocity of a traveling asphaltene plug, is lowered by an increase in
   the Damkohler number, suggesting that the aggregation event lowers the
   flow rate of an asphaltene sample. Also, the average spread of the
   channel centerline concentration, described by a Gaussian profile and
   dictated primarily by the axial dispersion (and not Taylor dispersion,
   in light of the small Peclet number) increases with the Damkohler
   number. The net effect is a distinctly noticeable separation of

Abstract = {{We investigate the evolution of copper phthalocyanine thin films as they

   a result of the ion bombardment; a planar surface quickly becomes an
   array of nanopillars which are less than 20 nm in diameter. The changes
   in morphology are independent of plasma power, which controls the etch
   rate only. Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that
   surface concentrations of copper and oxygen increase with etch time,
   while carbon and nitrogen are depleted. Despite these changes in surface
   stoichiometry, we observe no effect on the work function. The absorbance
   and X-ray diffraction spectra show no changes other than the peaks
   diminishing with etch time. These findings have important implications
   for organic photovoltaic devices which seek nanopillar thin films of
   metal phthalocyanine materials as an optimal structure.}},

   of research. We report here the synthesis and characterization of
   biodegradable, temperature- and pH-sensitive carbohydrate-based cationic
   nanogels as effective gene delivery carriers to Hep G2 cells. The
   temperature-sensitive property of the nanogels allows their facile
   complexation of DNA, while the pH-sensitive property allows the
   degradation of nanogels followed by the release of plasmid in the
   endosome. The nanogels are synthesized via reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) technique
   and are evaluated for their DNA condensation efficacy. The gene delivery
   efficacies of these nanogels are subsequently studied and it is found
   that these cationic glyconanogels can serve as potent gene delivery
   vectors in hepatocytes. It is found that the gene delivery efficacies of
   this system are similar to that of branched poly(ethyleneimine), which
   is used as a positive control. Moreover, these nanogels show desirable

Abstract = {{In the course of developing a microfluidic analytical platform
   incorporating the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent
   capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis for a variety of bio-assays, we
   examined PCR inhibition through surface interactions with the chip
   materials. Our devices perform PCR in a three-layer chip, a
   glass-poly(dimethylsiloxane)-glass sandwich in which the
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS, a silicone rubber) layer is used for
   pneumatic membrane pumping and valving of the PCR reagents. Initial
   on-chip PCR-CE tests of BK virus replicated in multiple uncoated chips
   showed variable results, usually yielding no detectable product at the
   target sample concentrations used. Subsequent ``chip-flush{''}
   experiments, where water or reagents were flushed through a chip and
   subsequently incorporated in off-chip PCR, highlighted bovine serum
   albumin (BSA) amongst other pre-treatments, chip materials and PCR
   recipes as being effective in mitigating inhibition. When the BSA
   channel pre-coating was applied to on-chip PCR-CE experiments, a
   substantial improvement (10x to 40x) in signal-to-noise (S/N) of the CE
   product peak was conferred, and was shown with high confidence despite
   high S/N variability. This is the first study to quantitatively examine
   BSA's ability to reduce inhibition of PCR performed on PDMS chips, and
   one of very few microfluidic PCR inhibition studies of any kind to use a
   large number of microfluidic chips (similar to 400). The simplicity and
   effectiveness of our BSA coating suggest that passivating materials
   applied to microfluidic device channel networks may provide a viable
   pathway for development of bio-compatible devices with reduced
   complexity and cost.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we focus on a class of nonlinear systems and design an

   capable of optimizing closed-loop performance with respect to general
   economic considerations taken into account in the construction of the
   cost function. Working with the class of full-state feedback
   linearizable nonlinear systems, we use a high-gain observer to estimate
   the nonlinear system state using output measurements and a
   Lyapunov-based approach to design an economic MPC system that uses the
   observer state estimates. We prove, using singular perturbation
   arguments, that the closed-loop system is practically stable provided
   the observer gain is sufficiently large. We use a chemical process
   example to demonstrate the ability of the state-estimation-based
   economic MPC to achieve process time-varying operation that leads to a
   superior cost performance metric compared to steady-state operation
   using the same amount of reactant material. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper considers a multiuser single-relay wireless network, where
   the relay gets paid for helping users forward signals, and the users pay
   to receive the relay service. We study the relay power allocation and
   pricing problems and model the interaction between the users and the
   relay as a two-level Stackelberg game. In this game, the relay, which is
   modeled as the service provider and the leader of the game, sets the
   relay price to maximize its revenue, whereas the users are modeled as
   customers and followers who buy power from the relay for higher
   transmission rates. We use a bargaining game to model the negotiation
   among users to achieve a fair allocation of relay power. Based on the
   proposed fair relay power allocation rule, the optimal relay power price
   that maximizes the relay revenue is derived analytically. Simulation
   shows that the proposed power allocation scheme achieves higher network
   sum rate and relay revenue than the even power allocation. Furthermore,
   compared with the sum-rate-optimal solution, simulation shows that the
   proposed scheme achieves better fairness with comparable network sum
   rate for a wide range of network scenarios. The proposed pricing and
   power allocation solutions are also shown to be consistent with the laws
   of supply and demand.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of elastic deformation on the anodic dissolution of X70 steel
   have been investigated in 0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4 solution. In the active
   region, the elastic stress exerts no obvious influence on the active
   dissolution rate of the specimen. However, in the oscillatory region, it
   leads to a marked increase in the frequency of current oscillations,
   while the mode remains essentially the same. In the passive region, it
   induces oscillations at the initial stage, but shows no significant
   effect on the passive current when the potential is controlled at the
   more positive stage. Two explanations are postulated: the elastic
   deformation degrades the stability and increases the defects of the
   passive film: it increases the surface energy (Delta G(s)), causing the
   effective potential (E-v) to move negative. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study are to quantitatively evaluate, using a
   wetting model, the wettability of three probe liquids with different
   properties on heat-treated jack pine surfaces prepared by three
   different types of machining (sanding, planing and sawing) and to
   compare with those of untreated wood surfaces. The results indicate that
   the heat-treated wood is wetted less than the untreated wood due to
   degradation of wood components (hemicelluloses, lignin and cellulose)
   during heat treatment and it absorbs less liquid. The heat-treated wood
   becomes most hydrophobic when wood surfaces are sanded by 180-grit paper
   compared to those prepared by other machining process. Heat-treated wood
   surfaces are strongly acidic similar to those of untreated wood.
   Consequently, the basic probe liquid, formamide, shows the highest

Abstract = {{Understanding the molecular mechanism of DNA aggregation and
   condensation is of importance to DNA packaging in cells, and
   applications of gene delivery therapy. Modifying polycations such as
   polyethylenimine with lipid substitution was found to improve the
   performance of polycationic gene carriers. However, the role of the
   lipid substitution in DNA binding and aggregation is not clear and
   remains to be probed at the molecular level. In this work, we elucidated
   the role of lipid substitution through a series of all-atom molecular
   dynamics simulations on DNA aggregation mediated by lipid modified
   polyethylenimine (lmPEI). We found that the lipids associate
   significantly with one another, which links the lmPEIs and serves as a
   mechanism of aggregating the DNAs and stabilizing the formed polyplex.
   In addition, some lipid tails on the lmPEIs stay at the periphery of the
   lmPEI/DNA polyplex and may provide a mechanism for hydrophobic
   interactions. The enhanced stability and hydrophobicity might contribute
   to better cellular uptake of the polyplexes.}},

Abstract = {{To improve construction productivity and performance, it must be
   measured. The Construction Sector Council (CSC) has started a Labour
   Productivity and Project Performance Benchmarking Program for the
   infrastructure sector of the construction industry in Canada. Metrics
   were developed for project cost, time, safety, and quality performance;
   labour productivity; rework; project conditions; and management
   practices related to health and safety. Data from 19 projects located in
   different regions of Canada were collected and analyzed. Based on the
   results and on industry feedback, additional metrics for practices
   related to project planning, materials management, and construction
   supervisory skills development were developed. This paper describes the
   development of the program. Lessons learned during the development and
   implementation of the benchmarking and metrics program are summarized
   and steps to establish a sustainable program are identified. It is
   concluded that a successful program is feasible and has the potential to

Abstract = {{Construction projects are usually labour intensive, and human resource
   (HR) issues contribute significantly to a project's final costs. From
   this perspective, a tool that can help construction managers reduce
   their HR costs can potentially generate improvement in the project cost.
   In this paper we propose a simulation-based approach that sheds light on
   the dynamics of workforce skill evolution as the project progresses,
   thereby assisting construction managers in adjusting their HR policies.
   The proposed approach uses a system dynamics (SD) simulation model that
   dynamically tracks the effects of alternative HR policies. After the
   development and validation of the SD model, the SD model is extended to
   capture operational details and their interaction with workforce skill
   evolution, adopting a hybrid SD and discrete event simulation (DES). The
   hybrid model has been applied to an experimental case of structural
   steel fabrication projects, in which we demonstrate that there is a
   considerable room for cost-saving in HR. The hybrid modeling approach
   introduced in this paper can be employed by construction managers for
   possible improvements in HR management, as well as researchers for an
   in-depth understanding of the dynamics in workforce skill evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Contractor default is one of the major risks that threaten a project's
   success in the construction industry. Previous studies have focused
   mainly on evaluation of the contractor's financial aspects to predict
   contractor default. There remains a need for a comprehensive model that
   has the ability to incorporate the evaluation of all the project
   aspects, project team, contractual risks, and project management
   evaluation criteria to predict the possibility of a contractor's default
   on a specific construction project. This paper presents a contractor
   default prediction model (CDPM) from the surety bonding perspective that
   incorporates these criteria and uses a fuzzy inference system for
   reasoning. The CDPM provides a more objective, structured, and
   comprehensive approach for contractor default prediction for surety
   practitioners, project owners, and for self-assessment by contractors to
   reduce the risk of contractor default. The multi-attribute utility
   function was used to develop a group consensus system (GCS) to aggregate
   the participating experts' opinions to build the CDPM. The accuracy of
   the GCS was found to be 91.1\%. A novel approach for fuzzy rule base
   development is applied to develop the rule base for the CDPM. The CDPM
   was validated using 30 contractor default prediction cases, and the
   accuracy was found to be 86.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{The factory-based modular construction process has proven to increase
   the speed of construction, and improve quality and safety, while
   providing value to the customer and a rapid return on investment to the
   builder and owner. However, onsite module assembly creates new schedule
   demands, as activities are scheduled on a minute-by-minute basis;
   therefore simulation of the process becomes essential at early stages of
   a project. Although simulation proves to be an effective tool for
   project engineers to assess complex construction operations, it remains
   a symbolic base model with no visual link to the actual physical shape
   and look of the project's activities. This paper presents the
   application of integrated simulation and post simulation visualization
   as a tool to assist the modular construction industry in scheduling
   onsite installation of prefabricated modules. The proposed methodology
   uses simulation model output as an ASCII file in a binary format and
   imports this ASCII file to 3D Studio Max to perform the animation. The
   output from the high level simulation model is transformed into
   frames/second in 3D Studio Max. The proposed methodology was tested on
   the planned construction of a 34-storey building in Brooklyn, New York,
   USA. Simulation visualization of the process proved to be effective in
   communicating the value and simplicity of a minute-by-minute schedule.
   Based on the output information, the most efficient solutions were
   generated. The use of post simulation visualization was effective in
   analyzing the construction methods of the case study which consisted of
   950 structural steel modules. Issues related to construction activities'
   productivity were synchronized to achieve onsite installation of the
   project in only 56 working days.}},

Abstract = {{The state-of-the-art tracking technologies, such as the global

   methodology to realize automated and continuous tracking of construction
   resources. The emerging ZigBee-based wireless sensor networks (WSN)
   technology is introduced. A framework of WSN application is proposed for
   indoor construction resources tracking, which consists of a group of
   stationary and mobile sensor nodes that can communicate with one

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the channel estimations in a relay network with
   multiple transmit and receive antennas, including the estimation of the
   end-to-end channel matrix and the individual estimation of the
   transmitter-relay channels and the relay-receiver channels. For the
   end-to-end channel estimation, instead of directly estimating entries of
   the channel matrix, we use singular value decomposition (SVD) and
   estimate its largest singular value and singular vectors, which are then
   combined to form an estimation of the channel matrix. An approximate
   maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation is proposed, which is shown to become
   the exact ML estimation when the time duration of each training step
   equals the number of antennas at the transmitter. Simulation on the mean
   square error (MSE) shows that the SVD-based approximate ML estimation
   performs about the same as the exact ML estimation and is superior to
   entry-based estimations. For the individual channel estimation, we
   decompose each channel vector into the product of its length and
   direction, and find the ML estimation of each. By using an approximation
   on the probability density function (PDF) of the observations during
   training, an analytical ML estimation is derived. The ML estimation with
   the exact PDF is also investigated and a solution is obtained
   numerically. Simulation on the MSE shows that the two have similar
   performance. Compared with cascade channel estimations, its performance
   is superior for the relay-receiver channel estimation and comparable for
   the transmitter-relay channel estimation. Extension to the general
   multiple-antenna multiple-relay network is also provided.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Two new transmit/receive (Tx/Rx) antenna selection strategies are
   proposed and analyzed for two-way multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks. These two strategies select the
   best transmit and receive antennas at the two sources and the relay
   based on (i) minimizing the overall outage probability and (ii)
   maximizing the sum-rate. The performance of these selection strategies
   is quantified by deriving the overall outage probability, its high SNR
   approximation and the diversity order providing valuable insights into
   practical system-designs. Importantly, multiple relay and multiple user
   two-way relay network set-ups are also treated by proposing and
   analyzing (i) joint relay and antenna selection strategies, and (ii)
   joint user, relay and antenna selection strategies, respectively.
   Interestingly, our outage probability results reveal that the joint
   relay and antenna selection strategies achieve significant diversity and
   array gains over those of their single relay counterparts. In fact, the
   diversity orders of individual relayed-branches accumulate to yield the
   overall diversity of the multi-relay networks. For example, at 10(-2)
   outage probability, the dual-antenna relay provides a 14 dB gain over a
   single-antenna relay, and having two dual-antenna relays improves the
   gain by another 5 dB. Moreover, the performance degradation due to
   practical transmission impairments (i) feedback delays, (ii)
   spatially-correlated fading and (iii) non-identically distributed fading
   is quantified. Impact of channel prediction to circumvent outdated
   channel state information for antenna selection due to feedback delay is
   also studied. All the derivations are validated through Monte-Carlo
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In tone reservation (TR) based OFDM systems, the peak to average power
   ratio (PAPR) reduction performance mainly depends on the selection of
   the peak reduction tone (PRT) set and the optimal target clipping level.
   Finding the optimal PRT set requires an exhaustive search of all
   combinations of possible PRT sets, which is a nondeterministic
   polynomial-time (NP-hard) problem, and this search is infeasible for the
   number of tones used in practical systems. The existing selection
   methods, such as the consecutive PRT set, equally spaced PRT set and
   random PRT set, perform poorly compared to the optimal PRT set or incur
   high computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient scheme based
   on genetic algorithm (GA) with lower computational complexity is
   proposed for searching a nearly optimal PRT set. While TR-based clipping
   is simple and attractive for practical implementation, determining the
   optimal target clipping level is difficult. To overcome this problem, we
   propose an adaptive clipping control algorithm. Simulation results show
   that our proposed algorithms efficiently obtain a nearly optimal PRT set
   and good PAPR reductions.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Cartilage cryopreservation requires optimal loading of protective
   solutes, most commonly dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), to maximize
   chondrocyte survival. Previously, diffusion models have been used to
   predict the distribution of solutes in tissue samples, but the accuracy
   of spatiotemporal predictions of these models have not been validated
   with empirical studies and remains unknown.
   Objective: In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging was
   used to measure the spatial and temporal changes in DMSO and water
   concentrations in porcine articular cartilage plugs, throughout 1 h of
   solute loading.
   Design: A custom NMR spectroscopic imaging pulse sequence provided water
   and DMSO concentration images with an in-plane spatial resolution of 135
   mu m and a temporal resolution of 150 s, repeated for 60 min throughout
   DMSO loading. Delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance of
   cartilage (d-GEMRIC) imaging provided fixed charge density and
   spin-density imaging provided water density images prior to DMSO
   loading.
   Results: The measured spatial and temporal distribution of DMSO in three
   different samples was compared to independent predictions of Fick's law
   and the modified triphasic biomechanical model by Abazari etal. (2011)
   with the empirical data more closely agreeing with the triphasic model.
   Conclusion: Dynamic NMR spectroscopic imaging can measure spatial and
   temporal changes in water and cryoprotectant concentrations in articular
   cartilage. The modified triphasic model predictions for the interstitial

Abstract = {{In spite of practical relevance, little effort has been made to analyze
   the effect of geometrical shape of cross-section on thermoelastic
   dissipation of micro/nano beams under different surface thermal
   condition. The present paper aims to study thermoelastic dissipation of
   micro/nano beams of elliptical, triangular or arbitrary rectangular
   cross-section with accurate satisfaction of the surface thermal
   condition. Detailed formulas are derived for quality (Q-) factor of
   beams of the above-mentioned cross-sections. Our results show that for
   all cross-section discussed, thermoelastic dissipation is a
   non-monotonic function of the absolute size of the cross-section
   provided the beam length is fixed, and the maximum dissipation appears
   at a specific size which is of the order of a few hundreds of nanometers
   for examples discussed. These results suggest that thermoelastic
   dissipation could increase with decreasing cross-sectional size within
   the micron scale, while it could decrease with decreasing
   cross-sectional size within the nano scale. In general, for all beams of
   the above-mentioned cross-sections, the Q-factor for isothermal surface
   is always higher than the Q-factor for adiabatic surface under otherwise
   identical conditions at micro/nano scales. The present analysis also
   indicates that, to achieve a high quality factor, beam resonators with
   elliptical or triangular cross-sections are best to operate at higher
   frequencies while beams of rectangular cross-sections are best to
   operate at lower frequencies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Self-cycling fermentation (SCF), a cyclical, semi-continuous process
   that induces cell synchrony, was incorporated into a recombinant protein
   production scheme. Escherichia coli CY15050, a lac- mutant lysogenized
   with temperature-sensitive phage lambda modified to over-express
   beta-galactosidase, was used as a model system. The production scheme
   was divided into two de-coupled stages. The host cells were cultured
   under SCF operation in the first stage before being brought to a second
   stage where protein production was induced. In the first stage, the host
   strain demonstrated a stable cycling pattern immediately following the
   first cycle. This reproducible pattern was maintained over the course of
   the experiments and a significant degree of cell synchrony was obtained.
   By growing cells using SCF, productivity increased 50\% and production
   time decreased by 40\% compared to a batch culture under similar
   conditions. In addition, synchronized cultures induced from the end of a
   SCF cycle displayed shorter lysis times and a more complete culture-wide
   lysis than unsynchronized cultures. Finally, protein synthesis was
   influenced by the time at which the lytic phase was induced in the cell
   life cycle. For example, induction of a synchronized culture immediately
   prior to cell division resulted in the maximum protein productivity,
   suggesting protein production can be optimized with respect to the cell
   life cycle using SCF. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012;109: 22622270. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper reports the removal of ten target metals of environmental
   concern (Cr-53, Mn, Co, Ni-60, Cu-65, Zn-66, As, Sr-88, Mo-95, and Ba)
   from oil sands tailings pond water. The organism responsible for removal
   was found to be an indigenous green micro-alga identified as
   Parachlorella kessleri by sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene. P. kessleri
   grew in tailings pond water samples taken from two oil sands operators
   (Syncrude Canada Ltd. and Albian Sands Energy Inc.), and enriched with
   low (0.24 mM NO3- and 0.016 mM PO4-3) and high (1.98 mM NO3- and 0.20 mM
   PO4-3) concentrations of nutrient supplements (the most realistic
   scenario).
   The removal of Ni-60, Cu-65, As, Sr-88, Mo-95, and Ba from Syncrude
   tailings pond water was significantly enhanced by high concentrations of
   nitrogen and phosphorus, whereas the high nutrient concentrations
   adversely affected the removal of Co, Ni-60, As, Sr-88, and Mo in
   samples of Albian tailings pond water. Based on ANOVA two-factor
   analysis, higher nutrient concentration does not always result in higher
   metal removal, and TPW source must also be considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Corrosion of components in a recovery boiler is a major problem faced by
   the pulp and paper industry. The superheater tubes become severely
   corroded due to the presence of sulfidic gases in the boiler and molten
   salts which are deposited on the surface of the tubes. As a result, the
   boiler must be decommissioned for expensive maintenance and repairs.
   Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings have been shown to provide
   corrosion resistance when applied on gas turbines operating at high
   temperatures. Air plasma-sprayed YSZ environmental barrier coatings on
   Type 309 stainless steel were exposed to three different corrosive
   environments: Test A-600 A degrees C, salt vapors, flue gases, 168 h;
   Test B-600 A degrees C, molten salt, air, 168 h; and Test C-600 A
   degrees C, molten salt, flue gases, 168 h. Two different types of YSZ
   coatings-conventional YSZ and nanostructured YSZ-were tested to study
   their resistance to corrosion and molten salt penetration. The
   performances of both types of coatings were evaluated, and a comparative
   study was conducted. It was found that the nanostructured YSZ samples
   protected the stainless steel substrate better than their conventional
   counterparts. This superior performance was attributed to the presence
   of semi-molten nano-agglomerates present in the coating microstructure,
   which acted as collection points for the penetrating molten salts.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing recognition for the need to develop high quality
   use case models from the professional and academic communities. Quality
   in use case models is of particular importance when they are utilized
   within a use case driven development process, whereby every aspect of
   development is driven by the models and influenced by their quality.
   Many practitioners and researchers have provided guidelines, suggestions
   and techniques to construct high quality use case models. This
   invaluable body of knowledge is disseminated across numerous literature
   resources. Without unifying this knowledge into one resource, it cannot
   be expected that a use case modeler would be fully aware of the entire
   body of knowledge and benefitting from it. This paper presents a
   systematic review that was conducted in order to identify and amalgamate
   this knowledge. The amalgamated knowledge is presented in a unified
   form, specifically as a set of 26 anti-patterns, which modelers can use
   to improve the quality of their models.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing production costs for fermentation-based drugs (e.g.,
   antibiotics) is crucial for the long-term sustainability of healthcare.
   In this study, we propose a novel low-intensity pulsed ultrasound
   (LIPUS) stimulation scheme using a nominal frequency of 1.5 MHz with a
   20\% duty cycle (200 mu s ultrasound on and 800 mu s ultrasound off) to
   increase production of fermentation-based drugs. We chose Penicillium
   brevicompactum as a model system to demonstrate the performance of our
   LIPUS system. Penicillium brevicompactum can produce mycophenolic acid
   (MPA), an immunosuppressive agent commonly used to prevent rejection
   after organ transplantation. We have stimulated Penicillium
   brevicompactum in 50 mL shake flasks using LIPUS during its
   fermentation. After a series of screening experiments to optimize
   ultrasound parameters (e.g., ultrasound intensities, treatment duration
   and treatment frequency per day), it was concluded that ultrasound
   stimulation can increase MPA production by as much as 60\% when treated
   eight times a day for 10-min durations at an intensity (spatial peak
   temporal average) of 200 mW/cm(2). These findings elucidate a new
   approach to reduce the cost of producing fermentation-based drugs.

Abstract = {{Semi-supervised learning is one of the important topics in machine
   learning, concerning with pattern classification where only a small
   subset of data is labeled. In this paper, a new network-based (or
   graph-based) semi-supervised classification model is proposed. It
   employs a combined random-greedy walk of particles, with competition and
   cooperation mechanisms, to propagate class labels to the whole network.
   Due to the competition mechanism, the proposed model has a local label
   spreading fashion, i.e., each particle only visits a portion of nodes
   potentially belonging to it, while it is not allowed to visit those
   nodes definitely occupied by particles of other classes. In this way, a
   ``divide-and-conquer{''} effect is naturally embedded in the model. As a
   result, the proposed model can achieve a good classification rate while
   exhibiting low computational complexity order in comparison to other
   network-based semi-supervised algorithms. Computer simulations carried
   out for synthetic and real-world data sets provide a numeric
   quantification of the performance of the method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust closed-loop strategy for control of depth
   of hypnosis. The proposed method regulates the electroencephalogram
   (EEG)-derived WAV(CNS) index as measure of hypnosis by manipulating
   intravenous propofol administration. In contrast to many existing
   closed-loop control methods for hypnosis drug delivery, the control
   design presented in this paper produces stability and robustness against
   uncertainty by explicitly accounting for the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
   pharmacodynamic (PD) variability between individuals, as well as the
   unexpected surgical stimulation and anesthetic-analgesic interaction
   that the closed-loop control is required to tolerate. This robust
   closed-loop controller was evaluated in comparison with a heuristically
   tuned proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller using a
   simulated surgical procedure on 44 patients whose PK and PD models were
   identified using real clinical data. The results demonstrate that the
   robust control strategy can deliver propofol to yield consistent and
   acceptable closed-loop induction and maintenance phase responses over
   wide-ranging PK and PD differences (mean rise and settling times of 4
   min and 7 min and mean overshoot of less than 8\%, which meets
   anesthesiologists' response specifications), whereas its PID control
   counterpart exhibits limitations in performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In order to reduce artifacts in match metric and improve the

   improved nearest neighbor (NN) interpolators based on confidence region
   (CR) are studied. These improved NN interpolators include: (1) NN based

   stochastic confidence region (SCR), SCRNN; (3) NN based on confidence
   region integrating deterministic information and stochastic information
   (DSCR), DSCRNN. The values of normalized mutual information (NMI) are
   deterministic and accurate at any grid translation position when any
   improved NN interpolator is used. The smoothness of the NMI curves is
   compared by applying DCRNN, SCRNN, and DSCRNN interpolators to rigid
   medical image registration with different numbers of intensity bins and
   random variables. The results of tests show that the new DSCRNN
   interpolator outperforms DCRNN and SCRNN in curve smoothness and

Abstract = {{Microalloyed steels are used widely in oil and gas pipelines. They are a
   class of high-strength, low-carbon steels that contain small additions
   (in amounts less than 0.1 wt pct) of Nb, Ti, and/or V. The steels may
   contain other alloying elements, such as Mo, in amounts exceeding 0.1 wt
   pct. Precipitation in these steels can be controlled through
   thermomechanical-controlled processing, leading to precipitates with
   sizes that range from several microns to a few nanometers. Microalloyed
   steels have good strength, good toughness, and excellent weldability,
   which are attributed in part to the presence of the nanosized carbide
   and carbonitride precipitates. Because of their fine sizes, wide
   particle size distribution, and low volume fractions, conventional
   microscopic methods are not satisfactory for quantifying these
   precipitates. Matrix dissolution is a promising alternative to extract
   the precipitates for quantification. Relatively large volumes of
   material can be analyzed so that statistically significant quantities of
   precipitates of different sizes are collected. In this article, the
   microstructure features of a series of microalloyed steels (X70, X80,
   and X100) as well as a Grade 100 steel are characterized using optical
   microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A chemical
   dissolution technique is used to extract the precipitates from the
   steels. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) are combined to analyze the chemical composition of these
   precipitates. Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns is used to
   quantify fully the relative amounts of these precipitates. The size
   distribution of the nanosized precipitates is quantified using
   dark-field imaging (DF) in the TEM. The effects of microalloying
   content, finish rolling temperature (FRT), and coiling temperature
   (CT)/interrupted cooling temperature (ICT) on the grain size and the
   amount of nanoprecipitation are discussed. Individual strengthening
   contributions from grain size effects, solid-solution strengthening, and
   precipitation strengthening are quantified to understand fully the
   strengthening mechanisms for these steels.}},

Abstract = {{The energy sector is moving into the era of distributed generation (DG)
   and microgrids (MGs). The stability and operation aspects of
   converter-dominated DG MGs, however, are faced by many challenges.
   Important among these, are: 1) the absence of physical inertia; 2)
   comparable size of power converters; 3) mutual interactions among
   generators; 4) islanding detection delays; and 5) large sudden
   disturbances associated with transition to islanded mode, grid
   restoration, and load power changes. To overcome these difficulties,
   this paper presents a new large-signal-based control topology for DG
   power converters that is suitable for both grid-connected and islanding
   modes of operation without any need to reconfigure the control system
   and without islanding detection. To improve MG stability, the proposed
   control structure is realized via two steps. First, an emulated inertia
   and damping functions are adopted. Second, to guarantee stability and
   high performance of the MG system during sudden harsh transients such as
   islanding, grid reconnection, and large load power changes, a nonlinear
   MG stabilizer is proposed. An augmented converter model is developed and
   used to design the MG stabilizer via the adaptive backstepping (AB)
   technique to guarantee large-angle stability and robustness against

Abstract = {{Hybrid ac/dc power networks are recently emerged in distribution
   generation (DG) systems with widespread acceptance under the smart grids
   environment. However, system-level dynamic interactions might be yielded
   due to the active control nature and tight regulation of power
   converters to meet load/generation requirements. This paper presents an
   assessment and mitigation strategies of such interactions in hybrid
   networks. A typical and comprehensive hybrid network composed of a DG
   power park, dc microgrid, islanded ac microgrid interfaced by
   voltage-source converter (VSC), and a grid-connected VSC is considered.
   Mathematical modeling and analysis of the input/output admittances of
   these entities are provided to evaluate the overall system stability
   based on the Nyquist admittance ratio criterion. It can be shown that
   the tight regulation of VSCs introduces incremental negative admittances
   reflected to the common dc link which significantly degrades the system
   stability. Therefore, active compensators are proposed to actively
   reshape the input dc-side admittance of the VSCs so that the Nyquist
   criterion is satisfied. Time-domain-large signal model of a typical
   hybrid network is implemented to validate the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their undoubted advantages, Distributed Generation (DG) systems
   can negatively impact some aspects of the distribution system operation.
   In this paper, impacts of inverter-based DGs on fuse-recloser
   coordination in the fuse-saving protection scheme are thoroughly
   studied. Various fault conditions with different fault resistances and
   the effects of different DG locations are investigated. Also, the
   effects of DG reactive power injection, known as a DG potential
   ancillary service, on the protection scheme are studied. Furthermore, in
   order to mitigate the impact of DG on the protection coordination, a
   simple and effective control strategy is proposed. This strategy limits
   the DG output current according to the DG terminal voltage. Extensive
   simulations at different fault conditions and different DG penetration
   levels showed that the proposed control method is able to eliminate DG's
   contribution during the fault, and consequently eliminate its impact on
   the fuse-recloser coordination. In comparison to other methods, this
   strategy is inexpensive, easy to implement, does not limit DG capacity
   during normal condition, and does not require any change in the original
   protection system. The simulation results also demonstrated that the
   proposed method is robust against non-fault transient disturbances such
   as load switching, starting of induction motors, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the concept of microgrids (clusters of distributed generation,
   energy storage units, and reactive power sources serving a cluster of
   distributed loads in grid-connected and isolated grid modes) has gained
   a lot of interest under the smart grid vision. However, there is a
   strong need to develop systematic procedure for optimal construction of
   microgrids. This paper presents systematic and optimized approaches for
   clustering of the distribution system into a set of virtual microgrids
   with optimized self-adequacy. The probabilistic characteristics of
   distributed generation (DG) units are also considered by defining two
   new probabilistic indices representing real and reactive power of the
   lines. Next, the advantages of installing both distributed energy
   storage resources (DESRs) and distributed reactive sources (DRSs) are
   investigated to improve the self-adequacy of the constructed
   micro-grids. The new strategy facilitates robust infrastructure for
   smart distribution systems operational control functions, such as
   self-healing, by using virtual microgrids as building blocks in future
   distribution systems. The problem formulation and solution algorithms
   are presented in this paper. The well-known PG\&E 69-bus distribution
   system is selected as a test case and through several sensitivity
   studies, the effect of the total DESRs or DRSs capacities on the design
   and the robustness of the algorithm are investigated.}},

   This paper presents an intelligent power factor compensation controller

   algorithms are proposed for the purpose of easy implementation in a

   sensing devices and does not require additional measurements. As a
   result, the proposed controller can be constructed as a retrofitting

Abstract = {{Inspired from biological systems, small synthetic organic molecules
   expressing the hydrogen bonding arrays of the DNA bases guanine and
   cytosine were prepared, and their self-assembly into rosette nanotubes
   (RNTs) was investigated. Due to their unique biological,
   physicochemical, and mechanical properties, RNTs could serve as the next
   generation of injectable orthopedic materials. In this study, a
   self-assembling module (termed twin base linkers or TBL) was
   synthesized, and the corresponding RNTs were used as bioactive
   components in composites of poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA)
   and hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles (termed TBL/HA/pHEMA). The
   properties of these composites were characterized for solidification
   time, surface morphology, mechanical properties, and cytocompatibility.
   The experimental conditions were optimized to achieve solidification
   within 2-40 min, offering a range of properties for orthopedic
   applications. Composites with 20wt\% HA nanoparticles had a compressive
   strength (37.1 MPa) and an ultimate tensile stress (14.7 MPa) similar to
   that of a natural vertebral disc (5-30 MPa). Specifically, the TBL (0.01
   mg/mL)/HA(20wt\%)/pHEMA composites improved long-term functions of
   osteoblasts (or bone-forming cells) in terms of collagen synthesis,
   alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium deposition. Moreover, this
   composite inhibited fibroblast adhesion, thus decreasing the potential
   for undesirable fibrous tissue formation. In summary, this in vitro
   study provided evidence that TBL/HA/pHEMA composites are promising
   injectable orthopedic implant materials that warrant further mechanistic
   and in vivo studies.}},

Abstract = {{Articular cartilage injuries do not heal and large defects result in
   osteoarthritis with major personal and socioeconomic costs.
   Osteochondral transplantation is an effective treatment for large joint
   defects but its use is limited by the inability to store cartilage for
   long periods of time. Cryopreservation/vitrification is one method to
   enable banking of this tissue but decades of research have been unable
   to successfully preserve the tissue while maintaining cartilage on its
   bone base - a requirement for transplantation. To address this
   limitation, human knee articular cartilage from total knee arthroplasty
   patients and deceased donors was exposed to specified concentrations of
   4 different cryoprotective agents for mathematically determined periods
   of time at lowering temperatures. After complete exposure, the cartilage
   was immersed in liquid nitrogen for up to 3 months. Cell viability was
   75.4 +/- 12.1\% determined by membrane integrity stains and confirmed
   with a mitochondrial assay and pellet culture documented production of
   sulfated glycosaminoglycans and collagen II similar to controls. This

Title = {{A genetic reduction of feature space in the design of fuzzy models}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The two fundamental conflicting requirements of fuzzy modeling, namely
   accuracy and transparency (interpretability) have resulted in a plethora
   of design methodologies and ensuing architectures of fuzzy models. This
   study contributes to the ongoing approaches to the enhancement of
   interpretability of fuzzy models by focusing on the reduction of input
   space in which such models are constructed. Fuzzy clustering realized
   through Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is carried out in the input space of reduced
   dimensionality and the information granules obtained in such space are
   used to form a series of local models of the rule-based fuzzy model. The
   reduction of the input space is a problem of combinatorial nature and to
   solve this task, considered is the optimization scheme of genetic
   algorithms. In this sense, the feature (input) space reduction is
   realized by a wrapper algorithm, where the objective function guiding
   its development of the input space expresses the performance of the
   resulting fuzzy model. The design utilizes two commonly encountered
   concepts and functional constructs of fuzzy models, viz. information
   granules built in the reduced input space and a collection of local
   linear models forming the conclusion parts of the rules. Considering the
   well-established architecture of fuzzy models, the main objective of
   this study is to present a way of an efficient reduction of the input
   space leading to the enhanced interpretability of the fuzzy models and
   investigate and quantify possibilities of optimization of fuzzy models
   with regard. The underlying design issues being of particular practical
   interest in this modeling context deal with the dependencies between the
   level of reduction of the input space versus the granularity of the
   fuzzy model (viz. the number of its rules) and a quantification of an
   impact of the parameters of the granules (fuzzification coefficient) on
   the performance of the obtained model. The experimental studies
   highlighting the numerical aspects of the design comprise
   experimentation with synthetic data and those publicly available at
   several data sites. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Heart failure is an epidemic in the elderly and has become a leading
   cause for hospitalization and death. Heart failure with preserved
   ejection fraction (HFPEF) is more common than heart failure with reduced
   ejection fraction (HFREF) but disease identification remains
   challenging. Current criteria rely on symptoms of poor exercise
   tolerance, preserved ejection fraction and laboratory evidence for
   elevated filling pressures. Each of these clinical parameters is
   difficult to evaluate in the elderly and reduce the certainty of
   diagnosis. Aging is associated with changes in the peripheral
   vasculature, pulmonary function, oxygen transport and skeletal muscle
   function, all key determinants of exercise capacity. Furthermore,
   co-morbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are
   common in the elderly and cloud the interpretation of symptoms. The
   choice of ejection fraction (EF) 45-50\% as preserved appears arbitrary
   as there is evidence that the lower limit for EF in elderly women is
   much higher. B-type natriuretic peptide has emerged as a popular blood
   biomarker of heart failure and increased filling pressures but appears
   to have trouble discriminating HFPEF from normal elderly controls.
   Regardless of the difficulties in diagnosis, several population studies
   show that HFPEF incidence and prevalence are on the rise especially in
   those > 70 years of age. Co-morbid diseases are common in HFPEF, and
   these patients often die from non-cardiac causes. Future studies need to
   emphasize a holistic approach to HFPEF and identify whether there are
   diagnostic or therapeutic targets outside of the heart.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3984-3995}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{For the operation of autonomous microgrids, an important task is to
   share the load demand using multiple distributed generation (DG) units.
   In order to realize satisfied power sharing without the communication
   between DG units, the voltage droop control and its different variations
   have been reported in the literature. However, in a low-voltage
   microgrid, due to the effects of non-trivial feeder impedance, the
   conventional droop control is subject to the real and reactive power
   coupling and steady-state reactive power sharing errors. Furthermore,
   complex microgrid configurations (looped or mesh networks) often make
   the reactive power sharing more challenging. To improve the reactive
   power sharing accuracy, this paper proposes an enhanced control strategy
   that estimates the reactive power control error through injecting small
   real power disturbances, which is activated by the low-bandwidth
   synchronization signals from the central controller. At the same time, a
   slow integration term for reactive power sharing error elimination is
   added to the conventional reactive power droop control. The proposed
   compensation method achieves accurate reactive power sharing at the
   steady state, just like the performance of real power sharing through
   frequency droop control. Simulation and experimental results validate
   the feasibility of the proposed method.}},

   with Lipid-Substituted Polyethylenimines}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising approach for AML
   treatment as the siRNA molecule can be designed to specifically target
   proteins that contribute to aberrant cell proliferation in this disease.
   However, a clinical-relevant means of delivering siRNA molecules must be
   developed, as the cellular delivery of siRNA is problematic. Here, we
   report amphiphilic carriers combining a cationic polymer (2 kDa
   polyethyleneimine, PEI2) with lipophilic moieties to facilitate
   intracellular delivery of siRNA to AML cell lines. Complete binding of
   siRNA by the designed carriers was achieved at a polymer: siRNA ratio of
   similar to 0.5 and led to siRNA/polymer complexes of similar to 100 nm
   size. While the native PEI2 did not display cytotoxicity on AML cell
   lines THP-1, KG-1 and HL-60, lipid-modification on PEI2 slightly
   increased the cytotoxicity, which was consistent with increased
   interaction of polymers with cell membranes. Cellular delivery of siRNA
   was dependent on the nature of lipid substituent and the extent of lipid
   substitution, and varied among the three AML cell lines used. Linoleic
   acid-substituted polymers performed best among the prepared polymers and
   gave a siRNA delivery equivalent to better performing commercial
   reagents. Using THP-1 cells and a reporter (GFP) and an endogenous
   (CXCR4) target, effective silencing of the chosen targets was achieved
   with 25 to 50 nM of siRNA concentrations, and without adversely
   affecting subsequent cell growth. We conclude that lipid-substituted
   PEI2 can serve as an effective delivery of siRNA to leukemic cells and
   could be employed in molecular therapy of leukemia.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric black carbon (BC) warms Earth's climate, and its reduction
   has been targeted for near-term climate change mitigation. Models that
   include forcing by BC assume internal mixing with non-BC aerosol
   components that enhance BC absorption, often by a factor of similar to
   2; such model estimates have yet to be clearly validated through
   atmospheric observations. Here, direct in situ measurements of BC
   absorption enhancements (E-abs) and mixing state are reported for two
   California regions. The observed E-abs is small-6\% on average at 532
   nm-and increases weakly with photochemical aging. The E-abs is less than
   predicted from observationally constrained theoretical calculations,
   suggesting that many climate models may overestimate warming by BC.
   These ambient observations stand in contrast to laboratory measurements
   that show substantial E-abs for BC are possible.}},

Abstract = {{A new copper based bi-continuous composite was fabricated by
   infiltrating a preformed chromium carbide foam with molten copper at
   elevated temperature. The preformed chromium carbide foam was prepared
   using a reactive sintering process in a carbonaceous environment. The
   infiltration was conducted in a tube furnace under a reduction
   atmosphere with an ambient pressure. The obtained composite exhibited a
   homogenous structure with pronounced interfacial bonding. Some
   mechanical properties (hardness, elastic modulus) of the new composite
   were evaluated and compared with theoretically calculated values as well
   as other published composites. This composite shows relatively higher
   elastic property, which can be attributed to the feature of the
   bi-continuous homogeneous microstructure and the good interfacial
   bonding between the matrix phase and the reinforcing phase. (C) 2012

Title = {{Stochastic Boolean networks: An efficient approach to modeling gene
   regulatory networks}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Various computational models have been of interest due to
   their use in the modelling of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). As a
   logical model, probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) consider molecular
   and genetic noise, so the study of PBNs provides significant insights
   into the understanding of the dynamics of GRNs. This will ultimately
   lead to advances in developing therapeutic methods that intervene in the
   process of disease development and progression. The applications of
   PBNs, however, are hindered by the complexities involved in the
   computation of the state transition matrix and the steady-state
   distribution of a PBN. For a PBN with n genes and N Boolean networks,
   the complexity to compute the state transition matrix is O(nN2(2n)) or
   O(nN2(n)) for a sparse matrix.
   Results: This paper presents a novel implementation of PBNs based on the
   notions of stochastic logic and stochastic computation. This stochastic
   implementation of a PBN is referred to as a stochastic Boolean network
   (SBN). An SBN provides an accurate and efficient simulation of a PBN
   without and with random gene perturbation. The state transition matrix
   is computed in an SBN with a complexity of O(nL2(n)), where L is a
   factor related to the stochastic sequence length. Since the minimum
   sequence length required for obtaining an evaluation accuracy
   approximately increases in a polynomial order with the number of genes,
   n, and the number of Boolean networks, N, usually increases
   exponentially with n, L is typically smaller than N, especially in a
   network with a large number of genes. Hence, the computational
   efficiency of an SBN is primarily limited by the number of genes, but
   not directly by the total possible number of Boolean networks.
   Furthermore, a time-frame expanded SBN enables an efficient analysis of
   the steady-state distribution of a PBN. These findings are supported by
   the simulation results of a simplified p53 network, several randomly
   generated networks and a network inferred from a T cell immune response
   dataset. An SBN can also implement the function of an asynchronous PBN
   and is potentially useful in a hybrid approach in combination with a
   continuous or single-molecule level stochastic model.
   Conclusions: Stochastic Boolean networks (SBNs) are proposed as an
   efficient approach to modelling gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The SBN
   approach is able to recover biologically-proven regulatory behaviours,
   such as the oscillatory dynamics of the p53-Mdm2 network and the dynamic
   attractors in a T cell immune response network. The proposed approach
   can further predict the network dynamics when the genes are under
   perturbation, thus providing biologically meaningful insights for a
   better understanding of the dynamics of GRNs. The algorithms and methods
   described in this paper have been implemented in Matlab packages, which
   are attached as Additional files.}},

Abstract = {{Using a surface forces apparatus (SFA), we have directly measured the
   molecular and surface interactions of well-defined comb-type polymer
   polystyrene-graft-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-g-PEO). The interaction
   forces of PEO side chains end-functionalized with-OH were investigated
   in both symmetric (polymer. vs polymer) and asymmetric (polymer vs mica)
   configurations. Long-range repulsive forces were measured between the
   swollen polymer brushes in aqueous solutions, which were shown to have a
   steric origin and could be well described using the Alexander-de Gennes
   model. Contact angle measurement showed the water contact angle on
   PS-g-PEO surface decreased by over 20 degrees in about 1 min after the
   water droplet contacted with the polymer surface, which indicates that
   the PEO side chains are able to extend into water due to the strong van
   der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic PEO side
   chains and water. The extended PEO side chains can act as a swollen
   brush, leading to the strong steric forces measured by SFA. Atomic force
   microscippe (AFM) was also employed to provide complementary information
   regarding the surface morphology before and after the polymer was
   exposed to water. Solution ionic strength showed negligible impact on
   the molecular interactions of the comb type polymer. The surface energy
   of PS-g-PEO film was determined to be gamma approximate to 38.0 +/- 1.0
   mJ/m(2) by both adhesion mechanics test and three-probe-liquid contact
   angle measurement. Our results provide important insights into the
   fundamental understanding of molecular interaction mechanisms of comb
   type copolymers and the development Of novel functional
   polymers/coatings with strong antifouling capabilities for engineering
   and biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) are produced
   during the extraction of bitumen from oil sands in Alberta, Canada. The
   degradation of a model naphthenic acid, cyclohexanoic acid (CHA), and
   real naphthenic acids (NAs) from OSPW were investigated in the presence
   of peroxydisulfate (S2O82-) and zerovalent iron (ZVI). For the model
   compound CHA (SO mg/L), in the presence of ZVI and 500 mg/L S2O82-, the
   concentration decreased by 45\% after 6 days of treatment at 20 degrees
   C, whereas at 40, 60, and 80 degrees C the concentration decreased by
   20, 45 and 90\%, respectively, after 2 h of treatment. The formation of
   chloro-CHA was observed during ZVI/S2O82- treatment of CHA in the
   presence of chloride. For OSPW NAs, in the presence of ZVI alone, a 50\%
   removal of NAs was observed after 6 days of exposure at 20 degrees C.
   The addition of 100 mg/L S2O82- to the solution increased the removal of
   OSPW NAs from SO to 90\%. In absence of ZVI, a complete NM removal from
   OSPW was observed in presence of 2000 mg/L S2O82- at 80 degrees C. The
   addition of ZVI increased the efficiency of NAs oxidation by S2O82- near
   room temperature. Thus, ZVI/S2O82- process was found to be a viable
   option for accelerating the degradation of NAs present in OSPW.}},

Abstract = {{This note provides methods to fabricate polymer surfaces which have
   similar advancing or receding contact angles with distilled water but
   dissimilar contact angle hysteresis. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),
   Polystyrene, Polypropylene and Teflon AF were chosen, and three
   different methods namely spin coating, spray coating, and heat press
   were used in the fabrication. Contact angle measurements were performed
   using the sessile drop method, and atomic force microscopy was used to
   measure the roughness of the fabricated surfaces. Surfaces obtained from
   spin coating, spray coating and heat press showed very different
   wettability, which can be explained by their different surface roughness
   or heterogeneity. For spin coating, by changing the spinning rate and
   concentration of the solution, contact angle hysteresis of the PMMA
   surface can be changed in the range of 13-25 degrees. For heat press,
   contact angle hysteresis can be varied from 21 degrees to 29 degrees by
   changing the plate and/or the method of separating the plate from the
   surface. For Teflon AF surfaces, the contact angle hysteresis can be
   varied from 10 to 23 degrees by using different surface fabrication
   methods. For surfaces made of mixed solution of PMMA and Polystyrene,
   the ratio of PMMA:Polystyrene was shown to affect the surface
   wettability, and the results were explained by changes in the pattern
   and size of the heterogeneous domains on the surface. (c) 2012 Elsevier

   the Nonlinear Firing Behaviour of a Reduced Neuron Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Our goal was to investigate how the propagation of alternating signals
   (i.e. AC), like action potentials, into the dendrites influenced
   nonlinear firing behaviour of motor neurons using a systematically
   reduced neuron model. A recently developed reduced modeling approach
   using only steady-current (i.e. DC) signaling was analytically expanded
   to retain features of the frequency-response analysis carried out in
   multicompartment anatomically reconstructed models. Bifurcation analysis
   of the extended model showed that the typically overlooked parameter of
   AC amplitude attenuation was positively correlated with the current
   threshold for the activation of a plateau potential in the dendrite.
   Within the multiparameter space map of the reduced model the region
   demonstrating ``fully-bistable'' firing was bounded by directional DC
   attenuation values that were negatively correlated to AC attenuation.
   Based on these results we conclude that analytically derived reduced
   models of dendritic trees should be fit on DC and AC signaling, as both
   are important biophysical parameters governing the nonlinear firing
   behaviour of motor neurons.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we focus on the application of an integrated fault
   detection and isolation and fault tolerant control (FDIFTC) framework to
   a catalytic alkylation of benzene process. We consider that the
   catalytic alkylation of benzene process is controlled by a distributed
   model predictive control (DMPC) system and is subjected to unknown,
   persistent actuator faults. The FDIFTC system monitors closed-loop
   process residuals in order to detect and isolate a faulty actuator.
   After isolation of an actuator fault, the FDIFTC system estimates the
   fault magnitude, recalculates a new optimal operating point, and
   ultimately reconfigures the DMPC system to maintain stability of the
   process in an optimal manner. Extensive simulations are carried out to
   demonstrate the performance of the FDIFTC system from closed-loop
   stability and performance points of view. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A model for a carbon nanotube (CNT)-DNA hybrid embedded in an
   electrolyte solution is developed. The DNA charges are smeared out
   uniformly onto a cylindrical surface covering the CNT and the response
   of the CNT to the DNA charges is captured using the one-dimensional
   density of states (1D DOS) proposed by Mintmire et al. Coupled with the
   Debye-Huckel equation for the electrolyte, the expressions for the
   electric potential of the hybrid are obtained for both metallic and
   semiconducting CNT cores. For the surface charge density of the cylinder
   corresponding to the physically measured wrapping angles of a
   single-stranded DNA around a CNT, the developed model predicts that the
   induced charges on a semiconducting CNT are about one order of magnitude
   smaller than the DNA charges, while the induced charges on a metallic
   CNT can be comparable in magnitude to the DNA charges. Because of this,
   the magnitude of the electric potential for a metallic CNT-DNA hybrid
   can be as much as similar or equal to 30\% smaller than that for a
   semiconducting one. This result can be used to explain the experiments
   on DNA-assisted CNT separation using ion exchange chromatography. (C)

Abstract = {{New materials based on WC-YSZ composites were investigated as potential
   anodes for direct methane-fueled solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Two
   different carbide-based composites were developed in this study: a
   conventional WC-YSZ (50:50 vol.\%) composite and an infiltrated WC-YSZ
   composite (20 vol.\% WC infiltrated into a porous YSZ support). It was
   shown that a conventional WC-YSZ composite cannot be used as an
   alternative anode because of catastrophic changes in anode
   microstructure due to the carbide phase decomposition. The infiltrated
   WC-YSZ, however, performed rather stably with no catastrophic
   degradation at 800-900 degrees C under mixed hydrogen methane and
   methane fuels. Furthermore, while WC-based anodes were resistance to
   carbon formation under methane, the fuel was poorly activated and the
   performance was quite low. The carbide-based electrodes were then
   modified by incorporation of 5 wt\% CeO2 and 1 wt\% Ru. Not only did the
   addition of ceria-Ru electrocatalysts dramatically enhance the fuel cell
   performance, it also greatly improved the stability of the polarized
   cell. Both calculations and experiments showed that kinetic factors play
   the major role in stability of the carbide phase. It is proposed here
   that the carbide-infiltrated YSZ support can reasonably be considered as
   a foundation for future studies to develop promising alternative anodes.

Abstract = {{p-conjugated molecular organics such as rubrene, Alq3, fullerene, and
   PCBM have been used extensively over the last few decades in numerous
   organic electronic devices, including solar cells, thin-film
   transistors, and large-area, low-cost flexible displays. Rubrene and
   Alq3, have emerged as promising platforms for spin-based classical and
   quantum information processing, which has triggered significant research
   activity in the relatively new area of organic spintronics. Synthesis of
   these materials in a nanowire geometry, with feature sizes in the
   sub-100 nm regime, is desirable as it often enhances device performance
   and is essential for development of high-density molecular electronic
   devices. However, fabrication techniques that meet this stringent size
   constraint are still largely underdeveloped. Here, a novel, versatile,
   and reagentless method that enables growth of nanowire arrays of the
   above-mentioned organics in the cylindrical nanopores of anodic aluminum
   oxide (AAO) templates is demonstrated. This method 1) allows synthesis

Abstract = {{In this study, adsorption and desorption of mixtures of organic
   compounds commonly emitted from automotive painting operations were
   experimentally studied. A mixture of two alkanes and a mixture of eight
   organic compounds were adsorbed onto beaded activated carbon (BAC) and
   then thermally desorbed under nitrogen. Following both adsorption and
   regeneration, samples of the BAC were chemically extracted. Gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to quantify the
   compounds in the adsorption and desorption gas streams and in the BAC
   extracts. In general, for both adsorbate mixtures, competitive
   adsorption resulted in displacing low boiling point compounds by high
   boiling point compounds during adsorption. In addition to boiling point,
   adsorbate structure and functionality affected adsorption dynamics. High
   boiling point compounds such as n-decane and 2,2-dimethylpropylbenzene
   were not completely desorbed after three hours regeneration at 288
   degrees C indicating that these two compounds contributed to heel
   accumulation on the BAC. Additional compounds not present in the
   mixtures were detected in the extract of regenerated BAC possibly due to
   decomposition or other reactions during regeneration. Closure analysis
   based on breakthrough curves, solvent extraction of BAC and mass balance
   on the reactor provided consistent results of the amount of adsorbates
   on the BAC after adsorption and/or regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of organic contaminants in process-affected (PA) water
   represents an environmental liability for oil sands operators. Oil sands
   coke is a promising adsorbent for removing dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), which includes toxic acid-extractable oil sands tailings organics
   (AEOSTO) found in PA water. The ability of raw and activated delayed and
   fluid coke to remove DOC and AEOSTO from PA water was assessed.
   Treatment with 5 g/L of activated delayed and fluid coke removed 91\% of
   DOC and 92\% of AEOSTO at levels of 36 mg/L and 60 mg/L, respectively.
   Heavy metal leaching of vanadium at 5: 9 mg/L was observed for a 5 g/L
   application of activated delayed coke, representing a challenge to the
   approach. Microtox testing indicated that higher carbon doses of
   activated cokes were effective in reducing toxic the biological response
   caused by organic compounds; however, exposure to heavy metals increased
   the toxic effect with time. The proposed methodology should be coupled
   with an inorganic treatment technique for complete oil sands tailings

   Emphasis is given to the simulation of the softening regime of the

   minimizing mesh-dependency. A pragmatic and easy-to-implement procedure
   is developed for the calibration under the framework of friction
   hardening/cohesion softening. Fracture energy regularization is applied
   in the back-analysis of the triaxial tests to remove mesh dependency.
   The impact of different mesh designs is investigated. Oriented mesh with
   the same inclination as the shear band provides the most realistic
   outcome and is able of capturing real shear band thickness. (c) 2012 The

Journal = {{CATALYSIS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that conversion as a function of temperature hysteresis
   can occur during ignition and extinction exothermic reaction
   experiments, such as CO oxidation over Pt/Al2O3, with the activity
   during the ignition process not matching that during the extinction
   process. Conversions being higher during extinction than that during
   ignition are often observed. Several explanations have been proposed in
   which heat effects, different catalyst surface states, and different Pt
   oxidation states are the most common. In this work CO oxidation
   hysteresis behavior, when in a mixture with C3H6, was investigated. The
   results show that when C3H6 was absent, CO oxidation followed normal
   hysteresis behavior; however, when C3H6 was added to the mixture, the
   catalytic activity during the extinction phase decreased. As the C3H6
   concentration in the mixture increased, the hysteresis loop became
   smaller and ultimately reverse hysteresis was observed. The decrease in
   catalytic activity during extinction was due to the formation of C3H6
   oxidation intermediate species. These species competed with CO for
   active sites, thus inhibiting CO oxidation, and were not present during
   ignition as CO was the dominant adsorbed species when starting at low
   temperature.}},

   sequence of image mosaic patches is acquired systematically, at
   predetermined mechanical scanning locations, with optical scanning.
   After all imaging locations are covered, a large panoramic scene is

Abstract = {{Numerical issues for the friction-dominated steady-state Saint-Venant
   equations with a shock-capturing upwind finite-element scheme are
   studied using nonuniform-flow test cases and Fourier analysis. The
   friction-dominated case is a common phenomenon in open channel flow
   modeling when the depth becomes small compared with the discretization
   length. In the nonuniform-flow test cases, abrupt slope changes and
   abrupt roughness changes are introduced, and in the Fourier analysis, a
   periodic bed perturbation is used. Nondimensional parameter groups
   identified are as follows: the upwinding coefficient, the number of
   elements per wavelength, the average-flow Froude number, and the
   numerical friction number. The results show that errors in both depth
   and discharge variables are observed whenever there is any perturbation
   in the bed topography or bed roughness. These errors increase with
   increasing Froude number and increasing numerical friction number. A
   combined friction parameter is introduced for practical application. The
   combined friction parameter can be used to specify minimum depths or to
   guide mesh refinement. The analysis framework developed can also be used
   for other numerical schemes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000577.

   exact closed-form solution for outage probability of an opportunistic AF
   relaying system where the best node is selected from a number of
   candidate intermediate nodes to relay the data signal between the source
   and the destination. The selection follows a maximum end-to-end SNR
   policy, based on the available channel state information. The results
   are precise for any number of candidate relays and Rayleigh, Nakagami-m
   or Rician fading distributions. The effects of different channel fading
   parameters and the number of relays in the relay selection pool are
   studied. The system performance is compared to that of dual-hop AF
   systems without relay selection and to dual-hop AF relaying systems with
   maximum relay-to-destination SNR relay selection. The adopted selection
   method provides diversity gain over dual-hop AF relaying systems without
   relay selection and over maximum relay-to-destination SNR relay
   selection. The diversity gain is proportional to the relay selection
   pool size.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Depression is very common in Parkinson's disease (PD). The
   neuropathological basis for this remains unclear: however, dysfunction
   in prefrontal and limbic regions may play a role.
   Methods: We examined non-demented PD patients with and without
   depression and healthy controls (n = 6 per group) for differences in
   limbic structures and connections between these structures and the
   prefrontal cortex. Depressed individuals were selected from a
   representative sample of 33 PD patients using scores from the 15
   question Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Magnetic Resonance Diffusion
   Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography was used to examine the structural
   integrity of the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a white matter tract that
   projects from the hippocampus, amygdala and temporal pole to the
   orbitofrontal cortex, and the corpus callosum. Integrity of the UF and
   corpus callosum was established through measures of mean diffusivity
   (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and tract length. A volumetric analysis
   of the hippocampal head, body and tail, as well as the amygdala was
   performed to determine whether volume differences in these structures in
   PD relate to depression.
   Results: The depressed PD group showed smaller amygdala volumes compared
   to healthy controls, but the groups did not differ on any other measure.
   Conclusions: The present study found intact limbic connectivity but
   suggests that amygdala atrophy may be present in Parkinson's disease
   with depression. Further work is needed to replicate these findings. (C)

Title = {{Estimation of equivalent fracture network permeability using fractal and

Abstract = {{Mapping fracture networks and estimating their properties such as
   porosity and permeability to be used as input data in simulation studies
   are two critical steps in modeling of naturally fractured reservoirs.
   The data to achieve these two tasks are almost always insufficient and
   mostly limited to well scale measurements, seismic maps, and outcrop
   studies. Any quantitative information about fracture networks obtained
   through these sources would make accurate preparation of static models
   possible. Hence, it is essential to use limited quantitative data
   effectively in fracture network studies for accurate estimation of
   reservoir performance in any subsurface modeling study. This study
   focuses on one of the critical problems namely practical estimation of
   effective fracture network permeability (EFNP). First, an investigation
   on the relationship between statistical and fractal parameters of
   fracture network geometry and fracture network permeability was
   presented. Then, twelve statistical and fractal fracture network
   properties of randomly generated 2D fracture patterns were tested
   against permeability and correlations were obtained. Approximately half
   of the properties showed a strong relationship with the EFNP.
   Correlations obtained through multivariable regression analysis were
   tested on randomly generated different fracture network types and
   natural fracture patterns. In this exercise, all fracture network
   characteristics (density, length, orientation, connectivity, and
   aperture) were considered. Finally, the capability of artificial neural
   networks (ANN) was used to capture complex and nonlinear relationships
   between statistical-fractal parameters and equivalent permeability of 2D
   fracture networks to further improve empirical EFNP prediction models.
   To achieve this, a back propagation (BP) neural network with one hidden
   layer in the middle was used. After training this network, it was used
   to predict the EFNP. The ANN was observed to be a more powerful approach
   than the multivariable regression analysis in handling the non-linearity
   and complexity of the problem.
   This study showed that certain fractal characteristics of fracture
   network could be used in fracture network mapping and preparation of
   permeability data. The correlations obtained and tested could also be
   useful to calculate equivalent fracture network permeability tensor in
   2D practically and efficiently. The proposed method could be potentially
   extended and further developed to be applicable on 3D models as well.

Abstract = {{We report depletion induced flocculation and phase separation of
   bacteria due to the presence of rod-shaped nanoparticles by using
   confocal laser microscopy and turbidity measurements. To investigate the
   depletion effect of rod shaped nanoparticles in bacteria systems,
   cellulose nanocrystals with length, L = 90 +/- 10 nm, diameter, D = 8
   +/- 1 nm and zeta potential of 51.5 +/- 0.8 mV was used. The
   flocculation of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomanas aeruginosa
   (average length = 1.2 mu m, width = 0.2 mu m) was tested. The zeta
   potential of P. aeruginosa suspended in 10 mM NaCl was -29.84 +/- 0.6
   mV. Bacterial flocculation was observed at the CNC concentration of less
   than 0.1\% due to the depletion effect. We conclude from our results
   that rod shaped nanoparticles are very effective for the depletion
   flocculation of colloidal size bacteria and that phase separation of
   bacteria can occur at very low concentrations of rodlike CNC particles.

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring amphotropic liquid-crystals were recently identified
   in unreacted hydrocarbon resources and resource fractions from around
   the world, including Athabasca bitumen. Liquid crystal forming
   constituents are present in both asphaltene and maltene fractions and
   appear to be an important class of materials that is missed entirely
   during conventional hydrocarbon characterization, i.e.: SIMDIST or SARA
   analysis. In this contribution, some physical properties of liquid
   crystals in Athabasca asphaltenes and maltenes identified using
   experimental methods as diverse as polarized light microscopy,
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and mid- and near-infrared
   photoacoustic spectroscopy with depth profiling are reported. Liquid
   crystals, comprising materials with an aromaticity between that of
   maltenes and asphaltenes, form irreversibly on the surface of both
   asphaltene particles and maltene drops on heating. At higher
   temperatures the liquid crystals become isotropic but remain on particle
   surfaces. Liquid crystals do not reappear on cooling or subsequent
   reheating unless the samples are frozen and crushed between heating
   cycles. The interdependence of these phase properties on sample thermal
   and mechanical history may help explain unexpected and frequently
   deleterious surface and interfacial phenomena arising during Athabasca
   bitumen production and processing.}},

Abstract = {{Iron-bearing particles in two Athabasca oil sands ore samples have been
   characterized in this study by electron microscopy. One sample was taken
   from a ``good processing ore{''} and one from a ``poor processing

   the resulting solids in the primary froth were characterized. While
   iron-bearing minerals such as magnetite and hematite were common in both
   ore samples, pyrite and goethite were only found in the poor processing
   ore and wustite was identified only in the good processing ore. The
   iron-bearing particles were concentrated in the primary froth stream
   from batch extraction, and their sizes varied from a few nanometers to
   several hundred nanometers. The nanometer scale iron bearing minerals
   have been identified in two different arrangements. Nanoscale
   iron-bearing minerals either form patches on top of relatively large
   (200-300 nm) clay particles, or they combine with nanoscale clay and

   efficiency was about 100\% for both two canola and carrot protoplasts,
   which were further confirmed by the confocal and sectional TEM images.
   Some mSWCNTs were found trapped both inside the endosomes of canola
   protoplast and outside endosome near the nuclear membrane of carrot
   protoplast according to the sectional TEM images. All results showed
   that mSWCNT is a good delivery carrier for biomolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Silver zeolites, especially Ag-ETS-10 and Ag-mordenite, actively bind
   xenon and iodine, two prime contaminants common to nuclear accidents.
   The evolution of silver species on silver exchanged ETS-10 (Ag/ETS-10)
   and mordenite (Ag/Mor) has been investigated by exposing the materials
   to a series of activation conditions in Ar, air and H-2. The samples
   were characterized by XRD, SEM and solid-state Ag-109, Si-29 and Al-27
   MAS NMR. The silver reduction and structural evolution have been
   illustrated by those techniques. The effectiveness of one sample of each
   type of sieve was tested for its ability to trap mercury from a gas
   stream. However, the results from this study demonstrate that the
   adsorption characteristics of silver-loaded sieves cannot necessarily be
   predicted using a full complement of structural characterization
   techniques, which highlights the importance of understanding the
   formation and nature of silver species on molecular sieves.}},

Abstract = {{Depth profiling of NbxO/W multilayered samples was carried out using
   O2+, Cs+ or Ar+ beams of different energies (2?keV, 1?keV and 0.5?keV).
   The obtained depth profiles showed that sputtering with O2+ or Ar+ beams
   can reveal the distribution of light elements, while sputtering with Cs+
   cannot show correctly their distribution if lower energy of 0.5?keV is
   applied. SRIM simulations show that changes in primary energy of sputter
   ions have much stronger effect on deposited energy incl. vacancy/ion and
   sputter yields than for oxygen and argon ion beam etching. It is
   suggested that O2+ or Ar+ sputter sources should be used when both light
   and heavy species are present in nano-scale multilayered targets.

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in the large scale cyclotron production of
   Tc-99m via the Mo-100(p,2n)Tc-99m reaction. While the use and recycling
   of cyclotron-irradiated enriched molybdenum targets has been reported
   previously in the context of Tc-94m production, to the best of our
   knowledge, previous recycling studies have been limited to the use of
   oxide targets. To facilitate reuse of high-power enriched Mo-100
   targets, this work presents and evaluates a strategy for recycling of
   enriched metallic molybdenum. For the irradiated Mo-100 targets in this
   study, an overall metal to metal recovery of 87\% is reported.
   Evaluation of ``new{''} and ``recycled{''} Mo-100 revealed no changes in
   the molybdenum isotopic composition (as measured via ICP-MS). For
   similar irradiation conditions of ``new{''} and ``recycled{''} Mo-100,
   (i.e. target thicknesses, irradiation time, and energy), comparable
   levels of Tc-94g, Tc-95g, and Tc-96g contaminants were observed.
   Comparable QC specifications (i.e. aluminum ion concentration, pH, and
   radiochemical purity) were also reported. We finally note that
   {[}Tc-99m]-MDP images obtained by comparing MDP labelled with
   generator-based Tc-99m vs. Tc-99m obtained following the irradiation of
   recycled Mo-100 demonstrated comparable biodistribution. With the goal
   of producing large quantities of Tc-99m, the proposed methodology
   demonstrates that efficient recycling of enriched metallic Mo-100
   targets is feasible and effective. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Solidliquid flows span a large parameter space, with dimensionless
   coordinates such as Stokes numbers, the solids volume fraction, the
   density ratio between the phases, and Reynolds numbers (e.g., associated
   with the continuous phase flow). We are interested in systems with
   appreciable inertia effectsthat is, nonzero Stokes and Reynolds
   numbershaving density ratios of the order of one and solids volume
   fractions of order 0.1. In such flows, direct numerical simulations are
   desired to reveal the relevant interactions. The resolution required for
   DNS limits the size of the systems that we are able to simulate to the
   meso-scale. In this article, examples of direct simulations based on the
   lattice-Boltzmann method of dense solidliquid flows are presented, along
   with suggestions as to how to use their results at the macro-scale. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, a method to characterize buried non-magnetic objects in
   ground using ultra-wideband (UWB) ground penetrating radar (GPR) is
   proposed. In this method, UWB pulses are radiated by the radar, while
   scattered signals from the ground with the buried object are received.
   The received signals are then post-processed to estimate the depth,
   thickness, and electrical properties of the buried object. A constant
   depth and thickness is enforced at all frequencies while the signals are
   processed to extract the buried object characteristics, resulting in
   more accurate estimations and reduced processing time. In addition, path
   loss due to the close proximity of the radar to the ground is
   compensated analytically. The applicability of the proposed method is
   validated with several planar objects and a boulder that we typically
   encounter in the construction industry. The proposed method can achieve
   sufficient reliability in estimating the permittivity of buried objects
   for the purpose of material identification. Incorporating the proposed
   method into the GPRs enhances their existing imaging ability by adding
   material identification capability.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of interface bonding strengths are necessary for predicting
   the failure behavior of structures and materials with bi-material
   interfaces. However, it is well known that due to the discontinuity of
   material properties, stress singularity may exist at the edges of the
   interface. For accurate determination of the bonding strength of
   bi-material interface, the elimination of the stress singularity is
   necessary. This paper presents an analytical solution for the
   determination of the stress singularity and the critical bonding angle
   of a bonded joint between elastic and viscoelastic materials. This
   solution is based on the analytical solution available for an
   elastic-elastic bonded joint via the elastic-viscoelastic corresponding
   principle. For the viscoelastic material, both time-independent and
   time-dependent Poisson's ratios are considered to find its effect on the
   stress singularity. As an example, the developed solution is applied to
   a simulated aluminum-epoxy bonded joint with a spherical interface. It
   is found that the critical bonding angle and the order of the stress
   singularity are different for assuming a time-independent or
   time-dependent Poisson's ratio of the idealized viscoelastic epoxy. With
   the analytical solution developed, it is possible to design an optimal
   interface geometry that can eliminate the stress singularity from the
   interface corner.}},

   demonstrated with the conceptual design and optimization of a gearbox as
   the study case. In addition, an extended feature system for product
   development was explored. With a spreadsheet package and a computer
   aided design (CAD) tool, the product model generation, change management
   and final optimization of the case assembly including its bulk shape,
   have been achieved. Two important information chains were used to
   address the aspect of ``design for post-manufacture services{''} with
   concurrent engineering consideration, i.e. a field installation pattern
   and a set of wrapping dimensions for product transport packaging. In
   order to demonstrate the feasibility of change management, a different
   product derivative model was regenerated by adopting and changing the
   values of a main conceptual feature. The result is promising. (C) 2012

   electron work function (EWF) and mechanical properties of metals such as

Title = {{Multilayer bonding using a conformal adsorbate film (CAF) for the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Reliable microfabrication processes and materials compatible with
   complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology are required
   by industry for the mass production of complex and highly miniaturized
   lab-on-a-chip systems. Photopolymers are commonly used in the
   semiconductor industry, and are suitable for the integration of
   multilayer structures onto CMOS substrates. This paper describes a novel
   photopolymer bonding process compatible with CMOS technology for the
   fabrication of three-dimensional monolithic microfluidic devices. The
   process consists of the formation of a conformal adsorbate film (CAF)
   approximately 15 nm thick on a patterned photopolymer layer (KMPR),
   thereby increasing the number of open polymer chains at the bonding
   interface and acting as an ultra-thin adhesive layer. This thin adhesive
   layer is made of the same photopolymer as the microfluidic structures,
   but has a substantially lower crosslinking density so it will be able to
   make better bonds during a thermocompressive bonding step. This CAF
   treatment substantially improves the bonding yield between two patterned
   and previously crosslinked photopolymer layers because both optimum
   structure strength (to resist deformation during bonding) and bonding
   strength from epoxy crosslinking can be achieved. We demonstrate high
   bonding yields of up to 99\% of the useful area of the substrate after
   three successive bonding steps. With this technique, up to six layers
   have been bonded in a single device. Unlike previously reported methods
   the quality of bonding is mostly decoupled from soft-bake parameters and
   crosslinking level of the previously patterned layers. Three different
   bonding processes were characterized to describe the bonding mechanism
   and the differences between the presented method and the
   partial-crosslinking bonding method. Capillary filling experiments were
   performed in microchannels of multilayer structures built with the CAF
   technique, without any observable leakage between layers.}},

Abstract = {{Current literature relies almost exclusively on the power number to

   impeller (KPC), and a mixed-flow impeller (45 degrees down-pumping PBT),
   each at two diameters, were used to test the protocol. Fourteen measures
   were considered. Five are recommended for full characterization: power
   number, momentum number, and peak rate of dissipation of turbulent
   kinetic energy to characterize conditions at the impeller; power at
   just-suspended speed to compare the efficiency of solids suspension at
   the bottom of the tank; and point of air entrainment as a measure of
   turbulence penetration to the free surface. These five measures provide
   complete information about mixing performance and good differentiation

Title = {{The EmhABC efflux pump decreases the efficiency of phenanthrene
   biodegradation by Pseudomonas fluorescens strain LP6a}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Pseudomonas fluorescens strain LP6a, designated here as strain WEN
   (wild-type PAH catabolism, efflux positive), utilizes the polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene as a carbon source but also extrudes
   it into the extracellular medium using the efflux pump EmhABC. Because
   phenanthrene is considered a nontoxic carbon source for P. fluorescens
   WEP, its energy-dependent efflux seems counter-productive. We
   hypothesized that the efflux of phenanthrene would decrease the
   efficiency of its biodegradation. Indeed, an emhB disruptant strain,
   wild-type PAH catabolism, efflux negative (WEN), biodegraded 44\% more
   phenanthrene than its parent strain WEP during a 6-day incubation. To
   determine whether efflux affected the degree of oxidation of
   phenanthrene, we quantified the conversion of C-14-phenanthrene to
   radiolabeled polar metabolites and (CO2)-C-14. The emhB (-) WEN strain
   produced approximately twice as much (CO2)-C-14 and radiolabeled
   water-soluble metabolites as the WEP strain. In contrast, the
   mineralization of C-14-glucose, which is not a known EmhB efflux
   substrate, was equivalent in both strains. An early open-ring metabolite
   of phenanthrene, trans-4-(1-hydroxynaphth-2-yl)-2-oxo-3-butenoic acid,
   also was found to be a substrate of the EmhABC pump and accumulated in
   the supernatant of WEP but not WEN cultures. The analogous open-ring
   metabolite of dibenzothiophene, a heterocyclic analog of phenanthrene,
   was extruded by EmhABC plus a putative alternative efflux pump, whereas
   the end product 3-hydroxy-2-formylbenzothiophene was not actively
   extruded from either WEP or WEN cells. These results indicate that the
   active efflux of phenanthrene and its early metabolite(s) decreases the
   efficiency of phenanthrene degradation by the WEP strain. This activity
   has implications for the bioremediation and biocatalytic transformation
   of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocycles.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: To develop a novel Vero cell assay that implements a real-time
   cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system for the determination of the
   presence of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). The assay
   overcomes the major drawbacks in conventional Vero cell assay, for
   example, labour-intensive and time-consuming. Methods and Results: Cells
   were grown onto the surfaces of microelectronic sensors that are
   integrated into the bottom surfaces of the microtiter plate. Cellular
   viability was monitored in real-time and quantified based on changes in
   the sensors electrical impedance. For cell viability measurement, the
   data generated on the RT-CES system correlated well with those obtained
   by the Vero cell assay for Verotoxins. To assess cytotoxicity, test
   cells growing on microelectronic sensors were treated with either
   supernatant from pure cultures, or stool samples. The specific
   neutralizing antibodies of VT1 and VT2 were used to identify specific
   toxins in the samples. Conclusions: The RT-CES assay provides a
   sensitive measurement comparable to conventional crystal violet assay.
   The assay has been successfully and specifically used to identify VTEC
   in human faecal samples. Significance and Impact of the Study: The
   RT-CES assay significantly shortens the testing time from 48 to 72 h
   required by the crystal violet assay to only 15 h with automated

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging tractography is commonly used to quantify white
   matter tracts in the human brain via parameters such as fractional
   anisotropy and mean diffusivity. Simulation studies recommend the use of
   more than six directions for robust parameter estimates; however, no
   study has examined the impact of the number of gradient directions on
   deterministic tractography-derived diffusion parameters in human brain.
   Here, for 10 major white matter tracts in 11 healthy volunteers at 1.5
   T, six-direction diffusion tensor imaging data were compared to 30- or
   60-direction data, keeping scan time and number of b = 0 images constant
   within each test. Mean diffusivity was systematically lower for
   six-direction protocols (20/40 comparisons); six-direction data had
   higher fractional anisotropy in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and
   smaller tract volume for the genu of the corpus callosum. In general,
   parameter differences due to the number of directions were smaller than
   those from intersubject variation or signal-to-noise ratio. Despite some
   absolute differences, standard deviations were significantly different
   for only one of 160 comparisons. Thus, six-direction data provide
   diffusion measures with comparable robustness to 30- or 60-direction
   data and yield appropriate parameter values for most white matter
   tracts, although there are clear advantages in acquiring higher angular
   resolution data. Magn Reson Med, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Several flood mapping classification techniques, applied to single-date
   and multi-date SAR images of ERS2, based on the Danube River flooding of
   2006 in Romania are compared, as part of an effort to explore the
   feasibility of mapping flooded areas by SAR images acquired through
   radar sensors. Among 7 SAR images analyzed for the same study site
   located around Bistret of Romania, several represent ``dry{''} and
   several ``wet{''} conditions, where the latter represent the major
   Danube flooding event of 2006. The images were classified into (1)
   permanent water (Danube River and lakes), (2) flooded area, and (3) dry
   land, using single image, pixel-based classification, frequency-based
   contextual classification, and principal component analysis (PCA)
   combined with Isodata classification. The flooded areas delineated from
   the above procedures for the study site at Bistret are visually compared
   with that of Landsat-TM images and MODIS mosaic and digitally compared
   with referenced flooded area produced by the DEM data of SRTM.
   Apparently there is no one technique that is clearly better partly
   because of the nature of SAR data (radar echoes) and partly because of
   data noise even though the images were first subjected to speckle
   filtering and geometric corrections, and partly because SAR images could
   appear dark not only because of flooding but also because of smooth
   surfaces, target sizes, etc. However, if multi-date SAR images of both
   DRY and WET (flooding) conditions are available, it seems that PCA
   combined with the Isodata classifier would give better defined flooded
   areas of the Danube River than the simple single image, pixel-based
   classification or the contextual classification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Deep tissue injury (DTI) is a type of pressure ulcer in which tissue
   breakdown initiates at the bone-muscle interface under intact skin.
   Excessive deformation in the soft tissue, particularly around bony
   prominences, is believed to be one of the causes leading to the
   development of DTI. The main goal of this study was to measure the
   magnitude and distribution of strains within muscles surrounding the
   ischial tuberosities, induced by levels of external loading that
   encompass the range of loading experienced by the soft tissue in seated
   individuals. The experiments were conducted in adult pigs with intact
   spinal cords (n = 5) and pigs with partial spinal cord injury (SCI) (n =
   2), one of which also had a DTI. A secondary goal was to obtain a
   preliminary assessment regarding the capacity of intermittent electrical
   stimulation (IES), an intervention for preventing the formation of DTI,
   to counteract the muscle compression caused by external loading. In
   intact animals, muscles subjected to external loads equivalent to 25\%
   of body weight experienced maximal principal strains, minimal principal
   strains, and shear strains of 0.68, -0.3, and 0.4, respectively. These
   magnitudes increased by 91.9, 17.6, and 87.5\%, respectively, when
   external loading increased to 50\% body weight. Minimal to no further
   increases in strain magnitudes were seen with the 75\% body weight
   loading level. In one animal with SCI and no DTI, strain magnitudes were
   on average 9.7\% higher than those in the intact animals at the
   corresponding loading levels. The presence of a DTI in another animal
   with SCI reduced strain magnitudes by 28\% compared to intact animals.
   The regions in the muscle that underwent the largest deformations were
   those between the ischial tuberosity and the external surface, and up to
   2 cm ventral to the ischial tuberosity (furthest measured). Muscle
   contractions produced by IES increased the thickness of the tissue
   between the ischial tuberosities and skin during the period of
   stimulation by 10-20\% for loading levels up to 75\% of body weight in
   both intact and spinal cord injured pigs. This study provides the first
   measurements of strain around the ischial tuberosities in an animal
   model that resembles humans.}},

Abstract = {{The overall goal of this project is to develop interventions for the
   prevention of deep tissue injury (DTI), a form of pressure ulcers that
   originates in deep tissue around bony prominences. The present study
   focused on: (1) obtaining detailed measures of the distribution of
   pressure experienced by tissue around the ischial tuberosities, and (2)
   investigating the effectiveness of intermittent electrical stimulation
   (IES), a novel strategy for the prevention of DTI, in alleviating
   pressure in regions at risk of breakdown due to sustained loading. The
   experiments were conducted in adult pigs. Five animals had intact spinal
   cords and healthy muscles and one had a spinal cord injury that led to
   substantial muscle atrophy at the time of the experiment. A
   force-controlled servomotor was used to load the region of the buttocks
   to levels corresponding to 25\%, 50\% or 75\% of each animal's body
   weight. A pressure transducer embedded in a catheter was advanced into
   the tissue to measure pressure along a three dimensional grid around the
   ischial tuberosity of one hind leg. For all levels of external loading
   in intact animals, average peak internal pressure was 2.01 +/- A 0.08
   times larger than the maximal interfacial pressure measured at the level
   of the skin. In the animal with spinal cord injury, similar absolute
   values of internal pressure as that in intact animals were recorded, but
   the substantial muscle atrophy produced larger maximal interfacial
   pressures. Average peak internal pressure in this animal was 1.43 +/- A
   0.055 times larger than the maximal interfacial pressure. Peak internal
   pressure was localized within a +/- 2 cm region medio-laterally and
   dorso-ventrally from the bone in intact animals and +/- 1 cm in the
   animal with spinal cord injury. IES significantly redistributed internal
   pressure, shifting the peak values away from the bone in spinally intact
   and injured animals. These findings provide critical information
   regarding the relationship between internal and interfacial pressure
   around the ischial tuberosities during loading levels equivalent to
   those experienced while sitting. The information could guide future
   computer models investigating the etiology of DTI, as well as inform the
   design and prescription of seating cushions for people with reduced
   mobility. The findings also suggest that IES may be an effective
   strategy for the prevention of DTI.}},

Abstract = {{Fe-Ni-Cr alloys containing different contents of Si with and without
   pre-formed oxide scale at the surface were tested in oxidation
   environments at 1,050 A degrees C with varied sulfur partial pressures.
   The oxide-scale growth on Fe-Ni-Cr alloys was accelerated by increasing
   sulfur partial pressures in the oxidizing-carburizing environments. This
   accelerated oxidation was characterized by the formation of plate-shaped
   MnCr2O4 spinel crystallites and the nodular clusters at the site of
   scale spallation. Pre-oxidized Fe-Ni-Cr alloys generally did not suffer
   from sulfur attack because of excellent protection of pre-formed oxide
   scale. Scale spallation and sulfur attack were found only on high-Si
   alloy subjected to the maximum sulfur potential, which was attributed to
   accelerated oxidation and selective oxidation and sulfidation at the
   sites where oxide scale spallation had occurred. For bare alloys in
   absence of pre-formed oxide layers, scale spallation was found to occur
   at lower level of sulfur potential on low-Si alloy than on high-Si
   alloy. A higher content of Si is necessary for the formation of
   protective silica sub-layer, which is believed to be the main cause of
   the difference in scale spallation observed.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional finite element model of micro electron beam welding
   is developed where the Kanaya-Okayama heat source formulated in Part I
   of this work is used to represent the electron beam. The large number of
   process variables is grouped into two non-dimensional parameters,
   namely, Peclet number and relative beam penetration, and their effect is
   analysed numerically to arrive at the optimum conditions of
   microwelding. Based on the minimum heat input of the process, the
   optimum Peclet number is found to be 100, and the beam penetration is
   twice that of the weld depth. The optimum parameters obtained using the
   Kanaya-Okayama heat source model are similar to the previous findings
   using the exponential decay heat source model; however, the predictions
   of the temperature field in the solid as a result of microwelding are
   relatively lower in case of the Kanaya-Okayama heat source model because
   of the differences in distribution of heat into the condensed matter.
   The lower weld surface temperatures in microwelding using the electron
   beam suggest significantly less ablation than in laser beams.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction forces between an air bubble and a spherical particle of
   moderate and tuneable surface charge density and hydrophobicity in
   aqueous solutions were measured using atomic force microscopy. Bitumen
   coated silica spheres were used as model particles of tuneable charge
   density and hydrophobicity due to pH-dependent ionisation of carboxylic
   acids at bitumen-water interfaces. The measured force profiles showed a
   long-range repulsion prior to jump into contact, indicating the rupture
   of intervening liquid film between the bitumen and bubble surfaces. The
   long-range repulsive force increased with increasing pH. The measured
   force profiles were analysed by adopting the model originally developed
   by White and co-workers to account for deformation and change in shape
   of bubbles before rupture of the intervening liquid film. Satisfactory
   agreement between the theory and measured force profiles was obtained,
   showing the suitability of the model to describe the measured
   interaction forces. The model was then used to study the physical
   parameters on the particle-bubble interaction forces prior to three
   phase contact line (TPCL) formation. The hydrophobic decay length,
   surface potential and size of bubble and probe particles, and ionic
   strength of the medium (KCl concentration) were found to have a strong
   influence on the predicted force profiles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Knowledge transfer in system modeling and its realization through an
   optimal allocation of information granularity}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1985-1995}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce and discuss a concept of knowledge transfer
   in system modeling. In a nutshell, knowledge transfer is about forming
   ways on how a source of knowledge (namely, an existing model) can be
   used in presence of new, very limited experimental evidence. In virtue
   of the nature of the problem at hand (a situation encountered quite
   commonly, e.g. in project cost estimation), new data could be very
   limited and this scarcity of data makes it insufficient to construct a
   new model. At the same time, the new data originate from a similar (but
   not the same) phenomenon (process) for which the original model has been
   constructed so the existing model, even though it could applied, has to
   be treated with a certain level of reservation. Such situations can be
   encountered, e.g. in software engineering where in spite existing
   similarities, each project, process, or product exhibits its own unique
   characteristics. Taking this into consideration, the existing model is
   generalized (abstracted) by forming its granular counterpart - granular
   model where its parameters are regarded as information granules rather
   than numeric entities, viz. their non-numeric (granular) version is
   formed based on the values of the numeric parameters present in the
   original model. The results produced by the granular model are also
   granular and in this manner they become reflective of the differences
   existing between the current phenomenon and the process for which the
   previous model has been formed.
   In the study on knowledge transfer and reusability, information
   granularity is viewed as an important design asset and as such it is
   subject to optimization. We formulate an optimal information granularity
   allocation problem: assuming a certain level of granularity, distribute
   it optimally among the parameters of the model (making them granular) so
   that a certain data coverage criterion is maximized. While the
   underlying concept is general and applicable to a variety of models, in
   this study, we discuss its use to fuzzy neural networks with intent to
   clearly visualize the advantages of the approach and emphasize various
   ways of forming granular versions of the weights (parameters) of the
   connections of the network. Several granularity allocation protocols
   (ranging from a uniform distribution of granularity, symmetric and
   asymmetric schemes of allocation) are discussed and the effectiveness of
   each of them is quantified. The use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
   as the underlying optimization tool to realize optimal granularity
   allocation is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we introduce an estimation approach to determine the
   parameters of the fuzzy linear regression model. The analytical solution
   to estimate the values of the parameters has been studied. The issue of
   negative spreads of fuzzy linear regression makes the problem to be NP
   complete. To deal with this problem, an iterative refinement of the
   model parameters based on the gradient decent optimization has been
   introduced.
   In the proposed approach, we use a hierarchical structure which is
   composed of dynamically accumulated simple nodes based on Polynomial
   Neural Networks the structure of which is very flexible.
   In this study, we proposed a new methodology of fuzzy linear regression
   based on the design method of Polynomial Neural Networks. Polynomial
   Neural Networks divide the complicated analytical approach to estimate
   the parameters of fuzzy linear regression into several simple analytic
   approaches.
   The fuzzy linear regression is implemented by Polynomial Neural Networks
   with fuzzy numbers which are formed by exploiting clustering and
   Particle Swarm Optimization. It is shown that the design strategy
   produces a model exhibiting sound performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

   states of an electrolyte drop on charged surfaces. An electric double
   layer (EDL) develops when the electrolyte drop comes in contact with the
   charged surface. Therefore, the EDL free energy affects these states by
   triggering a hydrophilicity-inducing tendency. Consequently, an
   originally hydrophilic condition leads to a superhydrophilic Wenzel
   state, and an originally hydrophobic condition leads to a less
   hydrophobic Wenzel state. For the Cassie-Baxter state, this gives rise
   to the most remarkable situation of a hydrophilic (as compared to the
   original) Cassie-Baxter state.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic framework is established to calculate the solubility of
   inorganic salts in nonaqueous solvents. New solubility data of potassium
   iodide in selected organic solvents of acetone, ethanol, and 1-propanol
   are determined in the temperature range of 278-343 K. The experimental
   solubility is modeled by the methodology proposed in this work, and the
   solubility products of potassium iodide in organic solvents are
   estimated. Following this, the experimental mean activity coefficients
   are modeled with the electrolyte activity coefficient models of Pitzer,
   e-NRTL, e-Wilson equations, and their modified forms. Model parameters
   are optimized by fitting the experiment data. It turns out that the
   three-parameter e-Wilson equation presents the best correlation results
   with an overall average percentage relative deviation ARD of 1.36\%.
   When the models are extrapolated to predict the low temperature
   solubility of potassium iodide in acetone down to 215 K, the
   three-parameter e-NRTL gives the most reliable predictions. A novel
   simple predictive mixing rule for the e-Wilson equation is proposed to
   estimate the solubility of potassium iodide in binary mixed solvents.
   The predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data of
   potassium iodide in water and ethanol over wide ranges of concentration

Volume = {{378}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between kaolinite clay particles and a comb-type
   polymer (polycarboxylate ether or PCE), so-called PCE super-plasticizer,
   were investigated through viscosity and surface forces measurements by a
   rheometer and a Surface Forces Apparatus (SFA). The addition of PCE
   shows a strong impact on the viscosity of concentrated kaolinite
   suspensions in alkaline solutions (pH = 8.3) but a weak effect under
   acidic conditions (pH = 3.4). In acidic solutions, the high viscosity
   measured is attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction between
   negatively charged basal planes and positively charged edge surfaces of
   clay particles. Under the alkaline condition, the suspension viscosity
   was found to first increase significantly and then decrease with
   increasing PCE dosages. The results from surface forces measurement show
   that PCE molecules at low dosages can bridge the kaolinite particles in
   the concentrated suspensions via hydrogen bonding, leading to the
   formation of a kaolinite-PCE ``network{''} and hence an increased
   suspension viscosity. At high PCE dosages, clay particles are fully
   covered by PCE molecules, leading to a more dispersed kaolinite
   suspensions and hence lower suspension viscosity due to steric repulsion
   between the adsorbed PCE molecules. The insights derived from measuring
   viscosity and interfacial properties of kaolinite suspensions containing
   varying amount of comb-type super-plasticizer PCE at different pH
   provide the foundation for many engineering applications and optimizing
   industrial processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electron work function (EWF) is the minimum energy required to move
   an electron at the Fermi level from inside a conducting material to its

   light illumination were monitored in situ using a Kelvin probe in order
   to study the photon-induced electron excitation in the TiO2 nanotubular
   arrays upon illumination. It was shown that the EWF could be used to
   investigate the electron-hole separation and recombination, helping us
   to better understand the photo-activity of the photocatalytic material.
   This study has demonstrated that EWF provides an effective parameter for
   understanding of semiconductors' photo-activities with different views

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{27}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{A new technique is developed to fabricate biomimetic antireflection
   coatings (ARCs). This technique combines a bottom-up fabrication
   approach (glancing angle deposition, or GLAD) with a top-down
   engineering process (ion milling). The GLAD technique is first utilized
   to produce nanopillar arrays (NPAs) with broadened structures, which are
   subsequently transformed into biomimetic tapered geometries by means of
   post-deposition ion milling. This structure transformation, due to
   milling-induced mass redistribution, remarkably decreases reflection
   over a wide wavelength range (300-1700 nm) and field of view (angle of
   incidence <60 degrees with respect to the substrate normal). The
   milling-induced antireflection enhancement has been demonstrated in the
   NPAs made of Si, SiOx and TiO2, illustrating that this integrated
   technique is readily adapted to a wide variety of materials. Good
   agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the enhanced
   antireflection performance is ascribed to a smoother refractive index
   transition from the substrate to the air, which improves the impedance
   match and reduces reflection losses. Additionally, ion bombardment tends
   to alter the stoichiometry and diminish the crystallographic structure
   of the NPA materials. The broadband and quasi-omnidirectional
   antireflection observed establishes the strong competitiveness of this
   technique with the methods previously reported.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulation was used to study the diffusivity of water
   at low concentrations in two types of amorphous polyurethanes PU1 and
   PU2. PU1 was made up of castor oil and 4,4'-diphenylmethano-diisocyanate
   (MDI), a polyurethane that is not swollen by water, and PU2 was made up
   of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with MDI, a polyurethane exhibiting a high
   degree of swelling by water. PU2 also has the ability to form a
   considerable amount of hydrogen bonds with water molecules. To mimic the
   non-swollen and swollen behavior, canonical (i.e., NVT) and
   isothermal-isobaric (i.e., NPT) ensembles were used for PU1 and PU2,
   respectively. Simulation results showed that the diffusivity of water in
   PU1 was insensitive to its concentration at low concentrations but
   decreased with increasing concentration for PU2. Further data analysis
   revealed that in the case of PU1, both the mean number of hops of water
   molecules from one free volume hole to another and the mean hopping
   distance did not vary with water concentration. In other words, at low
   concentrations, hopping of water molecules is not affected by the
   presence of other water molecules, suggesting that there is no blocking
   effect. In the case of PU2, the mean number of hops did decrease
   drastically in the concentration range of 0-2 wt\% and leveled off at
   higher concentrations while the mean hopping distance exhibited a slight
   decrease. It was found that the observed behavior is mainly attributed
   to the hydrogen bonds formed between PU2 and water molecules. However,
   it is the swelling behavior (i.e., high dK/dc below 2 wt\% but almost
   constant dK/dc above 2 wt\%) leads to the concentration dependence
   profile of diffusion coefficient. Compared with the theory of Barrie and
   Platt, the computed diffusivity is much lower than that is predicted by
   the theory. This is because the theory does not include effects from the
   hydrogen bonds formed between PU2 and water molecules and the swelling
   behavior of PU2. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new, practical methodology with simple analysis
   methods coupled with rapid experimental tests to identify distribution
   factors (DFs) for existing highway bridges. This approach is
   demonstrated on a reinforced concrete T-beam bridge population. It is
   shown that the moment DFs of single-span T-beam bridges can be
   determined by using skew angle, modal frequency, and the flexibility
   coefficient, where the frequency and the flexibility coefficient can be
   identified by means of rapid impact testing that can be conducted using
   an impactor, such as a falling weight deflectometer (FWD). This approach
   is first demonstrated using finite-element model (FEM) simulations.
   Moment approximation to FEM results with the new approach is 6\%,
   whereas this approximation is on the order of 30\% compared with the
   conventional beamline analysis given in the AASHTO code. This new
   approach is then demonstrated by using experimental data from four
   real-life bridges for the computation of moment values as well as the
   load ratings. It is shown that this new approach can conservatively
   approximate live load increases for the four existing bridges. DOI:

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel methodology for structural health monitoring of a
   bridge is presented with implementations for bridge load rating using
   sensor and video image data from operating traffic. With this
   methodology, video images are analyzed by means of computer vision
   techniques to detect and track vehicles crossing the bridge. Traditional
   sensor data are correlated with computer images to extract unit
   influence lines (UILs). Based on laboratory studies, UILs can be
   extracted for a critical section with different vehicles by means of
   synchronized video and sensor data. The synchronized computer vision and
   strain measurements can be obtained for bridge load rating under
   operational traffic. For this, the following are presented: a real life
   bridge is instrumented and monitored, and the real-life data are
   processed under a moving load. A detailed finite-element model (FEM) of
   the bridge is also developed and presented along with the experimental
   measurements to support the applicability of the approach for load
   rating using UILs extracted from operating traffic. The load rating of
   the bridges using operational traffic in real life was validated with
   the FEM results of the bridge and the simulation of the operational
   traffic on the bridge. This approach is further proven with different
   vehicles captured with video and measurements. The UILs are used for
   load rating by multiplying the UIL vector of the critical section with
   the load vector from the HL-93 design truck. The load rating based on
   the UIL is compared with the FEM results and indicates good agreement.
   With this method, it is possible to extract UILs of bridges under
   regular traffic and obtain load rating efficiently. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper considers the analytical performance of primary users (PUs)

   located at the center of the cell, is having a protective region which
   is free of SUs and the SUs are distributed over a finite area in
   contrast to the commonly used infinite area assumption. We first
   characterize the statistical properties of the aggregate interference at
   the PU due to SUs, by deriving new exact closed form expressions for the
   moment generating function, cumulants, first, second and third moments
   and first order expansions of the cumulative distribution functions
   corresponding to propagation scenarios with path loss factors, two and
   four. We then investigate the PU performance by presenting new

Abstract = {{Photolithography is one of the main mass nanoproduction processes.
   Manufacturing small devices by photolithography is a challenge because

   Literature models are usable for only long (i.e., LAR, pattern
   length/spacing greater than 20) two-line parallel patterns. In the
   current study, a numerical framework is introduced that allows study the
   collapse of different pattern geometries. In this framework, the rinse
   interface shape is found using Surface Evolver, and pattern deformation
   is found using ANSYS through coupled modeling. The results of the new
   numerical approach, was in agreement with the analytical model results
   in the range of its applicability (i.e., long two-line parallel
   pattern). The developed numerical framework was then used to study a few
   simple geometries where the analytical model was not applicable. One of
   the findings from the numerical framework results was that, despite the
   fact that buttresses stiffen the patterns, buttressed patterns deform

Abstract = {{We present a new integrated micro-endoscopy system combining label-free,
   fiber-based, real-time C-scan optical-resolution photoacoustic
   microscopy (F-OR-PAM) and a high-resolution fluorescence micro-endoscopy
   system for visualizing fluorescently labeled cellular components and
   optically absorbing microvasculature simultaneously. With a diode-pumped
   532-nm fiber laser, the F-OR-PAM sub-system is able to reach a
   resolution of similar to 7 mu m. The fluorescence subsystem, which does
   not require any mechanical scanning, consists of a 447.5-nm-centered
   diode laser as the light source, an objective lens, and a CCD camera.
   Proflavine is used as the fluorescent contrast agent by topical
   application. The scanning laser and the diode laser light source share
   the same light path within an optical fiber bundle containing 30,000
   individual single-mode fibers. The absorption of proflavine at 532 nm is
   low, which mitigates absorption bleaching of the contrast agent by the
   photoacoustic excitation source. We demonstrate imaging in live murine
   models. The system is able to provide cellular morphology with cellular
   resolution co-registered with the structural information given by
   F-OR-PAM. Therefore, the system has the potential to serve as a virtual
   biopsy technique, helping visualize angiogenesis and the effects of
   anti-cancer drugs on both cells and the microcirculation, as well as aid
   in the study of other diseases. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{The photonic band structures (PBSs) of oblique incidence propagation in
   one-dimensional plasma-doped photonic crystals (PCs) are investigated
   carefully. When the lattice constant of plasma-doped PCs is less than
   the incident wavelength, the PC becomes anisotropic. Therefore, the
   dielectric constant of PC is converted into a complex tensor dielectric
   constant. This determines the PBSs of PCs. In the present paper,
   one-dimensional PCs are taken as an example to study both normal and
   absorption PBSs. Using both the effective medium approximation and the
   transfer matrix method, we can derive the dispersion relation for PCs.
   The dependence of the plasma filling factor on the effective dielectric
   constant and PBSs is calculated and discussed. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{In many communication channels, the ambient disturbance is known through
   experimental evidence as well as theoretical considerations to deviate
   strongly from the Gaussian model. In order to evaluate the performance

   non-Gaussian noise and study the performance of communication systems
   employing block data transmission in the presence of impulsive noise.
   Analytical expressions for assessing codeword error probability and bit
   error probability are derived for hard-decision decoders, soft-decision
   decoders and optimum maximum likelihood detectors in both nonfading and
   quasi-static Rayleigh fading scenarios. Numerical results are presented
   for different codes, block sizes and error rate levels. The

Abstract = {{When using alternating current submerged arc welding to produce pipes
   from microalloyed linepipe steel strip, it is necessary to balance
   penetration depth and deposition rates in order to minimise the number
   of weld passes while still maintaining good heat affected zone
   properties. A series of bead on plate submerged arc welds were performed
   on X70 steel, varying either traditional variables (i.e. current,
   voltage, travel speed and polarity) or waveform variables (i.e. balance,
   offset and frequency). Cross-section profile areas were measured,
   penetration profile shape {[}i.e. the semipenetration (SP) ratio] was
   calculated and hardness and Charpy V notch (CVN) impact testing were
   performed. By using a 3.2 mm welding wire with a constant current mode,
   increased current resulted in greater wire feed speeds (WFS), while WFS
   was reduced by increasing voltage or decreasing travel speed. Increased
   balance reduced WFS and increased weld penetration, while offset and
   frequency did not appear to significantly affect WFS or bead profile.
   Waveform variables did not have significant effects on Vickers hardness
   traverses. Preliminary CVN testing showed that using 30 Hz frequency
   resulted in lower fracture energies, and using 75\% balance resulted in
   greater energies. Improved CVN results were achieved when welds were
   produced with lower heat input and greater SP ratio values.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The complex interaction between several variables in magnetron
   sputtering discharges is a challenge in developing engineering design
   tools for industrial applications. For instance, at high pressures,
   rarefaction and gas heating should no longer be neglected for
   determining several parameters of the process. In this article, we use a
   comprehensive 3D reactor-scale simulator that incorporates most
   phenomena of interest in a self-consistent manner to simulate the
   transport of sputtered particles over a wide range of pressures and
   powers. Calculations of aluminum deposition rates and metal vapor
   densities are in reasonable agreement with experiments over a wide range
   of pressures and powers. Of the elements investigated (Al, Ti, and Cu),
   copper showed the greatest rarefaction (30\%) due to its higher
   sputtering yield. Titanium, despite a slightly lower sputtering yield
   than Al, shows a greater rarefaction than aluminum as more particles are
   reflected from the target as high energy neutrals. In this case, a more
   efficient energy transfer process is responsible for the higher
   rarefaction observed in Ti sputtering when compared to Al. The authors
   also observed that by sputtering at a higher pressure, the probability
   of electron impact ionization of sputtered particles is increased and
   speculate about the role of this process in contrast to penning
   ionization, which is believed to be the dominant ionization mechanism in
   magnetron sputtering. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society.

   water at high pressures in large pipes. One solution for rural areas is
   supplying only potable water using small pipes that are supplied in long
   spools and that can be ploughed-in, a novel method of direct-bury. This
   water is delivered to private cisterns at low pressure, extending the
   range of the system for the same input energy level. Pressure control
   valves are used to keep pressure positive at high points to safeguard
   water quality. Modelling is particularly important in rural systems,
   where extensive pipeline distances and elevation difference result in
   significant head losses and areas of high local pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can improve walking in
   individuals with mobility impairments. We evaluated accelerometers,
   force sensitive resistors, segment angles, and segment angular
   velocities to identify which sensor best determines the activation and
   deactivation times of the main muscles used during walking. This
   sensor(s) can be used in the future in conjunction with FES systems to
   improve walking. Able-bodied subjects walked at various speeds.
   Threshold levels were set for each sensor that minimized the difference
   between the times of activating and deactivating the electromyogram
   (EMG) of six muscles and the times of sensor threshold crossings as a
   percent of the step cycle. Mobility-impaired subjects walked at their
   preferred speed with and without FES to correct foot drop. Thresholds
   were set for these subjects so that sensor signals would cross at times
   that matched those of able-bodied subjects. Segment angles were
   generally the most effective sensor signals. Using segment angles of the
   thigh, shank, and foot, activation and deactivation times of the six
   muscles could be determined to within 6\% of the step cycle. The shank
   segment angle produced the lowest overall error and was among the top
   three sensors for 10 of the 12 events (activation and deactivation of
   six muscle groups). A segment angle sensor was implemented using a
   complementary filter (accelerometer/gyroscope combination). Using this
   sensor improved rule-based timing of FES in subjects with foot drop as
   compared to accelerometers alone.}},

Abstract = {{Bracing is a common nonsurgical treatment for scoliosis, but its
   effectiveness has been debated. Some clinical studies have shown
   efficacy of brace treatment is correlated to how the brace has been
   worn. The more often the patients wear their braces to the prescribed
   tightness as well as the prescribed length of wear each day, the better
   the treatment outcome. A system of four wireless pressure control
   devices was developed to understand brace wear-time and regulate a
   target pressure range at the brace-body interface. Each pressure control
   device could function independently and be embedded in the brace at key
   pressure areas. Such a system could improve the quality of brace
   wear-making the treatment more effective and refining our understanding
   of the three-pressure-point brace treatment concept during daily
   activities. This paper reports the system development and validation.
   The system was tested on four healthy subjects for 2 h without pressure
   regulation and 2 h with regulation. The results show that the pressure
   regulation doubled the time spent in a desired pressure range on average
   (from 31\% to 62\%). Brace-wear time was logged correctly. The system
   was also validated through a seven-day continuous test, and a fully
   charged battery could run for 30 days without requiring recharge.}},

Title = {{Proximal humeral fracture fixation: locking plate construct +/-

Abstract = {{Background: Locking plate constructs for proximal humeral fractures can
   fail due to varus collapse, especially in osteoporotic bone with medial
   cortex comminution. Augmentation, using a fibular allograft as an
   intramedullary bone peg, may strengthen fixation preventing varus
   collapse. This study investigated the ability of the augmented locking
   plate construct to withstand repetitive varus stresses relative to the
   nonaugmented construct.
   Materials and methods: Proximal humeral fractures with medial
   comminution were simulated by performing wedge-shaped osteotomies at the
   surgical neck in cadaveric specimens. For each cadaver (n = 8), 1
   humeral fracture was fixated with the locking plate construct alone and
   the other with the locking plate construct plus ipsilateral fibular
   autograft augmentation. The humeral head was immobilized and a
   repetitive, medially directed load was applied to the humeral shaft
   until construct collapse or until 25000 cycles were completed.
   Results: No augmented construct collapsed. In comparison, 6 of 8
   nonaugmented constructs collapsed (P < .05). Collapse in the 6
   nonaugmented constructs occurred after an average +/- SD of 6604 +/-
   1984 cycles. Screw penetration of the articular surface was found in
   only 1 of the nonaugmented constructs.
   Conclusion: Fibular allograft augmentation increased the ability of the
   locking plate to withstand repetitive varus loading. Clinically, this
   may assist proximal humeral fracture fixation in osteoporotic bone with
   medial cortex comminution.

Abstract = {{We tailored nanostructured morphology and crystal texture of iron
   nanocolumns by engineering the inclination and azimuthal directions of
   the collimated flux characteristic of glancing angle deposition (GLAD).
   Under continuous substrate rotation, the flux is azimuthally isotropic
   within one rotation. With large substrate rotation speeds, we can
   deposit vertical nanocolumns with a faceted, tetrahedral apex, BCC
   crystal structure and < 111 > fiber texture. Designing the flux to have
   an azimuthal 3-fold symmetry, which reflects the symmetry of the
   tetrahedral apex, allows us to induce both an in-plane and out-of-plane
   texture (biaxial texture) by evolutionary selection. In-plane crystal
   orientation is accompanied by a preferential azimuthal nanocolumn
   orientation, where the sides of tetrahedral apex are directed toward the
   flux direction. This work demonstrates the flux engineering technique,
   which can orient in-plane crystal texture and morphology of crystalline
   nanocolumns on amorphous substrates. This control is a useful addition
   to vapor solid, physical self-assembly with the potential to improve the
   performance of porous thin film architectures as biaxial buffer layers,
   and in a variety of device applications such as photovoltaics and energy
   storage.}},

   Weather conditions can be obtained with high resolution, providing
   environmental conditions virtually at every point of a transmission
   system. This novel approach provides a complete spatiotemporal view of
   the thermal state of the system, bringing a whole new dimension to the
   research of thermal aging. All described types of aging analysis are
   important for effective transmission asset management, for scheduling of

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Synchronous distributed generators are prone to operate islanded after
   contingencies, which is usually not allowed due to safety and
   power-quality issues. Thus, there are several anti-islanding techniques;
   however, most of them present technical limitations so that they are
   likely to fail in certain situations. Therefore, it is important to
   quantify and determine whether the scheme under study is adequate or
   not. In this context, this paper proposes an index to evaluate the
   effectiveness of anti-islanding frequency-based relays commonly used to
   protect synchronous distributed generators. The method is based on the
   calculation of a numerical index that indicates the time period that the
   system is unprotected against islanding considering the global period of
   analysis. Although this index can precisely be calculated based on
   several electromagnetic transient simulations, a practical method is
   also proposed to calculate it directly from simple analytical formulas
   or lookup tables. The results have shown that the proposed approach can
   assist distribution engineers to assess and set anti-islanding
   protection schemes.}},

   geosynthetic remain elastic, an elastoplastic analytical procedure for
   foundations improved by GECs is proposed. The radial stresses that the
   geosynthetic provides and the elastoplastic deformations of the
   foundation resting on a rigid base are derived. A comparison with finite
   element analysis shows that the proposed method is effective and can
   provide a reasonable prediction of a GEC's deformation. Subsequent
   parametric analysis indicates that higher geosynthetic stiffness leads
   to better performance of the composite foundation. The optimum length of
   encasement is related to the load acting on the foundation and the
   permissible vertical and radial displacements of the column. Moreover,
   as the dilation angle of the column increases, the settlement decreases,
   especially under high loading. The influence of the encasement is more
   significant in soils with smaller elastic modulus.}},

Title = {{Potential mechanism of alendronate inhibition of osteophyte formation in

Abstract = {{Objective: To employ elemental Strontium as a tracer of bone turnover,
   in the presence (or absence) of the bisphosphonate drug Alendronate, in
   order to spatially map osteophytogenesis and other bone turnover in rats
   developing post-traumatic secondary osteoarthritis (PTOA).
   Methods: PTOA was induced in rats by medial meniscectomy surgery. We
   utilized in-vivo microfocal computed tomography (CT) to follow bony
   adaptations in groups for 8 weeks after surgery, either with or without
   alendronate treatment. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) was used to
   detect Strontium incorporation in mineralizing tissues. Histologic
   studies were conducted on the same samples using Safranin-O/fast green
   and Tetrachrome staining of decalcified sections to examine articular
   cartilage health and osteophyte formation at the sites of elemental
   Strontium deposition.
   Results: EPMA revealed uniform incorporation of Strontium over actively
   remodeling trabecular surfaces in normal control rats. That pattern was
   significantly altered after meniscectomy surgery resulting in greater
   Strontium signal at the developing osteophyte margins. Alendronate
   treatment inhibited osteophyte development by 40\% and 51\% quantified
   by micro-CT volumetric measurements at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery,
   respectively. Osteophytes in the alendronate group were more
   cartilaginous in composition {[}i.e., lower bone mineral density (BMD)]
   compared to the untreated group. Histological analysis confirmed the
   osteophyte inhibitory effect of alendronate, and also verified reduced
   degeneration of the articular cartilage compared to untreated rats.
   Conclusion: Our study confirmed that alendronate administration will
   reduce osteophyte formation in a rat model of post-traumatic
   osteoarthritis, partially through the inhibition of secondary remodeling
   of osteophytes. Our study is the first to employ elemental Strontium as
   a tracer of bone turnover in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and to
   assess the efficacy of bisphosphonate antiresorptive drug interventions
   on osteophytogenesis. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Abstract = {{The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 alpha/CXCL12 and its
   receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) play a crucial role in the
   homing/engraftment and retention of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
   (HSPCs) in the bone marrow. It has been shown using the viral gene
   transfer technique that CXCR4 overexpression on human CD34(+) HSPC
   significantly improves their engraftment in murine models. However,
   clinical trials with gene therapy have revealed safety concerns related
   to the immunogenicity of the viral carriers, due to the random
   integration of viral genes into the host genome. Therefore, a method for
   CXCR4 gene delivery into HSPC that is safe, nonviral, and highly
   efficient is needed to improve clinical transplantation and gene
   therapies. In this work, we investigated the nonviral CXCR4 gene
   delivery into HSPC using the cationic liposome agent IBAfect. We used
   CD34(+) cells from cord blood and the models of immature hematopoietic
   cells expressing CD34 antigen, namely, leukemic cell lines KG-1a and
   KG-1. Transfection efficiency was determined by flow cytometric analysis
   12, 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, and the viability of cells
   analyzed by trypan blue exclusion and MTS assays. The functional
   response of CXCR4-transfected HSPC toward an SDF-1 alpha gradient was
   determined by chemotaxis assay. We found that similar to 25\%
   transfection is achieved for KG-1a and KG-1 cells and 20\% for HSPC, and
   that the viability of CXCR4-transfected HSPC is not significantly
   altered. More importantly, overexpression of CXCR4 using IBAfect
   significantly increased the chemotaxis of KG-1 cells and HSPC toward
   SDF-1 alpha. However, we tested 2 other commercially available cationic
   liposomes (Lipofectamine 2000 and
   1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane {[}DOTAP]) in parallel, and we
   found that they failed to deliver the CXCR4 gene into cells under the
   same conditions. These results suggest that IBAfect-mediated in vitro
   gene delivery to overexpress CXCR4 on HSPC is a safe and efficient
   technique with great potential for improving the efficacy of HSPC
   transplantation and gene therapy protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past twenty years, several computer models for structured

   such a model, based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), for
   simulating fluid flow in an elliptical shaped honeycomb monolith reactor
   comprising a total of 7539 parallel channels. This example of industrial
   relevance will serve to evidence the progress made in computer modeling
   in recent years, but also to bring up aspects that need to be further
   improved, such as the use of LBM to simulate efficiently turbulent flow
   and heat and mass transfer in this type of structured catalytic

   density, the diffuser angle and the aspect ratio. The mass flow rate of
   the feed also has a strong influence. Monolith substrates with a high
   cell density showed faster light-off for a model reaction. A dual zone
   monolith consisting of a high cell density core and a low cell density
   outer annulus showed worse performance in the light-off compared to all
   other configurations tested. The overall execution time required for a
   two dimensional simulation required anything from under a minute for a

Abstract = {{This paper describes a computational study of a proposed recuperative

   layers of washcoated monolith channels through which the fluid passes in
   counter-current flow. Heat transfer occurs continuously across the
   boundary separating the layers, thus the exiting hot gas exchanges
   energy with the incoming cold gas. Monoliths composed of cordierite and
   silicon carbide are compared, each of which had 12\% by volume washcoat
   applied. The effects of layer thickness, monolith length and space time
   are compared. It is found that the monolith comprised of higher thermal
   conductivity material is more effective in enhancing the temperature in
   the reactor. Conversion of methane entering the reactor at relatively
   low temperatures can be oxidised with some added thermal energy. (C)

Abstract = {{An efficient implementation of Nakagami-m and Weibull variate generators
   on a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is presented. The
   hardware model first generates a correlated Rayleigh fading variate
   sequence and then transforms it into a sequence of Nakagami-m or Weibull
   fading variates. A biquad processor facilitates the compact
   implementation of a Rayleigh variate generator with arbitrary
   autocorrelation properties. A combination of logarithmic and linear
   domain segmentations along with piece-wise linear approximations is used
   to accurately implement the nonlinear numerical functions required to
   transform the correlated Rayleigh fading process into Nakagami-m or
   Weibull fading processes. When implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5
   5VSX240TFF1738-2 FPGA, the fading simulator uses only 1.6\% of the
   configurable slices, 1.2\% of the DSP48E modules and 3 block memories,
   while operating at 120 MHz, generating 120 million complex variates per

Abstract = {{The problem of multivariate alarm analysis and rationalization is
   complex and important in the area of smart alarm management due to the
   interrelationships between variables. The technique of capturing and
   visualizing the correlation information, especially from historical
   alarm data directly, is beneficial for further analysis. In this paper,
   the Gaussian kernel method is applied to generate pseudo continuous time
   series from the original binary alarm data. This can reduce the
   influence of missed, false, and chattering alarms. By taking into
   account time lags between alarm variables, a correlation color map of
   the transformed or pseudo data is used to show clusters of correlated
   variables with the alarm tags reordered to better group the correlated
   alarms. Thereafter correlation and redundancy information can be easily
   found and used to improve the alarm settings; and statistical methods
   such as singular value decomposition techniques can be applied within
   each cluster to help design multivariate alarm strategies. Industrial
   case studies are given to illustrate the practicality and efficacy of
   the proposed method. This improved method is shown to be better than the
   alarm similarity color map when applied in the analysis of industrial
   alarm data. (C) 2012 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study the internal stress field of a three-phase two-dimensional
   inclusion of arbitrary shape bonded to an unbounded matrix through an
   intermediate interphase layer when the matrix is subjected to remote
   uniform in-plane stresses. The elastic materials occupying all three
   phases belong to a particular class of compressible hyperelastic
   harmonic materials. Our analysis indicates that the internal stress
   field can be uniform and hydrostatic for some nonelliptical shapes of
   the inclusion, and all of the possible shapes of the inclusion
   permitting internal uniform hydrostatic stresses are identified. Three
   conditions are derived that ensure an internal uniform hydrostatic
   stress state. Our rigorous analysis indicates that for the given
   material and geometrical parameters of the three-phase inclusion of a
   nonelliptical shape, at most, eight different sets of remote uniform
   Piola stresses can be found, leading to internal uniform hydrostatic
   stresses. Finally, the analytical results are illustrated through an

Journal = {{ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{607-617}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory testing of rocks is traditionally carried out to determine
   the peak strength using the ISRM Suggested Methods or other suitable
   standards. However, it is well known that in low-porosity crystalline
   rocks there are at least three distinct stages of compressive loading
   that can be readily identified if the stress-strain response is
   monitored during the loading process: (1) crack initiation, (2) unstable
   crack growth, i.e., crack coalescence and (3) peak strength. Crack
   initiation is noted as the first stage of stress-induced damage in
   low-porosity rocks, yet the suggested guidelines of the ISRM for
   compression tests make no mention of crack initiation. In addition,
   recent research suggests that crack initiation can be used as an
   estimate for the in situ spalling strength, commonly observed around
   underground excavations in massive to moderately jointed brittle rocks.
   Various methods have been proposed for identifying crack initiation in
   laboratory tests. These methods are evaluated using ten samples of
   A{''}spo Diorite and the results are compared with a simplified method,
   lateral strain response. Statistically, all methods give acceptable
   crack-initiation values. It is proposed that the ISRM Suggested Methods
   be revised to include procedures suitable for establishing the
   crack-initiation stress.}},

Abstract = {{Essential collective dynamics is a promising and robust approach for
   analysing the slow motions of macromolecules from short molecular
   dynamics trajectories. In this study, an extension of the method to
   treat a collection of interacting protein molecules is presented. The
   extension is applied to investigate the effects of dimerization on the
   collective dynamics of ovine prion protein molecules in two different
   arrangements. Examination of the structural plasticity shows that
   aggregation has a restricting effect on the local mobility of the prion
   protein molecules in the interfacial regions. Domain motions of the two
   dimeric ovine prion protein conformations are distinctly different and
   can be related to interatomic correlations at the interface. Correlated
   motions are among the slow collective modes extensively analysed by
   considering both main-chain and side-chain atoms. Correlation maps
   reveal the existence of a vast network of dynamically correlated side
   groups, which extends beyond individual subunits via interfacial
   interconnections. The network is formed by a core of hydrophobic side
   chains surrounded by hydrophilic groups at the periphery. The relevance
   of these findings are discussed in the context of mutations associated
   with prion diseases. The binding free energy of the dimeric
   conformations is evaluated to probe their thermodynamic stability. The
   descriptions afforded by the analysis of the essential collective
   dynamics of the prion dimers are consistent with their binding free
   energies. The agreement validates the extension of the methodology and
   provides a means of interpreting the collective dynamics in terms of the
   thermodynamic stability of ovine prion proteins. Proteins 2012. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Statistical learning theory is regarded as an appropriate theory to deal
   with learning problems on small samples, and it has now become a novel
   research interest of the machine learning field. However, the theory is
   based on real-valued random samples and established on probability
   measure space; it rarely deals with learning problems based on fuzzy
   random samples and established on Sugeno measure space. It is well known
   that fuzzy random samples and Sugeno measure space are interesting and
   important extensions of real-valued random samples and probability
   measure space, respectively. Therefore, the statistical learning theory
   based on fuzzy random samples in Sugeno measure space is further
   discussed in this paper. Firstly, based on definitions of the
   distribution function and the expected value of fuzzy random variables
   in Sugeno measure space, the Hoeffding inequality of fuzzy random
   variables is proved. Secondly, for the sake of completeness of the
   paper, the key theorem of learning theory based on fuzzy random samples
   in Sugeno measure space is introduced. Finally, the bounds on the rate
   of uniform convergence of a learning process based on fuzzy random
   samples in Sugeno measure space are constructed.}},

Abstract = {{An assessment of the impact of ultraviolet (UV) reflection from inner
   walls is important for the accuracy of model predictions of fluence rate
   (FR) distribution and for the improvement of reactor efficiency. In this
   study, the FR distribution in an annular UV reactor with inner walls of
   various reflectances was measured in-situ by using a 360 degrees
   response micro-fluorescent silica detector. The tests were performed in
   water with various transmittances ranging from 65\% to 99\% and with
   inner reactor walls composed of quartz/aluminum foil, quartz/stainless
   steel, or quartz/black cloth, whose reflection coefficients were
   determined to be 80.5\%, 26.1\% and 11.1\%, respectively. The results
   demonstrate that an inner wall with a high reflection coefficient can
   lead to a marked increase in the weighted average FRs, thus greatly
   improving the reactor efficiency. Furthermore, the presently used FR
   distribution models could have an error of up to 35\% for commonly used
   stainless steel walls as a result of the influence of inner-wall
   reflection. Finally, it was found that the uniformity of the FR
   distribution is strongly dependent on the diffuse reflection property of
   the inner wall, which could lead to a better fluence delivery
   distribution in the UV reactor. This work has potential application to
   increase the accuracy of model predictions as well as optimize the
   design of high-efficiency UV reactors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: Spasticity is a common complication with neurological
   diseases and CNS lesions. Instrumented systems to evaluate spasticity
   often cannot provide an immediate result, thus limiting their clinical
   usefulness. In this study we investigated the accuracy and reliability
   of the portable Neurokinetics RA1 Ridgidity Analyzer to measure
   stiffness of the ankle joint in 46 controls, 14 spinal cord injured
   (SCI) and 23 multiple sclerosis (MS) participants.
   Methods: Ankle stiffness measures were made twice by two raters, at
   speeds above and below the expected stretch reflex threshold. Ankle
   torque was measured with the portable device and a stationary torque
   motor. Inter- and intra-rater reliability was assessed with the
   intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).
   Results: Stiffness measures with the portable and stationary devices
   were significantly correlated for controls and MS participants (p <
   0.01). Intra-rater reliability for the portable device ranged from
   0.60-0.89 (SCI) and 0.63-0.67 (control) and inter-rater reliability
   ranged from 0.70-0.73 (SCI) and 0.61-0.77 (control). Ankle stiffness
   measures in SCI and MS participants were significantly larger than in
   controls for both slow (p < 0.05) and fast movements (p < 0.01), with
   stiffness being larger for fast compared to slow movements in SCI and MS
   participants (p < 0.05), but not in controls (p = 0.5).
   Conclusion: The portable device correlated well with measures obtained
   by a torque motor in both controls and MS participants, showed high
   intra- and inter-rater reliability for the SCI participants, and could
   easily distinguish between stiff and control ankle joints. However, the
   device, in its current form, maybe less accurate during rapid movements
   when inertia contributes to stiffness and the shape of the air-filled
   pads did not provide a good interface with the foot.
   Significance: This study demonstrates that a portable device can
   potentially be a useful diagnostic tool to obtain reliable information
   of stiffness for the ankle joint. (C) 2011 International Federation of

Abstract = {{This paper proposes large-scale transient stability simulation based on
   the massively parallel architecture of multiple graphics processing
   units (GPUs). A robust and efficient instantaneous relaxation (IR)-based
   parallel processing technique which features implicit integration, full

   multiple GPUs simultaneously. This implementation highlights the
   combination of coarse-grained algorithm-level parallelism with
   fine-grained data-parallelism of the GPUs to accelerate large-scale
   transient stability simulation. Multithreaded parallel programming makes
   the entire implementation highly transparent, scalable, and efficient.
   Several large test systems are used for the simulation with a maximum
   size of 9,984 buses and 2,560 synchronous generators all modeled in
   detail resulting in matrices that are larger than 20,000 x 20,000.}},

Abstract = {{Single layer La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 hollow fibre (HF) precursors (< 1 mm
   ID) produced by phase inversion (PI) were sintered at 1,200, 1,350 and
   1,400 A degrees C. The increase in sintering temperature resulted in
   microstructural changes in the LSCF fibres, reflected in their
   electrical conductivities. LSCF-based cathodes with different designs
   were brushed onto co-extruded nickel-gadolinium-doped ceria (CGO)
   anode/CGO electrolyte dual-layer HFs (< 1 mm ID) fabricated by PI. The
   effect of cathode layers on the overall performance of the fuel cells
   (FCs) was assessed using nearly identical anode and electrolyte
   compositions, thicknesses, and microstructures. Cathode microstructure
   design caused cells to perform differently producing peak power
   densities of 0.35-0.7 W cm(-2) at 600 A degrees C. Impedance
   spectroscopy analysis at 600 A degrees C on the FCs produced 0.12-0.24
   Omega cm(2) confirming the cathode's structural effect on the overall
   area-specific resistance of the FCs. The best performing FC with a
   brush-deposited cathode was compared to a similar FC where cathode was
   deposited by dip coating; at 600 A degrees C the first produced 0.6 W
   cm(-2) while the second cell 0.7 W cm(-2). Co-extruding anodes and
   electrolytes by using PI and combining dip coating for cathode
   deposition could lead to the fabrication of FCs with enhanced
   microstructures and improved performances.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction of a rotor with a stationary part is a kind of serious
   malfunction that could result in a catastrophic failure if remained
   undetected. Past analytical and numerical simulation work on
   rotor-stator interactions mainly focus on the vibrations along the
   lateral directions. The torsional degree of freedom (dof) is usually
   ignored. The present work is aimed to study the influence of a rotor to
   stator contact on the lateral-torsional coupled vibrations. A
   mathematical model consisting of interacting vibratory systems of rotor
   and stator is presented. The contact is modeled using contact stiffness,
   damping and Coulomb friction. Equations derived for kinetic, potential
   and dissipation energies and non-conservative external forces are used
   in the Langrange's equations for deriving the motion equations for the
   rotor-stator system. Equations revealed that the lateral-torsional
   motion coupling exists twofold for the rotor. The unbalance couples
   lateral-torsional motion of rotor through inertia and damping matrices.
   Coupling due to the rotor-stator friction occurs through a force vector.
   The nonlinear equations are solved using a Runge-Kutta fourth-order
   numerical integration scheme using relatively small time step. Results
   obtained through the proposed model are compared with the identical
   rotor-stator system without torsional dof and differences are
   identified. Effect of several parameters such as speed, relative
   inertia, coefficient of friction and contact damping on the bifurcation
   behavior of the rotor-stator motion has been investigated. Vibration
   motions presented in the forms of spectrum cascade of the coast-up
   response, and orbit and Poincar, plots of the steady-state response are
   exhibiting rich dynamic behavior of the system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the experimental and numerical simulation study of
   waterflooding of a very low permeability limestone outcrop. Continuous
   pressure measurements during waterflooding is carried out to estimate
   the permeability heterogeneity. Waterflooding experiments have been
   performed with vertical injection-vertical production (VI-VP) and
   vertical injection-horizontal production (VI-HP) well configurations.
   Relative permeability and permeability heterogeneity characteristics
   have been obtained for the limestone outcrop using pressure and oil
   recovery profiles obtained for VI-VP well configuration. These
   characteristics have further been used for simulation of VI-HP well
   configuration. The experimental and simulation recoveries are in good
   agreement whereas pressure profiles match qualitatively. For the outcrop
   under investigation, the experimental and simulated pressure profiles
   indicated the presence of permeability heterogeneity. The pressure
   measurements and numerical simulations provided the qualitative
   estimation of permeability heterogeneities of the studied outcrop. The
   nature of pressure profiles remained the same during waterflooding for
   both the well configurations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   illumination directions. While estimating surface normals using the
   Lambertian model of reflectance is well established, depth-map
   estimation is an ongoing field of research and dealing with image noise
   is an active topic. Using the zero-mean Gaussian model of image noise,
   this paper introduces a method for maximum likelihood depth-map
   estimation that accounts for the propagation of noise through all steps
   of the estimation process. Solving for maximum likelihood depth-map
   estimates involves an independent sequence of nonlinear regression
   estimates, one for each pixel, followed by a single large and sparse
   linear regression estimate. The linear system employs anisotropic
   weights, which arise naturally and differ in value to related work. The
   new depth-map estimation method remains efficient and fast, making it
   practical for realistic image sizes. Experiments using synthetic images
   demonstrate the method's ability to robustly estimate depth maps under
   the noise model. Practical benefits of the method on challenging imaging
   scenarios are illustrated by experiments using the Extended Yale Face
   Database B and an extensive data set of 500 reflected light microscopy
   image sequences.}},

Abstract = {{The single-ceramic-layer (SCL) 8YSZ (conventional and nanostructured
   8YSZ) and double-ceramic-layer (DCL) La2Zr2O7 (LZ)/8YSZ thermal barrier
   coatings (TBCs) were fabricated by plasma spraying on nickel-based
   superalloy substrates with NiCrAlY as the bond coat. The thermal shock
   behavior of the three as-sprayed TBCs at 1000 degrees C and 1200 degrees
   C was investigated. The results indicate that the thermal cycling
   lifetime of LZ/8YSZ TBCs is longer than that of SCL 8YSZ TBCs due to the
   fact that the DCL LZ/8YSZ TBCs further enhance the thermal insulation
   effect, improve the sintering resistance ability and relieve the thermal
   mismatch between the ceramic layer and the metallic layer at high
   temperature. The nanostructured 8YSZ has higher thermal shock resistance
   ability than that of the conventional 8YSZ TBC which is attributed to
   the lower tensile stress in plane and higher fracture toughness of the
   nanostructured 8YSZ layer. The pre-existed cracks in the surface
   propagate toward the interface vertically under the thermal activation.
   The nucleation and growth of the horizontal crack along the interface
   eventually lead to the failure of the coating. The crack propagation
   modes have been established, and the failure patterns of the three
   as-sprayed coatings during thermal shock have been discussed in detail.

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at quantifying the deposition of micrometer-sized
   aerosols in realistic oropharyngeal airway replicas of children 6-14
   years old, as well as minimizing interindividual scatter in correlations
   that fit this data. To perform this study, computed tomography (CT)
   images of nine children were taken during inhalation at a constant flow
   rate delivered by an AKITA (R) inhalation system. After segmenting the
   oral airways from the a scan images, rapid prototyping technology was
   employed to fabricate plastic replicas of the airways. Deposition was
   then measured by comparing the number concentration of jojoba oil
   particles, generated by a six-jet Collison atomizer, passing through the
   replica vs. a blank line with no replica attached. The number
   concentration and the size of particles in 6 size ranges in the
   aerodynamic size range of 0.5-5.3 mu m associated with the impactor
   stage cutpoints were measured using an electrical low pressure impactor
   (ELPI). Five medium to high constant breathing flow rates, ranging from
   30 to 150 L/min, were generated using two vacuum pumps in series. Prior
   to testing the children's replicas, our deposition measurements were
   validated using a well-characterized and commercially-available
   geometry, the Alberta Idealized Throat. The replicas were re-scanned
   with CT to ensure a high quality fabrication and to measure their
   dimensions. These dimensions were used to establish a non-dimensional
   correlation, consisting of Stokes and Reynolds numbers, to reduce the
   scatter in deposition. Our proposed correlation may be useful for the
   prediction of deposition of micrometer-sized particles in the
   oropharyngeal airways of children during inhalation at moderate to high
   constant flow rates, typical of that seen during the use of
   pharmaceutical aerosol inhalers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, a proximity fuzzy framework for clustering relational
   data is presented, where the relationships between the entities of the
   data are given in terms of proximity values. We offer a comprehensive
   and in-depth comparison of our clustering framework with proximity
   relational knowledge to clustering with distance relational knowledge,
   such as the well known relational Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). We conclude that
   proximity can provide a richer description of the relationships among
   the data and this offers a significant advantage when realizing
   clustering. We further motivate clustering relational proximity data and
   provide both synthetic and real-world experiments to demonstrate both
   the usefulness and advantage offered by clustering proximity data.
   Finally, a case study of relational clustering is introduced where we
   apply proximity fuzzy clustering to the problem of clustering a set of
   trees derived from software requirements engineering. The relationships
   between trees are based on the degree of closeness in both the location
   of the nodes in the trees and the semantics associated with the type of
   connections between the nodes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We developed a technique to decrease memory requirements when solving
   the integral equations of three-dimensional (3D) molecular theory of
   solvation, a.k.a. 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM), using
   the modified direct inversion in the iterative subspace (MDIIS)
   numerical method of generalized minimal residual type. The latter
   provides robust convergence, in particular, for charged systems and
   electrolyte solutions with strong associative effects for which damped
   iterations do not converge. The MDIIS solver (typically, with 2 X 10
   iterative vectors of argument and residual for fast convergence) treats
   the solute excluded volume (core), while handling the solvation shells
   in the 3D box with two vectors coupled with MDIIS iteratively and
   incorporating the electrostatic asymptotics outside the box
   analytically. For solvated systems from small to large macromolecules
   and solidliquid interfaces, this results in 6- to 16-fold memory
   reduction and corresponding CPU load decrease in MDIIS. We illustrated
   the new technique on solvated systems of chemical and biomolecular
   relevance with different dimensionality, both in ambient water and
   aqueous electrolyte solution, by solving the 3D-RISM equations with the
   KovalenkoHirata (KH) closure, and the hypernetted chain (HNC) closure
   where convergent. This coreshell-asymptotics technique coupling MDIIS
   for the excluded volume core with iteration of the solvation shells
   converges as efficiently as MDIIS for the whole 3D box and yields the
   solvation structure and thermodynamics without loss of accuracy.
   Although being of benefit for solutes of any size, this memory reduction
   becomes critical in 3D-RISM calculations for large solvated systems,
   such as macromolecules in solution with ions, ligands, and other
   cofactors. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{BEST: Improved Prediction of B-Cell Epitopes from Antigen Sequences}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Accurate identification of immunogenic regions in a given antigen chain
   is a difficult and actively pursued problem. Although accurate
   predictors for T-cell epitopes are already in place, the prediction of
   the B-cell epitopes requires further research. We overview the available
   approaches for the prediction of B-cell epitopes and propose a novel and
   accurate sequence-based solution. Our BEST (B-cell Epitope prediction
   using Support vector machine Tool) method predicts epitopes from antigen
   sequences, in contrast to some method that predict only from short
   sequence fragments, using a new architecture based on averaging selected
   scores generated from sliding 20-mers by a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   The SVM predictor utilizes a comprehensive and custom designed set of
   inputs generated by combining information derived from the chain,
   sequence conservation, similarity to known (training) epitopes, and
   predicted secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility.
   Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that BEST
   outperforms several modern sequence-based B-cell epitope predictors
   including ABCPred, method by Chen et al. (2007), BCPred, COBEpro,
   BayesB, and CBTOPE, when considering the predictions from antigen chains
   and from the chain fragments. Our method obtains a cross-validated area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the
   fragment-based prediction at 0.81 and 0.85, depending on the dataset.
   The AUCs of BEST on the benchmark sets of full antigen chains equal 0.57
   and 0.6, which is significantly and slightly better than the next best
   method we tested. We also present case studies to contrast the
   propensity profiles generated by BEST and several other methods.}},

Abstract = {{The prime example of a relevant industrial process in which fluid flow
   dynamics impacts desired process specifications is given by the
   Czochralski (CZ) crystal growth process. Melt flow in the crucible
   induces a variety of transport phenomena with profound effects on the
   mass, momentum, and heat transfer during the process. To provide novel
   insight into the transport phenomena associated with the CZ process melt
   flow, the approach of discerning the mixing templates by identifying
   Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) is explored. In particular, the LCS
   have been extracted to identify transport features in the melt during
   the crystal growth. The finite-element method has been employed to
   simulate realistic axisymmetric melt flow accounting for physically
   relevant geometries (including the melt-crystal and melt-ambient
   interfaces) for identification of the LCS. These structures are known to
   represent dynamically driven material surfaces, and they provide insight
   into mixing properties of the melt flow that influence the
   characteristics of the grown crystal.}},

Abstract = {{Edge effect is known to hinder spreading of a sessile drop. However, the
   underlying thermodynamic mechanisms responsible for the edge effect
   still is not well-understood. In this study, a free energy model has
   been developed to investigate the energetic state of drops on a single
   pillar (from upright frustum to inverted frustum geometries). An
   analysis of drop free energy levels before and after crossing the edge
   allows us to understand the thermodynamic origin of the edge effect. In
   particular, four wetting cases for a drop on a single pillar with
   different edge angles have been determined by understanding the
   characteristics of FE plots. A wetting map describing the four wetting
   cases is given in terms of edge angle and intrinsic contact angle. The
   results show that the free energy barrier observed near the edge plays
   an important role in determining the drop states, i.e., (1) stable or
   metastable drop states at the pillar's edge, and (2) drop collapse by
   liquid spilling over the edge completely or staying at an intermediate
   sidewall position of the pillar. This thermodynamic model presents an
   energetic framework to describe the functioning of the
   so-called,{''}re-entrant{''} structures. Results show good consistency
   with the literature and expand the current understanding of Gibbs'
   inequality condition.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{106-119}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulations of microsphere motion through a
   microfluidic separation device (pinched flow fractionation, PFF, device)
   were performed using the lattice Boltzmann method. The results were
   compared with the original experimental work on PFF by Yamada et al.
   (2004). The effects of the pinched segment width and the ratio between
   the particle solution and diluent flow rates were studied. Both analyses
   showed agreement with the experimental trends. Previous modelling of PFF
   has relied on the assumption that particles follow streamlines, and this
   assumption was evaluated. The simulations indicated that large particles
   experience a lift force due to a region of low pressure between the
   particle and the wall of the pinch. The lift force attracts the
   particles to the wall as they exit the pinched segment. Smaller
   particles experience a much weaker force. This force may provide an
   explanation for the experimental observation that a sharp expansion
   provides better separation performance than a gradual expansion, an
   effect that cannot be explained by streamline analyses. (c) 2012

Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{282-288}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Desorption of ethylene/ethane and carbon dioxide/methane mixtures was
   performed by microwave heating and conductive heating on Na-ETS-10. Gas
   recovery, Na-ETS-10 regeneration efficiency and swing capacity were
   compared between the two methods. Na-ETS-10 regeneration occurred within
   8 min for microwave heating and 22 min for conductive heating. For
   microwave heating the energy consumption was 0.7 kJ/g Na-ETS-10 and the
   gas recovery was 94\% for C2H4/C2H6 and 70\% for CO2/CH4. Conductive
   heating had an energy consumption of 7.7-7.9 kJ/g Na-ETS-10 and resulted
   in 71\% gas recovery for C2H4/C2H6 and 57\% for CO2/CH4. The adsorption
   capacity of Na-ETS-10 did not change over five adsorption-regeneration
   cycles for both heating techniques. Microwave desorption provided a
   faster heating rate and desorption rate, higher desorption and gas
   recovery and lower energy consumption compared to conductive heating.
   Hence, microwave heating can be used as a more efficient and energy
   saving regeneration technique for Na-ETS-10 for adsorptive separation of
   binary mixtures such as C2H4/C2H6 and CO2/CH4. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Ischemia episode detection in ECG using kernel density estimation,
   support vector machine and feature selection}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Myocardial ischemia can be developed into more serious
   diseases. Early Detection of the ischemic syndrome in electrocardiogram
   (ECG) more accurately and automatically can prevent it from developing
   into a catastrophic disease. To this end, we propose a new method, which
   employs wavelets and simple feature selection.
   Methods: For training and testing, the European ST-T database is used,
   which is comprised of 367 ischemic ST episodes in 90 records. We first
   remove baseline wandering, and detect time positions of QRS complexes by
   a method based on the discrete wavelet transform. Next, for each heart
   beat, we extract three features which can be used for differentiating ST
   episodes from normal: 1) the area between QRS offset and T-peak points,
   2) the normalized and signed sum from QRS offset to effective zero
   voltage point, and 3) the slope from QRS onset to offset point. We
   average the feature values for successive five beats to reduce effects
   of outliers. Finally we apply classifiers to those features.
   Results: We evaluated the algorithm by kernel density estimation (KDE)
   and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Sensitivity and specificity
   for KDE were 0.939 and 0.912, respectively. The KDE classifier detects
   349 ischemic ST episodes out of total 367 ST episodes. Sensitivity and
   specificity of SVM were 0.941 and 0.923, respectively. The SVM
   classifier detects 355 ischemic ST episodes.
   Conclusions: We proposed a new method for detecting ischemia in ECG. It
   contains signal processing techniques of removing baseline wandering and
   detecting time positions of QRS complexes by discrete wavelet transform,
   and feature extraction from morphology of ECG waveforms explicitly. It
   was shown that the number of selected features were sufficient to
   discriminate ischemic ST episodes from the normal ones. We also showed
   how the proposed KDE classifier can automatically select kernel
   bandwidths, meaning that the algorithm does not require any numerical
   values of the parameters to be supplied in advance. In the case of the
   SVM classifier, one has to select a single parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are short binding
   regions located within longer intrinsically disordered regions that bind
   to protein partners via disorder-to-order transitions. MoRFs are
   implicated in important processes including signaling and regulation.
   However, only a limited number of experimentally validated MoRFs is
   known, which motivates development of computational methods that predict
   MoRFs from protein chains.
   Results: We introduce a new MoRF predictor, MoRFpred, which identifies
   all MoRF types (alpha, beta, coil and complex). We develop a
   comprehensive dataset of annotated MoRFs to build and empirically
   compare our method. MoRFpred utilizes a novel design in which
   annotations generated by sequence alignment are fused with predictions
   generated by a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which uses a custom
   designed set of sequence-derived features. The features provide
   information about evolutionary profiles, selected physiochemical
   properties of amino acids, and predicted disorder, solvent accessibility
   and B-factors. Empirical evaluation on several datasets shows that
   MoRFpred outperforms related methods: alpha-MoRF-Pred that predicts
   alpha-MoRFs and ANCHOR which finds disordered regions that become
   ordered when bound to a globular partner. We show that our predicted
   (new) MoRF regions have non-random sequence similarity with native
   MoRFs. We use this observation along with the fact that predictions with
   higher probability are more accurate to identify putative MoRF regions.
   We also identify a few sequence-derived hallmarks of MoRFs. They are
   characterized by dips in the disorder predictions and higher
   hydrophobicity and stability when compared to adjacent (in the chain)
   residues.}},

Abstract = {{Water is integral to both operational and environmental aspects of the
   oil sands industry. A water treatment option based on the use of
   petroleum coke (PC), a by-product of bitumen upgrading, was examined as
   an opportunity to reduce site oil sands process-affected water (OSPW)
   inventories and net raw water demand. Changes in OSPW quality when
   treated with PC included increments in pH levels and concentrations of
   vanadium, molybdenum, and sulphate. Constituents that decreased in
   concentration after PC adsorption included total acid-extractable
   organics (TAO), bicarbonate, calcium, barium, magnesium, and strontium.
   Changes in naphthenic acids (NAs) speciation were observed after PC
   adsorption. A battery of bioassays was used to measure the OSPW
   toxicity. The results indicated that untreated OSPW was toxic towards
   Vibrio fischeri and rainbow trout. However, OSPW treated with PC at
   appropriate dosages was not acutely toxic towards these test organisms.
   Removal of TAO was found to be an adsorption process, fitting the
   Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm models. For TAO concentrations
   of 60 mg/L, adsorption capacities ranged between 0.1 and 0.46 mg/g. This
   study demonstrates that freshly produced PC from fluid cokers provides
   an effective treatment of OSPW in terms of key constituents' removal and
   toxicity reduction. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The statistical properties of training, validation and test data play an
   important role in assuring optimal performance in artificial neural
   networks (ANNs). Researchers have proposed optimized data partitioning
   (ODP) and stratified data partitioning (SDP) methods to partition of
   input data into training, validation and test datasets. ODP methods
   based on genetic algorithm (GA) are computationally expensive as the
   random search space can be in the power of twenty or more for an average
   sized dataset. For SDP methods, clustering algorithms such as self
   organizing map (SOM) and fuzzy clustering (FC) are used to form strata.
   It is assumed that data points in any individual stratum are in close
   statistical agreement. Reported clustering algorithms are designed to
   form natural clusters. In the case of large multivariate datasets, some
   of these natural clusters can be big enough such that the furthest data
   vectors are statistically far away from the mean. Further, these
   algorithms are computationally expensive as well. We propose a custom
   design clustering algorithm (CDCA) to overcome these shortcomings.
   Comparisons are made using three benchmark case studies, one each from
   classification, function approximation and prediction domains. The
   proposed COCA data partitioning method is evaluated in comparison with
   SOM, FC and GA based data partitioning methods. It is found that the
   CDCA data partitioning method not only perform well but also reduces the
   average CPU time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach with a new configuration is introduced to design an
   ultra-wideband (UWB) band-pass filter (BPF) that demonstrates
   double/single notch-bands using micro-strip transmission lines without
   using any via-hole. The proposed approach is established using two
   parallel stepped-impedance resonators (SIR) that provide two paths with
   different electrical lengths. The mechanism of realising notch-bands
   within the pass-band of the UWB BPF is developed based on the waves'
   cancellation theory. To realise single or double notch-bands (DNBs)
   within the pass-band of a UWB BPF, the conventional tri-section
   stepped-impedance resonator (TSSIR) is adopted and its fundamental and
   first spurious resonance frequencies are chosen either to be suppressed
   or supported. New parallel dual-section T-shaped and TSSIRs are
   proposed, optimised and fabricated to provide single and DNBss,
   respectively. The proposed concept avoids using via holes, which is
   conventionally used in notch filters. In addition, a size reduction of
   about 75\% is reported in comparison with the conventional BPF with a
   single notch-band accompanied by two transmission zeroes at the lower
   and upper stop-bands. Moreover, our proposed DNBs BPF demonstrates a
   comparable performance while being smaller in size (up to a 12.6\% size
   reduction) to that of the latest UWB BPF design that used complicated
   and expensive multilayer liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology.}},

Abstract = {{The trace metal content of municipal solid waste (MSW) compost affects
   the quality and potential end uses of the finished product. The impact
   of typical contaminants found in the organic fraction of MSW on the
   trace metal content of compost was investigated. Contaminants including
   alkaline batteries, galvanized nails, zinc-plated screws, copper wires,
   and electronic cables were exposed to a thermophilic composting process
   for three weeks. The increase in trace metal content in the compost
   product was measured at the end of the composting process. The results
   showed that low-quality alkaline batteries, galvanized nails,
   zinc-plated nails, and copper wires had a significant impact on the
   zinc, copper, arsenic, lead, and cobalt contents of compost. Copper
   wires showed the highest impact on copper content, which was 52\% of the
   Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Category A limit
   in the final compost. Galvanized nails contributed to final levels of
   zinc reaching 30\% of the CCME Category A limit. To ensure that CCME

Abstract = {{Time-varying forces from soil-machine interactions cause stresses in the
   components of earthmoving machinery, which may cause damage to the
   machine. It is not always possible to know all the characteristics of a
   soil sample prior to excavation; however, by estimating necessary soil
   parameters, it is possible to predict the soil-machine interaction
   forces in a practical manner. This article presents the development of a
   simple apparatus and method for estimating the soil parameters from the
   cutting force measured by the novel bench-scale excavating tool,
   validation of the soil model, and comparison with other available
   techniques. The apparatus used to collect data of soil forces on a tool
   consists of an instrumented crank-slider mechanism equipped with a thin
   plate to fragment the soil, which is contained in a sample box. Using
   the Mohr-Coulomb earth pressure model to predict failure force during
   the interaction, two methods are used to minimize the error between the
   predicted and measured failure force, that allows to estimate soil
   parameters: First, the Newton-Raphson Method (NRM) is used to minimize
   the error, which allows estimation of two soil parameters (interface
   friction angles) on non-cohesive soil samples. Additionally, a new
   estimation scheme based on the NRM is presented, that uses an auxiliary
   equation, and allows estimation of up to three soil parameters,
   including interface friction angles and cohesion. Comparing the results
   obtained from the presented apparatus, it is confirmed that the friction
   angles are successfully estimated for two non-cohesive particulate
   materials. Additionally, it is shown that the new scheme demonstrates
   smaller error in estimating soil parameters for cohesive and
   non-cohesive soil samples than previously reported methods. The
   parameter estimation method is subsequently applied to determine the
   properties of highly cohesive oil sand, and delivers promising results.

Abstract = {{ZEP brand electron beam resists are well-known for their high
   sensitivity and etch durability. The various performance metrics such as
   sensitivity, contrast, and resolution of ZEP resist depend strongly on
   the development process. In this work, we investigate the development of

   roughness measurements using three different classes of developer

   ambient temperature (22 degrees C) and cold (-15 degrees C) development
   conditions. In order to provide a deeper insight into the ZEP
   development process, we propose a novel kinetic model of dissolution for
   ZEP, and develop an efficient analytical method that allows determining
   the microscopic parameters of ZEP dissolution based on experimental
   contrast curves. We also observe experimentally and characterize the

Abstract = {{Objective: Investigate the effect of therapeutic Low Intensity Pulsed
   Ultrasound (LIPUS) on human dentine-pulp complex in an in vitro model.
   Design: 92 premolars were extracted from 23 adolescent orthodontic
   patients. The premolars were sectioned transversely into 600 mu m thick
   slices. The slices were divided into two main groups according to how
   often the LIPUS was applied (single or daily application), and then
   subdivided into five subgroups each (5, 10, 15 and 20 mm and one control
   group). The tooth slices were cultured at (37 degrees C/5\% CO2) in a
   humidified incubator where medium was changed every 48 h. LIPUS was
   applied using a 3.9 cm(2) transducer that produces an incident intensity
   of 30 mW/cm(2). After five days, tissue was harvested for
   histomorphometrical analysis and real time PCR to investigate expression
   of genes of interest (Collagen I, DMP1, DSPP, TGF-beta 1, RANKL and
   OPG).
   Results: Histomorphometric analyses revealed that odontoblast cell count
   was higher in the single application groups (5, 10 and 15 mm,
   respectively) than in the control and other treatment groups. Predentin
   thickness was higher in the single application group (10, 5 and 15 mm)
   respectively than in the daily application group and the control groups,
   however they were not significantly different from each other. Real time
   PCR demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the
   groups in the expression of Collagen I, DMP1, TGF-beta 1, DSPP, RANKL
   and OPG.
   Conclusion: Reproducible responses from cultured dentine-pulp complex
   were observed in groups with single application of LIPUS for 5, 10 and
   15 min. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights
