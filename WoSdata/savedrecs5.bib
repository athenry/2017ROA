Abstract = {{An elegant, compact and rigorous analytical solution is derived to the
   problem of a screw dislocation interacting with an anisotropic
   elliptical elastic inhomogeneity with interface stresses in the presence
   of remote uniform anti-plane shear stresses and uniform anti-plane
   eigenstrains imposed on the inhomogeneity. The screw dislocation can be
   located both outside and inside the inhomogeneity. The internal
   inhomogeneity and the surrounding matrix are monoclinic with the
   symmetry plane at x (3)=0. A modified anisotropic version of the
   Gurtin-Murdoch model of the surface/interface elasticity is incorporated
   into the elastic analysis. It is clearly observed from our results that
   the elastic fields in the composite and image force on the screw
   dislocation are size-dependent.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Western Canada is endowed with considerable reserves of deep un-mineable
   coal, which can be converted to syngas by means of a gasification
   process called underground coal gasification (UCG). The syngas can be
   transformed into hydrogen (H-2) through commercially available
   technologies employed in conventional fossil-fuel based H-2 production
   pathways. This paper presents a data-intensive model to evaluate life
   cycle GHG emissions in H-2 production from UCG with and without CCS.
   Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) was considered as a sequestration method and
   included in the LCA. The life cycle GHG emissions are calculated to be
   0.91 and 18.00 kg-CO2-eq/kg-H-2 in H-2 production from UCG with and
   without CCS, respectively. In addition, a detailed analysis of the
   influence of key UCG parameters, i.e., H2O-to-O-2 injection ratio,
   ground water influx, and steam-to-carbon ratio in syngas conversion, is
   completed on the results. The advantage of adopting UCG-CCS technology
   for H-2 production is realized over the predominant steam methane
   reforming (SMR) process; around 15.3 million tonnes of GHG emissions can
   be mitigated to achieve the projected SCO production rate from the
   bitumen upgrading in 2022. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed
   that the life cycle GHG emissions is sensitive to the heat exchanger
   efficiency and the separation efficiency of the pressure swing
   adsorption (PSA) unit, with increasing values of these parameters
   causing an increase and a decrease in the magnitude of life cycle GHG
   emissions, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Zn-air batteries, which are cost-effective and have high energy density,
   are promising energy storage devices for renewable energy and power
   sources for electric transportation. Nevertheless, limited charge and
   discharge cycles and low round-trip efficiency have long been barriers
   preventing the large-scale deployment of Zn-air batteries in the
   marketplace. Technology advancements for each battery component and the
   whole battery/cell assembly are being pursued, with some key milestones
   reached during the past 20 years. As an example, commercial Zn-air
   battery products with long lifetimes and high energy efficiencies are
   being considered for grid-scale energy storage and for automotive
   markets. In this review, we present our perspectives on improvements in
   Zn-air battery technology through the exploration and utilization of
   different electrolyte systems. Recent studies ranging from aqueous
   electrolytes to nonaqueous electrolytes, including solid polymer
   electrolytes and ionic liquids, as well as hybrid electrolyte systems
   adopted in Zn-air batteries have been evaluated. Understanding the
   benefits and drawbacks of each electrolyte, as well as the fundamental
   electrochemistry of Zn and air electrodes in different electrolytes, are
   the focus of this paper. Further consideration is given to detailed
   Zn-air battery configurations that have been studied and applied in
   commercial or nearing commercial products, with the purpose of exposing
   state-of-the-art technology innovations and providing insights into
   future advancements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{103}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Long period stacking ordered (LPSO) structure plays an important role in
   determining the strength and ductility of Mg-based ternary alloys. In
   this work, we investigated the thermodynamic stability of 10H LPSO
   structures in comparison with those of 14H and 18R LPSO structures. A
   trimer model was proposed to predict the possibility of forming LPSO
   structure in Mg-X-L-X-S (X-L = Rare earth, Ca, Sr and X-S = Al, Zn, Cu,
   Ni) with first-principles calculations. The formation of LPSO structure
   was determined based on the intrinsic stacking fault energy, mix energy
   and segregation energy. An element which decreases the intrinsic
   stacking fault energy is essential for the formation of LPSO structure.
   Decreasing the stacking fault energy favors the formation of local FCC
   layers, which would attract solid solutes segregating from HCP to local
   FCC Mg and forming L12 cluster and finally the LPSO structure. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Despite decades of research, the mechanisms of near-neutral pH stress
   corrosion cracking of pipeline steel are still not fully understood.
   This investigation was aimed to understand the effect of minor cycles
   with very high R ratios (minimum stress/maximum stress) on crack growth
   in air and in near-neutral pH environments. It has been demonstrated
   that the minor cycle, even with an R ratio as high as 0.9, could
   significantly contribute to the crack growth of pipeline steels in the
   presence of a large underload cycle with a low R ratio of 0.5 in
   near-neutral pH environment. Comparing with constant amplitude tests, an
   increase of crack growth rate by a factor of 3 and 5 was observed when
   some non-propagating minor cycles were combined with an underload cycle
   for tests in air and in near-neutral pH solution, respectively. Based on
   the test results, the crack growth mechanisms during minor cycle loading
   in near-neutral pH environments were discussed and practical strategies
   aimed to minimise crack growth during pipeline operation were also
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Highly boron-doped polysilicon is a fill candidate for through silicon
   via technology where the CVD polysilicon overburden is removed by
   chemical mechanical polish. However, for highly boron-doped polysilicon,
   increases in doping have a very large effect of polish removal rate,
   exemplified by a 70\% increase in doping causing a >3 x decrease in
   removal rate. In this paper we develop understanding of the role of
   chemical and mechanical effects on removal and advance a model to
   explain our results. Based on this model we develop an optimum removal
   process and also predict other strategies that could be used to further
   improve the process. The optimum polish outcome with a maximum polish
   rate of 0.37 mu m/min, minimum slurry consumption and acceptable surface
   quality was achieved under maximum mechanical forces and dry friction
   polishing at 120 rpm, 6 psi, 50 ml/min and at room temperature. This
   process is twice as fast as and reduces slurry consumption by a factor
   of 8 when compared to prior work. We predict that cooling the slurry/pad
   below room temperature will further increase the removal rate. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) is applied to three models for
   carbon-based molecular junctions containing fragments of graphene with
   covalent edge-bonding to aromatic and aliphatic molecules, with the
   graphene representing a sp(2) hybridized carbon electrode and the
   molecule representing a molecular layer between two electrodes. The DFT
   results agree well with experimental work functions and transport
   barriers, including the electronic coupling between molecular layers and
   graphitic contacts, and predict the compression of tunnel barriers
   observed for both ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and
   experimental tunneling currents. The results reveal the strong effect of
   the dihedral angle between the planes of the graphene electrode and the
   aromatic molecule and imply that the molecules with the smallest
   dihedral angle are responsible for the largest local current densities.
   In addition, the results are consistent with the proposal that the
   orbitals which mediate tunneling are those with significant electron
   density in the molecular layer. These conclusions should prove valuable
   for understanding the relationships between molecular structure and
   electronic transport as an important step toward rational design of
   carbon-based molecular electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Shortcut methods have an important role in the conceptual design of
   distillation processes because they rapidly provide constraints for
   important design parameters such as minimum reflux ratio, number of
   stages, process feasibility, possible splits, and, specifically for
   extractive distillation, minimum solvent feed ratio and maximum reflux
   ratio. In this work, a simplified method using reversible distillation
   models has been applied to the conceptual design of double feed
   extractive distillation columns. This work uses continuation methods for
   calculating the curves that determine the feasibility region and all of
   the resulting design parameters. Combining continuation methods with the
   column equations yields a simple method for calculating the pinch curves
   that border the feasibility region. As previously found by other
   authors, we observed that these extractive distillation pinch curves, in
   addition to determining the feasibility region, are also useful for
   calculating an approximate minimum entrainer feed ratio independent of
   other parameters, as well as accurately pinpointing the minimum and
   maximum reflux ratios. Applications to example extractive distillation
   systems allow us to conclude that the method is reliable, fast, and much
   easier to implement than other methods presented previously in the
   literature. The systems acetone methanol water and ethanol water
   ethylene glycol were employed as case studies, allowing a graphical
   assessment of the method; however, it can be used in the analysis of
   systems with more than three components.}},

Title = {{Ideal near-field thermophotovoltaic cells}},

Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{We ask the question, what are the ideal characteristics of a near-field
   thermophotovoltaic cell? Our search leads us to a reformulation of
   near-field radiative heat transfer in terms of the joint density of
   electronic states of the emitter-absorber pair in the thermophotovoltaic
   system. This form reveals that semiconducting materials with narrowband
   absorption spectra are critical to the energy-conversion efficiency.
   This essential feature is unavailable in conventional bulk semiconductor
   cells but can be obtained using low-dimensional materials. Our results
   show that the presence of matched van Hove singularities resulting from
   quantum confinement in the emitter and absorber of a thermophotovoltaic
   cell boosts both the magnitude and spectral selectivity of radiative
   heat transfer, dramatically improving energy-conversion efficiency. We
   provide a model near-field thermophotovoltaic system design making use
   of this idea by employing the van Hove singularities present in carbon
   nanotubes. Shockley-Queisser analysis shows that the predicted heat
   transfer characteristics of this model device are fundamentally better
   than existing thermophotovoltaic designs. Our work paves the way for the
   use of quantum dots, quantum wells, two-dimensional semiconductors,
   semiconductor nanowires, and carbon nanotubes as future materials for
   thermophotovoltaic cells.}},

Abstract = {{Partial least-Squares (PLS) is a-popular Method for the development
   of-data-driven models which in general are locally-Valid. To account for
   the time-varying properties of a process-and to maintain the performance
   of a PLS model, the model needs to be updated regularly. In order to
   reduce the high model updating frequency (which leads to a heavy
   computational load) in. typical adaptive modeling methods, in this work,
   a model performance assessment method is proposed to detect the
   significant model degradation, Avon which the model updating is
   activated. Subsequently, a dual updating-strategy based on the model
   performance assessment method is proposed for a moving-window PLS model
   in an attempt to effectively track the time-varying behavior of a
   process. In the dual updating strategy, model updating and bias updating
   are activated alternatively based on the results of the model
   performance assessment. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach, the dual updating method is applied to two industrial
   processes. The simulation results based on real industrial data
   demonstrate that the method can significantly reduce the model updating
   frequency while maintaining the prediction accuracy of the model.}},

Title = {{Using micro-CT derived bone microarchitecture to analyze bone stiffness
   - a case study on osteoporosis rat bone}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) images can be used to
   quantitatively represent bone geometry through a range of computed
   attenuation-based parameters. Nonetheless, those parameters remain
   indirect indices of bone microarchitectural strength and require further
   computational tools to interpret bone structural stiffness and potential
   for mechanical failure. Finite element analysis (FEA) can be applied to
   measure trabecular bone stiffness and potentially predict the location
   of structural failure in preclinical animal models of osteoporosis,
   although that procedure from image segmentation of Micro-CT derived bone
   geometry to FEA is often challenging and computationally expensive,
   resulting in failure of the model to build. Notably, the selection of
   resolution and threshold for bone segmentation are key steps that
   greatly affect computational complexity and validity. In the following
   study, we evaluated an approach whereby Micro-CT derived grayscale
   attenuation and segmentation data guided the selection of trabecular
   bone for analysis by FEA. We further correlated those FEA results to
   both two- and three-dimensional bone microarchitecture from sham and
   ovariectomized (OVX) rats (n = 10/group). A virtual cylinder of
   vertebral trabecular bone 40\% in length from the caudal side was
   selected for FEA, because Micro-CT based image analysis indicated the
   largest differences in microarchitecture between the two groups resided
   there. Bone stiffness was calculated using FEA and statistically
   correlated with the three-dimensional values of bone volume/tissue
   volume, bone mineral density, fractal dimension, trabecular separation,
   and trabecular bone pattern factor. Our method simplified the process
   for the assessment of trabecular bone stiffness by FEA from Micro-CT
   images and highlighted the importance of bone microarchitecture in
   conferring significantly increased bone quality capable of resisting
   failure due to increased mechanical loading.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the lack of interoperability across different engineering
   disciplinary domains remains a big issue in industrial practice, such as
   those major chemical process projects. Detailed engineering information
   is mainly exchanged verbally or, to a very limited extent, manually by
   technical documents, and hence the interdisciplinary dependencies,
   especially those tedious and error-prone references across domains, are
   not well maintained. The interoperability is hindered by the
   heterogeneous domain models used, and engineering semantics are not well
   maintained during the project lifecycle. This paper attempts to solve
   the informatics interoperability issue by proposing an inter-domain
   functional feature framework based on the associative feature mechanism
   and the exploration of commonalities of product and process models
   between chemical and mechanical domains. The schemas of feature models
   are developed explicitly to represent the characteristics of
   multi-domain entities and flows, while a mapping mechanism is realized
   to support inter-domain information sharing. Inter-feature relations are
   systematically managed so that the intricate engineering knowledge is
   incorporated into design tasks. The prototype software developed shows
   that design conflicts can be detected by the system intelligently: and
   the effectiveness towards engineering consistency management is
   promising. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   optimized fluence quantification}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{43-50}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The ultraviolet (UV) photolysis kinetics of eight sulfonamide (SA)
   antibiotics was investigated in a quasi-collimated beam apparatus. By
   using a micro fluorescent silica detector to monitor online the dynamic
   irradiance fluctuation, the accuracy in fluence quantification could be
   increased by up to 15\%. Solution pH governed the speciation of selected
   SAs, thus impacting significantly their molar absorption coefficients
   (epsilon), fluence-based photolysis rate constants (k'), and quantum
   yields. An increasing pH induced a hyperchromic effect and a blue shift
   of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of selected SAs, thus causing the
   anionic species to show a relatively higher specific epsilon value than
   the neutral species at 254 nm. On UV exposure, the photodegradation of
   selected SAs all followed pseudo-first order reaction kinetics. The SAs
   with a penta-heterocycle, because of their higher electron densities,
   exhibited an obviously higher photodegradation rate than those with a
   hexa-heterocycle. The specific k' values of the neutral and anionic
   species were in the ranges of (0.30-14.49) x 10(-3) and (0.61-20.90) x
   10(-3) cm(2) mJ(-1), respectively. With the specific k' values obtained,
   it is estimated that only part of SAs can be photodegraded during UV
   disinfection of water and wastewater, so an advanced oxidation process
   is necessary if a higher removal of selected SAs is to be achieved. (C)

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{430-439}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, harvesting energy from broadband or low-frequency
   vibrations via piezoelectric effect has been realized due to worldwide
   research efforts, however harvesting energy from sway and
   multidirectional vibrations still present some challenges. To address
   this interesting issue, this paper reports a design and experimental
   verification of a beam-roller piezoelectric energy harvester that can
   scavenge energy from both sway and bi-directional vibrations. The
   beam-roller harvester is composed of a piezoelectric cantilever beam, a
   roller, and a frame. The beam and the roller are sensitive to two
   orthogonal directions of vibrations. The roller is also designed to
   sense the sway of the frame that acts as the guide rail of the roller.
   The energy captured by the roller is transferred to the beam via
   magnetic coupling, and the latter conducts the piezoelectric conversion.
   The frequency up-conversion is also achieved through this configuration
   which converts the low-frequency sway and vibration to the
   higher-frequency vibration of the beam. A lumped parameter model is used
   to predict the voltage output of the beam and simulate the excitation
   exerted to the beam by the roller. Experimental studies are performed as
   well to validate the theoretical predictions and examine the effects of
   different sway parameters on the performance of the beam-roller
   harvester. The obtained results indicate that employing a roller to
   actuate the piezoelectric cantilever beam to function is a feasible way
   to harvest energy from both the sway and the bi-directional vibrations.

Abstract = {{Nanolayered composites based on Fe and Mg serve as insightful model
   systems for understanding a wide range of hydrogen storage materials. We
   examined the stability of the multilayered thin-film structure Si
   (substrate)/Ta/Mg/Fe/Ta/Pd after deuterium absorption and desorption and
   after annealing the specimen at 250 degrees C. We employed two
   complementary techniques for analysis: neutron reflectometry and
   analytical transmission electron microscopy. The neutron reflectometry
   provides evidence that interdiffusion is significant at 250 degrees C,
   but with the film general structure still in place. In contrast, after
   deuterium absorption and desorption at the same temperature, the changes
   of the film structure are more severe, such that the Mg/Fe/Ta/Pd layers
   appear to be fully intermixed, with only the bottom Ta layer remaining
   intact. Electron microscopy observations indicate that annealing at 250
   degrees C has caused a phase transformation to form Mg5Pd2 at the upper
   sections of the Mg layer, with the general periodicity of the sample
   still maintained, in accordance with the reflectometry measurements. In
   the desorbed state, the layers show substantial variations in local
   thicknesses, with thicker regions containing a range of Mg-Pd compounds
   and the thinner portions remaining primarily Mg. This degradation
   sequence occurs despite the Fe layer remaining chemically unchanged. We
   provide a mechanistic description regarding the observed evolution of
   the multilayered structure during annealing and deuterium cycling. (C)

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the real-time cell analyzer (RTCA) has provided a
   good tool to the cell-based in vitro assay. Unlike the traditional
   systems that label the target cells with luminescence, fluorescence, or
   light absorption, RTCA monitors cell properties using noninvasive and
   label-free impedance measuring. However, realization of the maximum
   value of RTCA for applications will require assurance of
   within-experiment repeatability, day-to-day repeatability, and
   robustness to variations in conditions that might occur from different
   experiments. In this article, the performance and variability of RTCA is
   evaluated and a novel repeatability index (RI) is proposed to analyze
   the intra-/inter-E-plate repeatability of RTCA. The repeatability assay
   involves six cell lines and two media (water {[}H2O] and dimethyl
   sulfoxide {[}DMSO]). First, six cell lines are exposed to the media
   individually, and time-dependent cellular response curves characterized
   as a cell index (CI) are recorded by RTCA. Then, the variations along
   sampling time and among repeated tests are calculated and RI values are
   obtained. Finally, a discriminating standard is set up to evaluate the
   degree of repeatability. As opposed to the standardized methodologies,
   it is shown that the presented index can give the quantitative
   evaluation for repeatability of RTCA within E-plate and variation on
   different days. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Exfoliated graphite (EG) exhibits exceptional sorption capacity for
   petroleum and dissolved hydrocarbons owing to its highly hydrophobic
   surface and wide pore size distribution. The high price of preparing EG,
   however, restricts its application. Methods which increase the rate or
   extent of sorption to EG even further are thus longed for. Here, we
   assess the effects of weak direct current (DC) fields on the sorption of
   the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene (PHE) to EG. DC applied
   to an ionic solution in a solid matrix invokes electroosmotic flow
   (EOF), i.e., the surface charge-induced movement of the solution. EG was
   exposed to weak DC fields in the presence of dissolved PHE to test if
   EOF increases transport of PHE to poorly accessible sorption sites. DC
   fields increased PHE sorption rates in EG sevenfold and reduced the
   desorption rate of sorbed PHE by >99\%. EOF thus appeared to be highly
   effective in translocating PHE into pores, which contribute most of the
   sorption sites, but are difficult to access in the absence of EOF by
   molecular diffusion only. The observed `power of power' may be used to
   kinetically regulate the interaction of sorbates with EG or other porous
   sorbents in environmental (bio-) technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multiple elastic inclusions with uniform internal stress fields in an
   infinite elastic matrix are constructed under given uniform remote
   in-plane loadings. The method is based on the sufficient and necessary
   condition imposed on the boundary value of a holomorphic function that
   guarantees the existence of the holomorphic function in a multiply
   connected region. The unknown shape of each of the multiple inclusions
   is characterized by a conformal mapping. This work focuses on a major
   large class of multiple inclusions characterized by a simple condition
   that covers and is much beyond the known related results reported in
   previous works. Extensive examples of multiple inclusions with or
   without geometrical symmetry are shown. Our results showed that the
   inclusion shapes obtained for the uniformity of internal stress fields
   are independent of the remote loading only when all of the multiple
   inclusions have the same shear modulus as that of the matrix. Moreover,
   specific conditions are derived on remote loading, elastic constants of
   the inclusions and uniform internal stress fields, which guarantee the
   existence of multiple symmetric inclusions or multiple rotationally
   symmetrical inclusions with uniform internal stress fields.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial biofilms can cause severe problems in technical installations
   where they may give rise to microbially influenced corrosion and
   clogging of filters and membranes or even threaten human health, e.g.
   when they infest water treatment processes. There is, hence, high
   interest in methods to prevent microbial adhesion as the initial step of
   bioffirn formation. In environmental technology it might be desired to
   enhance bacterial transport through porous matrices. This motivated us
   to test the hypothesis that the attractive interaction energy allowing
   cells to adhere can be counteracted and overcome by the shear force
   induced by electroosmotic flow (EOF, i.e. the water flow over surfaces
   exposed to a weak direct current (DC) electric field). Applying EOF of
   varying strengths we quantified the deposition of Pseudomonas
   fluorescens Lp6a in columns containing glass collectors and on a quartz
   crystal microbalance. We found that the presence of DC reduced the
   efficiency of initial adhesion and bacterial surface coverage by >85\%.
   A model is presented which quantitatively explains the reduction of
   bacterial adhesion based on the extended Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and
   Overbeek (XDLVO) theory of colloid stability and the EOF-induced shear
   forces acting on a bacterium. We propose that DC fields may be used to
   electrokinetically regulate the interaction of bacteria with surfaces in
   order to delay initial adhesion and biofilm formation in technical
   installations or to enhance bacterial transport in environmental
   matrices.}},

Abstract = {{Biological fixation of CO2 using microalgae is an environmentally
   sustainable option for CO2 capture. In this study, response surface
   methodology (RSM) was used to model the CO2 uptake rate and specific
   growth rate of Chlorella kessieri, which had been identified previously
   as a promising strain for CO2 fixation, cultivated in oil sands process
   water (OSPW). The quadratic models developed were used to determine the
   optimal sets of CO2 concentration, phosphate concentration and light
   intensity for CO2 uptake rate and specific growth rate in batch
   operation. The optimal CO2 concentration, phosphate concentration and
   light intensity of 35\%, 29 mM and 70 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)
   respectively, were estimated to maximize the CO2 uptake rate to 65.03
   mg/L/day. Also, the maximum specific growth rate of 0.310 per day was
   obtained at 22\% CO2 concentration, 29 mM phosphate concentration and 70
   mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Finally, a multi-objective optimization
   technique was used to maximize the CO2 uptake rate and specific growth
   intensity. Thus, each of the optimal conditions correspond to high
   phosphate concentration and high light intensity in the ranges
   investigated, while the CO2 concentration varied between high and
   intermediate levels in the range investigated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Direct perturbation of the Peng-Robinson attraction and covolume
   parameters for reservoir fluid characterization}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation of enhanced oil recovery processes, such as gas and
   steam floods, requires that the reservoir fluid of interest is reliably
   modeled by use of an equation of state (EOS). Reservoir fluid
   characterization using an EOS can be challenging because of the
   uncertainties associated with non identifiable heavy fractions, which
   are characterized as a few pseudo components.
   This paper presents a new method for reservoir fluid characterization
   that directly perturbs the attraction and covolume parameters of pseudo
   components from the n-alkanes' values (direct perturbation from
   n-alkanes, or direct PnA). The direct PnA method systematically adjusts
   the attraction and covolume parameters of all pseudo components within a
   given reservoir fluid through a few adjustable parameters. As in our
   prior research, the psi(=a/b(2)) parameter is used to ensure the proper
   interrelationship between the attraction (a) and covolume (b)
   parameters. A new approach to adjustment of the psi parameters is
   developed with a linear relationship of psi with molecular weight. The
   Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS is used throughout the research.
   The direct PnA method is applied to 84 different reservoir fluids, such
   as gas condensates, volatile oils, and heavy oils. Characterization of
   each fluid uses the saturation pressure and liquid density data at
   different pressures at the reservoir temperature. Other phase behavior
   data available are used to test the predictive capability of the fluid
   models developed using the PR EOS with the direct PnA method. Results
   show that the reservoir fluids tested are reliably characterized by the
   systematic control over phase behavior predictions in the direct PnA
   method. Unlike prior characterization methods, the direct PnA method
   does not require estimation of apparent critical parameters of
   non-identifiable heavy fractions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Predicting the remaining useful life plays an important role in
   minimizing the overall maintenance cost of mechanical systems. Although
   most conventional reliability models deal with binary systems to perform
   such predictions, in most practical cases, mechanical systems experience
   multiple levels of degradation states before failure. When the
   degradation level associated with such a multistate deteriorating
   process is monitored only at fixed inspection points, extracted
   monitoring data are interval-censored. Interval censoring can influence
   both the parameter estimation (model training) and the calculation of
   principal reliability measures. This article studies the problem of
   parameter estimation and the development of principal prognostic-based
   reliability measures, including reliability function and mean residual
   life, for a multistate device under limited inspection capacity. The
   correctness of the introduced models is demonstrated through
   simulation-based numerical experiments. Finally, an example of the wear
   process of the shell of a bearing is used to demonstrate the application
   of the proposed models.}},

   normal bending moments when inserted into a uniformly loaded laminated

   harmonic shape (hole or rigid inclusion) and two interacting harmonic
   shapes can be successfully designed to meet our requirements. In our
   discussion, the two interacting harmonic shapes include (i) two
   interacting harmonic holes, (ii) two interacting harmonic rigid

Journal = {{MOLECULAR THERAPY-NUCLEIC ACIDS}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Leukemias arise from genetic alterations in normal hematopoietic stem or
   progenitor cells, leading to impaired regulation of proliferation,
   differentiation, apoptosis, and survival of the transformed cells. With
   the advent of RNA interference (RNAi) and the short interfering RNA
   (siRNA) as its pharmacological mediator, it is becoming possible to
   modulate specific targets at will. This article summarizes current
   attempts to utilize RNAi reagents for therapy of leukemias, focusing on
   acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. We first present unique aspects of
   RNAi-mediated therapy, followed by a brief background on the delivery
   technology of RNAi reagents. The need for leukemia-specific delivery of
   siRNA is discussed by describing approaches that targeted agents to
   leukemic cells. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of RNAi agents are
   then presented, highlighting the critical issues pertinent to emerging
   siRNA therapy. Efforts to deliver specific RNAi therapies are then
   summarized in the context of expected clinical outcomes, focusing on
   limiting leukemic cell survival, sensitizing malignant cells to
   chemotherapy, mobilization of leukemic cells, and eradication of
   leukemic stem cells. We conclude with a perspective on the future of
   RNAi therapy, emphasizing the technological requirements and mechanistic
   challenges for clinical entry.}},

Title = {{Low-Temperature Air/Solvent Injection for Heavy-Oil Recovery in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{148-163}},

Abstract = {{Limited studies on oil recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs
   using low-temperature air injection show that the process is strongly
   dependent on oxygen (O-2)-diffusion coefficient and matrix permeability,
   both of which are typically low. A new approach (i.e., the addition of
   hydrocarbon solvent gases into air) is expected to improve the
   diffusivity of the gas mixture and to accelerate the oxidation. To study
   this new idea, called low-temperature air/solvent injection, laboratory
   tests were performed by soaking heavy-oil-saturated cores in air/solvent
   filled reactors to determine the critical parameters on recovery.
   Laboratory tests were complemented by conducting experiments using air
   at different O-2 concentrations: zero (i.e., nitrogen), 21.0 mol\%
   (air), and 37.3 mol\% (O-2-enriched air).
   For safety reasons, it is imperative that enough time be given for air
   diffusion before the injected air breaks through a highly permeable
   fracture network. This implies that the huff `n' puff type of injection
   is a plausible option as opposed to the continuous injection of air. A
   high recovery factor was obtained by soaking a single matrix in an
   air/solvent chamber at static conditions rather than with air only. The
   period of pressure stabilization was faster for the air/solvent mixture
   than in 100\% solvent. The asphaltene content was lower in the
   air/solvent case than in the 100\%-air-injection case. Instead of
   pure-hydrocarbon solvent, injection of an air/solvent mixture yields a
   better recovery with less asphaltene. This is expected to reduce the
   cost of the process compared with pure-solvent injection. At low
   temperatures (75 degrees C), O-2 consumption in the matrix oil was low,
   while at high temperatures, the O-2 was partially (150 degrees C) or
   totally (200 degrees C in the presence of propane) diffused and consumed
   in the matrix.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the applications of the ensemble-Kalman-filter
   (EnKF) inverse-modelling technique to petroleum-reservoir
   characterization of thermally operated oil fields in northern Alberta,
   Canada. The EnKF is applied to 2D- and 3D-case studies based on the
   steam-assisted-gravity-drainage heavy-oil-extraction method. The
   modelling technique integrates effectively both static and dynamic data
   (petrophysical core data from wellbores, continuous temperature data
   measured by thermocouples, and 4D-seismic attributes) into a
   petroleum-reservoir model. Assimilated secondary information provides
   better insight into geologic properties of a reservoir and improves
   production forecasting. The method performs well for linear or slightly
   nonlinear systems that follow a Gaussian distribution, but shows worse
   performance for nonlinear or non-Gaussian systems. Integration of a
   large amount of data with a small number of realizations leads to
   ensemble collapse because of insufficient degrees of freedom. Increasing
   the ensemble size is a solution, but by increasing forecasting time. To
   overcome these issues and reduce computational time, matrix localization
   techniques and a shortcut based on replacement of the model realizations
   with their mean in forecasting are suggested. Even though the EnKF has
   been proved to be simple in implementation and effective for modelling
   of continuous linear systems, special care should be taken for modelling
   nonlinear systems, including categorical variables (e.g., geologic
   facies).}},

Title = {{Efficient Fault-Tolerant Topology Reconfiguration Using a Maximum Flow
   Algorithm}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{With an increasing number of processing elements (PEs) integrated on a
   single chip, fault-tolerant techniques are critical to ensure the
   reliability of such complex systems. In current reconfigurable
   architectures, redundant PEs are utilized for fault tolerance. In the
   presence of faulty PEs, the physical topologies of various chips may be
   different, so the concept of virtual topology from network embedding
   problem has been used to alleviate the burden for the operating systems.
   With limited hardware resources, how to reconfigure a system into the
   most effective virtual topology such that the maximum repair rate can be
   reached presents a significant challenge. In this article, a new
   approach using a maximum flow (MF) algorithm is proposed for an
   efficient topology reconfiguration in reconfigurable architectures. In
   this approach, topology reconfiguration is converted into a network flow
   problem by constructing a directed graph; the solution is then found by
   using the MF algorithm. This approach optimizes the use of spare PEs
   with minimal impacts on area, throughput, and delay, and thus it
   significantly improves the repair rate of faulty PEs. In addition, it
   achieves a polynomial reconfiguration time. Experimental results show
   that compared to previous methods, the MF approach increases the
   probability to repair faulty PEs by up to 50\% using the same redundant
   resources. Compared to a fault-free system, the throughput only
   decreases by less than 2.5\% and latency increases by less than 4\%. To
   consider various types of PEs in a practical application, a cost factor
   is introduced into the MF algorithm. An enhanced approach using a
   minimum-cost MF algorithm is further shown to be efficient in the
   fault-tolerant reconfiguration of heterogeneous reconfigurable
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the realization of on-chip
   inductors for use in microwave and millimeter-wave devices using
   ultraminiaturized on-chip vertical nanohelices. The inductors are
   constructed by depositing a thin film of closely packed, vertically
   aligned Nickel nanohelices. The film is fabricated using a
   CMOS-compatible glancing angle physical vapor deposition method. The
   resulting nanostructured inductors are characterized from 10 to 70 GHz
   and are found to have inductances of 6 pH/mu m(2), 60 times larger than
   conventional on-chip planar spiral inductors. A quality factor of three
   is measured and the results indicate that it continues to improve above
   70 GHz, while inductance values remain relatively constant. The proposed
   nanostructured inductors can significantly reduce the chip area, and
   consequently the cost, of radio frequency and millimeter-wave integrated
   circuits. In addition, the nanostructured inductors offer significantly
   larger operation bandwidth than on-chip planar structures operating at
   frequencies above 100 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Zirconium nitride (ZrN) has the lowest bulk electrical resistivity and
   high thermal stability among group IV and V transition metal nitrides,
   which makes it a promising material for ULSI applications such as a
   diffusion barrier for Cu interconnects, contact metal in III-V
   semiconductor devices, and in high density memory structures. Plasma
   enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) of conducting ZrN thin films
   using Zr{[}N(CH3)(2)](4) and forming gas (5\% H-2 + 95\% N-2) plasma is
   reported in this article. The growth per cycle (GPC) for every
   deposition was determined from analysis of dynamic in-situ spectroscopic
   ellipsometry (d-iSE) measurements. An experimental design is proposed
   for faster determination of ALD growth saturation curves. At substrate
   temperature of 150 degrees C, a GPC of 0.10 nm/cycle was observed for
   self-limiting ZrN PEALD growth. The electrical resistivity of ZrN films
   deposited on SiO2 substrate was found to be 559.5 +/- 18.5 mu Omega cm
   with negligible change in resistivity even after similar to 1000 h
   exposure to air. The metallic behavior of our ZrN films was evident from
   the free electron dispersion component in dielectric response, the broad
   band of photoelectron emission across Fermi level and the positive
   temperature coefficient for resistivity of 0.0088/degrees C. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Petroleum asphaltenes are a complex mixture of organic molecules
   containing mainly fused polyaromatic and naphthenic systems and pendant
   chains, polar moieties with heteroatoms (S, N, and O), and transition
   metals. A variety of spectroscopic techniques has been employed to
   characterize asphaltenes, but their structures remain largely elusive
   because of the complexity, variety of samples, and assignment
   limitations. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR)
   spectroscopy has contributed extensively to asphaltene characterization.
   However, proper assignment of C-13 NMR spectra is very challenging
   because spectra of natural asphaltenes feature a large number of peaks
   in unusual environments, which may be hard to assign and interpret. We
   employ the dispersion-corrected omega B97X-D density functional with
   6-31G(d,p). basis set to rationalize common trends in the C-13 NMR
   chemical shifts of asphaltene model compounds. The calculated C-13 NMR
   chemical shifts for a calibration series of 14 aromatic and heterocyclic
   reference compounds containing C atoms of types similar to those in the
   asphaltene model compounds are found to correlate linearly with the
   respective experimental values. The linear fitting yields a correlation
   coefficient of R-2 = 0.99 and absolute errors of less than 10 ppm.
   Moreover, we calculate and calibrate the C-13 chemical shifts of
   asphaltenes extracted from Brazilian vacuum residues to analyze and
   correlate the C atom types with those of the reference compounds. It is
   found that the presence of heteroatoms as well as environments with a
   high aromatic condensation index can significantly affect the chemical
   shifts. The effect of heteroatoms on the chemical shift, a situation
   that has scarcely been addressed in the literature, is evaluated here in
   detail. The results are intended to help interpret C-13 NMR spectra and
   allow for a more complete characterization of asphaltene molecules.}},

Abstract = {{The geometry of phenanthridine, benzothiophene, tetralin, and
   naphthalene representative of the heterocyclic, naphthenic, and aromatic
   components of bitumen adsorbed on kaolinite is optimized using density
   functional theory and periodic boundary conditions in gas phase. These
   bitumen model compounds preferentially adsorb on the aluminum hydroxide
   surface of kaolinite with energy decreasing in the order phenanthridine
   > naphthalene > tetralin similar to benzothiophene. The adsorption of
   phenanthridine is strengthened by hydrogen bonding between the pyridinic
   N atom and an axial hydroxyl group of kaolinite, while the rest of the
   molecules adsorb through van der Waals interactions. The mechanism of
   solvation in CO2 and the effect of liquid and supercritical CO2 on the
   adsorption thermodynamics are studied using the three-dimensional
   reference interaction site model theory with the closure approximation
   of Kovalenko and Hirata (3D-RISM-KH) molecular theory of solvation at
   293-333 K and 10-30 MPa. The CO2 solvent interacts with the aluminum
   hydroxide surface of kaolinite by hydrogen bonding, with the pyridinic N
   atom of phenanthridine by electrostatic interactions, and with the rest
   of the bitumen model compounds by hydrophobic interactions, as inferred
   from the 3D site density distribution functions of CO2. The
   molecule-kaolinite potentials of mean force in CO2 show that the
   adsorption of naphthalene and tetralin on kaolinite is substantially
   weakened as the pressure is increased and the temperature is decreased.
   Benzothiophene adsorption is the least sensitive to CO2 temperature and
   pressure changes. In liquid CO2 at 30 MPa and 293 K, the hydrocarbon
   molecules are weakly adsorbed and can be desorbed by CO2, while the
   heterocycles would remain adsorbed, suggesting an approach for
   extraction of deasphalted bitumen from oil sands. While the most
   favorable thermodynamic conditions for desorption are in liquid CO2, the
   kinetic barrier for desorption is the most sensitive to small changes in
   the temperature and pressure in supercritical CO2, indicating that
   supercritical conditions are important for desorption rate control.
   These results suggest that the investigated bitumen components can be
   selectively desorbed from kaolinite by controlling the temperature and
   pressure of the CO2 solvent and agree with experimental reports on heavy
   oil recovery. These insights are valuable for the development of
   improved techniques for extraction of bitumen from oil sands and
   deasphalting of bitumen using liquid and supercritical CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Water withdrawal for electricity generation in the United States
   accounts for approximately half the total freshwater withdrawal. With
   steadily growing electricity demands, a changing climate, and limited
   water supplies in many water-scarce states, meeting future energy and
   water demands poses a significant socioeconomic challenge. Employing an
   integrated modeling approach that captures the energy-water interactions
   at regional and national scales can improve our understanding of the key
   drivers that govern those interactions and the role of national
   policies. In this study, the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a
   technologically-detailed integrated model of the economy, energy,
   agriculture and land use, water, and climate systems, was extended to
   model the electricity and water systems at the state level in the US.
   (GCAM-USA). GCAM-USA was employed to estimate future state-level
   electricity generation and consumption, and their associated water
   withdrawals and consumption under a set of seven scenarios with
   extensive detail on the generation fuel portfolio, cooling technology
   mix, and their associated water use intensities. These seven scenarios
   were explored to investigate the implications of socioeconomic
   development and growing electricity demands, cooling system transitions,
   adoption of water-saving technologies, climate mitigation policy and
   electricity trading options on future water demands of the U.S.
   electric-sector. Our findings include: 1) decreasing water withdrawals
   and increasing water consumption from the conversion from open-loop to
   closed-loop cooling systems; 2) different energy-sector water demand
   behaviors with alternative pathways to the mitigation goal; 3) open
   trading of electricity benefiting energy-scarce yet demand-intensive
   states; 4) across-state homogeneity under certain driving forces (e.g.,
   climate mitigation and water-saving technologies) and mixed effects
   under other drivers (e.g. electricity trade); and 5) a clear trade-off
   between water consumption and withdrawal for the electricity sector in
   the U.S. The paper discusses this withdrawal-consumption trade-off in
   the context of current national policies and regulations that favor
   decreasing withdrawals (and increasing consumptive use), and the role of
   water-saving technologies. The study also clearly shows that climate
   mitigation strategies focusing on CCS and nuclear power will have less
   favorable water consumption effects than strategies that support
   renewable energy and water-saving technologies. The highly-resolved
   nature of this study, both geographically and technologically, provides
   a useful platform to address scientific and policy-relevant and emerging
   issues at the heart of the water-energy nexus in the U.S. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Poly(glycerol sebatate) (PGS) and its derivatives make up an attractive
   class of biomaterial, owing to their tunable,mechanical properties With
   programmable biodegradability. In practice, however, the application of
   PGS is often hampered by frequent inconsistency in reproducing process
   conditions. The inconsistency stems from the volatile nature of glycerol
   during the esterification process. In this study, we suggest that the
   degree of esterification (DE). can be used to predict precisely the
   physical status, the mechanical properties, and the degradation of the
   PGS materials. Young's modulus is shown to linearly increase with DE,
   which is in agreement with an entropic spring theory of rubbers. To
   provide a processing guideline for researchers, we also provide a
   physical status map as a function of curing temperature and time. The
   amount of glycerol loss, obtainable by monitoring the evolution of the
   total mass loss and the DE during synthesis, is shown to make the
   predictions even more precise. We expect that these strategies cart be
   applicable to different categories of polymers that involve condensation
   polymerization with the volatility of the reactants. In addition, we
   demonstrate that microwave-assisted prepolymerization is a time- and
   energy-efficient pathway to obtain PGS. For example, 15 min of microwave
   time is shown to be as efficient as prepolymerization in nitrogen
   atmosphere for 6 h at 130 degrees C. The quick synthesis method,
   however, causes a severe evaporation of glycerol, resulting in a large
   distortion in the monomer ratio between glycerol and sebacic acid.
   Consequently, more rigid PGS is produced under a similar curing
   condition compared to the conventional prepolymerizatton method.
   Finally, we demonstrate that the addition of molecularly rigid
   cross-linking agents and network-Structured inorganic nanoparticles are
   also effective in enhancing the mechanical properties of the PGS-derived
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The log-log plots of normalized rate versus material balance time of two
   fractured horizontal wells completed in the Cardium and Bakken
   formations show three distinct regions of quarter, half and unit slopes.
   The first two regions can be interpreted by the existing semi-analytical
   models for bi-linear and linear transient flow. This study develops a
   pseudo-steady state (PSS) model for linear dual porosity reservoirs that
   describes the third region (unit slope). The application of this PSS
   model on field production data from two tight oil wells yields
   reasonable estimates of hydraulic fracture half-length and average
   matrix permeability. Also, this paper demonstrates how the proposed PSS
   analysis complements the transient linear analysis commonly used in

Abstract = {{In this article, we develop a linear theory of elastic boundary
   reinforcement of a couple stress elastic solid subjected to anti-plane
   deformations. The reinforcement is represented by a thin couple stress
   elastic coating perfectly bonded to the boundary of the solid. The
   elastic properties of the coating are taken to be separate from those of
   the surrounding bulk material. In this context, the model developed here
   can also be viewed as a more comprehensive representation of the
   deformation of a couple stress material in which the separate role of
   surface mechanics is incorporated into the model of deformation. As an
   example of our theory, we consider the classical problem of a
   semi-infinite crack in a couple stress material and examine the
   contribution of the reinforcement to the stress distributions in the
   vicinity of the crack tip. Our results indicate that the presence of the
   reinforcing layer on the crack faces eliminates the well-known stress
   singularity at the crack tip demonstrating the influence of surface and
   couple stress effects in the model of deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Auditory warning of speeding behaviour is considered to be one of the
   most effective methods developed to reduce the accidents involving
   commercial passenger vehicles. Facing a complex, mixed traffic condition
   and a lot of risky driving behaviours in China, commercial passenger
   vehicles need an effective speeding warning system to reduce the high
   accident rate. Although many automobile manufacturers have installed the
   speeding warning systems on their vehicles, the styles of these auditory
   speeding warning systems are different, and few studies has been found
   to investigate the effectiveness of the auditory speeding warning
   systems for commercial passenger vehicles. Therefore this study is
   intent to fill such a gap to evaluate the effectiveness of three
   different sound-based speeding warning styles. In this study, thirty
   drivers qualified for driving the commercial passenger vehicles are
   recruited and then asked to drive for four 80-km field trips on an
   expressway in Wuhan, China. Driving behaviour is logged by a monitoring
   system and is monitored by two observers during these trips. Study
   results showed that `beep warning' is most effective and `break-sound
   warning' is the least. Basically, the results of this study could
   provide a good reference for development of future voice-based speed
   warning systems in China.}},

Abstract = {{Building information modeling (BIM) has been recognized as an
   information technology with the potential to markedly change the
   Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, and has
   drawn attention from numerous scholars within the construction domain.
   Despite the reported advancements pertaining to BIM in previous studies,
   the extended use of BIM has not yet reached its full potential. This
   paper thus presents a BIM-based integrated scheduling approach which
   facilitates the automatic generation of optimized activity-level
   construction schedules for building projects under resource constraints,
   by achieving an in-depth integration of BIM product models with work
   package information, process simulations, and optimization algorithms. A
   developed prototype system for panelized building construction as an
   add-on tool for Autodesk Revit is described. A case study is
   subsequently presented to demonstrate the methodology. Building on the
   existing body of research in this field, the key contribution of the
   proposed research is the in-depth integration of BIM product model with
   work package information, process simulations, and an optimization
   model, which provides solutions addressing the challenges of the
   existing practice with respect to detailed construction scheduling under

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the current gold standard to
   screen for heart transplant rejection but has important risks and
   limitations. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is
   increasingly used to characterize cardiac function and myocardial
   tissue. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CMRI compared with EMB
   and clinically diagnosed heart transplant rejection.
   METHODS: Comprehensive CMRI scans were performed on adult heart
   transplant recipients within 24 hours of EMB (routine or clinically
   indicated), before initiation of any anti-rejection therapy, and blinded
   to EMB results. Multivariable analysis was used to create CMRI
   diagnostic criteria for comparison with a positive EMB (Grade >= 2R or
   antibody-mediated rejection) and clinical rejection (change in medical
   therapy to treat rejection).
   RESULTS: Sixty participants (75\% male; mean age, 51 +/- 14 years) were
   recruited, providing 73 comparisons between CMRI and EMB for the
   diagnosis of rejection. Multivariable logistic regression identified
   myocardial edema (T2 relaxation time) and right ventricular
   end-diastolic volume index as independent predictors of a positive EMB.
   Combining threshold right ventricular end-diastolic volume index and
   edema values predicted a positive EMB with very good accuracy:
   sensitivity, 93\%; specificity, 78\%; positive predictive value, 52\%;
   and negative predictive valve, 98\%. CMRI was more sensitive than EMB at
   predicting clinical rejection (sensitivity of 67\% vs 58\%).
   CONCLUSIONS: CMRI has high sensitivity and high negative predictive
   value in predicting biopsy-positive heart transplant rejection and may
   be useful as a screening test before routine EMB. CMRI also has better
   sensitivity for clinically diagnosed heart transplant rejection and
   could be helpful in cases of negative rejection on the biopsy specimen.

Title = {{Weekly Streamflow Forecasting Using a Statistical Disaggregation Model
   for the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Accurately forecasting the weekly seasonal streamflow of the Upper Blue
   Nile basin (UBNB) in Ethiopia is essential for managing large-scale
   water projects of Nile basinwide countries. A wavelet-based, artificial
   neural network calibrated by genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) model and a
   statistical disaggregation algorithm were integrated to forecast weekly
   streamflow of the UBNB. The July to October (JASO) streamflow of the El
   Diem station of UBNB shows strong interannual oscillations prior to the
   1920s and after 1990s. Two ANN-GA models were developed to forecast the
   UBNB JASO streamflow, the first one using the February to May (FMAM)
   seasonal sea surface temperature (SST) of the global oceans as
   predictors to directly forecast JASO streamflow, while the second, a
   hybrid model, is developed to forecast JASO streamflow from two sets of
   predictors, which consist of FMAM SST and the July to September (JJAS)
   seasonal rainfall previously forecasted by the wavelet-based, ANN-GA
   also driven by FMAM SST as predictors. The forecasted JASO streamflow
   were then disaggregated to weekly total streamflow using the
   disaggregation model, Valencia and Schaake (VS). Results indicate that
   seasonal forecasts with up to 4months lead time only based on SST as
   predictors achieved reasonable skill (r2=0.5), while the hybrid model
   achieved a better performance (r2=0.8). The disaggregated streamflow
   from the first model explained 69\% of the streamflow variance, compared
   to 71\% when the hybrid model was used. Based on the results, the
   proposed hybrid model that uses both SST and a forecasted JJAS seasonal
   rainfall as predictors achieves a marginally better forecasting skill of
   the UBNB weekly streamflow. This proposed method that directly forecasts
   the streamflow, rather than forcing a hydrological model with rainfall
   forecasts is useful for the management of river basins that lack
   observed hydrologic data.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Solid particles can be transported along a pipeline in the form of
   trains of individually shaped lenticular deposits (LDs) when the
   concentration of solids is less than 1 vol\% and the transport velocity
   is below the critical value required for full suspension. Such special
   bed transport, observed as rippled sand dune patterns, may occur in
   petroleum production lines transporting oil and gas produced from
   unconsolidated sand reservoirs under turbulent flow conditions, and
   during sediment transport by rivers and winds. The primary objective of
   this study was to investigate how the occurrence of lenticular bed
   deposits affects near-wall turbulent activities at the sand/fluid
   (wave-like) interface and frictional pressure drop during pipeline
   transportation of solids. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements
   were used to quantify the velocity field, the turbulence kinetic energy
   (TKE), and the coherent structures associated with surface morphology
   change and LD formation near the bed deposits/fluid interface. A 7-8\%
   reduction in frictional pressure drop was consistently observed during
   the transition from continuous sand bed to LDs. Results also indicate
   that the formation of naturally shaped LDs reduces the intensity and
   frequency of near-wall turbulent coherent structures (burst-sweep
   events). Moreover, TKE associated with flow over the LDs was found to be
   lower than that of continuous bed and water (only) flow. (C) 2014

   racetrack resonator detection cavities. The two cavities slightly
   overlap, which also enables the mechanical frequency of both beams to be
   detected simultaneously with a single wavelength. Finally, to physically
   map which wavelength channel corresponds to which specific device, a
   heating laser is targeted individually on each beam to create a
   reversible mechanical frequency shift. This multiplexing method would
   allow for the simpler detection of large arrays of nanomechanical

Abstract = {{In spite of the impressive diversity of models of time series, there is
   still an acute need to develop constructs that are both accurate and

   into some meaningful, semantically sound entities. With this regard, the
   design of time series forecasting models used the information
   granulation is interpretable and easily comprehended by humans. In order
   to cluster information granules, a modified fuzzy c-means which does not
   require that data have the same dimensionality is proposed. Then, we
   develop forecasting model combining the modified fuzzy c-means and
   information granulation for solving the problem of time series long-term
   prediction. Synthetic time series, chaotic Mackey-Glass time series,
   power demand, daily temperatures, stock index, and wind speed are used

   OSPW pretreated with a higher ozone concentration removed a higher COD
   concentration and acid extractable fraction (AEF), organics removal

Abstract = {{Particle effective density is an important physical property of vehicle
   exhaust, and is required for estimating particulate matter (PM) mass
   emissions using the Integrated Particle Size Distribution (IPSD) method.
   In this study, we measure particle effective density of five light-duty
   vehicles with PM emissions below the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) III PM
   standards of 1 or 3 mg/mi (0.62 and 1.86 mg/km) using the Differential
   Mobility Analyzer (DMA) - Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyzer (CPMA)
   approach. Test vehicles included two gasoline direct injection (GDI)
   vehicles without particulate filters, and for the first time reported in
   the literature, two port-fuel injected (PFI) vehicles and a turbocharged
   direct injection (TDI) light-duty diesel vehicle with a diesel
   particulate filter (DPF). The particle effective density functions
   generally resemble previous work on GDI and diesel engines without
   particulate filters but, for many size ranges, the PR and TDI vehicles
   produced emissions with higher particle effective densities than GDI
   vehicles. Good linear correlation was found between the gravimetric and
   IPSD methods when applying the new particle effective density functions
   to size distribution measured by the TSI Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer
   (EEPS, 5.6-560 nm, R-2=0.84); however, the IPSD method underestimated
   gravimetric mass by 64\%. When using a TSI Aerodynamic Particle Sizer
   (APS, 0.54-2.5 mu m) to measure the contribution of larger particles,
   underestimation bias was virtually eliminated and the correlation
   improved dramatically (R-2=0.96). Even stronger correlation between IPSO
   and gravimetric methods was achieved when using a Scanning Mobility
   Particle Sizer (SMPS, 8.7-365 nm) and the APS (R-2=0.97). A procedure
   for correcting EEPS measurements using the SMPS is presented and
   evaluated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In natural-fiber-reinforced polymer, absorption of water or moisture is
   a significant issue in maintaining strength and stiffness. To enhance
   the understanding of water and moisture sorption behavior, the kinetics
   of moisture sorption in natural-fiber-reinforced polymers are
   investigated under immersion conditions. Samples of
   hemp-bast-fiber-reinforced polyethylene are prepared using an injection
   molding technique at different hemp fiber volume fractions (v(f)). The
   samples are then immersed in water for 274 days. Moisture content and
   uptake rate are analyzed at different fiber volume factions and matrix
   crystallinity percentages. A simplified two-dimensional contraction
   model is developed to investigate the contraction effect on the moisture
   uptake; it shows that a matrix with high crystallinity has more
   stiffness contraction on the reinforcing natural fibers, which limits
   the maximum amount of the absorbed moisture. The Fickian diffusion is
   found to be the dominant mechanism, shifting toward pseudo-Fickian or
   anomalous diffusion depending on the natural fiber volume fraction and
   the crystallinity percentages of the matrix. The
   natural-fiber-reinforced polymers diffusivity is evaluated and modeled
   to characterize the ability of liquid molecules to diffuse into these
   composites at different hemp fiber volume fractions. Both the
   crystallinity percentage of the matrix material and the volume fraction
   of the reinforcing fibers were found to interactively affect the
   sorption kinetics of the tested natural-fiber-reinforced polymers.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{10-15}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A pair of gyradius ratios, defined from the principal radii of gyration,
   are used to generate a dimension map that describes the geometry of
   molecular aggregates in water and in organic solvents. Molecular
   dynamics simulations were performed on the aggregation of representative
   biomolecules and polyaromatic compounds to demonstrate application of
   the dimension map. It was shown that molecular aggregate data on the
   dimension map were bounded by two boundary curves, and that the map
   could be separated into three regions representing three groups of
   structures: one-dimensional rod-like structures; two-dimensional planar
   structures or short-cylinder-like structures; and three-dimensional
   sphere-like structures. Examining the location of the aggregates on the
   dimension map and how the location changes with solvent type and solute
   material parameter provides a simple yet effective way to infer the
   aggregation manner and to study solubility and mechanism of aggregation.

Abstract = {{The oil sands industry is seeking innovative technologies to address the
   water intensity and the high-energy consumption associated with current
   oil sands processing technologies. This research therefore investigates
   the use of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) as an alternative to the
   current water-based extraction technology, Bitumen, a complex mixture of
   hydrocarbons, was extracted from an Athabasca oil sand slurry using
   supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2). Preliminary experiments revealed
   the importance of a higher mixing speed and a longer static time on
   hydrocarbon yields. In a second set of experiments, when toluene was
   introduced as a modifier, a higher SC-CO2 density (i.e. high pressure,
   low temperature) led to higher extraction yields. In the absence of
   toluene, higher temperature conditions (i.e. lower SC-CO2 density)
   provided higher extraction yields suggesting desorption resistant
   hydrocarbon components in the oil sand matrix slurry are released as a
   result of increasing temperature. Using gas chromatography-flame
   ionization detector (GC-FID), the experiment that produced the highest
   cumulative hydrocarbon extraction yield was analyzed for product quality
   and the extracted hydrocarbons were observed to center on C-25. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Electron work function (EWF) is a simple and fundamental parameter which
   largely reflects or characterizes the behavior of electrons in metals.
   This parameter can be used to guide the selection of solutes for
   effective modification of mechanical properties of Mg, an important
   metal for lightweight materials. From our prediction, adding solutes
   with EWFs lower than that of Mg can improve both strength and ductility
   of Mg, while adding elements with higher EWFs results in higher strength
   but lowered ductility. This study reveals the electronic origin of such
   influences of solutes on the strength and ductility of Mg and suggests
   an EWF-based principle or law for selecting appropriate solutes to
   achieve the optimal combination of strength and ductility for advanced

Abstract = {{The impulse atomization process developed at the University of Alberta
   (Canada) enables metallic powders to be solidified with well controlled
   process parameters. The inner microstructure of several droplets of
   Al-4.5 wt.\%Cu alloy produced by this technique has been investigated by
   using both synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography and electron backscattered
   diffraction (EBSD). The 3D reconstructions obtained by micro-tomography
   are used to visualize cross sections of the droplets in any spatial
   directions. A wide range of dendrite morphologies are observed for
   different droplets of similar diameter and produced in the same batch.
   Microstructural features indicate that the development of the dendrite
   arms (primary and of higher orders) occurs in most droplets along < 1 1
   1 > crystallographic axes. This was unexpected as < 1 0 0 > directions
   are observed in conventional casting technologies. EBSD measurements
   were carried out on a selection of representative droplets after their
   characterization by synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography. Results confirm
   that most of the droplets are single grains and the relationship between
   the dendrite growth directions and the crystal orientation is determined
   unambiguously. Moreover, the large number of droplets analyzed by
   micro-tomography enabled a statistical analysis of the dendrite
   morphology as a function of droplet size and cooling atmosphere. The
   impact of different processing parameters on the final distribution of
   dendrite morphologies is also discussed. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc.

   free, rigidly clamped and simply supported edges. We derive solutions of
   simple form by using the new Stroh octet formalism for the coupled
   stretching and bending deformations of anisotropic thin plates and the
   method of analytic continuation. In particular, real solutions of the
   far-field elastic fields induced by an inclusion of arbitrary shape are
   obtained. Specific examples of an elliptical inclusion in an infinite,

Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Efficient dewatering of oil sands tailings is imperative to reduce the
   environmental footprint of oil sands operators. Currently there is no
   mature technology capable of effectively treating oil sands tailings and
   completely eliminating the use of tailings ponds. Consolidated tailings
   and paste technology are the most extensively used dewatering methods.
   However, the high concentrations of divalent ions in the water recovered
   using the consolidated tailings process impedes the re-utilization of
   this water in the bitumen extraction process. Accumulation of ions does
   not occur in the case of paste technology; however, this technology,
   similarly to the consolidated tailings process, recovers only part of
   the water from tailings and produces high-water content sediments
   (25-30wt. \% solids) that sill requires special storage. This happens
   because the sediments produced by polyacrylamide (PAM) flocculants are
   not closely packed and require the application of other consolidation
   technologies (e.g., freeze-thaw, filtration, centrifugation) to obtain
   dry and self-supportive tailings. This review focuses on examining
   alternative flocculants that could potentially replace PAM polymers in
   mature and new dewatering technologies. Flocculants are a key element of
   many tailing treatments including paste technology and filtration. The
   ideal flocculant would increase the ability of these technologies to
   dewater tailings, resulting in higher water recovery and sediment
   consolidation without affecting water chemistry or increasing
   operational costs. This review presents a comparison between PAM
   flocculants and two promising alternative flocculants: inorganic-organic
   hybrid and temperature-sensitive polymers. Each flocculant type is
   evaluated in terms of its flocculation mechanisms and its dewatering
   efficacy.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{115-129}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Under the effect of climate change, warming likely means that there will
   be more water vapour in the atmosphere and extreme storms are expected
   to occur more frequently and with greater severity, resulting in
   municipal Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves with higher
   intensities and shorter return periods. A regional climate model, MM5
   (the Pennsylvania State University / National Center for Atmospheric
   Research numerical model), was set up in a one-way, three-domain nested
   framework to simulate future summer (May to August) precipitation of
   central Alberta. MM5 is forced with climate data of four Global Climate
   Models, CGCM3, ECHAM5, CCSM3, and MIROC3.2, for the baseline 1971-2000
   and 2011-2100 based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A2,
   A1B, and B1 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Due to the
   bias of MM5's simulations, a quantile-quantile bias correction method
   and a regional frequency analysis is applied to derive projected
   grid-based IDF curves for central Alberta. In addition, future trends of
   air temperature and precipitable water, which affect storm pattern and
   intensity, are investigated. Future IDF curves show a wide range of
   increased intensities especially for storms of short durations (a parts
   per thousand currency sign1-h). Conversely, future IDF curves are
   expected to shift upward because of increased air temperature and
   precipitable water which are projected to be about 2.9 A degrees C and
   29 \% in average by 2071-2100, respectively. Our results imply that the
   impact of climate change could increase the future risk of flooding in
   central Alberta.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a procedure for prepitting of X-52 pipeline steel in the

   to the solution to induce pitting, and the optimum concentration of

   procedure briefly included prepassivation of the steel in the solution
   with optimum concentration of chloride ions and then increasing the
   potential above the pitting potential to generate pits. The potential
   was then stepped back well below the pitting potential to grow the pits
   to the desirable depth. This procedure can be used to generate pits on
   tensile specimens, which can be subsequently employed in near neutral pH
   stress corrosion crack initiation studies. This can result in shorter

Abstract = {{Motivated by challenges in state estimation with event-based measurement
   updates, the properties of the exact and approximate set-valued Kalman
   filters with multiple sensor measurements for linear time-invariant
   systems are investigated in this work. First, we show that the exact and
   the proposed approximate set-valued filters are independent of the
   fusion sequence at each time instant. Second, the boundedness of the
   size of the set of estimation means is proved for the exact set-valued
   filter. For the approximate set-valued filter, if the closed-loop matrix
   is contractive, then the set of estimation means has a bounded size
   asymptotically; otherwise a nonsingular linear transform is constructed
   such that the size of the set of estimation means for the transformed
   states is asymptotically bounded. Third, the effect of set-valued
   measurements on the size of the set of estimation means is analyzed and
   conditions for performance improvement in terms of smaller size of the
   set of estimation means are proposed. Finally, the results are applied
   to event-based estimation, which allow the event-triggering conditions
   to be designed by considering requirements on performance and
   communication rates. The efficiency of the proposed results are
   illustrated by simulation examples and comparison with the approximate
   event-based MMSE estimator and the Kalman filter with intermittent
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of causality is an important and challenging problem in root
   cause and hazard propagation analysis. It has been shown that the
   transfer entropy approach is a very useful tool in quantifying
   directional causal influence for both linear and nonlinear
   relationships. A key assumption for this method is that the sampled data
   should follow a well-defined probability distribution; yet this
   assumption may not hold for some industrial process data. In this paper,
   a new information theory-based measure, transfer 0-entropy (T0E), is
   proposed for causality analysis on the basis of the definitions of
   0-entropy and 0-information without assuming a probability space. For
   the cases of more than two variables, a direct T0E (DT0E) concept is
   presented to detect whether there is a direct information and/or
   material flow pathway from one variable to another. Estimation methods
   for the T0E and the DT0E are addressed. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is illustrated by two data sets, one based on data from
   a pilot scale process and a second evaluation based on data from a
   benchmark industrial case study.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo perform quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in
   negligible acquisition time and apply it to measuring iron-rich
   subcortical gray matter.
   MethodsWhole brain QSM was performed using single-shot gradient
   echo-planar imaging (EPI) in under 7 seconds on a standard 1.5 T system
   for imaging brain iron in subcortical gray matter. The method was
   compared to a standard 6-minute gradient recalled echo (GRE) QSM
   acquisition in healthy subjects. Region-of-interest QSM measurements
   were compared between methods in six subcortical gray-matter nuclei and
   two white matter territories.
   ResultsEPI-QSM provided similar mean susceptibility values to standard
   GRE-QSM in iron-rich subcortical gray matter regions, while providing
   greater than 50-fold scan time reduction. Blurring from the low spatial
   resolution and transverse relaxation decay of EPI affected edges but had
   negligible effect on whole subcortical nuclei measurements, which had a
   high correlation (R-2=0.96) to estimated iron content.
   ConclusionEPI-QSM can be performed in several seconds, which enables
   expansion of brain iron studies of subcortical gray matter to cases
   where time is limited and to existing MRI studies that already uses

Abstract = {{Uncertainty in reservoir geological properties has a major impact in
   reservoir design and operations decision-making. To quantify the
   production uncertainty and to make optimal decisions in reservoir
   development, flow simulation is widely used. However, reservoir flow
   simulation is a computationally intensive task due to complex geological
   heterogeneities and numerical thermal modeling. Normally only a small
   number of realizations are chosen from a large superset for flow
   simulation. In this paper, a mixed-integer linear optimization-based
   geological realization reduction method is proposed to select geological
   realizations. The method minimizes the probability distance between the
   discrete distribution represented by the superset of realizations and
   the reduced discrete distribution represented by the selected
   realizations. The proposed method was compared with the traditional
   ranking technique and the distance-based kernel clustering method.
   Results show that the proposed method can effectively select
   realizations and assign probabilities such that the extreme and expected
   reservoir performances are recovered better than any of the single
   static measure-based ranking methods or the kernel clustering method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique to damp subsynchronous torsional
   oscillations in a series-compensated system with multimass synchronous
   generator by reshaping the output impedance of an electrically nearby
   voltage-source converter (VSC; e.g., interfacing a high-voltage dc
   transmission system or wind farm). The incremental output admittance of
   a VSC that is constructed by the circuit components and control
   parameters of a VSC is the key element for VSC-grid interactions. The
   proposed subsynchronous resonance damping controller is based on
   reshaping the virtual output admittance of the interfacing VSC-based
   system to ensure positive damping in the vicinity of torsional modes.
   The proposed reshaping technique uses the voltage at the point of common
   coupling in cascaded compensators to magnify the positive resistance
   without using generator or turbine speed and/or torque perturbations.
   Time-domain simulation results and laboratory-scale experimental results
   are presented to validate the theoretical analysis and show the

Abstract = {{To avoid inconvenient vehicle stops at charging stations, on-road
   wireless charging of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising application
   in the future smart grid. In this paper, we study a critical yet open
   problem for this application, i.e., the impact of wireless charging and
   mobility of EVs on the wholesale electricity market based on locational
   marginal price (LMP), which is mainly determined by the EV mobility
   patterns. To capture the dynamics in vehicle traffic flow and state of
   charge of EV batteries, we model the EV mobility as a queuing network
   based on the statistics obtained via traffic information systems. Then,
   the load on each power system bus with respect to EV wireless charging
   is obtained using the stationary distribution of the queuing network. An
   economic dispatch problem is formulated to incorporate the EV wireless
   charging demand, and the LMP of each power system bus is obtained.
   Furthermore, a pricing mechanism based on the LMP variations of power
   system buses is investigated to enhance the social welfare. The
   performance of our proposed analytical model is verified by a realistic
   road traffic simulator (SUMO) based on a 3-bus test system and an IEEE
   30-bus test system, respectively. Simulation results indicate that our
   proposed analytical model can accurately provide an estimation of the
   LMP variations due to EV wireless charging.}},

Abstract = {{Preparative separations in supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)
   involve the injection of large volumes of the solute. In SFC, the mobile
   phase is typically high pressure CO2 + modifier and the solute to be
   injected is usually dissolved in the modifier. Two-types of injection
   methods, modifier-stream and mixed-stream, are common in commercial
   preparative SFC systems. In modifier-stream injection, the injection is
   made in the modifier stream which is later mixed with the CO2 stream,
   while in the mixed-stream injection, the injection is made in a mixed
   CO2 + modifier stream. In this work a systematic experimental and
   modelling study of the two techniques is reported using
   single-enantiomers of flurbiprofen on Chiralpak AD-H with CO2 + methanol
   as the mobile phase. While modifier-stream injection shows non-distorted
   peaks, mixed-stream injection results in severe peak-distortion. By
   comparing the modelling and experimental results, it is shown that the
   modifier ``plug{''} introduced in the mixed-stream injection is the
   primary cause of the peak distortions. The experimental results also
   point to the possible existence of viscous fingering which contributes
   to further peak distortion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Quantitative comparison of 21 protocols for labeling hippocampal
   subfields and parahippocampal subregions in in vivo MRI: Towards a
   harmonized segmentation protocol}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{526-541}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Objective: An increasing number of human in vivo magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) studies have focused on examining the structure and
   function of the subfields of the hippocampal formation (the dentate
   gyrus, CA fields 1-3, and the subiculum) and subregions of the
   parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal
   cortices). The ability to interpret the results of such studies and to
   relate them to each other would be improved if a common standard existed
   for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions.
   Currently, research groups label different subsets of structures and use
   different rules, landmarks, and cues to define their anatomical extents.
   This paper characterizes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the
   variability in the existing manual segmentation protocols for labeling
   hippocampal and parahippocampal substructures in MRI, with the goal of
   guiding subsequent work on developing a harmonized substructure
   segmentation protocol.
   Method: MRI scans of a single healthy adult human subject were acquired
   both at 3 T and 7 T. Representatives from 21 research groups applied
   their respective manual segmentation protocols to the MRI modalities of
   their choice. The resulting set of 21 segmentations was analyzed in a
   common anatomical space to quantify similarity and identify areas of
   agreement.
   Results: The differences between the 21 protocols include the region
   within which segmentation is performed, the set of anatomical labels
   used, and the extents of specific anatomical labels. The greatest
   overall disagreement among the protocols is at the CA1/subiculum
   boundary, and disagreement across all structures is greatest in the
   anterior portion of the hippocampal formation relative to the body and
   tail.
   Conclusions: The combined examination of the 21 protocols in the same
   dataset suggests possible strategies towards developing a harmonized
   subfield segmentation protocol and facilitates comparison between
   published studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, innovative drought indices are developed to accurately
   quantify the characteristics of drought events and their possible
   impacts to the water resources system of the Tsengwen Reservoir of
   Taiwan. We applied a monotonic test to three fundamental single drought
   indices, namely reliability, vulnerability and resilience, to
   demonstrate that indices showing non-monotonic behaviour can potentially
   give misleading information regarding the effects of drought to water
   resources systems. We further tested two newly proposed single drought
   indices, Vul (system) and Res (weighted) , to the study site, of which
   Vul (system) showed monotonic behaviour but Res (weighted) still behaved
   non-monotonically, even though in a suppressed manner. Next, we proposed
   and tested three composite drought indices, sustainability index (SI),
   drought risk index (DRI) and the water shortage index (WSI), of which
   only the WSI behaved monotonically. As a result, WSI was applied to
   investigate the potential impact of climate change to the future drought
   risk of the study site. On the basis of WSI values derived from runoffs
   simulated by the modified HBV and a reservoir operation (water balance)
   model driven with 18 sets of climate changes scenarios of IPCC (2007)
   statistically downscaled using the MarkSim GCM model, it seems that
   there is a 20 \% chance that climate change impact could lead to more
   severe droughts in the study site. However, under the combined impact of
   climate change and the effect of sedimentation to the Tsengwen
   Reservoir, which could decrease its storage capacity by about 12 \%
   (i.e., s = 0.88), it seems more severe drought impacts will increase to
   2/3 of the 18 test cases. Lastly, a direct relationship was developed
   between WSI and the multifractal strength, which implies that runoff
   data with a stronger multifractal strength could lead to more severe
   droughts and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the performance of
   N-(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)diethylenetriamine (DAEAPTS)-grafted
   mesoporous SBA-15 adsorbent for postcombustion carbon capture was
   studied. Wet grafting technique was adopted to functionalize SBA-15
   surface. The adsorption of CO2 on the amine-grafted sorbent was measured
   by the thermogravimetric method over a CO2 partial pressure range of
   0-90 kPa and a temperature range of 25-105 degrees C under atmospheric
   pressure. The optimal amine loaded SBA-15 adsorbent containing 40 wt\%
   DAEAPTS exhibited capture capacity up to 2.3 mmol/g under simulated gas
   conditions (88.2\% CO2/N-2) at 75 degrees C. The CO2
   adsorption-desorption kinetics of the grafted sorbents were found to be
   sufficiently fast in both dry and humid CO2 streams and it was observed
   that the grafted adsorbent achieved 75\% of the total capacity in 5 min
   of adsorption time in dry 8.8\% CO2/N-2 and in less than 3.5 min in
   humid 8.8\% CO2/N-2. It was also observed that 95\% of the total
   desorption occurred in less than 7 min at 150 degrees C under pure N-2.
   The grafted sorbents showed good reversibility and multicycle stability
   and the drop in capacity after 100 cycles in dry and humid 8.8\% CO2/N-2
   streams was around 7.09\% and 11.65\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The Alberta oil sands contain one of the world's largest reserves of oil
   - over 169 billion barrels of bitumen are economically recoverable with
   current extraction technologies. Surface mining and subsequent hot water
   extraction of bitumen from the ore generates about nine cubic meters of
   raw tailings per cubic meter of oil. Oil sands facilities are required
   to operate under a policy of zero water discharge, resulting in ponds
   containing more than one billion cubic meters of tailings, a mixture of
   sand, fines and process-affected water. Process-affected water contains
   numerous organic compounds, including naphthenic acids (NM), which have
   been identified as the primary source of acute toxicity of
   process-affected water. Developments in analytical techniques, aerobic
   biodegradability, and treatment via chemical oxidation (ozone) of NM are
   reviewed. The field continues to be challenged by the lack of a
   cost-effective, accurate analytical technique for NAs or an
   understanding of all the organic constituents in process-affected water
   that may be contributing to observed toxicity and thus requiring
   treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fractionation of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) via
   pH-dependent extractions was performed to quantitatively investigate
   naphthenic acids (NAs, C(n)H2(n+z)O(2)) and oxidized NAs (O-x-NAs)
   species (CnH2n+zO3 and CnH2n+zO4) using ultra-performance liquid
   chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOFMS). A
   mathematical model was also developed to estimate the dissociation
   constant pK(a) for NAs species, considering the liquid-liquid extraction
   process and the aqueous layer acid-base equilibrium. This model provides
   estimated dissociation constants for compounds in water samples based on
   fractionation extraction and relative quantification. Overall, the sum
   of O-2-, O-3-, and O-4-NAs species accounted for 33.6\% of total
   extracted organic matter. Accumulative extracted masses at different pHs
   revealed that every oxygen atom added to NAs increases the pK(a) (i.e.,
   O-2-NAs < O-3-NAs < O-4-NAs), indicating that the additional O atoms
   exist as -OH in O-3- and O-4-NAs. Molecule electron-withdrawing groups
   such as double bonds and aromatic groups, as indicated by higher carbon
   and -Z number, may be responsible for the lower pK(a) of O-2-, O-3-, and
   O-4-NAs. The model obtained estimated pK(a) values of 3.5 for O-2-NAs,
   4.8 for O-3-NAs, and 6.8 for O-4-NAs via nonlinear regression curve
   fittings. These pK(a) values are valuable physicochemical parameters for
   environmental engineering applications targeting OSPW NAs treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Basal aquifer water is saline groundwater that often needs to be
   dewatered prior to mining. The oil sands industry is seeking
   cost-effective methods to treat basal aquifer water in order to allow
   its recycle to the bitumen extraction process. A hybrid desalination
   system consisting of advanced electrodialysis reversal (EDR)-reverse
   osmosis (RO) combined with a low-temperature evaporator/crystallizer was
   assessed as an opportunity to treat basal aquifer water for a near-zero
   liquid discharge (ZLD) approach. The pilot-scale plant had a capacity of
   50 m(3)/day influent. Pretreatment through sedimentation and
   ultrafiltration proved to be effective in removing both suspended solids
   and turbidity. The hybrid EDR-RO desalination system achieved about 77\%
   recoveries, with brine concentrations up to 125,000 mg/L The results
   showed that the evaporator-crystallizer was able to concentrate the
   EDR-RO brine to a conductivity of just over 250 mS/cm, while producing
   additional freshwater. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that the
   hybrid EDR-RO system combined with a low-temperature
   evaporator/crystallizer was an effective near-zero ZLD approach to
   produce freshwater and minimize brine discharge when treating basal
   aquifer water. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An Analytical Framework for Evaluating the Error Characteristics of

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1268-1281}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Approximate adders have been considered as a potential alternative for
   error-tolerant applications to trade off some accuracy for gains in
   other circuit-based metrics, such as power, area and delay. Existing
   approximate adder designs have shown substantial advantages in improving
   many of these operational features. However, the error characteristics
   of the approximate adders still remain an issue that is not very well
   understood. A simulation-based method requires both programming efforts
   and a time-consuming execution for evaluating the effect of errors. This
   method becomes particularly expensive when dealing with various sizes
   and types of approximate adders. In this paper, a framework based on
   analytical models is proposed for evaluating the error characteristics
   of approximate adders. Error features such as the error rate and the
   mean error distance are obtained using this framework without developing
   functional models of the approximate adders for time-consuming
   simulation. As an example, the estimate of peak signal-to-noise ratios
   (PSNRs) in image processing is considered to show the potential
   application of the proposed analysis. This analytical framework provides
   an efficient method to evaluate various designs of approximate adders
   for meeting different figures of merit in error-tolerant applications.}},

   methods based on finite element stresses}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{113-125}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A number of limit equilibrium slope stability methods have been
   developed where the factor of safety is calculated based on stresses
   computed using an independent finite element analysis. The internal
   stress distribution is usually generated using the `switch on' gravity
   technique assuming linear elastic soil behavior. Young's modulus and
   Poisson's ratio are often assigned at random with little knowledge of
   how the values could impact the slope stability calculations. The
   results from a number of slope stability studies are provided to
   summarize the differing opinions regarding the sensitivity of the factor
   of safety to the selection of Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus. It
   would appear that the different views amongst researchers can be related
   to the method used to search for the critical slip surface. The factor
   of safety is reported to vary by less than 5\% in studies where the grid
   and radius searching procedure is used and by more than 20\% in studies
   where the dynamic programming searching procedure is used. The different
   levels of sensitivity can be related to the soil behavior model adopted
   in the stress - deformation analysis and the interaction of the
   searching procedure with the internal stress distribution in the slope.

Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},

Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Controller discretization has the potential to jeopardize the stability
   of a bilateral teleoperation system. As reported in the literature,
   stability conditions impose bounds on the gains of the discrete-time
   controller and the sampling period and also a trade-off between the two.
   This paper shows a choice of task for which large sampling periods,
   necessitating low control gains for maintaining stability, lead to low
   teleoperation transparency and unacceptable task performance. It
   continues to show that users can successfully perform the same task if
   the controller is implemented using analog components. This highlights
   the advantages of analog haptics in tasks involving the display of
   highly stiff environments. The paper also highlights the constraints in
   designing analog haptic teleoperation controllers and proposes design
   guidelines to address them. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1471-1486}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the problem associated with two interacting circular
   inclusions in a composite subjected to anti-plane shear deformation. A
   version of the Gurtin-Murdoch model of surface/interface elasticity is
   incorporated into the description of the two inclusion-matrix
   interfaces. In contrast to previous investigations, the surface shear
   moduli are varied arbitrarily along the two circular interfaces. The
   composite is subjected to various loading mechanisms that include
   uniform stresses applied at infinity, uniform eigenstrains imposed on
   the two circular inclusions and a screw dislocation located either in
   the matrix or inside one of the two inclusions. Complex variable methods
   are used in conjunction with Fourier series expansions and matrix
   algebra to derive an analytical solution to the corresponding problem.
   The unknown coefficients in the ensuing three analytic functions are
   determined in an elegant manner. The size-dependent material forces
   acting on the two inclusions and the screw dislocation are also
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Femtosecond lasers together with high resolution optics have given us
   the ability to achieve submicron ablation spots which can play an
   important role in specific micromachining applications. Light emitted
   from the plasma at the sample surface created by a focused femtosecond
   laser pulse can also be used in laser induced breakdown spectroscopy
   (LIBS) and allows us to characterize the chemical composition of the

   resolution using LIBS has often been defined by measuring the FWHM of
   the crater size. In this report, we study the application of femtosecond
   266 nm laser pulses with very low energies of 10's of nanojoules. We
   have investigated spatial resolution using the detection of thin strips
   of chromium on silicon substrates and compared the actual width of the
   chromium versus the experimentally obtained width using LIBS detection.
   The variation of signal levels for low pulse energies is investigated on
   chromium surfaces. A spatial resolution of 1 mu m was obtained for
   detection of chromium from the emission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) for silencing of aberrantly
   expressed genes is a promising therapy for the treatment of various
   genetic disorders. Polymeric carriers have been used in the design of
   efficient delivery systems to generate nanoscale siRNA polyplexes.
   Despite the great amount of research pursued on siRNA therapeutics, the
   underlying mechanisms of polyplex dissociation in cytosol are still
   unclear. The fate of siRNA polyplexes during intracellular stages of
   delivery and how the endogenous molecules may affect the integrity of
   polyplexes remains to be explored. In this study, we have focused on
   miRNA-21 as a representative anionic endogenous molecule and performed
   gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays, particle size and zeta
   (zeta)-potential analyses, and a series of all-atom molecular dynamics
   simulations to elucidate the effect of miRNA on siRNA-PEI polyplexes. We
   report a slightly better binding to PEI by miRNA than that of siRNA, and
   speculated that miRNA may disrupt the integrity of preformed siRNA-PEI
   polyplexes. In contrast to our initial speculation, however,
   introduction of miRNA to a preformed siRNA-PEI polyplex revealed
   formation of a miRNA layer surrounding the polyplex through interactions
   with PEI. The resulting structure is a ternary siRNA-PEI-miRNA complex,
   where the experimentally determined ?-potential was found to decrease as
   a function of miRNA added.}},

Title = {{Octanol-Water Partition Coefficient from 3D-RISM-KH Molecular Theory of

Abstract = {{The octanol-water partition coefficient is an important
   physical-chemical characteristic widely used to describe
   hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of chemical compounds. The partition
   coefficient is related to the transfer free energy of a compound from
   water to octanol. Here, we introduce a new protocol for prediction of
   the partition coefficient based on the statistical-mechanical,
   3D-RISM-KH Molecular theory of solvation. It was shown recently that
   with the compound-solvent correlation functions obtained from the
   3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation, the free energy-functional
   supplemented with the correction linearly related to the partial molar
   volume obtained from the Kirkwood-Buff/3D-RISM theory, also called the
   ``universal correction{''} (UC), provides accurate prediction of the
   hydration free energy of small compounds, compared to explicit solvent
   molecular dynamics {[}Palmer, D. S.; et al. J. Phys.: Condens. Matter
   2010, 22, 492101]. Here we report that with the UC reparametrized
   accordingly this theory also provides an excellent agreement with the
   experimental data for the solvation free energy in nonpolar solvent
   (1-octanol) and so accurately predicts the octanol-water partition
   coefficient. The performance of the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) and Gaussian
   fluctuation (GF) functionals of the solvation free energy, with and
   without UC, is tested on a large library of small compounds with diverse
   functional groups. The best agreement with the experimental data for
   octanol-water partition coefficients is obtained with the KH-UC
   solvation free energy functional.}},

Title = {{Role of string-like collective atomic motion on diffusion and structural
   relaxation in glass forming Cu-Zr alloys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{We investigate Cu-Zr liquid alloys using molecular dynamics simulation
   and well-accepted embedded atom method potentials over a wide range of
   chemical composition and temperature as model metallic glass-forming
   (GF) liquids. As with other types of GF materials, the dynamics of these
   complex liquids are characterized by ``dynamic heterogeneity{''} in the
   form of transient polymeric clusters of highly mobile atoms that are
   composed in turn of atomic clusters exhibiting string-like cooperative
   motion. In accordance with the string model of relaxation, an extension
   of the Adam-Gibbs (AG) model, changes in the activation free energy
   Delta G(a) with temperature of both the Cu and Zr diffusion coefficients
   D, and the alpha structural relaxation time tau(alpha) can be described
   to a good approximation by changes in the average string length, L. In
   particular, we confirm that the strings are a concrete realization of
   the abstract ``cooperatively rearranging regions{''} of AG. We also find
   coexisting clusters of relatively ``immobile{''} atoms that exhibit
   predominantly icosahedral local packing rather than the low symmetry
   packing of ``mobile{''} atoms. These two distinct types of dynamic
   heterogeneity are then associated with different fluid structural
   states. Glass-forming liquids are thus analogous to polycrystalline
   materials where the icosahedrally packed regions correspond to crystal
   grains, and the strings reside in the relatively disordered grain
   boundary-like regions exterior to these locally well-ordered regions. A
   dynamic equilibrium between localized ({''}immobile{''}) and wandering
   ({''}mobile{''}) particles exists in the liquid so that the dynamic
   heterogeneity can be considered to be type of self-assembly process. We
   also characterize changes in the local atomic free volume in the course
   of string-like atomic motion to better understand the initiation and
   propagation of these fluid excitations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubular solid oxide fuel cells (mT-SOFCs) with infiltrated cathodes
   were fabricated and their electrochemical performance were compared with
   standard cells. For this purpose, NiO-YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia)
   microtubular supports were fabricated by cold isostatic pressing (CIP)
   of NiO, YSZ and pore former powders, followed by spray coating of the
   YSZ electrolyte and co-sintering at 1400 degrees C. The LSM
   (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta)-YSZ oxygen electrode is deposited by infiltration
   of LSM (into a thin porous YSZ layer). One of the advantages of this
   fabrication method is an increase of TPB (triple-phase boundary) length
   compared with the standard LSM-YSZ composite due to the much finer
   dispersed LSM particles having a higher active surface area towards
   oxygen reduction.
   The effect of the infiltrated amount in cell performance was studied.
   Two cells with identical anode support and thin layer electrolyte and 22
   vol\% (cell A) and 35 vol\% (cell B) infiltrated LSM were prepared. The
   infiltrated cells showed an increase of up to 50\% in terms of power
   density compared to the standard cell (550 mW cm(-2) at 0.7 V and 850
   degrees C for a standard cell having 50 vol\% LSM and 720 and 805 mW
   cm(-2) at 0.7 V and 850 degrees C for infiltrated cells A and B,
   respectively). The results indicate that the infiltrated cathode with
   fine distributed LSM particles improve the fuel cell performance using a
   lower LSM content compared with standard LSM-YSZ composite cathodes.

   micro-CT to measure their porosity, the area of flow and develop model
   geometry. Pressure-flow measurements were conducted on specimens to
   determine their permeability in the physiological and transverse flow
   directions to compare with numerical results. The overall porosity and
   permeability of the calvaria were spatially variable. Results suggest an
   order of magnitude increase in permeability for a 14\% increase in
   overall porosity based on a small number of samples. Numerical results
   fell within the experimental infusion tests results. Due to the
   difficulty and ethical considerations in obtaining adolescent skull
   samples to perform large-scale testing, the developed model will be

Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) is a novel coating
   process based on plasma spraying. In contrast to conventional methods,
   deposition takes place not only from liquid splats but also from
   nano-sized clusters and from the vapor phase. This offers new
   opportunities to obtain advanced microstructures and thus to comply with
   the growing demands on modern functional coatings. Thin and dense
   ceramic coatings as well as highly porous columnar structures can be
   achieved, offering novel opportunities for the application of thermal
   spray technology.
   This study describes process conditions, which are relevant for the
   formation of particular microstructures in the PS-PVD process. Following
   the structure of the process, the feedstock treatment close to the
   plasma source, plasma particle interaction in the open jet and the
   formation of coating microstructures on the substrate are covered.
   Calculated results on the plasma particle interaction under PS-PVD
   process conditions were found to be in good agreement with OES results
   and microstructural observations. They show that the feedstock treatment
   along the very first trajectory segment between injector and jet
   expansion plays a key role.
   Varying the plasma parameters, feedstock treatment can be controlled to
   a broad extent. Consequently, the manifold nature of the feedstock
   species arriving on the substrate enables to achieve various coating
   microstructures. As examples, application specific features of PS-PVD
   coatings are reported for strain-tolerant thermal barrier coatings as
   well as for gas-tight oxygen transport membranes with high mixed
   electronic-ionic conductivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The mineral and aqueous phase evolution of sulfur and nickel with

Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{401}},
Pages = {{169-179}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{The release of S and metals from the weathering of waste rock pyrrhotite
   {[}Fe(1-x)S] is affected by oxidation pathways, the presence and
   concentration of Fe- substitution metals (e.g., Ni), and Fe (oxyhydr)
   oxide products. A 4C (monoclinic) pyrrhotite {[}Fe7S8, Ni: Fe
   substitution of about 1: 200] in a low sulfide waste rock was weathered
   in the laboratory and at a field site to identify the evolution of S
   oxidation, distribution and coordination of Ni, and possible adsorption
   of Ni on secondary Fe minerals. Mineral phase S was present in the -2,
   -1, 0, + 4, and + 6 oxidation states prior to its release as SO42- into
   solution. The thiosulfate {[}S2O32-] pathway of sulfide oxidation was
   indicated by the presence of polythionates and S2O32- Sulfur as S2O32-
   was more persistent than sulfite {[}SO32-] prior to oxidation to SO42-.
   The release of Ni during the oxidative dissolution of pyrrhotite was
   influenced by its distribution in the grain: diffuse throughout the
   grain (solid solution mineral) or concentrated in exsolved pentlandite
   {[}(Fe, Ni)(9)S-8] lamellae within the pyrrhotite. With the oxidation of
   S, Ni coordination changed from bonding with reduced S species to
   bonding with oxygen prior to its release with SO42-. Sulfur as SO42-
   typically stayed in solutionwith release from the pyrrhotite, but the
   solubility of released Ni was dependent on leachate pH. A near-neutral
   pH induced the adsorption of Ni onto Fe (oxyhydr) oxides, which formed
   during oxidation of the pyrrhotite. In some grains, Ni was found
   concentrated in Fe distal precipitates as opposed to the closer
   alteration layers/zones of the sulfide grain. Subsequent dissolution of
   the Fe (oxyhydr) oxides or desorption of Ni with a change in pH provides
   a delayed release of Ni into solution. This improved understanding of
   the oxidation pathway of S, coordination and release of Ni, and
   influence of Fe (oxyhydr) oxides in the weathering of pyrrhotite will
   assist in determining appropriate reaction-rate factors and element
   release rates for prediction of acid rock drainage. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Hypoxic culture of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal stem cells
   differentially enhances in vitro chondrogenesis within cell-seeded
   collagen and hyaluronic acid porous scaffolds}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The quality of cartilaginous tissue derived from bone
   marrow mesenchymal stromal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation has been
   correlated with clinical outcome. Therefore, culture conditions capable
   of modulating tissue phenotype, such as oxygen tension and scaffold
   composition, are under investigation. The objective of this study was to
   assess the effect of hypoxia on in vitro BMSC chondrogenesis within
   clinically approved porous scaffolds composed of collagen and hyaluronic
   acid (HA). It was hypothesized that hypoxic isolation/expansion and
   differentiation would improve BMSC chondrogenesis in each construct.
   Methods: Ovine BMSCs were isolated and expanded to passage 2 under
   hypoxia (3\% oxygen) or normoxia (21\% oxygen). Cell proliferation and
   colony-forming characteristics were assessed. BMSCs were seeded at 10
   million cells per cubic centimeter on cylindrical scaffolds composed of
   either collagen I sponge or esterified HA non-woven mesh. Chondrogenic
   differentiation was performed in a defined medium under hypoxia or
   normoxia for 14 days. Cultured constructs were assessed for gene
   expression, proteoglycan staining, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantity, and
   diameter change.
   Results: Isolation/expansion under hypoxia resulted in faster BMSC
   population doublings per day (P < 0.05), whereas cell and colony counts
   were not significantly different (P = 0.60 and 0.30, respectively).
   Collagen and HA scaffolds seeded with BMSCs that were isolated,
   expanded, and differentiated under hypoxia exhibited superior aggrecan
   and collagen II mRNA expressions (P < 0.05), GAG quantity (P < 0.05),
   and proteoglycan staining in comparison with normoxia. GAG/DNA was
   augmented with hypoxic isolation/expansion in all constructs (P < 0.01).
   Comparison by scaffold composition indicated increased mRNA expressions
   of hyaline cartilage-associated collagen II, aggrecan, and SOX9 in
   collagen scaffolds, although expression of collagen X, which is related
   to hypertrophic cartilage, was also elevated (P < 0.05). Proteoglycan
   deposition was not significantly improved in collagen scaffolds unless
   culture involved normoxic isolation/expansion followed by hypoxic
   differentiation. During chondrogenesis, collagen-based constructs
   progressively contracted to 60.1\% +/- 8.9\% of the initial diameter
   after 14 days, whereas HA-based construct size was maintained (109.7\%
   +/- 4.2\%).
   Conclusions: Hypoxic isolation/expansion and differentiation enhance in
   vitro BMSC chondrogenesis within porous scaffolds. Although both
   collagen I and HA scaffolds support the creation of hyaline-like
   cartilaginous tissue, variations in gene expression, extracellular
   matrix formation, and construct size occur during chondrogenesis.}},

   non-linear control system has an unknown dynamic model. They apply a
   data-based method to design and adjust the feedback gain matrix for the
   plant, whose desired outputs are given by the remote controller. This
   method has advantages of both data and event-driven control methods.
   Moreover, the proposed scheme provides an alternative option to realise
   remote control, when the dynamic model of the plant is unknown. They
   then present theoretical analysis on the convergence condition and a

Abstract = {{In this study, a robust approach to global identification of linear

   In practice, the industrial process data are often contaminated with

   LPV modelling problem is formulated and solved in the scheme of
   generalised expectation-maximisation (GEM) algorithm. The measurement
   noise is taken to follow the Student's t-distribution instead of using
   the conventional Gaussian distribution, in this algorithm. The extent of
   robustness of the proposed approach is adaptively adjusted by optimising
   the degrees of freedom parameter of the Student's t-distribution
   iteratively through the maximisation step of the GEM algorithm. The
   numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{In this work, a parameter tuning problem of two-degrees-of-freedom model
   predictive control of industrial papermaking processes is explored to
   achieve satisfactory time-domain robust closed-loop performance in terms
   of worst-case overshoots and worst-case settling times, under
   user-specified parametric uncertainties. An efficient visualization
   method is first developed to characterize the set of time-domain
   closed-loop responses in the presence of parametric model plant
   mismatch. On the basis of the visualization technique and the
   unmodality/monotonicity properties of the performance indices with
   respect to the tuning parameters, the feasibility of the tuning problem
   can be analyzed, and a three-step iterative line-search based automatic
   tuning algorithm is proposed to determine the controller parameters that
   meet the time-domain performance requirements robustly for the given
   parametric uncertainty specifications. The effectiveness of the
   algorithm is illustrated by applying the results to a process from stock
   to conditioned weight in an industrial paper machine and by comparing
   the performance of the algorithm with that of brutal search.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Cracking sounds emitted from human synovial joints have been attributed
   historically to the sudden collapse of a cavitation bubble formed as
   articular surfaces are separated. Unfortunately, bubble collapse as the
   source of joint cracking is inconsistent with many physical phenomena
   that define the joint cracking phenomenon. Here we present direct
   evidence from real-time magnetic resonance imaging that the mechanism of
   joint cracking is related to cavity formation rather than bubble
   collapse. In this study, ten metacarpophalangeal joints were studied by
   inserting the finger of interest into a flexible tube tightened around a
   length of cable used to provide long-axis traction. Before and after
   traction, static 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired.
   During traction, rapid cine magnetic resonance images were obtained from
   the joint midline at a rate of 3.2 frames per second until the cracking
   event occurred. As traction forces increased, real-time cine magnetic
   resonance imaging demonstrated rapid cavity inception at the time of
   joint separation and sound production after which the resulting cavity
   remained visible. Our results offer direct experimental evidence that
   joint cracking is associated with cavity inception rather than collapse
   of a pre-existing bubble. These observations are consistent with
   tribonucleation, a known process where opposing surfaces resist
   separation until a critical point where they then separate rapidly
   creating sustained gas cavities. Observed previously in vitro, this is
   the first in-vivo macroscopic demonstration of tribonucleation and as
   such, provides a new theoretical framework to investigate health
   outcomes associated with joint cracking.}},

Title = {{Reactive air brazing for sealing mixed ionic electronic conducting

Abstract = {{Mixed ionic electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramic membranes and
   high-temperature alloys are candidate materials for applications in
   high-temperature gas separation systems and solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFCs). Ensuring a gas-tight seal between the components is of
   paramount importance in the operation of such devices. This paper
   investigates the wettability and joining of representative
   ceramic-to-ceramic and ceramic-to-metal components by reactive air
   brazing (RAB) using Ag-Cu alloys. The correlation of the interfacial
   reaction (including wettability) to the hermeticity of the joints has
   been demonstrated by elemental mapping using Electron Probe
   Micro-Analysis with wavelength dispersive spectrometry (EPMA-WDS). The
   wettability studies described herein demonstrate that RAB is a reliable
   method to achieve strong, gas-tight bonding between the dissimilar
   materials. These are the first reported results of successful air-brazed
   joints between La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) and
   BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.2O3-delta (BCFZ) hollow fibre membranes to FeCrAlloy
   components using a 4 mol.\% Cu in Ag filler metal composition which
   delivered an impressive runtime of up to 2000 h (for LSCF). It has been
   demonstrated that these RAB joints are hermetic and resistant to thermal
   ageing, making them suitable for membrane-based gas-separation
   applications. Post-operation EPMA-WDS analysis of the microstructures
   and compositional distribution of the brazed seals has revealed that
   their performance is largely dependent upon a reaction zone and an
   interfacial oxide layer adherent to the FeCrAlloy surface. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{The Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1, implemented in the GPS-X
   computational simulator, was calibrated to simulate the steady state
   anaerobic co-digestion of municipal wastewater sludge and restaurant
   grease trap waste (GTW). Substrate characterizations combined with
   anaerobic respirometric analysis were applied for model calibration.
   Initial biomass concentrations and distributions were estimated using
   methane production rate curves together with effluent values from
   full-scale anaerobic digesters. Two separate datasets obtained from
   steady state mesophilic lab-scale experiments were used to calibrate and
   validate the model. The modified model was able to predict reasonably
   well the steady-state results of biogas production, CH4 and CO2
   contents, pH, alkalinity, COD and VSS observed within the evaluated GTW
   loading. Finally, the calibrated model was validated using pilot-scale
   co-digestion results obtained during a previous study. The model output
   was in good agreement with measured values of methane production, pH,
   ammonia, alkalinity and COD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An expansion of fuzzy information granules through successive
   refinements of their information content and their use to system
   modeling}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with a fundamental problem of expanding
   (refining) information granules being treated as functional entities
   playing a pivotal role in Granular Computing and ensuing constructs such
   as granular models, granular classifiers, and granular predictors. We
   formulate a problem of refinement of information granules as a certain
   optimization task in which a selected information granule is refined
   into a family of more detailed (precise, viz, more specific) information
   granules so that a general partition requirement becomes satisfied. As
   the ensuing information granules are directly linked with the more
   general information granule positioned at the higher level of hierarchy,
   the partition criterion is conditional by being implied (conditioned) by
   the description of the granule positioned one level up in the hierarchy.
   A criterion guiding a refinement of information granules is formulated
   and made fully reflective of the nature of the problem (being of
   regression-like or of classification character), which leads to a
   distinct way in which the diversity of information granules is
   articulated and quantified. With regard to the detailed algorithmic
   setting, we discuss the use of a so-called conditional Fuzzy C-Means and
   show how information granules (fuzzy sets) are formed in a successive
   manner. The method helps highlight the ensuing calculations of the
   resulting membership functions and reveal how the detailed structure of
   the data is captured. A number of numeric studies in the realm of system
   modeling are provided to demonstrate the performance of the approach and
   highlight the nature of the resulting information granules along with
   the performance of the fuzzy models in which these information granules
   are used. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Toxicity of silver nanoparticles against bacteria, yeast, and algae}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{The toxicity mechanism employed by silver nanoparticles against
   microorganisms has captivated scientists for nearly a decade and remains
   a debatable issue. The question most frequently asked is whether silver
   nanoparticles exert specific effects on microorganisms beyond the
   well-documented antimicrobial activity of Ag+. Here, we study the
   effects of citrate- (d = 17.5 +/- 9.4 nm) and 11-mercaptounde-canoic
   acid (d = 38.8 +/- 3.6 nm)-capped silver nanoparticles on microorganisms
   belonging to various genera. The antimicrobial effect of Ag+ was
   distinguished from that of nanosilver by monitoring microbial growth in
   the presence and absence of nanoparticles and by careful comparison of
   the responses of equimolar silver nitrate solution. The results show
   that when using equimolar silver solutions, silver nitrate has higher
   toxic potential on all microorganisms than both nanoparticles tested.
   Furthermore, some microorganisms are more susceptible to silver than
   others and the choice of capping agent is relevant in the toxicity.
   Atomic force microscopy disclosed that AgNO3 had a destructive effect on
   algae. The antimicrobial activity of nanosilver could be exploited to
   prevent microbial colonization of medical devices and to determine the
   fate of nanoparticles in the environment.}},

   Fishway Passage}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Fishways have been developed to restore longitudinal connectivity in
   rivers. Despite their potential for aiding fish passage, fishways may
   represent a source of significant energetic expenditure for fish as they
   are highly turbulent environments. Nonetheless, our understanding of the
   physiological mechanisms underpinning fishway passage of fish is still
   limited. We examined swimming behaviour and activity of silver redhorse
   (Moxostoma anisurum) during its upriver spawning migration in a vertical
   slot fishway. We used an accelerometer-derived instantaneous activity
   metric (overall dynamic body acceleration) to estimate location-specific
   swimming activity. Silver redhorse demonstrated progressive increases in
   activity during upstream fishway passage. Moreover, location-specific
   passage duration decreased with an increasing number of passage
   attempts. Turning basins and the most upstream basin were found to delay
   fish passage. No relationship was found between basin-specific passage
   duration and activity and the respective values from previous basins.
   The results demonstrate that successful fishway passage requires periods
   of high activity. The resultant energetic expenditure may affect
   fitness, foraging behaviour and increase susceptibility to predation,
   compromising population sustainability. This study highlights the need
   to understand the physiological mechanisms underpinning fishway passage
   to improve future designs and interpretation of biological evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Incomplete regeneration of activated carbon loaded with organic
   compounds results in heel build-up that reduces the useful life of the
   adsorbent. In this study, microwave heating was tested as a regeneration
   method for beaded activated carbon (BAC) loaded with n-dodecane, a high
   molecular weight volatile organic compound. Energy consumption and
   desorption efficiency for microwave-heating regeneration were compared
   with conductive-heating regeneration. The minimum energy needed to
   completely regenerate the adsorbent (100\% desorption efficiency) using
   microwave regeneration was 6\% of that needed with conductive heating
   regeneration, owing to more rapid heating rates and lower heat loss.
   Analyses of adsorbent pore size distribution and surface chemistry
   confirmed that neither heating method altered the physical/chemical
   properties of the BAC. Additionally, gas chromatography (with flame
   ionization detector) confirmed that neither regeneration method
   detectably altered the adsorbate composition during desorption. By
   demonstrating improvements in energy consumption and desorption
   efficiency and showing stable adsorbate and adsorbent properties, this
   paper suggests that microwave heating is an attractive method for
   activated carbon regeneration particularly when high-affinity VOC
   adsorbates are present.}},

Abstract = {{Using a surface forces apparatus (SFA), we studied the forces associated
   with the reorientation of molecules of a common nematic thermotropic
   liquid crystal, 4'-n-pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB), confined between two
   conducting (silver) surfaces and its optical behavior under the
   influence of electric fields with varying magnitudes and field
   directions. A transient attractive force was observed due to partial
   reorientations of the liquid crystal molecules and the flow of free
   ions, in addition to a stronger constant capacitance attraction between
   the silver surfaces. At the same time, the optical properties of the
   liquid crystals were observed perpendicular to the silver surfaces.
   Observations of shifts and fluctuations of the extraordinary wave of the
   (multiple beam) interference fringes measure the refractive index of the
   director component parallel to the surface, which is sensitive to tilt
   motion (or reorientation) of the liquid crystal molecules that provided
   details of the anisotropic orientations of the molecules and domains.
   Any lateral differential refractive index change is easily observed by
   optical microscopy. The optical microscope imaging showed that the
   changes in the optical properties are due to convective flow at domain
   boundaries of the liquid crystal molecules (and possible free ions)
   between the two charged surfaces. At low electric fields, propagation of
   domain boundaries was observed, while at higher electric fields,
   hexagonal patterns of flowing molecules were observed. The interplay of
   the force measurements and optical observations reveal a complex dynamic
   behavior of liquid crystals subjected to varying electric fields in
   confined spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Internal physical structure can drastically modify the properties of

   assembled into cylindrically symmetric geometries constitute
   light-guiding structures that support new kinds of exotic modes. A
   microtube of anodized nanoporous alumina, with nanopores radially
   emanating from the inner wall to the outer surface, is a manifestation
   of such an anisotropic metamaterial optical fiber. The nanopores, when
   filled with a plasmonic metal such as silver or gold, greatly increase
   the electromagnetic anisotropy. The modal solutions in such anisotropic
   circular waveguides can be uncommon Bessel functions with imaginary

Title = {{A Stochastic Dilemma Zone Protection Algorithm Based on the Vehicles'

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{181-191}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{A common method of the dilemma zone (DZ) protection at intersections is
   to hold the green until the number of vehicles in DZ is lower than a
   threshold. Since the threshold is typically empirical and fixed, it
   cannot accommodate the dynamic and time-varying traffic patterns and
   therefore should be adjusted regularly. This article presents a new
   Markov-process-based DZ protection algorithm, which considers the number
   of vehicles in DZ (i.e., the state) over time to be a Markov process. At
   each time step, the algorithm first predicts the future states with the
   Markov state-transit matrix, then compares them with the current state
   to determine whether to end the green or not. In this way, the new
   end-green criterion is not the fixed threshold value but the current
   state and the prediction with the Markov state-transit matrix.
   Meanwhile, the Markov matrix is automatically updated whenever the new
   observed detected state transitions come in. The new algorithms were
   also evaluated in simulation and the simulation results showed that the
   new algorithm maintains reliable and effective protection in a dynamic
   traffic environment. At last, we find that the new algorithm performance
   can be further improved if the vehicle trajectories are precisely
   measured rather than estimated.}},

Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{801-814}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel fault detection and isolation (FDI) method for
   switching linear systems is developed. All input and output signals are
   assumed to be corrupted with measurement noises. In the proposed method,
   a `lifted' linear model named as stochastic hybrid decoupling polynomial
   (SHDP) is introduced. The SHDP model governs the dynamics of the
   switching linear system with all different modes, and is independent of
   the switching sequence. The error-in-variable (EIV) representation of
   SHDP is derived, and is used for the fault residual generation and
   isolation following the well-adopted local approach. The proposed FDI
   method can detect and isolate the fault-induced abrupt changes in
   switching models' parameters without estimating the switching modes.
   Furthermore, in this paper, the analytical expressions of the gradient
   vector and Hessian matrix are obtained based on the EIV SHDP
   formulation, so that they can be used to implement the online fault
   detection scheme. The performance of the proposed method is then
   illustrated by simulation examples.}},

Abstract = {{Solution salinity plays an important role in the interactions between
   polymer flocculants and solid colloid particles which determine the
   flocculation performance. In this work, chitosan-graft-polyacrylamide
   (chi-g-PAM) was synthesized and characterized. The influence of solution
   salinity (viz., addition of NaCl and CaCl2) on the flocculation of
   chi-g-PAM on kaolinite suspension and the interactions between the
   polymers and solid surfaces was investigated via several complementary
   measurements and techniques, including settling tests, zeta potential
   analyzer, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), surface
   forces apparatus (SFA), and atomic force microscope (AFM). Our results
   show that the initial settling rate (ISR) of kaolinite suspension
   decreases with increasing the concentration of NaCl and CaCl2 (0.01 to 1
   M). The high salinity condition leads to a relatively weak adsorption
   and more compressed conformations of chi-g-PAM chains on both silica and
   alumina surfaces (two facets of kaolinite), as well as weakened bridging
   interactions between two mica surfaces (with silicate structure similar
   to kaolinite), therefore resulting in relatively poor flocculation
   performance. The interaction mechanism between chi-g-PAM polymer chains
   and kaolinite particles during flocculation was discussed in terms of
   the intermolecular and surface forces involved.}},

Abstract = {{Enhanced photo-collection and increased carrier lifetimes in

   have been reported in this paper. As a direct result of radial surface
   potential due to Fermi level pinning caused by high density of surface
   states in BFO nanowire, a highly efficient carrier separation has been
   observed. The measured carrier lifetimes in BFO nanowire are three
   orders magnitude higher than the reported values in bulk. We have
   obtained the equilibrium carrier concentration similar to 5.4 x
   10(17)/cm(3) and assumed a mobility value similar to 3 cm(2) (V/s) at
   room temperature in the BFO nanowire. We believe that BFO nanowires with

Abstract = {{For construction safety and health, continuous monitoring of unsafe
   conditions and action is essential in order to eliminate potential
   hazards in a timely manner. As a robust and automated means of field
   observation, computer vision techniques have been applied for the
   extraction of safety related information from site images and videos,
   and regarded as effective solutions complementary to current
   time-consuming and unreliable manual observational practices. Although
   some research efforts have been directed toward computer vision-based
   safety and health monitoring, its application in real practice remains
   premature due to a number of technical issues and research challenges in
   terms of reliability, accuracy, and applicability. This paper thus
   reviews previous attempts in construction applications from both
   technical and practical perspectives in order to understand the current
   status of computer vision techniques, which in turn suggests the
   direction of future research in the field of computer vision-based
   safety and health monitoring. Specifically, this paper categorizes
   previous studies into three groups-object detection, object tracking,
   and action recognition-based on types of information required to
   evaluate unsafe conditions and acts. The results demonstrate that major
   research challenges include comprehensive scene understanding, varying
   tracking accuracy by camera position, and action recognition of multiple
   equipment and workers. In addition, we identified several practical
   issues including a lack of task-specific and quantifiable metrics to
   evaluate the extracted information in safety context, technical
   obstacles due to dynamic conditions at construction sites and privacy
   issues. These challenges indicate a need for further research in these
   areas. Accordingly, this paper provides researchers insights into
   advancing knowledge and techniques for computer vision-based safety and
   health monitoring, and offers fresh opportunities and considerations to
   practitioners in understanding and adopting the techniques. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new and rigorous analytical calculation of

   Then, by solving the modified Bessel's equation, the analytical formulas
   to calculate the magnetic field and eddy current losses in these regions
   are obtained and several cases are studied. The results are compared
   with 3-D finite element simulations and show very close correspondence.
   The obtained formulas allow straightforward calculations that can help
   designers to select proper parameters to optimize the design of
   transformers. This paper can be taken as the basis for the analysis of
   the nonlinear permeability case.}},

   shells by shape memory alloys}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The present paper deals with the nonlinear thermal instability of
   geometrically imperfect sandwich cylindrical shells under uniform
   heating. The sandwich shells are made of a shape memory alloy
   (SMA)-fiber-reinforced composite and functionally graded (FG) face
   sheets (FG/SMA/FG). The Brinson phenomenological model is used to
   express the constitutive characteristics of SMA fibers. The governing
   equations are established within the framework of the third-order shear
   deformation shell theory by taking into account the von Karman
   geometrical nonlinearity and initial imperfection. The material
   properties of constituents are assumed to be temperature dependent. The
   Galerkin technique is utilized to derive expressions of the bifurcation
   points and bifurcation paths of the sandwich cylindrical shells. Using
   the developed closed-form solutions, extensive numerical results are
   presented to provide an insight into the influence of the SMA fiber
   volume fraction, SMA pre-strain, core thickness, non-homogeneity index,
   geometrical imperfection, geometry parameters of sandwich shells and
   temperature dependency of materials on the stability of shells. The
   results reveal that proper application of SMA fibers postpones the
   thermal bifurcation point and dramatically decreases thermal
   post-buckling deflection. Moreover, the induced tensile recovery stress
   of SMA fibers could also stabilize the geometrically imperfect shells
   during the inverse martensite phase transformation.}},

Abstract = {{Two parallel multi-element ultrasonic acoustic arrays combined with sets
   of focal laws for acoustic signal generation and a classical tomographic
   inversion algorithm are used to generate real-time two-dimensional micro
   seismic acoustic images of multiphase materials. Proof of concept and
   calibration measurements were performed for single phase and two phase
   liquids, uniform polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plates, and aluminum cylinders
   imbedded in PVC plates. Measurement artefacts, arising from the limited
   range of viewing angles, and the compromise between data acquisition
   rate and image quality are discussed. The angle range of scanning and
   the image resolution were varied, and the effects on the quality of the
   reproduction of the speed of sound profiles of model solids and liquids
   with known geometries and compositions were analysed in detail. The best
   image quality results were obtained for a scanning angle range of {[}-35
   degrees, 35 degrees] at a step size of 2.5 degrees post processed to
   generate images on a 40 mu m square grid. The data acquisition time for
   high quality images with a 30 mm x 40 mm view field is 10 min.
   Representation of two-phase solids with large differences in speed of
   sound between phases and where one phase is dispersed in the form of
   macroscopic objects (greater than 1 mm in diameter) proved to be the
   most difficult to image accurately. Liquid-liquid and liquid-vapor phase
   boundaries, in micro porous solids by contrast, were more readily
   defined. Displacement of air by water and water by heptane in natural
   porous limestone provides illustrative kinetic examples. Measurement
   results with these realistic cases demonstrate the feasibility of the
   technique to monitor in real time and on the micrometer length scale
   local composition and flow of organic liquids in inorganic porous media,
   one of many envisioned engineering applications. Improvement of data
   acquisition rate is an area for future collaborative study. (C) 2015 AIP

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{A model-FUNNEL-GHG-OS (FUNdamental ENgineering PrinciplEs- based ModeL
   for Estimation of GreenHouse Gases in the Oil Sands) based on
   fundamental engineering principles was developed to estimate the
   specific energy consumption and GHGs (greenhouse gas emissions) for
   upgrading bitumen to produce SCO (synthetic crude oil). The model
   estimates quantity of SCO produced, the consumption of hydrogen, steam,
   natural gas and power in two different upgrading operations, namely
   delayed coking and hydroconversion. Hydroconversion upgrading is more
   energy and GHG (433.4 kgCO(2)eq/m(3) of bitumen) intensive than delayed
   coker upgrading (240.3 kgCO(2)eq/m(3) of bitumen) but obtains a higher
   yield of SCO. This research explores bitumen pathways in oil sands -
   upgrading bitumen to SCO, followed by transporting and refining SCO as
   compared to transporting and refining dilbit. The energy consumption,
   GHG emissions and volume of transportation fuels obtained from refining
   of different oil sands feeds has been investigated. Refining of oil
   sands products produce 7.9 to 15.72 gCO(2)eq per MJ of refined product.
   Refining of SCO to transportation fuels produces 41\% and 49\% less
   emissions than dilbit and bitumen respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We developed a generalized solvation force extrapolation (GSFE) approach
   to speed up multiple time step molecular dynamics (MTS-MD) of
   biomolecules steered with mean solvation forces obtained from the
   3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation (three-dimensional reference
   interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure). GSFE is based
   on a set of techniques including the non-Eckart-like transformation of
   coordinate space separately for each solute atom, extension of the
   force-coordinate pair basis set followed by selection of the best
   subset, balancing the normal equations by modified least-squares
   minimization of deviations, and incremental increase of outer time step
   in motion integration. Mean solvation forces acting on the biomolecule
   atoms in conformations at successive inner time steps are extrapolated
   using a relatively small number of best (closest) solute atomic
   coordinates and corresponding mean solvation forces obtained at previous
   outer time steps by converging the 3D-RISM-KH integral equations. The
   MTS-MD evolution steered with GSFE of 3D-RISM-KH mean solvation forces
   is efficiently stabilized with our optimized isokinetic Nose-Hoover
   chain (OIN) thermostat. We validated the hybrid
   MTS-MD/OIN/GSFE/3D-RISM-KH integrator on solvated organic and
   biomolecules of different stiffness and complexity: asphaltene dimer in
   toluene solvent, hydrated alanine dipeptide, miniprotein 1L2Y, and
   protein G. The GSFE accuracy and the OIN efficiency allowed us to
   enlarge outer time steps up to huge values of 1-4 ps while accurately
   reproducing conformational properties. Quasidynamics steered with
   3D-RISM-KH mean solvation forces achieves time scale compression of
   conformational changes coupled with solvent exchange, resulting in
   further significant acceleration of protein conformational sampling with
   respect to real time dynamics. Overall, this provided a 50- to 1000-fold
   effective speedup of conformational sampling for these systems, compared
   to conventional MD with explicit solvent. We have been able to fold the
   miniprotein from a fully denatured, extended state in about 60 ns of
   quasidynamics steered with 3D-RISM-KH mean solvation forces, compared to
   the average physical folding time of 4-9 mu s observed in experiment.}},

   PDE kernel augmented with the error analysis to establish the accuracy

Title = {{Fickian and Non-Fickian Diffusion in Heavy Oil plus Light Hydrocarbon
   Mixtures}},

Abstract = {{Diffusive mass transfer is expected to play a key role in existing and
   proposed solvent-added processes for heavy oil production.
   Compositiondistance profiles arising during free diffusion scale as a
   function of the joint variable (distance/time<\^{}>n(w)). Simple fluids
   are governed by Fickian diffusion, where n(w) = 0.5. For nanostructured
   fluids, the value of n(w) can be as low as n(w) = 0.25, known as the
   single-file limit, but more typically, the value for the exponent falls
   between these two limits and is composition-dependent. In this work,
   five published data sets, comprising free diffusion composition profiles
   for Athabasca bitumen fractions and for Cold Lake bitumen + light
   hydrocarbons obtained using diverse apparatus, are probed from this
   perspective. Additional experimental results are provided for Athabasca
   bitumen + toluene mixtures over the temperature range of 273-313 K, and
   results from positive and negative control experiments for two
   well-defined mixtures-(0.25 mass fraction carbon nanotubes + polybutene)
   + toluene, and polybutene + toluene-are also provided. The value of n(w)
   for the negative control experiment remains at 0.50 +/- 0.05 over the
   entire composition range, and for the positive control experiment, the
   value drops to n(w) = 0.30 +/- 0.02 at low toluene mass fraction.
   Although the quality of the diffusion profile data in the data sets
   analyzed is variable, the values of the exponent n(w) are shown to be
   light-hydrocarbon-dependent and increase from n(w) similar to 0.25 at
   low light-hydrocarbon mass fraction up to n(w) similar to 0.50 at high
   light-hydrocarbon mass fraction. Secondary convective effects are also
   noted in free diffusion experiment outcomes at long times. The
   industrial applications of these findings are currently being evaluated,
   but it is clear that the time for light hydrocarbons to penetrate a
   fixed distance into nano- and micro-structured hydrocarbon resources is
   greater than the value anticipated for unstructured fluids.}},

Abstract = {{Non-aqueous extraction of Alberta oil sands is of great interest to
   developing an alternative to the current hot-water extraction process to
   eliminate the tailing ponds. Investigations have been conducted to
   evaluate the performance of solvent mixtures to extract bitumen from a
   high-grade oil sands ore. Solvent mixtures of cycloalkane and n-alkanes
   were studied on the basis of their Hildebrand solubility parameters,
   which affect bitumen recovery and fine solids migration during the
   extraction process, and the results were compared to single solvents.
   Cyclohexane, cyclopentane, and methylcyclopentane were selected as the
   cycloalkane solvents, and they were studied in combination with n-alkane
   solvents, such as n-heptane, n-hexane, or n-pentane, to make up a final
   solubility parameter between 16.65 and 16.45 MPa1/2 for the final
   solvent mixture. It was observed that the solubility parameter of the
   solvent mixture has more impact on the migration of fine solids in
   bitumen than the recovery of bitumen. The amount of fine solids
   migrating into the bitumen product followed the order of
   cycloalkane/n-heptane > cycloalkane/n-hexane > cycloalkane/n-pentane.}},

Abstract = {{Modulation-encoded top orthogonal to bottom electrode (TOBE) capacitive
   micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) are proposed 2-D ultrasound
   transducer arrays that could allow 3-D images to be acquired in a single

   modulation-encoding scheme, columns are not only biased, but also
   modulated with a different frequency for each column. The modulation
   frequencies are higher than the pass-band of the CMUT membranes and mix
   nonlinearly in CMUT cells with acoustic signals to produce acoustic
   signal sidebands around the modulation carriers in the frequency domain.
   Thus, signals from elements along a row may be read out simultaneously
   via frequency-domain multiplexing. We present the theory and feasibility
   data behind modulation-encoded TOBE CMUTs. We also present experiments
   showing necessary modifications to the current TOBE design that would

Abstract = {{A pneumatic actuator with solenoid valves is a discontinuous-input
   system because each valve can be either in on or off state. For such an
   actuator, this paper proposes a sliding-mode control scheme that is
   based on an averaged continuous-input model of the discontinuous-input
   open-loop system. The averaged model is obtained from the nonlinear
   dynamics of the open-loop system undergoing pulse width modulation (PWM)
   at the input (i.e., valve open/close action). The PWM duty cycle will be
   regarded as a continuous input to the proposed averaged model, and thus
   generated by the proposed sliding-mode controller. For the sliding
   control design, we note that a pneumatic actuator has two chambers with
   a total of four ON/OFF valves. Thus, there are sixteen possible
   combinations for the valves' switching. Seven of these sixteen operating
   ``modes{''} are considered both functional and unique. The proposed
   sliding control utilizes and switches between these seven modes of the
   open-loop system in order to select the ones with necessary and
   sufficient amounts of drive energy. In comparing the new seven-mode
   controller to previous controllers, we will demonstrate reductions in
   the position tracking error and the number of switches made by the
   actuator's ON/OFF valves. The proposed control scheme is used in both
   position control of a pneumatic cylinder and bilateral control of a one
   degree of freedom teleoperation system. Experimental results are
   presented to validate our theoretical findings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and measurement of a single-layer
   micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-tunable reflective unit cell with
   orthogonally polarized dual bands for Ku-band mobile satellite

   cross-slotted patch tune its reflection phase at 12 GHz ( reception)
   with vertical polarization and 14 GHz ( transmission) with horizontal
   polarization. This unit cell provides four phase states with overall
   phase swing of 200 degrees and 180 degrees and average reflection
   amplitude of -0.79 and -0.69 dB at the lower and upper bands,
   respectively. This unit cell can be used for generation of an
   independently controlled beam at each of its operating bands. A

Title = {{Configuration and validation of a mesoscale atmospheric model for

Abstract = {{Extreme precipitation events in Central Alberta have overwhelmed
   hydraulic structures several times in recent years, and it is generally
   expected that rainfall intensity in this region will continue to
   increase over the next several decades. Accurate rainfall projections
   are thus needed to assess future flood risks and to mitigate the
   possible impacts of these changes. Such data may be obtained through the
   use of regional climate models (RCMs), and one in particular, the
   fifth-generation NCAR/Penn State mesoscale atmospheric model (MM5), is
   investigated here. MM5 is used to dynamically downscale European Centre
   for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data to
   evaluate its ability to accurately simulate rainfall in Central Alberta
   over two consecutive summers that represent contrasting precipitation
   regimes. It is determined that in complex terrain, different RCM
   preprocessing settings can result in vastly different input data which
   are used for the model simulation. After optimal preprocessing settings
   are identified, precipitation data from the resulting simulations are
   compared with data from Edmonton's local rain gauge network and a High
   Resolution Precipitation Product (HRPP), Climate Prediction Center (CPC)
   MORPHing technique (CMORPH). Precipitation data generated by MM5 reveal
   that this RCM can indeed distinguish between wet (2010) and dry (2009)
   years, but that simulated rainfall totals tend to be too high during May
   of both precipitation regimes, particularly during the dry year. This
   bias is partially attributed to the RCM's inaccurate simulation of
   available moisture in the presence of local terrain effects, and should
   be taken into consideration when making projections regarding possible
   changes to future precipitation conditions in Central Alberta and in
   other regions with similar climatology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the low-cyclic tensile responses of three-dimensional
   orthogonal woven composites based on the micro/meso-scale repetitive
   unit cells with elastic/viscoelastic models. The repetitive unit cell
   models for the resin impregnated fiber tows and the three-dimensional
   orthogonal woven composites at the fabric microstructure level were
   established. In the micro/meso-repetitive unit cells model, a nonlinear
   viscoelastic relationship with switch rule is introduced to characterize
   the mechanical behavior of the resin for the loading/unloading
   conditions. The fiber/fiber tows are characterized with linear elastic
   models. And damage initiation and postdamage constitutive models are
   also included for matrix/fiber and matrix impregnated fiber tows in the
   finite element analysis. The fatigue model with the mechanical
   parameters transferred from micro-scale to meso-scale model is
   numerically simulated with user-defined material subroutine and
   incorporated into commercial finite element software ABAQUS/Standard.
   The calculated results manifest the multiscale fatigue behaviors of
   three-dimensional orthogonal woven composites, such as the global
   stiffness degradation, decrease of peak stress, and even local damage
   behavior. The fatigue behaviors are also verified with the data in
   experimental and indicated that the model is an efficient strategy to
   predict the low-cyclic fatigue behaviors of polymer matrix composites.}},

Title = {{Residual liquids saturation development during two and three phase flow
   under gravity in square capillaries at different temperatures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{1-14}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study on heavy oil with air (two phase flow) and water
   and air (three phase flow) at different temperatures was carried out in
   square capillaries under gravity drainage conditions. Fluid retention
   characteristics (in the corners of capillaries) were determined and
   evaluated using the trapping number (N-T). In air-heavy oil systems,
   when N-T < 2.7E-2, the residual oil saturation (S-or) was constant and
   equal at 55 and 85 degrees C. The S-or was controlled by capillary
   forces regardless of viscous and gravity forces, including free fall
   gravity drainage (FFGD). For higher N-T, the S-or was a function of
   competition between gravity, viscous and capillary forces. The S-or was
   always higher at 85 degrees C compared to 55 degrees C for the same gas
   injection rate and the difference increased as the N-T augmented. FFGD
   experiments demonstrated that heavy oil retention depended on the Bond
   number and increased linearly as the Bond number increased.
   In the three phase systems (air-heavy oil-water) the oil retention did
   not diminish with the presence of water, which was also constant for the
   entire interval of N-T at 55 and 85 degrees C. High viscous forces
   originated from heavy oil were responsible for no change in the S-or.
   However, due to the water-wet nature of the capillary tubes, water was
   not completely swept. More S-or and residual water saturation were
   observed in air-water-heavy oil configuration, especially at 85 degrees
   C, due to the unfavorable viscosity ratio oil/water and the negative
   spreading coefficient of water in oil in the presence of air. Finally,
   the change of wettability from water wet to oil wet did not modify the
   S-or but the water saturation decreased slightly for air-heavy oil-water
   systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive model is proposed based on genetic algorithm to predict the
   characteristic map of aeroengine components. The difference functions,
   of the primary performance parameters between numerical model and test
   data, are taken as objective function. The coupled factors of component
   characteristics' map as optimized parameters are considered.The
   difference of the main performance parameters and process parameters
   between the adaptive model and the test data are shown to be within the
   range of 0.05\%.Meanwhile, the section's total temperature and pressure
   are controlled within 1\%. Furthermore, an aerongine fault diagnosis
   model is developed by the small deviation equation method in which the
   gas path analysis is implemented and the symptom and measuring
   parameters represent engine performance parameters' variation. It shows
   that the selection and relatively variable value of symptom parameter
   have great effect on fault diagnosis error; and the best selection of
   value is 1/3 of threshold The relative error of variable value between
   the symptom parameter of fault diagnosis model and the real fault can be
   found to be controlled within 5\% and it can do the correct evaluation
   of fault type. And the fault diagnosis model has no misdiagnosis in all
   the performed conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for designing fault-tolerant
   filters for linear discrete-time systems whose measurements undergo
   quantization. Two types of faults are considered: internal faults which
   are modelled by uncertainties in state space parameters; and actuator
   faults such as offset and stuck which are modelled as an unknown
   disturbance on the states. The proposed filter consists of two robust
   filters which operate in two different zones. These zones are defined
   based on the effects of the quantization on the residual signal between
   the quantized measurement and the one generated by the filter. Using an
   LMI-based approach with prescribed H-infinity, performance, stability
   LMIs are derived for the proposed dual-zone filter and finally the
   results are validated through simulation examples. (C) 2015 The Franklin

Title = {{Model molecules mimicking asphaltenes}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Asphalthenes are typically defined as the fraction of petroleum
   insoluble in n-alkanes (typically heptane, but also hexane or pentane)
   but soluble in toluene. This fraction causes problems of emulsion
   formation and deposition/precipitation during crude oil production,
   processing and transport. From the definition it follows that
   asphaltenes are not a homogeneous fraction but is composed of molecules
   polydisperse in molecular weight, structure and functionalities. Their
   complexity makes the understanding of their properties difficult. Proper
   model molecules with well-defined structures which can resemble the
   properties of real asphaltenes can help to improve this understanding.
   Over the last ten years different research groups have proposed
   different asphaltene model molecules and studied them to determine how
   well they can mimic the properties of asphaltenes and determine the
   mechanisms behind the properties of asphaltenes.
   This article reviews the properties of the different classes of model
   compounds proposed and present their properties by comparison with
   fractionated asphaltenes. After presenting the interest of developing
   model asphaltenes, the composition and properties of asphaltenes are
   presented, followed by the presentation of approaches and
   accomplishments of different schools working on asphaltene model
   compounds. The presentation of bulk and interfacial properties of
   perylene-based model asphaltene compounds developed by Sjoblom et al. is
   the subject of the next part. Finally the emulsion-stabilization
   properties of fractionated asphaltenes and model asphaltene compounds is
   presented and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Compression behavior of tire-derived aggregate (TDA) was investigated
   through relatively small-scale and large-scale laboratory
   one-dimensional compression tests, as well as a full-scale field test.
   Two types of TDA produced from passenger and light truck tire (PLTT) and
   off-the-road (OTR) tire were tested. The influence of initial void ratio
   (e(0)), particle size, tire source, and testing method on the
   compression behavior of TDA was investigated. The results indicated that
   the compressibility of TDA was primarily dominated by its e(0). OTR
   yielded lower e(0) than PLTT with similar particle size and the same
   compaction method. TDA in the field was pre-compressed by self-weight,
   resulting in lower e(0) and compressibility compared with laboratory
   samples. At relatively high stress levels, all TDA exhibited similar
   void ratio-stress curves regardless of e(0), particle size, tire source
   or testing method. High e(0), small particle size, and granular particle
   shape facilitated the sliding and rolling of TDA particles, resulting in
   high plastic strain. The elastic deformation of TDA, reflecting the
   elastic behavior of tire rubber, was primarily dominated by the average
   contact area ratio of the TDA particles, depending mainly on the sample
   void ratio.}},

Abstract = {{One of the common methods to reduce mercury vapor emissions from
   coal-fired power plants involves the injection of powdered activated
   carbon (PAC) into the flue gases to adsorb the mercury vapor. If the PAC
   then settles along with the fly ash in the electrostatic precipitator,
   the ability to use the collected fly ash as a supplementary cementitious
   admixture in concrete must be established. This study examined the
   influence of PAC in fly ash on the air void networks and consequent
   properties of concrete produced with an air entraining admixture.
   Samples included those with PAC added to the fly ash at the laboratory
   as well as PAC-containing fly ash collected at a generating station. The
   air void content, specific surface area and spacing factor of hardened
   concrete were determined using an image analysis technique on
   epoxy-impregnated and ink-prepared samples. The PAC-containing fly ash
   had an insignificant effect on the air void content and spacing factor
   compared to samples with laboratory-added PAC. Image analysis using
   ink-prepared samples provided improved reliability of the air void
   network results compared to epoxy-prepared samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Effect of supercooling and cell volume on intracellular ice formation}},
Journal = {{CRYOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{156-163}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Intracellular ice formation (IF) has been linked to death of cells
   cryopreserved in suspension. It has been assumed that cells can be
   supercooled by 2 to 10 degrees C before IIF occurs, but measurements of
   the degree of supercooling that cells can tolerate are often confounded
   by changing extracellular temperature and solutions of different
   osmolality (which affect the cell volume). The purpose of this study was
   to examine how the incidence of IIF in the absence of cryoprotectants is
   affected by the degree of supercooling and cell volume. Human umbilical
   vein endothelial cells were suspended in isotonic (300 mOsm) and
   hypertonic (-600 to 700 mOsm) solutions and exposed to supercooling
   ranging from 2 to 10 degrees C before extracellular ice was nucleated.
   The number of cells undergoing IIF was examined in a cryostage (based on
   the darkening of cells upon intracellular freezing ({''}flashing{''}))
   as a function of the degree of supercooling, and cell survival post-thaw
   was assessed using a membrane integrity assay. We found that while the
   incidence of IIF increased with supercooling in both isotonic and
   hypertonic solutions, it was higher in the isotonic solution at any
   given degree of supercooling. Since cells in hypertonic solution were
   shrunken due to water efflux, we hypothesized that the difference in IIF
   behavior could be attributed to the decreased volume of cells in the
   hypertonic solution. Our results confirm that cells with a smaller
   diameter before extracellular ice nucleation have a decreased
   probability of IIF and suggest that cell volume could play a more
   significant role in the incidence of IIF than the extracellular ice
   nucleation temperature. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A 40 Gb/s serial link interface is presented that includes four lanes of
   transceiver optimized for chip-to-chip communication while compensating
   for 20 dB of channel loss. Transmit equalization consists of a 2-tap
   feed-forward equalizer (FFE) while receive equalization includes a 2-tap
   FFE using a transversal filter, a 3-stage continuous-time linear
   equalizer with active feedback, and discrete-time equalizers consisting
   of a 17-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a 3-tap sampled FFE.
   The receiver uses quarter-rate double integrate-and-hold sampling. The
   clock and data recovery (CDR) unit uses a split-path CDR/DFE design
   which facilitates wider bandwidth and lower jitter simultaneously. A
   phase detection scheme that filters out edges affected by residual
   inter-symbol interference allows recovering a low-jitter clock from a
   partially-equalized eye. A fractional-N PLL is implemented for frequency
   offset tracking. Combining these techniques, the digital CDR recovers a
   stable 10 GHz clock from an eye containing 0.8 UIp-p input jitter and
   achieves 1-10 MHz of tracking bandwidth. The transceiver achieves
   horizontal and vertical eye openings of 0.27 UI and 120 mV,
   respectively, at BER = 10(-9). The quad SerDes is realized in 28 nm CMOS
   technology. Amortizing common blocks, it occupies 0.81 mm(2) per lane
   and achieves 23.2 mW/Gb/s power efficiency at 40 Gb/s.}},

   efficiently convert RF signals to DC voltages utilizing auxiliary

   harvested power and the output voltage and increases the threshold
   voltage of the reverse-biased transistors to reduce the leakage current
   to prevent the loss of previously stored energy. A 12-stage adaptive
   threshold-compensated rectifier is designed and implemented in IBM's
   0.13 mu m CMOS technology. The proposed rectifier exhibits measured

   NP-complete. We propose a green energy and content-aware data

Abstract = {{In this Letter, reflection-mode optical resolution photoacoustic
   microscopy (OR-PAM) using glancing angle-deposited (GLAD) nanostructured
   Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPI) for in vivo applications is reported.
   GLAD is a single-step physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique used to
   fabricate porous nanostructured thin films. Using titanium dioxide, a
   transparent semiconductor with a high refractive index (n = 2.4), the
   GLAD technique can be employed to fabricate samples with tailored
   nano-porosity, refractive index periodicities, and high Q-factor
   reflectance spectra. The OR-PAM in vivo images of chorioallantoic
   membrane (CAM) of 5-day chicken embryo model are demonstrated. The
   phantom study shows lateral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio better
   than 7 mu m and 35 dB, respectively. The sensitive GLAD FPI allows
   photoacoustic imaging down to a few-nJ pulse energy. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first time that a FPI-based reflection mode
   optical resolution photoacoustic imaging technique is demonstrated for
   in vivo applications. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the recovery and

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{189-199}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{A model - FUNNEL-GHG-OS (FUNdamental ENgineering PrinciplEs-based ModeL
   for Estimation of Green-House Gases in the Oil Sands) was developed to
   estimate project-specific energy consumption and greenhouse gas
   emissions (GHGs) in major recovery and extraction processes in the oil
   sands, namely surface mining and in situ production. This model
   estimates consumption of diesel (4.4-7.1 MJ/GJ of bitumen), natural gas
   (52.7-86.4 MJ/GJ of bitumen) and electricity (1.8-2.1 kW h/GJ of
   bitumen) as fuels in surface mining. The model also estimates the
   consumption of natural gas (123-462.7 MJ/GJ of bitumen) and electricity
   (1.2-3.5 kW h/GJ of bitumen) in steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD),
   based on fundamental engineering principles. Cogeneration in the oil
   sands, with excess electricity exported to Alberta's grid, was also
   explored. Natural gas consumption forms a major portion of the total
   energy consumption in surface mining and SAGD and thus is a main
   contributor to GHG emissions. Emissions in surface mining and SAGD range
   from 4.4 to 7.4 gCO(2)eq/MJ of bitumen and 8.0 to 34.0 gCO(2)eq/MJ of
   bitumen, respectively, representing a wide range of variability in oil
   sands projects. Depending upon the cogeneration technology and the
   efficiency of the process, emissions in oil sands recovery and
   extraction can be reduced by 16-25\% in surface mining and 33-48\% in
   SAGE). Further, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the
   effects of key parameters on the GHG emissions in surface mining and
   SAGD. Temperature and the consumption of warm water in surface mining
   and the steam-to-oil ratio (SOR) in SAGD are major parameters affecting
   GHG emissions. The developed model can predict the energy consumption
   and emissions for surface mining and SAGD for oil sands. (C) 2015

Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1477-1488}},

Abstract = {{The burning characteristics and thermal-flow structures within
   laboratory-scale pool fires have previously been shown to be dependent
   on the pool's bottom temperature and the pool wall material. Relatively
   unexplored are the effects of the thickness of liquid fuel in the pool
   without ullage. These effects are explored experimental here using a 90
   mm diameter quartz pool burning methanol in a quiescent environment for
   a range of bottom boundary temperature (i.e., -4 degrees C to 50 degrees
   C). Three pools with fuel depth of 6, 12 and 18 mm were examined in
   terms of overall burning rate, flame height, and cross-sectional maps of
   mean temperature and in-plane 2-D velocity. It was shown that the
   burning rate and flame height for a specified pool bottom temperature
   increased with increasing pool depth, and shallower pools were more
   sensitive to pool bottom boundary temperature. Generally, the pool
   showed a distinct two-layer thermal structure with a near uniform upper
   layer, and a lower layer with a non-linear temperature gradient. The
   uniform layer was coincidental with a pair of standing counter-rotating
   vortices keeping this fluid well-mixed, while the lower layer had only a
   slow upward velocity associated with maintaining the liquid level. For
   the deepest pool, the thicknesses of the well-mixed and lower layers
   were essentially fixed, and the investigation showed that its velocity
   and non-dimensional temperature structures were independent of the
   bottom temperature. This independence was used to identify a regime of
   thick-pools, which allow the liquid to be modeled with relative
   simplicity. For shallow pools (i.e., thin-pools), the thicknesses of
   these layers were dependent on the bottom temperature. Mechanisms for
   this behavior were proposed. Lastly, an energy analysis of the liquid
   beneath the well-mixed layer was able to explain the non-linear
   temperature profiles in that region as being a combination of vertical
   conduction and advection energy transfer. (C) 2014 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Stray voltages have always been a concern to utility companies and
   customers. But methods to troubleshoot and monitor nonroutine stray
   voltage problems are very limited. This paper presents a passive,
   measurement-based method to identify the contributors to the common
   cause of stray voltages, the neutral-to-earth voltage (NEV) rise at the
   service entrance point. The paper shows that the NEV can be decoupled
   into two components: those related to the customer under investigation
   and those outside the customer facility. A method to quantify the
   relative contributions of the two components is proposed. A new concept
   called current return ratio is introduced to facilitate the decoupling
   and to quantify the grounding conditions of the system. This paper
   presents the background, circuit model, concept, and theory of the

Abstract = {{Anatomic placement of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) grafts at
   arthroscopic reconstruction can be challenging. Localising ACL
   attachments on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences
   pre-operatively could aid with planning for anatomic graft placement.
   Though ACL attachments can be identified on two-dimensional (2D) MRI,
   slice thickness theoretically limits out-of-plane accuracy and a 3D MRI
   base sequence with smaller isotropic voxels may improve observer
   reliability in localising ACL attachment locations. The purpose of this
   study was to test whether a high-resolution 3D sequence improved inter-
   and intra-observer reliability of ACL attachment localisation compared
   with conventional 2D MRI for this application.
   Twenty paediatric knees were retrospectively scanned at 1.5 Tesla with
   multi-planar 2D proton density (slice thickness 3-4 mm) and T2-weighted
   3D multiple-echo data image combination gradient echo (isotropic 0.8 mm
   voxels) sequences. Two observers blinded to each others' findings
   identified ACL attachments on MRI slices, and 3D reconstructions showing
   ACL attachments were produced. ACL attachment centre locations and areas
   were calculated, and reliability assessed.
   Inter-observer variation of centre locations of ACL attachments
   identified on 3D versus 2D sequences was not significantly different
   (mean +/- A SD): 1.8 +/- A 0.6 versus 1.5 +/- A 0.7 mm at femoral
   attachments, 1.7 +/- A 0.7 versus 1.5 +/- A 0.8 mm at tibial attachments
   (p > 0.05). The 95 \% confidence interval for centre locations was < 4.0
   mm in all cases. Inter-observer reliability of attachment areas was not
   higher for 3D sequences.
   ACL attachment centres were localised with high and similar inter- and
   intra-observer reliability on a high-resolution 3D and multi-planar
   conventional 2D sequences. Using this technique, MRI could potentially
   be used for planning and intra-operative guidance of anatomic ACL
   reconstruction, whether from 2D or 3D base sequences. Surgeons in
   clinical practice need not order a lengthy dedicated 3D MRI to localise
   ligament attachments, but can confidently use a standard 2D MRI for this
   application.

Title = {{Monitoring for idiopathic scoliosis curve progression using surface
   topography asymmetry analysis of the torso in adolescents}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{743-751}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: At first visit and each clinical follow-up session,
   patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) undergo radiographic
   examination, from which the Cobb angle is measured. The cumulative
   exposure to X-ray radiation justifies efforts in developing noninvasive
   methods for scoliosis monitoring.
   PURPOSE: To determine the capability of the three-dimensional markerless
   surface topography (ST) asymmetry analysis to detect >= 5 degrees
   progression in the spinal curvature in patients with AIS over 1-year
   follow-up interval.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Cross-sectional study in a specialized scoliosis
   clinic.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: In this study, baseline and 1-year follow-up full torso
   ST scans of 100 patients with AIS were analyzed using three-dimensional
   markerless asymmetry analysis.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients with Delta Cobb >= 5 degrees and Delta Cobb<5
   degrees were categorized into progression and nonprogression groups,
   respectively.
   METHODS: The ST scan of each full torso was analyzed to calculate the
   best plane of symmetry by minimizing the distances between the torso and
   its reflection about the plane of symmetry. Distance between the torso
   and its reflection was measured and displayed as deviation color maps.
   The difference of ST measurements between two successive acquisitions
   was used to determine if the scoliosis has progressed at least 5 degrees
   or not. The classification tree technique was implemented using the
   local deformity of the torso in the thoracic-thoracolumbar (T-TL) and
   lumbar (L) regions to categorize curves into progression and
   nonprogression groups. The change in maximum deviation and root mean
   square of the deviations in the torso were the parameters effective in
   capturing the curve progression. Funding for this research is provided
   by the Scoliosis Research Society, and Women and Children's Health
   Research Institute.
   RESULTS: The classification model detected 85.7\% of the progression and
   71.6\% of the nonprogression cases. The resulting false-negative rate of
   4\% for T-TL curves, representing the proportion of undetected
   progressions, confirmed that the technique shows promise to monitor the
   progression of T-TL scoliosis curves. Although 100\% L curves with
   progression were detected using the deviation color maps of the torsos,
   because of the small number of analyzed L curves, further research is
   needed before the efficiency of the method in capturing the L curves
   with progression is confirmed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using the developed classification tree for the patients
   analyzed in this study, 43\% of nonprogression cases between two visits
   would not have to undergo an X-ray examination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Two 10 L completely mixed reactors operating at 37 degrees C and 20 days
   SRT were used to evaluate the relationships between reactor performance
   and microbial community dynamics during anaerobic co-digestion of
   biodiesel waste glycerin (BWG) with municipal wastewater sludge (MWS).
   The addition of up to 1.35\% (v/v) BWG to reactor feeds yielded
   increased VS and COD removal together with enhanced the biogas
   production and methane yield. This represented 50\% of the MWS feed COD.
   Pyrosequencing analysis showed Methanosaeta (acetoclastic) and
   Methanomicrobium (hydrogenotrophic) to be the methanogenic genera
   present in greatest diversity during stable reactor operation.
   Methanosaeta sequences predominated at the lowest BWG loading while
   those of Methanomicrobium were present in greatest abundance at the
   higher BWG loadings. Genus Candidatus cloacamonas was present in the
   greatest number of bacterial sequences at all loadings. Alkalinity, pH,
   biogas production and methane yield declined and VFA concentrations
   (especially propionate) increased during the highest BWG loading. (c)

Abstract = {{Biological fixation of CO2 using microalgae is a potential CO2 reduction
   strategy which can be applied to the oil sands operations in Alberta.
   These operations also produce large amounts of oil sands process water

   study, three different microalgae: Botryococcus braunii, Chlorella
   pyrenoidosa and Chlorella kessleri were investigated for their ability
   to grow in OSPW, and to uptake CO2. Also, the effect of phosphate,
   nitrate, CO2 concentrations and light intensity were studied using a
   fractional two-level and a full two-level factorial design. These
   investigations eliminated Botryococcus braunii as it cannot grow in
   OSPW, and demonstrated that Chlorella kessleri has a higher CO2 uptake
   rate than Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Moreover, CO2 concentration, light
   intensity and phosphate concentration proved to have the strongest
   effects (in that order) on the growth and CO2 uptake rate of Chlorella

Abstract = {{During solvent-based heavy-oil and bitumen recovery processes, viscosity
   reduction occurs through dilution of oil by mixing process. However,
   asphaltene precipitation may take place, eventually resulting in organic
   deposition (maltenes and asphaltenes) in the reservoir causing a
   reduction in permeability through pore plugging and unfavourable
   wettability reversal. In this paper, two identical porous media
   (unconsolidated glass bead packs) with significant contrast in
   wettability were used to investigate these phenomena. The oil-wet and
   water-wet glass bead models were exposed to constant rate solvent
   injection (propane, n-hexane, n-decane, and distillate hydrocarbon). The
   thickness of the multilayer organic deposition was determined using
   focused ion beam (FIB/SEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Three
   points from the models were analyzed to determine the level of
   asphaltene deposition and oil trapping (maltenes) on the surface of the
   glass beads and pore spaces. The results showed that the asphaltene
   migrated through the glass bead pack model. As a consequence, asphaltene
   deposition was observed at the middle and bottom points of the
   vertically situated glass bead packs with an injection point at the top,
   in addition to accumulated oil trapping at the production (bottom) end.
   Moreover, elemental mapping from the organic deposition visualization
   was conducted using the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis.
   Heteroatom elements were found in the sample along with carbon and iron

Abstract = {{Inexact (or approximate) computing is an attractive paradigm for digital
   processing at nanometric scales. Inexact computing is particularly
   interesting for computer arithmetic designs. This paper deals with the
   analysis and design of two new approximate 4-2 compressors for
   utilization in a multiplier. These designs rely on different features of
   compression, such that imprecision in computation (as measured by the
   error rate and the so-called normalized error distance) can meet with
   respect to circuit-based figures of merit of a design (number of
   transistors, delay and power consumption). Four different schemes for
   utilizing the proposed approximate compressors are proposed and analyzed
   for a Dadda multiplier. Extensive simulation results are provided and an
   application of the approximate multipliers to image processing is
   presented. The results show that the proposed designs accomplish
   significant reductions in power dissipation, delay and transistor count
   compared to an exact design; moreover, two of the proposed multiplier
   designs provide excellent capabilities for image multiplication with
   respect to average normalized error distance and peak signal-to-noise
   ratio (more than 50 dB for the considered image examples).}},

   advances in high-level synthesis tools, which provides an optimized and
   straightforward implementation. The proposed emulator has been applied
   to an induction heating (IH) appliance as an example of efficient and
   environmentally friendly appliances with a major economic and social
   impact. The obtained results are compared with classical offline
   simulation and experimental measurements, proving that the proposed
   emulator achieves the required accuracy for the IH application. As a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Based on previously developed monitoring system comprising three
   microfluorescent silica detectors, this paper proposed an improved
   real-time fluence monitoring method for running ultraviolet (UV)
   reactors. Adoption of this new method would significantly decrease the
   number of biodosimetry tests while increase the monitoring accuracy. The
   method constants were first determined by biodosimetry; thereafter, a
   long-term (about 16 months) experiment was conducted to evaluate the
   continuous performance of the proposed method under simulated practical
   conditions. The results indicate that the daily average fluence dropped
   gradually from 248 to 30 mJ/cm(2) over the whole operational period,
   which arose principally from the lamp output attenuation and serious
   sleeve fouling. Furthermore, the real-time monitoring data of 1
   representative week were analyzed, which could provide useful
   instructions for the operation and maintenance of UV facilities. This
   paper demonstrates that the proposed method could monitor well the
   real-time fluence with a low cost but a high accuracy. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{Trilateral haptic systems can be modeled as three-port networks.
   Analysis of coupled stability of a three-port network can be
   accomplished in either the passivity or the absolute stability
   frameworks assuming all three ports are connected to passive but

   results in terms of extending Raisbecks passivity criterion and
   Llewellyns absolute stability criterion to general three-port networks -
   both criteria are founded on the properties of a positive-real Hermitian
   matrix. Next, we show that the absolute stability criterion is less
   conservative than the passivity criterion. Then, to show how the two
   criteria may be utilized at the system design stage, we apply them to
   the problem of designing controllers for a dual-user haptic
   teleoperation system and a triple-user collaborative haptic virtual
   environment. Using the two criteria, controllers are then designed and
   compared in terms of conservatism in simulations and experiments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the stabilization efficacy of alkali-activated
   ground-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) for a marine soft clay,
   compared with that of portland cement (PC). The influence of activators,
   including NaOH, Na2CO3, carbide slag (CS), NaOH-CS, Na2CO3-CS, and
   Na2SO4-CS, on the stabilization efficacy was investigated. A range of
   tests were conducted to investigate the properties of stabilized clays,
   including unconfined compressive strength (UCS), X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mercury intrusion
   porosimetry (MIP). The results indicated that Na2CO3-GGBS had no
   stabilization efficacy for this marine soft clay. NaOH-GGBS-stabilized
   clay yielded the highest UCS at 7, 28, and 90 days; however, the UCS
   decreased from 90 to 180 days because of the microcracking.
   CS-GGBS-stabilized clay had higher 90-day and 180-day UCS than that of
   PC-stabilized clay, but significantly lower 7-day and 28-day UCS. NaOH,
   Na2CO3, and Na(2)SO(4)could enhance the strength development rate of
   CS-GGBS-stabilized clay. However, the UCS of NaOH-CS-GGBS and
   Na2CO3-CS-GGBS-stabilized clays decreased from 90 to 180 days as well.
   Na2SO4-CS-GGBS was found to be the optimum binder for this marine soft
   clay, yielding at least twice higher UCS than that of PC stabilized clay
   at any age studied. Considerable ettringite was produced in the
   Na2SO4-CS-GGBS stabilized clay, which contributed to the enhanced
   strength. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Behavior of Steel Shear Connections under Column-Removal Demands}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An understanding of the behavior of shear connections in steel gravity
   frames under the unique combinations of moment, shear, and axial force
   relevant to extreme loading conditions is necessary to assess the
   vulnerability of a structure to disproportionate collapse. However, such
   an understanding is currently limited by a deficiency of physical test
   data. To investigate the inherent robustness of commonly used steel
   shear connections, an experimental program consisting of 35 full-scale
   physical tests was completed. Specimens included shear-tab,
   welded-bolted single-angle, bolted-bolted single-angle, and
   bolted-bolted double-angle connections. A testing procedure was
   developed that imposed on a connection the force and deformation demands
   that would be expected in the bays immediately adjacent to a compromised
   column in a symmetrical multibay frame. Various geometric arrangements
   of each connection type were tested, and each arrangement was subjected
   to a range of loading histories representing different column-removal
   scenarios. The test results characterize the load-development history,
   deformation mechanisms, and expected failure modes following column
   removal for each type of connection. Connection strength and ductility
   limits under the effects of this unique type of combined loading are
   quantified. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Based on decision-theoretic rough set model of three-way decisions, we
   augment the existing model by introducing linguistic terms. Considering
   the two types of parameters being used in the three-way decisions with
   linguistic assessment, a certain type of novel three-way decisions based
   on the Bayesian decision procedure is constructed. In this way,
   three-way decisions with decision-theoretic rough sets are extended to
   the qualitative environment. With the aid of multi-attribute group
   decision making, the values of these parameters are determined. An
   adaptive algorithm supporting consistency improvement of multi-attribute
   group decision making is designed. Then, we optimize the scales of the
   linguistic terms with the use of particle swarm optimization. The values
   of these parameters of three-way decisions are aggregated when
   proceeding with group decision making. Finally, the proposed model of
   three-way decisions with linguistic assessment is applied to the

Abstract = {{Chemical and physical analyses are commonly used as screening methods
   for the environmental water. However, these methods can only look for
   the targeted substance but may miss unexpected toxicants. Furthermore,
   the synergistic effects of mixture cannot be detected. In order to set
   up the assay criteria for determining various biological activities at a
   cellular level that could potentially lead to toxicity of environmental
   water samples, a novel test based on cellular response by using
   Real-Time Cellular Analyzer (RTCA) is proposed in this study. First, the
   water sample is diluted to a series of strengths (80\%, 60\%, 40\%,
   30\%, 20\% and 10\%) to get the multi-concentration cellular response
   profile. Then, the area under the cellular response profile (AUCRP) is
   calculated. Comparing to the normal cell growth of negative control, a
   new biological activity index named Percentage of Effect (PoE) has been
   presented which reflects the cumulative inhibitory activity of cell
   growth over the log-phase. Finally, a synthetical index PoE50 is
   proposed to evaluate the intensity of biological activities in water
   samples. The biological experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) released into oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW) during bitumen processing in Northern Alberta are problematic for
   oil sands industries due to their toxicity in the environment and
   resistance to degradation during conventional wastewater treatment
   processes. Granular activated carbon (GAC) has shown to be an effective
   media in removing biopersistent organics from wastewater using a
   combination of adsorption and biodegradation removal mechanisms. A
   simultaneous GAC (0.4 g GAC/L) adsorption and biodegradation (combined
   treatment) study was used for the treatment of raw and ozonated OSPW.
   After 28 days of batch treatment, classical and oxidized NAs removals
   for raw OSPW were 93.3\% and 73.7\%, and for ozonated OSPW were 96.2\%
   and 77.1\%, respectively. Synergetic effects of the combined treatment
   process were observed in removals of COD, the acid extractable fraction,
   and oxidized NAs, which indicated enhanced biodegradation and
   bioregeneration in GAC biofilms. A bacteria copy number >10(8) copies/g
   GAC on GAC surfaces was found using quantitative real time polymerase
   chain reaction after treatment for both raw and ozonated OSPW. A
   Microtox (R) acute toxicity test (Vibrio fischeri) showed effective
   toxicity removal (>95.3\%) for the combined treatments. Therefore, the
   simultaneous GAC adsorption and biodegradation treatment process is a
   promising technology for the elimination of toxic OSPW NAs. (C) 2015

   treatments including general zonation, and ozone with carbonate,
   tert-butyl-alcohol, carbonate/tert-butyl-alcohol, tetranitromethane, or
   iron. Hierarchal clustering analysis showed that samples clustered based
   on sampling time and principal component analysis corroborated these
   results while also providing information on significant markers
   responsible for the clustering. Some markers were uniquely present in
   certain treatment conditions, while others showed variable behaviors in
   two or more treatments due to the presence of scavengers/catalysts. This
   advanced approach to monitoring significant changes of markers by using
   multivariate analysis can be invaluable for future work on OSPW

Abstract = {{We assessed the future irrigation demand of the South Saskatchewan River
   Basin (SSRB) of Alberta subjected to combined impact of climate change
   and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) using the Irrigation District
   Model (IDM) of Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development. Based on the
   agro-climatic data of SSRB of 1928-1995, the potential impact of climate
   change on SSRB's irrigation water demand for three future periods, i.e.,
   2010-2039 (2020s), 2040-2069 (2050s), 2070-2099 (2080s) are simulated by
   IDM on the basis of Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) climate
   scenarios projected by four General Circulation Models (GCMs) of
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The combined impact on
   SSRB's irrigation water demand is also simulated on the basis of SRES
   climate scenarios together with an active El Nino or La Nina in the
   2050s. If only the potential impact of climate change is considered,
   IDM's simulations for 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s show a general increasing
   trend in the irrigation demand in the 21st century for both the
   irrigation districts and the private irrigation blocks. On the average,
   water demands for the irrigation districts and private irrigation blocks
   are expected to increase by 7\% and 11\% in the 2020s, 12\% and 17\% in
   the 2050s, and 13\% and 18\% in the 2080s, respectively. While
   considering the combined impact for the 2050s, a further 7\% decrease
   (1\% increase) in the irrigation demand is projected under an active El
   Nino (La Nina) episode.}},

Abstract = {{This work is devoted to the three-dimensional numerical investigation of
   a chemical reacting porous carbon particle moving in a hot O-2/CO2 gas.
   The porous particle was represented by an agglomerate of small
   monodisperse spherical particles distributed inside a sphere. The
   ambient temperature was systematically varied in a range between 1200
   and 2500 K. To solve the Navier-Stokes equations for the flow field
   coupled with the energy and species conservation equations, a finite
   volume solver was applied. In addition to the solid carbon the model
   incorporates six gaseous chemical species (O-2, CO, CO2, H-2, H2O, and
   N-2). The reaction mechanism includes semi-global carbon monoxide
   oxidation, the forward and backward water-gas-shift reaction, and four
   heterogeneous reactions. The ambient medium was assumed to be nearly
   dry. The main objective of this work was to understand the char
   conversion processes inside a porous carbon particle. In particular, the
   change of regimes depending on the ambient gas temperature and the
   influence of the flow velocity on the processes inside the porous
   particle were studied in detail. As a reference case the oxidation of a
   solid non-permeable sphere moving in a hot O-2/CO2 gas was considered,
   and the results for the porous particle are discussed and compared
   against the reference case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The porous structures of KOH-activated multi-wall carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) were studied over a wide range of activation conditions,
   through which the pore-forming mechanisms of the activated MWCNTs were
   elucidated. It was found that micropores (<2 nm) were developed by KOH-C
   redox reaction on the walls of MWCNTs, causing the formation of a
   characteristic peak of micropores at 0.8 nm. More importantly, the
   in-depth activation was found to transversely section the nanotubes,
   which led to the release of the catalyst particles and the formation of
   mesopores. The understanding of the pore-forming mechanisms of the
   activated MWCNTs also provided a good platform to investigate the effect
   of absorbent's pore structures on its CO2 capture behavior. It was
   further demonstrated in this study that the micropores having pore sizes
   less than 1 nm played a significant role in the physic-sorption of CO2
   molecules. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mapping stresses in high aspect ratio polysilicon electrical
   through-wafer interconnects}},

Abstract = {{Electrical through-wafer interconnect technologies such as vertical
   through-silicon vias (TSVs) are essential in order to maximize
   performance, optimize usage of wafer real estate, and enable
   three-dimensional packaging in leading edge electronic and
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) products. Although copper TSVs
   have the advantage of low resistance, highly doped polysilicon TSVs
   offer designers a much larger range of processing options due to the
   compatibility of polysilicon with high temperatures and also with the
   full range of traditional CMOS processes. Large stresses are associated
   with both Cu and polysilicon TSVs, and their accurate measurement is
   critical for determining the keep-out zone (KOZ) of transistors and for
   optimizing downstream processes to maintain high yield. This report
   presents the fabrication and stress characterization of 400-mu m deep,
   20-Omega resistance, high aspect ratio (25: 1) polysilicon TSVs
   fabricated by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) followed by low- pressure
   chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) of polysilicon with in-situ boron
   doping. Micro-Raman imaging of the wafer surface showed a maximum stress
   of 1.2 GPa occurring at the TSV edge and a KOZ of similar to 9 to 11 mu
   m. For polysilicon TSVs, the stress distribution in the TSVs far from
   the wafer surface(s) was not previously well- understood due to
   measurement limitations. Raman spectroscopy was able to overcome this
   limitation; a TSV cross section was examined and stresses as a function
   of both depth and width of the TSVs were collected and are analyzed
   herein. An 1100 degrees C postanneal was found to reduce average
   stresses by 40\%. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2944-2959}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, Sn films were electrodeposited from a slightly acidic
   electrolyte onto pure Cu substrates and aged at room temperature. Tin
   whiskers were observed after about 20 days. Transmission electron
   microscopy observations of foils prepared by focused ion beam methods
   revealed the following distribution of the Cu6Sn5 intermetallic phase:
   the largest grains were present at the Sn/Cu interface (typically
   several microns or larger in size); the next largest grains were located
   along the grain boundaries between as-deposited Sn grains and between
   whiskers and as-deposited Sn grains (200-500 nm in size); the finest
   grains (< 70 nm in size) precipitated within Sn grains. Precipitate-free
   zones (PFZs) were also observed in the vicinity of grain boundaries. The
   precipitates along grain boundaries between as-deposited Sn grains had a
   triangular or wedge shape with their long dimension parallel to the
   boundaries and tips along the whisker growth direction. The finest
   precipitates hardened the grains, making them less susceptible to
   deformation. The mechanism and necessary conditions for whisker growth
   are discussed. It is suggested that the whiskers grow through the
   movement of PFZs.}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Properties of metals are fundamentally determined by their electron
   behavior, which is largely reflected by the electron work function
   (phi). Recent studies have demonstrated that many properties of metallic
   materials are directly related to phi, which may provide a simple but
   fundamental parameter for material design. Since material properties are
   affected by temperature, in this article a simple model is proposed to
   correlate the work function with temperature, expressed as phi(T) =
   phi(0) - gamma (k(B)T)(2)/phi(0), where gamma varies with the crystal
   structure. This phi - T relationship helps determine and explain the
   dependence of metal properties on temperature on a feasible electronic
   base. As a sample application, the established relationship is applied
   to determine the dependence of the Young's modulus of metals on
   temperature. The proposed relationship is consistent with experimental
   observations. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, we address the regression problem on set-valued samples
   that appear in applications. To solve this problem, we propose a support
   vector regression approach for set-valued samples that generalizes the
   classical a-support vector regression. First, an initial representative
   point (or an element) for every set-valued sample is selected, and a
   weighted distance between the initial representative point and other
   points is determined. Second, based on the classification consistency
   principle, a search algorithm to determine the best representative point
   for every set-valued datum is designed. Thus, the set-valued samples are
   converted into numeric samples. Finally, a support vector regression
   that is based on set-valued data is constructed, and the regression
   results of the set-valued samples can be approximated using the method
   used for the numeric samples. Furthermore, the feasibility and
   efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using experiments with
   real-world examples concerning wind speed prediction and the prediction
   of peak particle velocity. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{A novel PKD2L1 C-terminal domain critical for trimerization and channel

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{As a transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily member, polycystic
   kidney disease 2-like-1 (PKD2L1) is also called TRPP3 and has similar
   membrane topology as voltage-gated cation channels. PKD2L1 is involved
   in hedgehog signaling, intestinal development, and sour tasting. PKD2L1
   and PKD1L3 form heterotetramers with 351 stoichiometry. C-terminal
   coiled-coil-2 (CC2) domain (G699-W743) of PKD2L1 was reported to be
   important for its trimerization but independent studies showed that CC2
   does not affect PKD2L1 channel function. It thus remains unclear how
   PKD2L1 proteins oligomerize into a functional channel. By SDS-PAGE, blue
   native PAGE and mutagenesis we here identified a novel C-terminal domain
   called C1 (K575-T622) involved in stronger homotrimerization than the
   non-overlapping CC2, and found that the PKD2L1 N-terminus is critical
   for dimerization. By electrophysiology and Xenopus oocyte expression, we
   found that C1, but not CC2, is critical for PKD2L1 channel function. Our
   co-immunoprecipitation and dynamic light scattering experiments further
   supported involvement of C1 in trimerization. Further, C1 acted as a
   blocking peptide that inhibits PKD2L1 trimerization as well as PKD2L1
   and PKD2L1/PKD1L3 channel function. Thus, our study identified C1 as the
   first PKD2L1 domain essential for both PKD2L1 trimerization and channel
   function, and suggest that PKD2L1 and PKD2L1/PKD1L3 channels share the
   PKD2L1 trimerization process.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigated the interaction of an edge dislocation

   dynamics techniques to explore the critical stress required to unpin the
   dislocation (CSRUD), the breakaway dislocation line shape when the
   dislocation leaves the precipitates and the transition of Cu atoms
   within precipitates. The results indicate that the CSRUD of the Cu-Ni
   precipitates with a diameter less than 2.38 nm is larger than that of Cu
   precipitates that contain the same number of Cu atoms, while for a
   diameter larger than 2.38 nm, the CSRUD of Cu-Ni precipitates is weaker,
   which is related to the bcc to fcc-like or hcp-like atoms transformation
   in precipitates. The dislocations interact with Cu and Cu-Ni

Abstract = {{The side-side, side-tip, and tip-tip clumping of nanofibers, including
   nanowires and nanotubes on surfaces, is a common problem that can
   diminish their optical, electrical, and mechanical performance. However,
   these different clumping configurations brought much complexity and
   confused researchers to predict or design the desired clumping or
   nonclumping. In this study, a universal model in the unified formula for
   the critical clumping criteria for three contact geometries of nanofiber
   arrays is derived in terms of two-dimensionless geometric and mechanical
   parameters, based on the length, radius, spacing, Young's modulus, and
   adhesion energy of the nanofibers. The model provides an easy way to
   predict the sequences of the three clumping configurations, which are
   successfully verified by analyzing various clumping structures reported
   in the literatures. This study provides new insights into, and methods
   for, designing nanofiber arrays on surfaces to achieve desired clumping
   or nonclumping structures.}},

Abstract = {{Recent thermodynamics calculations and adsorption isotherms showed that
   the adsorption of a self-assembled layer (SAL) of ionized weak acids to
   carbon was attributed to the negatively charged hydrogen bonding
   (-CAHB), yet the direct visualization and characterization of this
   adsorption behavior have not been reported. Here, an amplitude
   modulation-frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-FM AFM)
   technique was applied to discriminate the adsorption of decanoic acids
   (DA) on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Thermodynamics
   calculations revealed that the adsorption of SAL was driven by the
   formation of -CAHB with negatively charged functional groups of HOPG.
   Multilayer adsorption could occur over the adsorbed ionized SAL, leading
   to the development of aggregates. AM-FM AFM imaging showed that the
   adsorption of the DA molecules forming aggregates occurred only for the
   HOPG-functionalized steps, while DA molecules were found to adsorb over
   the entire functionalized HOPG surface after water-plasma treatment, as
   evident from the frequency shifts identified in AFM images.}},

Abstract = {{The oil sands industry has recently focused on both reducing their
   freshwater usage and maximizing the reuse of process water. This study
   is one of the few pilot-scale investigations reporting the ability of
   reverse osmosis (RO) to treat recycle water (RCW) from an oil sands
   facility. Two distinct treatment trains were assessed to evaluate the
   impacts of pretreatments on the RO performance. Treatment train I
   consisted of coagulant addition, ceramic ultrafiltration (CUF),
   antiscalant, and a single-pass RO system operated at natural pH, while
   the treatment train 2 included softening, coagulant addition, CUF
   system, weak acid cation ion exchange, antiscalant addition, and an RO
   system operated at alkaline pH. RU permeate fluxes normalized to 25
   degrees C of approximately 31-39 L/m(2).h at 72\% recovery and 38-52
   L/m(2).h at 85\% recovery were recorded for treatment trains 1 and 2,
   respectively. At these conditions, the two treatment trains resulted in
   total dissolved solids lower than 18 mg/L, while the dissolved sodium
   concentrations were below 7 mg/L. During the pilot tests, clean-in-place
   procedures were not required for both treatment configurations,
   highlighting the effectiveness of the pretreatment steps to reduce the
   RU membrane foulants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{UV and hydrogen peroxide treatment restores changes in innate immunity
   caused by exposure of fish to reuse water}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{257-273}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess the innate immunity of goldfish
   exposed to reuse water, and UV/H2O2-treated reuse water, using a
   real-time flow-through exposure system. The reuse water generated by
   ultrafiltration of finished wastewater from the municipal wastewater
   treatment plant was analyzed for the presence of a panel of 20
   herbicides/fungicides and 46 pharmaceuticals and personal care products
   (PPCP). There was a seasonal variation in the profile and concentrations
   of xenobiotics in reuse water with lowest levels occurring in the
   summer. The innate immunity parameters assessed were cytokine (IFN
   gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-10, TNF alpha 2), and cytokine receptor (TNFR1,
   TNFR2, IFNGR1, IFNGR2) gene expression, and phagocytosis of kidney
   leukocyte subpopulations. Assessment of innate immunity parameters was
   done after acute (7 days) and sub chronic (30 and 60 days) exposure to
   reuse water, UV/H2O2-treated reuse water, and activated carbon-treated
   reuse water (ACT; control), during spring, summer and fall of 2012.
   Temporal (acute versus sub chronic) as well as seasonal differences in
   innate immunity of fish exposed to reuse water were observed. The acute
   exposure of fish to reuse water caused significant down-regulation in
   cytokine gene expression in different organs of fish (kidney, spleen,
   liver) and phagocytic ability of different kidney leukocyte
   subpopulations. The immune gene expression and phagocytosis of kidney
   leukocytes of fish returned to ACT control levels after sub chronic
   exposure suggesting that fish have habituated to the reuse water
   exposure. The changes in gene expression after acute exposure were
   related to variations in the profile of xenobiotics in reuse water
   during different seasons. The efficiency of xenobiotic removal using
   UV/H2O2 ranged between 1.6 and 100\% indicating that treatment of reuse
   water using high dose UV/H2O2 was only partially effective in removing
   the xenobiotics, as assessed by both chemical analyses and measurement
   of innate immune responsiveness of the fish. Furthermore, exposure of
   fish to reuse water and UV/H2O2-treated reuse water generated in the
   spring and fall caused greater changes in innate immunity after acute
   exposure, compared to fish exposed to ACT reuse water, indicating that
   the remediation of reuse water, should be considered in order to protect
   aquatic and public health. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alloy 690 is one of the steam generator (SG) tubing materials in
   pressurized water reactors (PWR). The degradation of this alloy in
   alkaline solutions containing reduced sulfur is one of the main causes
   of stress corrosion cracking. In this study, the corrosion behavior of
   Alloy 690 in simulated alkaline crevice chemistry at 300 degrees C was
   investigated using polarization curves, scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and time-of-flight secondary
   ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Studying the effect of thiosulfate and
   sulfate on the properties of the passive film formed on Alloy 690 showed
   that the film formed at 300 degrees C was composed of an outer porous
   layer and an inner compact layer, and that the ion species presented in
   chloride solutions had a significant impact on the corrosion behavior of
   the alloy. The addition of thiosulfate increased the passive current
   density, decreased the transpassive potential, and therefore lowered the
   corrosion resistance. The presence of thiosulfate also led to a decrease
   in Cr levels and an increase in Ni levels in the passive layer. The
   thiosulfate can reduce sulfur at the film surface and enter into the
   film, causing an increased sulfide content in the film which decreases
   the corrosion resistance. However, experiments using sulfate had no
   obvious effect on film degradation as the ion had minimal interaction
   with the film.}},

Title = {{Process monitoring based on factor analysis: Probabilistic analysis of

Abstract = {{In generic process monitoring approaches based on probabilistic latent
   variable models, such as probabilistic principal component analysis
   (PPCA) or factor analysis (FA) model, the online score and residual are
   characterized by probability distributions. However, only their
   expectations are involved in the calculations of monitoring statistics,
   square prediction error (SPE) and Hotelling T-2, which ignore the
   information of their variances and may result in missed fault alarms.
   Based on the FA model, this paper investigates the probabilistic
   uncertainties of monitoring statistics arising from both inherent nature
   and missing measurements of the process data. The proposed method
   derives the distributions of both the online factor and residual at each
   sampling instant, and then transforms generic monitoring statistics into
   general quadratic forms. As a result, novel monitoring statistics are
   developed based on the probabilistic uncertainties of the generic
   statistics. In addition, the proposed monitoring statistics are extended
   to the case of incomplete measurements, in which the conditional
   distributions of the online measurement, factor and residual are
   computed and used to construct the statistics for process monitoring.
   Simulation examples illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method
   and demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We report a simple and robust method for fabricating graphene-on-silicon
   waveguides on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip. The waveguide consists
   of a silicon core covered by a graphene layer whose width exactly
   conforms with the width of the silicon core and whose length can be
   precisely controlled. Raman spectroscopy showed that the graphene layer
   retained its high quality after processing. Transmission measurements of
   fabricated graphene-on-silicon waveguides showed polarization-dependent
   propagation losses of 0.03 dB/mu m for the transverse-electric (TE) mode
   and 0.07 dB/mu m for the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode, in excellent
   agreement with theoretical simulations.}},

Title = {{Effects of different pretreatments on the performance of ceramic
   ultrafiltration membrane during the treatment of oil sands tailings pond
   recycle water: A pilot-scale study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{151}},

Abstract = {{Membrane filtration is an effective treatment method for oil sands
   tailings pond recycle water (RCW); however, membrane fouling and rapid
   decrease in permeate flux caused by colloids, organic matter, and
   bitumen residues present in the RCW hinder its successful application.
   This pilot-scale study investigated the impact of different pretreatment
   steps on the performance of a ceramic ultrafiltration (CUF) membrane
   used for the treatment of RCW. Two treatment trains were examined:
   treatment train 1 consisted of coagulant followed by a CUF system, while
   treatment train 2 included softening (Multiflo (TM) system) and
   coagulant addition, followed by a CUF system. The results indicated that
   minimum pretreatment (train 1) was required for almost complete solids
   removal. The addition of a softening step (train 2) provided an
   additional barrier to membrane fouling by reducing hardness-causing ions
   to negligible levels. More than 99\% removal of turbidity and less than
   20\% removal of total organic carbon were achieved regardless of the
   treatment train used. Permeate fluxes normalized at 20 degrees C of
   127-130 L/m(2) h and 111-118 L/m(2) h, with permeate recoveries of
   90-93\% and 90-94\% were observed for the treatment trains 1 and 2,
   respectively. It was also found that materials deposited onto the
   membrane surface had an impact on trans-membrane pressure and influenced
   the required frequencies of chemically enhanced backwashes (CEBs) and
   clean-in-place (CIP) procedures. The CIP performed was successful in
   removing fouling and scaling materials such that the CUF performance was
   restored to baseline levels. The results also demonstrated that due to
   their low turbidity and silt density index values, permeates produced in
   this pilot study were suitable for further treatment by high pressure
   membrane processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A semi-analytical solution to optimize single-component solvent
   coinjection with steam during SAGD}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{400-414}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Coinjection of a low concentration of solvent with steam has been
   studied as an alternative to steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD).
   This research presents a semi-analytical method for comparing oil
   drainage rates of SAGD and coinjection processes using different
   single-component solvents for a given set of reservoir/operating
   conditions. The oil recovery in coinjection involves complex interaction
   of energy and mass balances with the effects of gravity, phase behavior,
   and multiphase flow. We simplify the complex interaction without loss of
   fundamental mechanisms, while retaining the phase behavior details near
   the chamber edge.
   The new method begins with solution for thermodynamic conditions at the
   chamber edge, where the phase transition occurs between two and three
   phases. Three components are considered; oil, solvent, and water. The
   chamber-edge conditions that are solved for are used to estimate
   distributions of solvent and temperature beyond the chamber edge.
   Darcy's law and material balance are then applied to derive an
   analytical expression for oil-drainage ratio, the ratio of oil drainage
   in coinjection to that in SAGD. Since the chamber-edge temperature and
   composition are interdependent for this ternary phase behavior problem,
   oil-drainage ratio is solved for as a function of solvent concentration
   in the oleic (L) phase at the chamber edge (chi(edge)(sL)).
   Case studies with the semi-analytical method show that oil-drainage
   ratio is higher in the higher chi(edge)(sL) range than in the lower
   chi(edge)(sL) range for a given coinjection solvent. This indicates that
   efficient oil recovery in coinjection requires high accumulation of
   solvent at the chamber edge. Oil-drainage ratios calculated for
   different coinjection solvents are compared in the high chi(edge)(sL)
   range for preliminary screening of single-component coinjection
   solvents. This offers significant time savings in selecting a
   coinjection solvent by reducing the need for numerical reservoir
   simulation. The semi-analytical method also indicates that highly
   volatile solvents, which are relatively less expensive in general, tend
   to be more effective for less viscous reservoir oil and higher operating
   pressure. Less volatile solvents may offer more flexibility in operating
   conditions since they remain effective at lower pressures. These results
   are validated using fine-scale numerical reservoir simulations. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In order to meet standards for drinking water quality (GB5749-2006) in
   China, the sand filtration with a high dosage of secondary-flocculation
   following biological activated carbon (BAC) filter is employed at
   Nanjiao waterworks, which leads to greatly shortening the running cycle
   and increasing operating costs. In an effort to reduce the chemical
   dosage, optimization of sand filtration and BAC filtration were
   performed. The results show that the enhanced sand filtration and the
   improvement of water quality of BAC filter effluent can significantly
   reduce the dosage. Appropriate sand gradation (0.5-0.8mm), sand filter
   backwashing with high air flow rate and low water flow rate, the BAC
   filter with 0.3-0.6mm carbon operating with appropriate flow rate are
   beneficial in reducing the dosage of secondary-flocculation. Compared
   with the full-scale plant, over 60\% dosage can be saved by reducing
   chemical dosage to 0.3mg/L, thereby decreasing the amount of sludge,
   increasing the running cycle of the filter, saving the volume of
   backwash water, and finally reducing operating costs.}},

Abstract = {{The biomechanics of the patellofemoral (PF) joint is complex in nature,
   and the aetiology of such manifestations of PF instability as
   patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is still unclear. At this point, the
   particular factors affecting PFPS have not yet been determined. This
   study has two objectives: (1) The first is to develop an alternative
   geometric method using a three-dimensional (3D) registration technique
   and linear mapping to investigate the PF joint contact stress using an
   indirect measure: the depth of virtual penetration (PD) of the patellar
   cartilage surface into the femoral cartilage surface. (2) The second is
   to develop 3D PF joint models using the finite element analysis (FEA) to
   quantify in vivo cartilage contact stress and to compare the peak
   contact stress location obtained from the FE models with the location of
   the maximum PD. Magnetic resonance images of healthy and PFPS subjects
   at knee flexion angles of 15 degrees, 30 degrees and 45 degrees during
   isometric loading have been used to develop the geometric models. The
   results obtained from both approaches demonstrated that the subjects
   with PFPS show higher PD and contact stresses than the normal subjects.
   Maximum stress and PD increase with flexion angle, and occur on the
   lateral side in healthy and on the medial side in PFPS subjects. It has
   been concluded that the alternative geometric method is reliable in
   addition to being computationally efficient compared with FEA, and has
   the potential to assess the mechanics of PFPS with an accuracy similar
   to the FEA.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of high-risk behavior tendencies and impulsivity in an

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Improved neuroscientific understanding of high-risk behaviors such as
   alcohol binging, drug use, and unsafe sex will lead to therapeutic
   advances for high-risk groups. High-risk behavior often occurs in an
   emotionally-charged context, and behavioral inhibition and emotion
   regulation play important roles in risk-related decision making. High
   impulsivity is an important potential contributor to high-risk behavior
   tendencies. We explored the relationships between high-risk behavior
   tendencies, impulsivity, and fMRI brain activations in an emotional
   Go/NoGo task. This task presented emotional distractor pictures
   (aversive vs. neutral) simultaneously with Go/NoGo stimuli (square vs.
   circle) that required a button press or withholding of the press,
   respectively. Participants' risk behavior tendencies were assessed with
   the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events (CARE) scale. The Barratt
   Impulsivity Scale 11 (BIS) was used to assess participant impulsivity.
   Individuals with higher CARE risk scores exhibited reduced activation
   related to response inhibition (NoGo Go) in right orbital frontal cortex
   (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These regions did not show a
   significant relationship with impulsivity scores. Conversely, more
   impulsive individuals showed reduced emotionrelated activity (aversive
   neutral distractors) in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, perigenual
   anterior cingulate cortex, and right posterior OFC. There were distinct
   neural correlates of high-risk behavior tendency and impulsivity in
   terms of brain activity in the emotional Go/NoGo task. This dissociation
   supports the conception of high-risk behavior tendency as a distinct
   construct from that of impulsivity. Our results suggest that treatment
   for high-risk behavior may be more effective with a nuanced approach
   that does not conflate high impulsivity necessarily with high-risk
   behavior tendencies.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel voxel-based method for texture analysis of
   brain images. Texture analysis is a powerful quantitative approach for
   analyzing voxel intensities and their interrelationships, but has been
   thus far limited to analyzing regions of interest. The proposed method
   provides a 3D statistical map comparing texture features on a
   voxel-by-voxel basis. The validity of the method was examined on
   artificially generated effects as well as on real MRI data in
   Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The artificially generated effects included
   hyperintense and hypointense signals added to T1-weighted brain MRIs
   from 30 healthy subjects. The AD dataset included 30 patients with AD
   and 30 age/sex matched healthy control subjects. The proposed method
   detected artificial effects with high accuracy and revealed
   statistically significant differences between the AD and control groups.
   This paper extends the usage of texture analysis beyond the current
   region of interest analysis to voxel-by-voxel 3D statistical mapping and
   provides a hypothesis-free analysis tool to study cerebral pathology in
   neurological diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the filtering problem for Lipschitz systems
   in a networked environment. We assume that the measurements transmitted
   over the network are subject to quantization, uncertain delays and
   communication constraints. We first analytically demonstrate how each of
   the these issues affect the filtering problem. Second, we tackle the
   filter design as an optimization problem with LMI constraints. The
   optimization maximizes the Lipschitz constant and thus the region of
   attraction for which the filter is stable and an H bound is satisfied by
   the error system. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Energy loss in the transport of a beam of relativistic electrons in warm

Title = {{Optimal robust optimization approximation for chance constrained
   optimization problem}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{89-99}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Chance constraints are useful for modeling solution reliability in
   optimization under uncertainty. In general, solving chance constrained
   optimization problems is challenging and the existing methods for
   solving a chance constrained optimization problem largely rely on
   solving an approximation problem. Among the various approximation
   methods, robust optimization can provide safe and tractable analytical
   approximation. In this paper, we address the question of what is the
   optimal (least conservative) robust optimization approximation for the
   chance constrained optimization problems. A novel algorithm is proposed
   to find the smallest possible uncertainty set size that leads to the
   optimal robust optimization approximation. The proposed method first
   identifies the maximum set size that leads to feasible robust
   optimization problems and then identifies the best set size that leads
   to the desired probability of constraint satisfaction. Effectiveness of
   the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a portfolio optimization
   problem, a production planning and a process scheduling problem. (C)

Abstract = {{The interaction between air bubbles and solid surfaces plays important
   roles in many engineering processes, such as mineral froth flotation. In
   this work, an atomic force microscope (AFM) bubble probe technique was
   employed, for the first time, to directly measure the interaction forces
   between an air bubble and sphalerite mineral surfaces of different
   hydrophobicity (i.e., sphalerite before/after conditioning treatment)
   under various hydrodynamic conditions. The direct force measurements
   demonstrate the critical role of the hydrodynamic force and surface
   forces in bubble-mineral interaction and attachment, which agree well
   with the theoretical calculations based on Reynolds lubrication theory
   and augmented YoungLaplace equation by including the effect of
   disjoining pressure. The hydrophobic disjoining pressure was found to be
   stronger for the bubble-water-conditioned sphalerite interaction with a
   larger hydrophobic decay length, which enables the bubble attachment on
   conditioned sphalerite at relatively higher bubble approaching
   velocities than that of unconditioned sphalerite. Increasing the salt
   concentration (i.e., NaCl, CaCl2) leads to weakened electrical double
   layer force and thereby facilitates the bubblemineral attachment, which
   follows the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory by
   including the effects of hydrophobic interaction. The results provide
   insights into the basic understanding of the interaction mechanism
   between bubbles and minerals at nanoscale in froth flotation processes,
   and the methodology on probing the interaction forces of air bubble and
   sphalerite surfaces in this work can be extended to many other mineral
   and particle systems.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the uniformity of the pavement unbound layers'

   the OWP and CL showed a coefficient of variance (COV) of 0.31 and 0.59,
   correspondingly. Similar variation was observed in the subgrade modulus
   after placement of the base layer. Subgrade modulus displayed
   stress-softening behavior under the different bulk stresses during the
   FWD tests.
   Tests conducted on top of the base indicated that variation also exists
   in the base modulus, with COVs of 0.23 and 0.26, respectively, along the

Abstract = {{A centrifugal particle mass analyzer and a modified differential
   mobility spectrometer were used to measure the mass and mobility of
   particulate matter emitted by CFM56-5B4/2P, CFM56-7B26/3, and PW4000-100
   gas turbine engine sources. The mass-mobility exponent of the
   particulate matter from the CFM56-5B4/2P engine ranged from 2.68 to
   2.82, whereas the effective particle densities varied from 600 to 1250
   kg/m(3), depending on the static engine thrust and sampling methodology
   used. The effective particle densities from the CFM56-7B26/3 and
   PW4000-100 engines also fell within this range. The sample was
   conditioned with or without a catalytic stripper and with or without
   dilution, which caused the effective density to change, indicating the
   presence of condensed semivolatile material on the particles.
   Variability of the determined effective densities across different
   engine thrusts, based on the scattering about the line of best fit, was
   lowest for the diluted samples and highest for the undiluted sample
   without a catalytic stripper. This variability indicates that the
   relative amount of semivolatile material produced was engine thrust
   dependent. It was found that the nonvolatile particulate matter,
   effective particle density (in kilograms per cubic meter) of the
   CFM56-5B4/2P engine at relative thrusts below 30\% could be approximated
   using the particle mobility diameter (d(me) in meters) with
   11.92d(me)((2.76-3)).}},

Abstract = {{Friction stir welding is an efficient manufacturing method for joining
   dissimilar alloys, which can dramatically reduce grain sizes and offer
   high mechanical joint efficiency. Lap FSW joints between dissimilar
   AZ31B and Al 6061 alloy sheets were made at various tool rotation and
   travel speeds. Rotation and travel speeds varied between 560-1400 r/min
   and 16-40 mm/min respectively, where the ratio between these parameters
   was such that nearly constant pitch distances were applied during
   welding. X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), optical microscopy images
   (OM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and scanning electron
   microscopy equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (SEM-EDS) were used to investigate the microstructures of the joints
   welded. Intermetallic phases including Al12Mg17 (gamma) and Al3Mg2
   (beta) were detected in the weld zone (WZ). For different tool rotation
   speeds, the morphology of the microstructure in the stir zone changed
   significantly with travel speed. Lap shear tensile test results
   indicated that by simultaneously increasing the tool rotation and travel
   speeds to 1400 r/min and 40 mm/min, the joint tensile strength and
   ductility reached a maximum. Microhardness measurements and tensile
   stress-strain curves indicated that mechanical properties were affected
   by FSW parameters and mainly depended on the formation of intermetallic
   compounds in the weld zone. In addition, a debonding failure mode in the
   Al/Mg dissimilar weld nugget was investigated by SEM and surface
   fracture studies indicated that the presence of intermetallic compounds
   in the weld zone controlled the failure mode. XRD analysis of the
   fracture surface indicated the presence of brittle intermetallic
   compounds including Al12Mg17 (gamma) and Al3Mg2 (beta). (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{338-345}},

Abstract = {{Low permeability saline aquifers, which are widely distributed around
   this world, have great potential for injected CO2 storage. Fluid flow in
   low permeability layers shows characteristics of low-velocity non-Darcy
   flow. A mathematical model considering the effect of threshold pressure
   gradient (TPG) for CO2 flow and storage in low permeability saline
   aquifer has been developed, and the corresponding numerical model has
   been formulated and solved. From the numerical results, we can conclude
   that the injection rate, cumulative CO2 injected, and the storage
   efficiency for the case with TPG are always less than those of the case
   without TPG because of the sharp pressure decline and increased energy
   consumption. Under this paper's calculation condition, the storage
   efficiency when considering TPG is about 10\% less than the case without
   considering TPG. If the TPG effect was to be ignored in the design of
   CO2 storage in low permeability saline aquifers, the CO2 storage
   efficiency will be overestimated. The research enlarges the theoretical
   basis of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and provides a more accurate
   method to evaluate CO2 storage efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fourteen large landslides have occurred within a 10 km stretch of the
   Thompson River Valley south of Ashcroft, British Columbia. The slides
   have had movements ranging from rapid (metres per hour) to very slow,
   and the largest slides have volumes approaching 15.0 x 10(6) m(3).
   Investigations of these slides have been conducted since the early
   failures of the slopes were noted in the 1860s, and have continued with
   the periodic reactivations and slope movements since then. This paper
   focuses on the Ripley Slide, which is one of the slides within the
   Thompson River Valley. This slide is a very slow-moving landslide, which
   has recently been reactivated. This landslide is crossed by a major
   transportation corridor and has therefore been the subject of ongoing
   geotechnical investigation and instrumentation. The results of this
   investigation are interpreted in light of the wealth of accumulated
   knowledge from more than a century of geotechnical investigation within
   this valley. The data collected from the landslide show that, like other
   slow-moving landslides in this valley, the seasonal fluctuations of the
   Thompson River elevation strongly influence the instability and the rate
   of slope movement. Continuous global positioning system monitoring of
   the movement of the landslide combined with measurement of the pore
   pressures within the sliding mass and elevation of the river have
   allowed for an empirical correlation between the limit equilibrium
   method modelled factor of safety and the velocity of the landslide.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{224}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{277-288}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the importance of considering contact angle hysteresis
   (CAH) during the process of stretching and breaking a liquid bridge
   between two solid surfaces is addressed. We clearly show that due to the
   pinning of contact line at the end of the stretching stage, the contact
   angle between liquid bridge and surfaces cannot be simply assumed to
   have a constant value (e.g. receding contact angle, theta (r) ).
   Simulation results for stretching a liquid bridge with and without CAH,
   showed that the contact line pinning can lead to breakage at a larger
   surface separation and smaller value of pull-off force (F (p) ). A
   systematic study about the effect of CAH and contact line pinning on the
   value of F (p) is provided. It is found that when one of the surfaces
   has a theta (r) larger than 90(a similar to), F (p) decreases with the
   increase of theta (r) on either surface delimiting the bridge. For the
   cases where theta (r) of both surfaces are smaller than 90(a similar
   to), significantly smaller F (p) is seen when contact line pinning
   occurs on both surfaces, as compared to F (p) when contact line pinning

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) finite
   impulse response (FIR) filtering problem for linear system described by
   discrete time-variant state-space models. An MVU FIR filter is derived
   by minimizing the variance from the unbiased FIR (UFIR) filter. The
   relationship between the filter gains of MVU FIR, UFIR and optimal FIR
   (OFIR) filters is derived analytically, and the mean square errors
   (MSEs) of different FIR filters are compared to provide an insight into
   the estimation performance. Simulations provided verify that errors in
   the MVU FIR filter are in between the UFIR and OFIR filters. It is also
   shown that the MVU FIR filter can offer optimal estimates without a
   prior knowledge of the initial state, and exhibits better robustness
   against temporary modeling uncertainties than the Kalman filter. (C)

Abstract = {{Membrane aerated biofilms (MABs) are subject to ``counter diffusion{''}
   of oxygen and substrates. In a membrane aerated biofilm reactor, gases
   (e.g., oxygen) diffuse through the membrane into the MAB, and liquid
   substrates pass from the bulk liquid into the MAB. This behavior can
   result in a unique biofilm structure in terms of microbial composition,
   distribution, and community activity in the MAB. Previous studies have
   shown simultaneous aerobic oxidation, nitrification, and denitrification
   within a single MAB. Using molecular techniques, we investigated the
   growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the oxygen-based MAB
   attached to a flat sheet membrane. Denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis of the amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments and functional
   gene fragments specific for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (amoA),
   denitrifying bacteria (nirK), and SRB (dsrB) demonstrated the
   coexistence of nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and SRB communities within a

   with an increase in the oxygen concentration in the bulk water of the

Abstract = {{Addition reactions have been proposed as a significant pathway for coke
   formation in the liquid-phase cracking of heavy oils and bitumens. In
   order to study the kinetics of olefin addition in the liquid phase, two
   alkyl-bridged aromatic compounds, with molecular weights of 899.70 g/mol
   and 1127.99 g/mol, were thermally cracked with 1-hexadecene,
   1-octadecene, or trans-stilbene, in a batch microreactor at 375-430
   degrees C for 15 to 45 min. Reaction products were analyzed by gas
   chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted
   laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and proton
   nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy. Kinetic data indicate
   a first-order reaction in model compound concentration, with energetics
   consistent with a free-radical chain mechanism. Tandem MS/MS and H-1 NMR
   spectra of the products are consistent with olefin addition through the
   alkyl bridge of the bridged aromatics. The results imply that (i) the
   addition products are able to abstract hydrogen to give detectable
   products faster than they decompose, and (ii) the addition products can
   react even more readily than the parent compounds.}},

Title = {{Inorganic Matter Behavior during Coal Gasification: Effect of Operating
   Conditions and Particle Trajectory on Ash Deposition and Slag Formation}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Ash particle deposition and uncontrolled slag flow, which can lead to
   tap hole blockage, are some of the main issues during coal gasification.
   In this work, a special collector probe was used to collect ash
   deposition and analyze slag formation and blockage probability in terms
   of operating conditions and particle trajectories. Increasing the
   temperature led to the increase in the total deposition for all of the
   experiments. However, when the temperature was increased, the weight of
   produced slag flow increased, but it was observed that increasing the
   temperature could not guarantee the safe operation by preventing
   deposition blockage. Using two Canadian coal types proved that the ash
   composition of coal has a significant effect on the amount and thickness
   of deposition on the wall. For fuel with low ash viscosity, increasing
   the temperature increased slag flow and blockage never happened.
   However, for fuel with high bulk ash viscosity, when the temperature was
   increased, the blockage probability did not decrease. The reason might
   be related to the different effects of the temperature on particle
   stickiness and slag viscosity at a specific range of the temperature.
   Computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) analysis showed
   that excluded iron-bearing minerals of the first coal and included
   calcium-bearing minerals of the second coal had a substantial effect on
   the deposition tendency of these fuels. Increasing the velocity of the
   particles by gas flow rate mostly resulted in reduction of deposition.
   Fuel with a higher particle size range at a low temperature and high gas
   flow has the lowest deposition tendency. To evaluate the effect of
   particle trajectory/aerodynamics, two different types of feeding
   configurations were used and the results showed that the feeder type has
   a significant effect on the deposition pattern and growth at different
   locations. One feeder by injecting the particles in a narrow area led to
   high inorganic accumulation near the feeding spot, resulting in severe
   depositions with a thickness of several centimeters. The other feeder
   caused more uniform deposition by producing a wider sticky surface with
   a lower deposition thickness on the wall of the furnace.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to study the effect of fracture surface
   roughness on fluid distribution during miscible displacement. The
   transparent replicas of single fractures obtained from seven different
   rocks were prepared and the surface roughness of each sample was
   described by fractal dimensions using the variogram, power spectral, and
   triangular prism (TP) techniques. Then, the effect of flow rate and
   viscosity on the geometry of the displacement front during miscible
   radial injection was investigated experimentally. The fractal dimensions
   of the fronts were obtained using box counting fractal analysis at
   different time lapses. The fractal values of invasion front varied from
   lithology to lithology, due to different surface roughnesses controlled
   by the lithology of the rocks. Although fluctuations of fractal values
   were observed during the growth of the front, fractal dimensions
   typically yielded an increasing trend. Fractal dimension became more
   stable with increasing flow rate and developed modestly with increasing
   viscosity. Finally, relationships between the fractal dimensions of
   displacement fronts and fracture surfaces were quantitatively analyzed
   and correlated in order to improve the prediction of fluid distribution
   within a single fracture during miscible displacement. Overall,
   correlations were observed between the surface characteristics and front
   fractal dimension values with some exceptions. In summary, to determine
   the probable distribution of miscible fluid and development of the
   front, all parameters except power spectral density (PSD) fractal
   dimension can be applied in the case of high viscosity ratios. In the
   case of low injection rates, TP could be applicable. No fractal behavior
   was present at extreme injection and low viscosity ratios, thus no
   correlation can be determined for the miscible displacement.}},

Abstract = {{Brace treatment is the most commonly used nonsurgical treatment for
   adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. However, brace treatment is not
   always successful and the factors influencing its success are not
   completely clear. This makes treatment outcome difficult to predict. A
   computer model which can accurately predict treatment outcomes could
   potentially provide valuable treatment recommendations. This paper
   describes a fuzzy system that includes a prediction model and a decision
   support engine. The model was constructed using conditional fuzzy
   c-means clustering to discover patterns in retrospective patient data.
   The model's ability to predict treatment outcome was compared to the
   ability of eight Scoliosis experts. The model and experts each predicted
   treatment outcome retrospectively for 28 braced patients, and these
   predictions were compared to the actual outcomes. The model outperformed
   all but one expert individually and performed similarly to the experts
   as a group. These results suggest that the fuzzy model is capable of
   providing meaningful treatment recommendations. This study offers the
   first model for this application whose performance has been shown to be
   at or above the human expert level.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of traffic scheduling between
   roadside units (RSUs) in a vehicular delay-tolerant network. A source
   RSU needs the help of passing-by vehicles to forward its traffic to a
   destination RSU. Costs are associated with energy consumption and
   information loss. When a vehicle arrives, the source RSU needs to decide
   whether to stop, i.e., transmit its traffic to the vehicle, or skip this
   vehicle and continue to wait for other vehicles. The source RSU's
   objective is to achieve the minimal rate of cost. In this paper, we
   theoretically derive an optimal stopping strategy of the source RSU.

Abstract = {{We modified the Random Walk-Particle Tracking (RW-PT) technique to
   simulate fully miscible CO2 injection, including matrix-fracture
   interaction, in naturally fractured oil reservoirs. After creating and
   validating the fracture network of a pilot test area for CO2 flooding,
   we first performed a sensitivity analysis and investigated the effect of
   different parameters (such as spacing between fractures and fracture
   lengths, fracture and matrix permeability, fracture-matrix interaction
   parameters, etc.) on the performance. Secondly, we performed a history
   match study to reproduce the observed CO2 production rate and achieved a
   good agreement between production and simulated data. We discussed the
   possibility of using the same technique to simulate the early stages of
   CO2 sequestration in naturally fractured reservoirs while injecting it
   for oil recovery.
   Although the introduced model does not capture the whole complexity of a
   miscible flow in fractured porous media due to its inherent
   characteristics, it can be used to estimate fully miscible transport
   processes in naturally fractured reservoirs, including CO2 flooding and
   the early stages of sequestration, as it has the capability of
   representing the complexity of natural fracture networks and matrix
   interaction. The simplifications used in the modeling and the
   limitations of the suggested technique are described as well. (C) 2015

   parameters and emission estimates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{490-501}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The storage of large volumes of tailings has become an issue for
   Canada's oil sands industry. The use of diluent, along with incomplete
   bitumen and solvent recovery from the tailings stream, leads to the
   accumulation of organic compounds within tailings ponds. Volatile
   organic compounds, reduced sulfur compounds, carbon dioxide, and methane
   are emitted from tailings outfalls. oily films, bitumen slicks, and
   mature fine tailings. These emissions are linked to the bitumen
   extraction and tailings treatment processes, tailings properties
   (composition, age, residence time), and environmental factors (wind,
   temperature, rain, and ice cover). Due to limited research in this area,
   it is difficult to evaluate relationships between emission sources and
   compounds emitted. To estimate emissions, emission factors based on
   snapshot measurements, and varying models and assumptions are commonly
   used. This review presents current knowledge on factors and parameters
   influencing emission estimates, and challenges pertaining to the
   development of current emissions factors. Standard emission measurement
   and calculation methods, vigilant sampling, and increased research are
   needed to develop a more accurate and representative understanding of
   emissions from oil sands tailings ponds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Here we investigate the oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalytic
   activity and the corrosion stability of several ternary Pt-Au-Co and
   Pt-Ir-Co alloys, with Pt-Au-Co having never been previously studied for
   ORR. The addition of Au fine tunes the lattice parameter and the surface
   electronic structure to enable activity and cycling stability that is
   unachievable in Pt-25 atom \% Co (state-of-the-art binary baseline). The
   ternary alloys exhibit a volcano-type dependence of catalytic efficacy
   on the content of Au or Ir. Pt-2.5 atom \% Au-25 atom \% Co alloy shows
   a specific activity of 1.41 mA cm-2 at 0.95 V, which is 16\% and 404\%
   higher than those of identically synthesized Pt-Co and pure Pt,
   respectively. This enhancement is promising in comparison to a range of
   previously published Pt skeleton and Pt skin alloys and is in fact the
   most optimum reported for a skeleton-type system. The catalysts exhibit
   dramatically improved corrosion stability with increasing levels of Au
   or Ir substitution, with the specific activity of all the ternary alloys
   being superior to that of Pt-Co after 100,000 potential cycles of
   0.6-1.0 V. For instance, postcycled Pt-10 atom \% Au-25 atom \% Co shows
   a specific activity of 0.63 mA cm(-2), which is 140\% higher than that
   of Pt-Co and 439\% higher than that of Pt. HRTEM and XPS shows that Au
   alloying promotes the formation of an atomically thin Pt-Au-rich surface
   layer, which imparts kinetic stabilization against the dissolution of
   the less noble solute component.}},

Abstract = {{Infant crying analysis is an important tool for identifying different
   pathologies at a very early stage of the life of a baby. Being able to
   perform this task with high accuracy is therefore important and required
   as a medical support system to assess a baby's health. In this research
   we propose an automatic classification model for infant crying for early
   disease detection. Our model mainly consists of two phases: (a) an
   acoustic features acquisition from the Mel Frequency Cepstral
   Coefficient and the Linear Predictive Coding from signal processing and
   (b) the selection/creation of an optimized fuzzy model through the
   Genetic Selection of a Fuzzy Model (GSFM) algorithm. GSFM searches for
   the best model by choosing a combination of a feature selection method,
   a type of fuzzy processing, a learning algorithm together with its
   associated parameters that best fit the input data. Our approach
   improves the predictive accuracy on the identification of the cause of
   crying and clearly helps to differentiate between normal and
   pathological cry. Experimental results show a significant accuracy
   improvement when using our optimized genetic selection method for most
   of the cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors developed a time-space discrete macroscopic
   model based on the shockwave theory for real-time queue estimation in

   After investigating the queue characteristics both at an active
   bottleneck and within a variable speed limit control case, the proposed
   model was applied to these two cases on Whitemud Drive, a major freeway
   corridor in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Modified Highway Capacity
   Manual-based methods were used to determine queue density in
   uninterrupted freeway flow. The effect of time interval size on queue
   estimation was studied, as loop detector data acquisition frequencies
   may differ. It was found that the proposed model accurately estimates
   real-time queue length independent of the time interval. Multiple single
   queues were implemented in a calibrated VISSIM 5.3 micro-simulation
   model to perform the validation task. The study is a helpful foundation
   for future active traffic management strategy development and
   improvement.}},

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{190-198}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Modular construction is a dominant manufacturing method for industrial
   construction in Alberta, Canada. Modularization requires large-capacity
   mobile cranes to lift heavy modules, such as piperack modules. The
   current practice utilizes AutoCAD to generate heavy lift studies for
   modular onsite installations. Heavy lift studies consist of 2D and 3D
   simulations of the lifting scenarios, along with the corresponding
   calculations (e.g., lifting capacity checking, ground bearing pressure
   checking). These static simulations provide snapshots of mobile cranes
   at pick and set configurations, but they do not represent the movements
   between the two configurations. For better communication among site
   engineers and crews, current static heavy lift studies need to be
   improved by animating the entire lifting process. 3ds Max is an
   animation tool that can visualize the lifting process, but the tedious
   and manual process of preparing the animation restricts efficiency and
   productivity. This research thus introduces a newly developed animation
   system that automates the transfer of heavy lift studies from AutoCAD
   into Autodesk 3ds Max animation. Also in this research, the kinetics of
   mobile cranes are studied and generic crane movements are defined. Using
   MAXScript, a script is written to link the crane and project database
   for automatic generating of animations. This research aims to provide
   the construction industry with a generic method for automating the
   animation process for heavy lifts based on AutoCAD and 3ds Max systems.}},

Abstract = {{Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by
   the inappropriate accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in tissues due
   to a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A).
   Anderson-Fabry cardiomyopathy is characterized by structural, valvular,
   vascular and conduction abnormalities, and is now the most common cause
   of mortality in patients with AFD. Large-scale metabolic and genetic
   screening studies have revealed AFD to be prevalent in populations of
   diverse ethnic origins, and the variant form of AFD represents an
   unrecognized health burden. Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked
   disorder, and genetic testing is critical for the diagnosis of AFD in
   women. Echocardiography with strain imaging and cardiac magnetic
   resonance imaging using late enhancement and T1 mapping are important
   imaging tools. The current therapy for AFD is enzyme replacement therapy
   (ERT), which can reverse or prevent AFD progression, while gene therapy
   and the use of molecular chaperones represent promising novel therapies
   for AFD. Anderson-Fabry cardiomyopathy is an important and potentially
   reversible cause of heart failure that involves LVH, increased
   susceptibility to arrhythmias and valvular regurgitation. Genetic
   testing and cardiac MRI are important diagnostic tools, and AFD
   cardiomyopathy is treatable if ERT is introduced early.}},

Abstract = {{In free viewpoint video, a viewer can choose at will any camera angle or
   the so-called ``virtual view{''} to observe a dynamic 3-D scene,
   enhancing his/her depth perception. The virtual view is synthesized
   using texture and depth videos of two anchor camera views via
   depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). We consider, for the first time,
   collaborative live streaming of a free viewpoint video, where a group of
   users may interactively pull and cooperatively share streams of
   different anchor views. There is a cost to access the anchor views from
   the live source, a cost to ``reconfigure{''} the peer network due to a
   change in selected anchors during view switching, and a distortion cost
   due to the distance of the virtual views to the received anchor views at
   users. We optimize the anchor views allocated to users so as to minimize
   the overall streaming cost given by the access cost, reconfiguration
   cost, and view distortion cost. We first show that, if the
   reconfiguration cost due to view switching is negligible, the view
   allocation problem can be optimally and efficiently solved in polynomial
   time using dynamic programming. For the case of non-negligible
   reconfiguration cost, the problem becomes NP-hard. We thus present a
   locally optimal and centralized algorithm inspired by Lloyd's algorithm
   used in non-uniform scalar quantization. We further propose a
   distributed algorithm with convergence guarantee, where each peer group
   independently makes merge-and-split decisions with a well-defined
   fairness criteria. Simulation results show that our algorithms achieve
   low streaming cost due to its excellent anchor view allocation.}},

Abstract = {{The Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) is a widely used kernel
   function in support vector machine (SVM). The kernel parameter a is
   crucial to maintain high performance of the Gaussian SVM. Most previous
   studies on this topic are based on optimization search algorithms that
   result in large computation load. In this paper, we propose an
   analytical algorithm to determine the optimal a with the principle of
   maximizing between-class separability and minimizing within-class
   separability. An attractive advantage of the proposed algorithm is that
   no optimization search process is required, and thus the selection
   process is less complex and more computationally efficient. Experimental
   results on seventeen real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm is fast and robust when using it for the Gaussian SVM.}},

Abstract = {{A new sphere decoder algorithm for uncoded spatial multiplexing
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is proposed. It overcomes
   the drawbacks of traditional sphere decoders: variable complexity and
   high complexity in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Its main novelty
   lies in scaling the search radius by a heuristic SNR-dependent factor.
   This new SNR-dependent radius control sphere decoder offers near maximum
   likelihood performance over the entire range of SNRs, while keeping its
   complexity roughly constant. This algorithm also incorporates channel
   ordering to save complexity. To quantify the variability of complexity,
   the normalised variance of the complexity is evaluated. This algorithm
   is also extended for joint iterative detection and decoding in coded
   MIMO systems and for MIMO-relay networks. Simulation results and
   theoretical analysis demonstrate the benefits of the proposed
   algorithm.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ACS COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{We employed a direct peptide-bacteria binding assay to screen peptide
   fragments for high and specific binding to Listeria monocytogenes.
   Peptides were screened from a peptide array library synthesized on
   cellulose membrane. Twenty four peptide fragments (each a 14-mer) were
   derived from three potent anti-listerial peptides, Leucocin A, Pediocin
   PA1, and Curvacin A, that belong to class IIa bacteriocins. Fragment
   Leu10 (GEAFSAGVHRLANG), derived from the C-terminal region of Leucocin
   A, displayed the highest binding among all of the library fragments
   toward several pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, including L.
   monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The
   specific binding of Leu10 to L. monocytogenes was further validated
   using microcantilever (MCL) experiments. Microcantilevers coated with
   gold were functionalized with peptides by chemical conjugation using a
   cysteamine linker to yield a peptide density of similar to 4.8 x 10(-3)
   mu mol/cm(2) for different peptide fragments. Leu10 (14-mer)
   functionalized MCL was able to detect Listeria with same sensitivity as
   that of Leucocin A (37-mer) functionalized MCL, validating the use of
   short peptide fragments in bacterial detection platforms. Fragment Leu10
   folded into a helical conformation in solution, like that of native
   Leucocin A, suggesting that both Leu10 and Leucocin A may employ a
   similar mechanism for binding target bacteria. The results show that
   peptide-conjugated microcantilevers can function as highly sensitive
   platforms for Listeria detection and hold potential to be developed as
   biosensors for pathogenic bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{AimsAnderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is an important X-linked metabolic
   disease resulting in progressive end-organ involvement, with cardiac
   disease being the dominant determinant of survival in a gender-dependent
   manner. Recent epidemiological screening for AFD suggests the prevalence
   is much higher than previously recognized, with estimates of 1:3000. Our
   aim was to discover novel plasma biomarker signatures in adult patients
   with AFD.
   Methods and resultsWe used an unbiased proteomic screening approach to
   discover novel plasma biomarker signatures. In the discovery cohort of
   46 subjects, 14 healthy controls and 32 patients with AFD, we used a
   mass spectrometry iTRAQ proteomic approach followed by multiple reaction
   monitoring (MRM) assays to identify biomarkers. Of the 38 protein groups
   discovered by iTRAQ, 18 already had existing MRM assays. Based on MRM,
   we identified an eight-protein biomarker panel (22 kDa protein, afamin,
   1 antichymotrypsin, apolipoprotein E, -Ala His dipeptidase, haemoglobin
   -2, isoform 1 of sex hormone-binding globulin, and peroxiredoxin 2) that
   was very specific and sensitive for male AFD patients. In female AFD
   patients, we identified a nine-marker panel of proteins with only three
   proteins, apolipoprotein E, haemoglobin -2, and peroxiredoxin 2, common
   to both genders, suggesting a gender-specific alteration in plasma
   biomarkers in patients with AFD. The biomarkers were validated in plasma
   samples from 48 subjects using MRM, and they performed inferiorly in
   patients with heart failure.
   ConclusionsWe have identified gender-specific plasma protein biomarker
   panels that are specific and sensitive for the AFD phenotype. The
   gender-specific panels offer important insight into potential
   differences in pathophysiology and prognosis between males and females
   with AFD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparison of three-dimensional (3-D)
   segmentations of the prostate, based on two-dimensional (2-D) manually
   segmented contours, obtained using ultrasound (US) and magnetic
   resonance (MR) imaging data collected from 40 patients diagnosed with
   localized prostate cancer and scheduled to receive brachytherapy
   treatment. The approach we propose here for 3-D prostate segmentation
   first uses radial basis function interpolation to construct a 3-D point
   distribution model for each prostate. Next, a modified principal axis
   transformation is utilized for rigid registration of the US and MR
   images of the same prostate in preparation for the following shape
   comparison. Then, statistical shape models are used to capture the
   segmented 3-D prostate geometries for the subsequent cross-modality
   comparison. Our study includes not only cross-modality geometric
   comparisons in terms of prostate volumes and dimensions, but also an
   investigation of interchangeability of the two imaging modalities in
   terms of automatic contour segmentation at the pre-implant planning
   stage of prostate brachytherapy treatment. By developing a new scheme to
   compare the two imaging modalities in terms of the segmented 3-D shapes,
   we have taken a first step necessary for building coupled US-MR
   segmentation strategies for prostate brachytherapy pre-implant planning,
   which at present is predominantly informed by US images only.}},

Abstract = {{The aero-engine is the heart of an airplane. Operational reliability
   assessment that aims to identify the reliability level of the
   aero-engine in the service phase is of great significance for improving
   flight safety. Traditionally, reliability assessment is carried out by
   statistical analysis on large failure samples. Because the operational
   reliability of a specific aero-engine is an individual problem lacking
   statistical sample data, traditional reliability assessment methods may
   be insufficient to assess the operational reliability of an individual
   aero-engine. The operational states of the aero-engine can be identified
   by its condition information. Changes in the condition information
   reflect the performance degradation of the aero-engine. Aiming at the
   assessment of the operational reliability of individual aero-engines, a
   novel similarity index (SI) is proposed by analyzing the condition
   information from the fault-free state, and the current state. A
   condition subspace is first obtained by kernel principal component
   analysis (KPCA). Subspace similarity is then represented by subspace
   angles, i.e., kernel principal angles (KPAs). The cosine function is
   finally utilized as a mapping function to transform the subspace angles
   into a similarity index. The index can be used as a non-probabilistic
   metric for operational reliability assessment. Only the condition
   information is needed for computation of the similarity index, thus it
   can be performed conveniently for online assessment. The effectiveness
   of the proposed method is validated by three case studies regarding the
   health assessment of aero-engines subjected to system-level and
   component-level degradation. The positive results demonstrate that the
   proposed SI is an effective metric for operational reliability
   assessment of individual aero-engines.}},

Abstract = {{Both natural climate change and anthropogenic impacts may cause
   nonstationarities in hydrological extremes. In this study, long-term
   annual maximum streamflow (AMS) records from 145 stations over Canada
   were used to investigate the nonstationary characteristics of AMS, which
   include abrupt changes and monotonic temporal trends. The nonparameteric
   Pettitt test was applied to detect abrupt changes, while temporal
   monotonic trend analysis in AMS series was conducted using the
   nonparameteric Mann-Kendall and Spearman tests, as well as a parametric
   Pearson test. Nonstationary frequency analysis of the AMS series was
   done using a group of nonstationary probability distributions. The
   nonstationary characteristics of Canadian AMS were further investigated
   in terms of the Hurst exponent (H), which represents the long-term
   persistence (LTP) of streamflow data. The results presented here
   indicate that for Canadian AMS data, abrupt changes are detected more
   frequently than monotonic trends, partly because many rivers began to be
   regulated in the twentieth century. Drainage basins that have
   experienced significant land-use changes are more likely to show
   temporal trends in AMS, compared to pristine basins with stable land-use
   conditions. The nonstationary characteristics of AMS were accounted for
   by fitting the data with probability distributions with time-varying
   parameters. Large H found in almost 2/3 of the Canadian AMS dataset
   indicates strong LTP, which may partly represent the presence of
   long-term memories in many Canadian river basins. Furthermore, H values
   of AMS data are positively correlated with the basin area of Canadian
   rivers. It seems that nonstationary frequency analysis, instead of the
   traditional stationary hydrologic frequency analysis, should be employed
   in the future.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment of steel plate shear walls under accidental blast
   loads}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{44-56}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Previous research on properly-designed steel plate shear wall systems
   has proven that it has a high level of lateral shear strength and
   stiffness and large ductility. These properties, along with ample
   redundancy, robustness, and superior energy dissipation capacity under
   severe cyclic loading, have made the system a viable lateral force
   resisting system for seismically-active regions. Although similar
   properties are desirable for protective structures, their application in
   this regard has been largely neglected. The potential application of
   some form of the steel plate shear wall as a protective system in
   industrial plants possibly subjected to accidental explosions is studied
   by means of iso-response curves. To capture all important aspects in
   blast response, a comprehensive numerical model is developed. The
   constitutive model for the steel material includes mixed-hardening,
   strain-rate effects, and damage initiation and evolution. The
   pressure-impulse diagrams for both in-plane and out-of-plane blast
   orientations, along with the corresponding weight-standoff distance
   diagrams, are produced with the aid of the numerical model Different
   response criteria and wall sizes are considered. A method is proposed to
   produce dimensionless iso-response curves to broaden their
   applicability. The results show that despite the inherent slenderness of
   the steel members, the wall system has the potential to be an effective
   system for use in a protective structure for industrial plants,
   especially for the in-plane blast load condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Compressive strength and behaviour of gusset plate connections with

Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{166-183}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Due to the ease of fabrication and construction, gusset plate
   connections with single-sided splice members are a popular connection
   type in building frames and light structures. However, this detail
   produces local out-of-plane eccentricity, which can be detrimental to
   the ultimate strength of the connections. This paper presents
   experimental, numerical, and analytical investigations of the
   compressive behaviour of eccentrically loaded gusset plate connections.
   Three full-scale tests were conducted, including two specimens with
   unstiffened splice members and the remaining one with stiffened splice
   members. The ultimate loads of the three specimens were found to be
   evidently less than the concentrically loaded specimen which has been
   earlier reported. Finite element (FE) models were then established,
   which were validated through comparisons against the test results. The
   sensitivity of the FE models to the initial imperfections was also
   studied. An extensive parametric study was subsequently performed, and
   the influences of varying gusset plate and splice member geometric
   configurations were discussed in detail. Three key failure modes were
   identified for the eccentrically loaded gusset plate connections,
   namely, Gusset-Splice Interactive Plastic Failure (G-SIPF), Splice
   Plastic Failure (SPF), and Gusset Plate Buckling (GPB). A et of design
   rules based on the nature of each failure mode was proposed accordingly,
   where good agreements were observed between the FE and the design
   results in terms of both the ultimate load and the governing failure
   mode. Worked examples were finally provided to clearly illustrate the
   proposed design procedure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the adhesion of SU-8 thin films using an AlN/Si surface
   acoustic wave sensor}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A new approach is developed for evaluating the adhesion of SU-8 thin
   films using a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor. The SAW sensor
   consists of a silicon (Si) substrate coated with a thin aluminum nitride
   (AlN) film and two sets of inter-digital electrodes (IDT) patterned on
   the AlN surface. Two sensor configurations are developed in order to
   evaluate the adhesion of SU-8. In the first configuration the SU-8 layer
   is patterned on top of a gold film that is deposited on the AlN surface.
   In the second configuration the gold film is coated with an omnicoat
   layer prior to patterning the SU-8 film. Omnicoat is an adhesion
   promoter for SU-8, which is used to increase its adhesion to gold. The
   frequency responses from both configurations are measured and the shift
   in the center frequency value is evaluated. The results illustrate that
   without omnicoat the center frequency shifts to a higher value
   indicating an increase in the wave velocity. This is because the poor
   adhesion of the SU-8 layer without omnicoat causes the wave to be more
   concentrated in the AlN/Si structure and AlN has a higher acoustic wave
   velocity in comparison to the SU-8 layer. In addition, four SAW sensors
   operating at four different center frequencies are developed to
   investigate the change in sensor sensitivity with the increase in center
   frequency. The results indicate that the sensor sensitivity increases
   proportionally to the increase in operating frequency. Finally, a
   theoretical model is developed to calculate the wave dispersion profile
   for the SU-8/AlN/Si configuration. The interface of the SU-8/AlN layers
   is modeled as a layer of mass-less springs with stiffness K(N m-3). The
   shifts in the wave dispersion profile at different levels of interface
   spring stiffness are compared to the experimental values to evaluate the
   adhesion of the SU-8 layer.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we elaborate on a distributed fuzzy modeling and ensuing
   granular fuzzy modeling. Such modeling is realized in the presence of
   separate and locally available data while the ensuing fuzzy rule-based
   models constructed on their basis are regarded as individual sources of
   knowledge. In virtue of an inherent diversity of these sources (models)
   and in an attempt to quantify it, a global model being formed at the
   higher level of hierarchy is becoming more abstract than those at the
   lower level is referred to as a granular fuzzy model. An essential
   concept of this class of models is introduced and their enhanced
   functionality is studied. Furthermore, we show interesting linkages of
   these models with type-2 fuzzy models studied in the literature. We
   highlight a number of arguments motivating a need and justifiable
   relevance of higher type of information granules. A detailed discussion
   on fuzzy rule-based models exhibiting an interesting aspect of an
   incremental format of the rules (whose rules capture an incremental
   description of input output relationships formed with respect to some
   simple reference model (say, constant or linear) is presented. The
   design practice of the models is elaborated on by highlighting in this
   context the use of augmented fuzzy clustering. The construction of a
   granular fuzzy model is guided by the principle of justifiable
   granularity using which we show how granular parameters of the models
   are formed. The performance of the model is quantified with respect to
   the two criteria, namely coverage of experimental data and specificity
   of granular results. Experimental studies are reported for both
   synthetic and publicly available data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   estimated from R-2{*}/MRI}},
Journal = {{PARKINSONISM \& RELATED DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether, in patients with early Parkinson's
   disease (PD), longitudinal changes in midbrain iron content are
   associated with declining motor function over a period of three years.
   Methods: Nineteen untreated subjects with early PD and 13 age- and
   sex-matched controls were followed clinically for 36 months. MRI with a
   3 T magnet was performed at baseline, 18 months and 36 months with a
   multiple gradient echo sequence designed for rapid single-scan mapping
   of the proton transverse relaxation rate R-2{*}. R-2{*} was calculated
   for midbrain and forebrain basal ganglia regions.
   Results: A difference in R-2{*} between patients and controls was
   observed at baseline (p = 0.035) but not at 18 or 36 months in the
   lateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Linear regression
   indicated significant correlations between the change in R-2{*} in the
   lateral SNc and the change score in UPDRS III (p = 0.008) and the PDQ-39
   -mobility sub-score (p = 0.03) from baseline to 36 months. R-2{*} tended
   to increase in those with more advanced disease and to decrease in those
   with milder disease.
   Conclusions: High field MRI demonstrates lateral SNc abnormalities that
   progress over 3 years in early PD consistent with increased iron content
   in those with more advanced disease, corresponding to the known
   distribution of neuronal loss occurring in this disorder, and
   correlating with motor symptomatology. Larger and longer investigations

Abstract = {{The interaction between bubbles and solid surfaces is central to a broad
   range of industrial and biological processes. Various experimental
   techniques have been developed to measure the interactions of bubbles
   approaching solids in a liquid. A main challenge is to accurately and
   reliably control the relative motion over a wide range of hydrodynamic
   conditions and at the same time to determine the interaction forces,
   bubble-solid separation and bubble deformation. Existing experimental
   methods are able to focus only on one of the aspects of this problem,
   mostly for bubbles and particles with characteristic dimensions either
   below 100 pm or above 1 cm. As a result, either the interfacial
   deformations are measured directly with the forces being inferred from a
   model, or the forces are measured directly with the deformations to be
   deduced from the theory. The recently developed integrated thin film
   drainage apparatus (ITFDA) filled the gap of intermediate
   bubble/particle size ranges that are commonly encountered in mineral and
   oil recovery applications. Equipped with side-view digital cameras along
   with a bimorph cantilever as force sensor and speaker diaphragm as the
   driver for bubble to approach a solid sphere, the ITFDA has the capacity
   to measure simultaneously and independently the forces and interfacial
   deformations as a bubble approaches a solid sphere in a liquid. Coupled
   with the thin liquid film drainage modeling, the ITEDA measurement
   allows the critical role of surface tension, fluid viscosity and bubble
   approach speed in determining bubble deformation (profile) and
   hydrodynamic forces to be elucidated. Here we compare the available
   methods of studying bubble-solid interactions and demonstrate unique
   features and advantages of the ITEDA for measuring both forces and
   bubble deformations in systems of Reynolds numbers as high as 10. The
   consistency and accuracy of such measurement are tested against the well
   established Stokes-Reynolds-Young-Laplace model. The potential to use
   the design principles of the ITFDA for fundamental and developmental
   research is demonstrated. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Nonconventional oil is usually heavy and extra heavy crude or light oil
   that is relatively unstable. This oil contains varying proportions of
   larger, more aromatic constituents rather than molecules that can be
   distilled directly into fuels and petrochemicals. We perform density
   functional theory (B97X-D/6-31G(d,p)) calculations to study the
   contributions of steric effects and dispersion interactions in a series
   of dimers and trimers of model hydrocarbons containing fused aromatic
   and cyclohexyl (referred to in the petroleum literature as naphthenic)
   rings. The aggregation behavior of these molecules is analyzed in terms
   of the optimized geometry, atomic charges, interaction enthalpy (H), and
   Gibbs free energy (G(298)). The H and G(298) values show that all the
   dimerization and trimerization processes are exothermic, and only a few
   are spontaneous at 298K. The naphthenic hydrogen atoms have a key role
   in the orientation of the monomers in dimer and trimer aggregates. The
   interaction among naphthenic hydrogen atoms belonging to adjacent
   monomers causes steric repulsion. The interaction of naphthenic hydrogen
   atoms with the -electronic clouds of aromatic rings in adjacent
   molecules causes attraction. In both cases, the naphthenic hydrogen
   atoms cause deviation of the monomer from the initial parallel displaced
   configuration in dimers and trimers. These results reflect the
   importance of naphthenic rings and their steric interactions in
   determining the relationship between structures of nonconventional
   petroleum constituents and their tendency to aggregate and cause
   fouling. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Effects for Improved DTI Tractography}},

Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{PurposeAn acquisition method that does not increase scan time or
   specific absorption rate is investigated for reducing the deleterious
   effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) partial volume effects on diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. It is based on using a shorter
   repetition time (TR) by means of slice acquisition re-ordering to reduce
   the signal of long T-1 CSF and a non-zero minimum diffusion weighting
   (b-value) to attenuate rapidly diffusing CSF signal with respect to
   brain tissue.
   MethodsA target reduction of the CSF/brain signal ratio from 3.5 to 0.8
   required a TR of 2.5 s and minimum b-value of 425 s/mm(2). This was
   evaluated at 4.7 Tesla in eight healthy young adults for tractography of
   the fornix, which has considerable CSF contamination and is difficult to
   track from standard DTI.
   ResultsThis method effectively reduced CSF signal relative to brain and
   yielded more robust tractography, increased tract volume, increased
   fractional anisotropy, and decreased mean diffusivity in the fornix
   relative to standard DTI.
   ConclusionCSF partial volume effects in DTI can be mitigated in
   acquisition through reduced TR and non-zero minimum diffusion weighting.
   The lack of RF absorption rate or scan time increases is attractive over
   other CSF suppression methods such as inversion recovery. Magn Reson Med

Title = {{Fuzzy clustering of time series data using dynamic time warping distance}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{235-244}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Clustering is a powerful vehicle to reveal and visualize structure of
   data. When dealing with time series, selecting a suitable measure to
   evaluate the similarities/dissimilarities within the data becomes
   necessary and subsequently it exhibits a significant impact on the
   results of clustering. This selection should be based upon the nature of
   time series and the application itself. When grouping time series based
   on their shape information is of interest (shape-based clustering),
   using a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is a desirable choice. Using
   stretching or compressing segments of temporal data, DTW determines an
   optimal match between any two time series. In this way, time series
   exhibiting similar patterns occurring at different time periods, are
   considered as being similar. Although DTW is a suitable choice for
   comparing data with respect to their shape information, calculating the
   average of a collection of time series (which is required in clustering
   methods) based on this distance becomes a challenging problem. As the
   result, employing clustering techniques like K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means
   (where the cluster centers - prototypes are calculated through averaging
   the data) along with the DTW distance is a challenging task and may
   produce unsatisfactory results. In this study, three alternatives for
   fuzzy clustering of time series using DTW distance are proposed. In the
   first method, a DTW-based averaging technique proposed in the
   literature, has been applied to the Fuzzy C-Means clustering. The second
   method considers a Fuzzy C-Medoids clustering, while the third
   alternative comes as a hybrid technique, which exploits the advantages
   of both the Fuzzy C-Means and Fuzzy C-Medoids when clustering time
   series. Experimental studies are reported over a set of time series
   coming from the UCR time series database. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{31-43}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Recently the service industry is transitioning from material-based
   contracting to performance-based contracting. This paradigm shift
   enables the supplier to maximize the profit by attaining the system
   performance goal, while the customer is able to lower the asset
   ownership cost with assured system availability. Prior studies usually
   focus on a single stakeholder, either the supplier or the customer, in
   searching for the optimal decisions. Under game-theoretical framework,
   this paper proposes a multiparty, multi-criteria, and multi-item service
   delivery mechanism to maximize the utilities of all the stakeholders.
   The goals are achieved by jointly optimizing the maintenance, the spares
   inventory, and the repair capacity under the game-theoretical framwork.
   We prove that the supplier's actions on parts replacement time, spares
   stock level and repair cycle times are fully observable to the customer.
   Hence a first-best solution is guaranteed without moral hazard issue.
   Numerical studies from wind industry show that a single or a
   consolidated multi-item contract could be advantageous over multiple
   single-item contracts as it ensures a higher profit margin at a lower
   customer's cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Movable bridges are unique structures due to the complex interaction
   between their structural, mechanical, and electrical systems with an
   intricate interrelation creating several challenges related to operation
   and maintenance. Continuous monitoring of the critical parts of these
   structures is essential to track and evaluate their performance for
   improving maintenance operations and reducing the associated costs. Open
   gears are one of the most critical components of movable bridges. Proper
   and regular maintenance of these gears is vitally important to ensure a
   safe, reliable, and cost-effective operation. In this study, a practical
   and low-cost monitoring approach is presented to track the lubrication
   level in an open gear of a movable bridge by using video cameras. Two
   unique indices are developed for monitoring of the open gear by
   investigating two different image processing methods in a comparative
   fashion. The first methodology is based on an edge detection algorithm
   that utilizes a Sobel gradient operator to determine the edges in the
   open gear image. A lubrication index (LI) based on the edge detection
   results is defined and extracted to determine the lubrication level. The
   second methodology employs a fuzzy neural network-based approach to
   define a lubrication anomaly parameter (LAP) for assessing the
   lubrication level. The analysis results from the real-life application
   show that both methodologies successfully identify the lubrication level
   of the movable bridge's open gear.}},

Title = {{Optimizing Earthmoving Job Planning Based on Evaluation of Temporary
   Haul Road Networks Design for Mass Earthworks Projects}},

Abstract = {{As a critical component of planning mass earthworks projects, designing
   effective haul road networks is conducive to delivering the project on
   time and under budget. The research reported in this paper proposes a
   grid-based temporary road network design method applicable to a site for
   which grading design has been completed. Further adding to the existing
   body of knowledge, a quantitative methodology is proposed for optimizing
   the detailed planning of earthmoving jobs based on a particular
   temporary haul road network design. Each job is defined in terms of the
   source cell, the destination cell, the earth volume, and the
   shortest-hauling-time path between source and destination. Through
   seamless integration of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and linear
   programming model, the shortest average haul time for a truckload can be
   obtained while automatically fulfilling site grading design
   specifications. Based on the resulting average haul time, cost equations
   are defined to account for (1) the direct truck-hauling crew cost; and
   (2) building, maintenance, and removal costs of temporary haul roads. As
   such, the cost associated with executing the optimized earthmoving job
   plan over a particular haul road network design can be readily assessed,
   making it straightforward for project managers to compare alternatives.
   The proposed methodology is demonstrated in steps using a numerical
   example and further applied in a case study based on a real-world
   project in northern Alberta. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Hydropower operations can induce significant variation of velocity field

   this study, the flow fields upstream of a high dam in China under
   different intake and spillway operation patterns were investigated
   theoretically using potential flow solution and computational fluid
   dynamic modeling, and experimentally in a 1:50-scale physical model.
   Flow fields induced by multiple intakes and by a line sink tends to be
   the same at about two times of the distance of adjacent operating intake
   upstream of the intakes. Different operation scenarios were analyzed to
   improve the general understanding of characteristics of upstream flow
   and to reduce the risk of fish entrainment. The extent of the risk zone
   for fish entrainment defined by specified thresholds of velocity and
   acceleration indicate that smaller water depth over submerged intake
   means a higher risk of fish entrainment. (C) 2014 International

Title = {{Effect of partial atomic charges on the calculated free energy of
   solvation of poly(vinyl alcohol) in selected solvents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is well-known that properties of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in the
   pure and solution states depend largely on the hydrogen bonding networks
   formed. In the context of molecular simulation, such networks are
   handled through the Coulombic interactions. Therefore, a good set of
   partial atom charges (PACs) for simulations involving PVA is highly
   desirable. In this work, we calculated the PACs for PVA using a few
   commonly used population analysis schemes with a hope to identify an
   accurate set of PACs for PVA monomers. To evaluate the quality of the
   calculated parameters, we have benchmarked their predictions for free
   energy of solvation (FES) in selected solvents by molecular dynamics
   simulations against the ab initio calculated values. Selected solvents
   were water, ethanol and benzene as they covered a range of size and
   polarity. Also, PVA with different tacticities were used to capture
   their effect on the calculated FESs. Based on our results, neither PACs
   nor FESs are affected by the chain tacticity. While PACs predicted by
   the Merz-Singh-Kollman scheme were close to original values in the
   OPLS-AA force field in way that no significant difference in properties
   of pure PVA was observed, free energy of solvation calculated using such
   PACs showed greater agreement with ab initio calculated values than
   those calculated by OPLS-AA (and all other schemes used in this work) in
   all three solvents considered.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Indentation testing has been developed as an unconventional method to
   determine intact rock strength using small rock specimens within the
   size of drill cuttings. In previous investigations involving indentation
   testing, researchers have used different indenter stylus geometries,
   penetration rate (PR) and specimen sizes. These dissimilarities can
   restrict applications of this method for strength measurement and lead
   to non-comparable results. This paper investigates the influence of
   indenter diameter (ID) and PR on indentation indices for carbonate rocks
   to provide objective comparison and application of the existing
   correlations. As part of this research, several indentation tests were
   conducted using different IDs and PRs. The laboratory test results
   showed that indentation indices can be affected by ID while PR has only
   minor effect on the indentation indices. Thus, a normalizing function
   was presented to reduce the dependency of test results to ID.
   Verification of the findings with independent data confirms the
   suitability of the suggested normalizing function in determining the
   rock uniaxial compressive strength using testing data obtained from
   various IDs and PRs.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Measures to limit greenhouse gas concentrations will result in dramatic
   changes to energy and land systems and in turn alter the character of
   human requirements for water. We employ the global change assessment
   model (GCAM), an integrated assessment model, to explore the
   interactions of energy, land, and water systems under combinations of
   three alternative radiative forcing stabilization levels and two carbon
   tax regimes. The paper analyzes two important research questions: i) how
   large may global irrigation water demands become over the next century,
   and ii) what are the potential impacts of emissions mitigation policies
   on global irrigation-water withdrawals. We find that increasing
   population and economic growth could more than double the demand for
   water for agricultural systems in the absence of climate policy, and
   policies to mitigate climate change further increase agricultural
   demands for water. The largest increases in agricultural irrigation
   water demand occur in scenarios where only fossil fuel emissions are
   priced (but not land use change emissions) and are primarily driven by
   rapid expansion in bio-energy production. Regions such as China, India,
   and other countries in South and East Asia are likely to experience the
   greatest increases in water demands. Finally, we test the sensitivity of
   water withdrawal demands to the share of bio-energy crops under
   irrigation and conclude that many regions have insufficient space for
   heavy bio-energy crop irrigation in the future-a result that calls into
   question the physical possibility of producing the associated biomass
   energy, especially under climate policy scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDAs a result of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
   emergence, certain tissues of cattle are categorized as specified risk
   material (SRM) and completely banned from their traditional applications
   as an ingredient in animal feed, pet food, or fertilizer applications.
   The goal of this study was to investigate the hydrolysis of such
   hazardous proteinacious biomass and extract a safe proteinacious
   fraction to produce industrial feedstock for value-added applications.
   RESULTSThe SRM was hydrolyzed at subcritical temperatures of 180, 200,
   220, 240, and 260 degrees C for 40min according to government-approved
   protocols. The recovery and cleavage of proteins and lipids, the
   generation and degradation of free and total amino acids, and the
   generation of organic acids were studied and found to be
   temperature-dependent. The yield of the hydrolyzed and recovered
   proteinacious fractions varied between 71.6 and 87.6\% by weight of the
   original protein content in the SRM. The molecular size was also
   significantly dependent on the hydrolysis temperature.
   CONCLUSIONThe valorization of an otherwise waste SRM by subcritical
   hydrolysis and recovery techniques resulted in protein hydrolyzates
   suitable for bio-based chemicals and materials applications. The
   increase of temperature resulted in higher degrees of hydrolysis as
   shown by the smaller molecular size of hydrolyzed proteins. (c) 2014

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{67-80}},

Abstract = {{With the wide adoption of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation
   for rice production, the water and nitrogen (N) fate in lowland paddy
   fields under AWD irrigation was needed to be investigated for assessing
   the water saving and environmental effects of AWD, compared to
   traditional continuously flooded (CF) irrigation. The HYDRUS-1D software
   package was used to simulate water movement, and N transport
   ancitransformations in experimental paddy fields under AWD and CF
   irrigation during 2007 and 2008. The variation in N transformation
   between AWD and CF paddy fields due to different water regimes in soil
   profiles were represented by time-varying boundary conditions and N
   transformation parameters that are dependent on soil water content.
   Simulations show that AWD irrigation decreased 27.8 and 19.0\% of
   percolation, 5.0-11.2\% and 3.0-23.5\% of N leaching losses in 2007 and
   2008, respectively, compared to CF irrigation. However, AWD irrigation
   increased 6.0-22.0\% and 2.5-11.7\% of N losses of volatilization, and
   6.3-9.4\% and 4.5-7.6\% of nitrification, as well as 6.7-19.8\% and
   4.1-11.2\% of denitrification in 2007 and 2008, respectively. These
   results reflect the intensified nitrification-denitrification processes
   that were caused by the relatively high ammonium concentration, and
   alternate aerobic and anaerobic environment in AWD paddy fields. The
   increased nitrate, which was formed from nitrification of ammonium in
   drying (aerobic) phase, can be easily denitrified to N-2 or N2O in the
   wetting (anaerobic) phase. Therefore, the practice of AWD irrigation

Abstract = {{In the era of advanced methodologies and practices of system modeling,
   we are faced with ever growing challenges of building models of complex
   systems that are in full rapport with reality. These challenges are
   multifaceted. Human centricity becomes of paramount relevance in system
   modeling and because of this models need to be customized and easily
   interpretable. More and more visibly, experimental data and knowledge of
   varying quality being directly acquired from experts have to be
   efficiently utilized in the construction of models. The quality of data
   and ensuing quality of models have to be prudently quantified. There are
   ongoing and even exacerbated challenges to build intelligent systems,
   modeling multifaceted phenomena, and deliver efficient models that help
   users describe and understand systems and support processes of
   decision-making. We have to become fully cognizant that processing and
   modeling has to be realized with the use of entities endowed with
   well-defined semantics, namely information granules. Human do not
   perceive reality and reason in terms of numbers but rather utilize more
   abstract constructs (information granules), which are helpful in setting
   up a certain cognitive perspective and ignore irrelevant details when
   dealing with the complexity of the systems.
   To make this study self-contained, we briefly recall the key concepts of
   granular computing and demonstrate how this conceptual framework and its
   algorithmic fundamentals give rise to granular models. We discuss
   several representative formal setups used in describing and processing
   information granules including fuzzy sets, rough sets, and interval
   calculus. Key architectures of models dwell upon relationships among
   information granules. We demonstrate how information granularity and its
   optimization can be regarded as an important design asset to be
   exploited in system modeling and giving rise to granular models. With
   this regard, an important category of rule-based models along with their
   granular enrichments is studied in detail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a performance characterization and efficient
   modeling of the dc-side interactions between renewable dc resources and
   interfacing voltage-source inverters (VSIs). The VSI is considered in
   both grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. On the other side,
   the dc source is modeled by an equivalent and a detailed circuit. In the
   former, an ideal current-source in parallel to a dc capacitor is used to
   represent a non-dispatchable source whereas an ideal dc voltage source
   is used to represent a dispatchable dc source. In the latter, an
   additional dc/dc boost converter interfaces the dc source to regulate
   the input dc-link voltage of the VSI. In all topologies,
   computationally-efficient small-signal admittance-based models, i. e.
   transfer-functions, are thoroughly developed for the dc source as well
   as the VSI. Using the Nyquist stability criterion, it is shown that the
   dc-link voltage dynamics is negatively affected under some operating
   conditions. The worst performance is yielded when the dc source is
   modeled by an ideal voltage source where the dc-link voltage is not
   controlled by the VSI. On the contrary, the dc/dc boost converter
   enhances the system damping. The dc-link voltage-controlling VSIs show
   the most damped performance. In order to enhance the system damping,
   active stabilizing compensators are proposed and embedded in the
   conventional control structure of VSIs. Large-signal time-domain
   simulation model is implemented under Matlab/Simulink environment to
   validate the small-signal models and show the effectiveness of the
   proposed compensators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{146-155}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The paper studied the effects of slurry chemistry on erosion of carbon
   steel. According to experimental measurements, the erosion rate in
   corroding slurries was a linear function of logarithm of anodic current
   density. In near-neutral or alkaline slurries, the erosion rates are
   independent of solution chemistry while the erosion rates in the acidic
   slurries were sensitive to slurry chemistry. To investigate the
   underlying mechanism, the in-situ surface hardness in corroding
   environments was measured with the nano-indentation technique under
   galvanostatic control. The results indicated that the surface hardness
   would decrease as anodic current was applied. The surface hardness
   degradation in near-neutral or alkaline electrolytes were almost
   unaffected by solution chemistry but that in acidic electrolyte depended
   heavily on solution chemistry. A linear correlation between the
   accelerated erosion and surface hardness degradation indicated that
   corrosion-induced surface-hardness degradation would be the dominant
   mechanism of corrosion-enhanced erosion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{204}},
Pages = {{43-49}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Vanadium silicate EVS-10 is analogous to ETS-10 except that vanadium
   completely substitutes for titanium in the structure. This study
   compares the structural and adsorptive characteristics of EVS-10 with
   ETS-10. The structures were characterized by powder XRD, EDX, argon
   physisorption, and SEM/TEM. The Henry law constants and heats of
   adsorption were calculated for both adsorbents from low pressure
   adsorption data using CH4, C2H6, C2H4, N-2, O-2, and CO2 for pressures
   up to 100 kPa and temperatures of 303, 323, and 343 K. The adsorption
   data were fit using Langmuir, Toth, and Redlich-Peterson isotherms. The
   best model was selected based on the quality of fit to the data and how
   closely the model predicted the saturation concentration compared to the
   value calculated from the measured pore volume data. The structural
   properties for EVS-10 are almost indistinguishable from ETS-10. The
   adsorption data reflects this similarity in that both adsorbents have
   similar heats of adsorption and selectivities for a wide range of gases.
   These results suggest that heteroatom substitution in ETS-10 does not
   necessarily affect its adsorption properties if the framework dimensions
   and composition remain similar. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{ETS-10, a mixed octahedral/tetrahedral titanosilicate molecular sieve,
   has a unique architecture where its 0.8 nm pores are lined exclusively
   with silicon which imparts a high degree of chemical stability, yet the
   anionic framework can be modified by cation exchange. In this work, the
   hydrogen-exchanged form of ETS-10 was impregnated with monoethanolamine
   and the thermal stability and CO2 adsorption characteristics were
   analyzed. The surface area of the material was characterized by N-2
   physisorption, the thermal stability of the material assessed through
   TG-MS experiments, the CO2 capacity was measured via static volumetric
   adsorption experiments, and the influence of moisture as a carbamate
   promoter was investigated through a series of gravimetric CO2
   adsorption/desorption cycling experiments. Several measurements converge
   on similar to 7 wt\% monoethanolamine loading which occupies about half
   of the available pore volume of the sieve. The results suggest that the
   monoethanolamine is so effectively retained by the molecular sieve that,
   while the amine is effectively immobilized, under both humid and dry
   process streams the monoethanolamine is either chemically or sterically
   hindered and is unable to react measurable quantities of CO2.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Although we often think about crystalline materials in terms of highly
   organized arrays of atoms, molecules, or even colloidal particles, many
   of the important properties of this diverse class of materials relating
   to their catalytic behavior, thermodynamic stability, and mechanical
   properties derive from the dynamics and thermodynamics of their
   interfacial regions, which we find they have a dynamics more like
   glass-forming (GF) liquids than crystals at elevated temperatures. This
   is a general problem arising in any attempt to model the properties of
   naturally occurring crystalline materials since many aspects of the
   dynamics of glass-forming liquids remain mysterious. We examine the
   nature of this phenomenon in the ``simple{''} case of the (110)
   interface of crystalline Ni, based on a standard embedded-atom model
   potential, and we then quantify the collective dynamics in this
   interfacial region using newly developed methods for characterizing the
   cooperative dynamics of glass-forming liquids. As in our former studies
   of the interfacial dynamics of grain-boundaries and the interfacial
   dynamics of crystalline Ni nanoparticles (NPs), we find that the
   interface of bulk crystalline Ni exhibits all the characteristics of
   glass-forming materials, even at temperatures well below the equilibrium
   crystal melting temperature, T-m. This perspective offers a new approach
   to modeling and engineering the properties of crystalline materials. (C)

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing has been employed to produce metal matrix
   composites by incorporating reinforcement particles in an Al 5059
   matrix. The fabrication method involved repeated friction stir passes on
   a groove which contained powder reinforcements, with different
   processing parameters and tool geometries used for each pass. Various
   particles with sizes from 130 nm to 4.3 mu m, and different process
   parameters were examined to obtain a uniform distribution of particles
   within the stir zone. Mechanical properties (i.e. tensile and
   microhardness) of the Al 5059 matrix MMCs reinforced with Al2O3, SiC,
   and B4C with particle sizes of 130, 250, and 35 nm respectively were
   compared. Tensile tests showed 11\%, 20\%, and 38\% increases in yield
   strength compared to the matrix alloy for composites containing
   nano-scale Al2O3, SiC, and B4C, respectively. When 4.3 mu m Al2O3
   particles were employed, higher volume fractions could be achieved which
   resulted in a 32\% increase in yield strength compared to the base
   metal. The average microhardness value within the stir zone increased
   from 85 HV in the base material to a maximum of 170 HV in the
   B4C-reinforced composite. Nano-scale particles seem to be more effective
   to increase hardness by increasing the particle fraction in the produced
   composites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of aluminum content
   on the twinning and texture evolution of cast magnesium alloys during
   compression. As-cast AZ31, AZ61, and AZ91D magnesium alloys exhibited
   basically a random orientation. Compressive deformation resulted in the
   formation of \{(1) over bar2 (1) over bar0\} {[}0001] and \{01 (1) over
   bar0\} {[}0001] texture components, indicating that the c-axes of hcp
   unit cells in most grains were rotated toward the anti-compression
   direction due to the occurrence of extension twinning. The intensity of
   the texture components increased with increasing compressive strain. The
   presence of a higher amount of beta-Mg17Al12 precipitates arising from
   more Al content in alloy AZ91D hindered the formation and growth of
   twins which led to the weakening of deformation texture of the high
   Al-containing magnesium alloy at higher compressive strains. (C) 2014

Pages = {{289-300}},

Abstract = {{Thin, low Platinum loading polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)
   electrodes fabricated by inkjet printing are investigated. Catalyst
   coated membranes (CCMs) with Pt loading of 0.026mg(Pt)/cm(2), catalyst
   layer thickness between 1.5 and 2 mu m and varying Nafion loadings (NL)
   on the cathode electrodes of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt\% are analyzed.
   Ex-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) visualization shows that the
   layers are porous and composed of Pt/C aggregates binded by ionomer.
   In-situ electrochemical testing shows that the Tafel slope of these
   electrodes is relatively large, i.e., 120 mV/dec. Further, at 80 degrees
   C and varying relative humidities, the CCMs are not sensitive to Nafion
   loading changes within the 20 wt\% 40 wt\% range. Proton transport
   limitations are only observed at low NL of 10 wt\% while transport
   losses are only observed at high currents for CCM with 50 wt\% NL.
   Comparing conventional and thin, low loading, inkjet printed electrodes,
   the inkjet printed electrodes show a much higher sensitivity to oxygen
   partial pressures. These results suggest that macro-scale oxygen and
   proton transport are not limiting the electrode at the 20 wt\% - 40 wt\%
   Nafion range. Pt mass activity for the inkjet CCM at ambient pressure
   was observed to be 196 A/mgPt (12.4kW g(Pt)(-1)), i.e., 10 times higher
   than a spray coated CCM, due to its reduced CL thickness and thereby
   reduced transport losses in the macro-scale. The Pt utilization at 2 bar
   gauge pressure is 47.6kW g(Pt)(-1) and represents one of the highest
   utilization values reported for low Pt loading electrodes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Mercury is a toxic air pollutant, emitted from the combustion of coal.
   Activated Carbon (AC) or other carbon sorbent (CS) injection into coal
   combustion flue gases can remove elemental mercury through an adsorption
   process. Recently, a brominated CS with biomass ash as the carbon source
   (Br-Ash) was developed as an alternative for costly AC-based sorbent for
   mercury capture. After mercury capture, these sorbents are disposed in
   landfill, and the stability of bromine and captured mercury is of
   paramount importance. The objective of this study is to determine the
   fate of mercury and bromine from Br-Ash and brominated AC after their
   service. Mercury and bromine leaching tests were conducted using the
   standard toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). The mercury
   was found to be stable on both the BrAsh and commercial brominated AC
   sorbents, while the bromine leached into the aqueous phase considerably.
   Mercury pulse injection tests on the sorbent material after leaching
   indicate that both sorbents retain significant mercury capture
   capability even after the majority of bromine was removed. Testing of
   the Br-Ash sorbent over a wider range of pH and liquid:solid ratios
   resulted in leaching of <5\% of mercury adsorbed on the Br-Ash. XPS
   analysis indicated more organically bound Br and less metalBr bonds
   after leaching.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{Engelhard titanosilicate-2 (ETS-2) has shown to be a promising substrate
   to load active sites for deep H2S removal (to sub-ppm levels) for gas
   purification applications at room temperature. Because of the high
   external surface area and the cation exchange capacity of ETS-2, active
   sites can be highly dispersed and very accessible to H2S molecules
   making it a novel support material for metal-oxide H2S adsorbents. In
   this paper, we report the room temperature H2S breakthrough performances
   of ETS-2 metal exchanged with Ag, Ca, Cu and 7n in comparison to a fully
   developed commercial H2S adsorbent (R3-11G, 36 wt\% CuO, BASF). The
   results indicate the following trend for H2S uptake capacities at room
   temperature: Cu-ETS-2 > Ag-ETS-2 > Zn-ETS-2 approximate to R3-11G >
   Ca-ETS-2 approximate to Na-ETS-2. Cu exchanged ETS-2 displays the
   highest H2S capacity of 29.7 mg H2S/g adsorbent compared to the other
   investigated materials, making it the most promising metal exchanged
   ETS-2 for room temperature desulfurization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The initial stages of ALD surface reactions are probed using dynamic in
   situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (d-iSE) technique during plasma-enhanced
   ALD of zirconium nitride (ZrN) thin films in spectral range of 0.73-6.4
   eV. The measured change in the ellipsometry parameter Delta, with every
   precursor (TDMAZr) and reactant (forming gas plasma) exposure is
   interpreted as the combined effect of film growth and change in surface
   chemistry during ALD. We present application of Bruggeman's
   effective-medium approximation (B-EMA) in the analysis of d-iSE data to
   determine fractional surface coverage (theta) of ALD grown film at the
   end of every deposition cycle. During the deposition of first few ZrN
   monolayers, d-iSE datasets are analyzed on the basis of surface
   diffusion enhanced ALD growth, where the surface adsorbed precursor
   molecules can diffuse over substrate surface to occupy energetically
   favorable surface sites. The determined surface coverage of ZrN films
   highlights the effects of substrate enhanced ALD growth. (C) 2014

Title = {{Effect of ozonation on the naphthenic acids' speciation and toxicity of
   pH-dependent organic extracts of oil sands process-affected water}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{506}},

Abstract = {{The presence of naphthenic acids (NAs) and other organic constituents in
   oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) stored in tailings ponds, poses
   a serious environmental threat due to their potential toxicity to
   aquatic organisms and wild life. In this work, four fractions of OSPW,
   extracted by dichloromethane at different pHs, were ozonated to
   determine the ozone impact on NAs degradation. Extracts distributions
   showed that high carbon number NAs (14-22) were associated with higher
   pH fractions (pH > 7) and smaller carbon number NAs (7-13) with lower pH
   fractions (pH <= 7). Extracts showed similar hydrogen deficiency
   (Z-number) patterns centered on Z = 6. Analysis of the speciation of NAs
   and oxidized NAs in the four fractions showed that ozonation degraded
   most NAs (55\% to 98\%). Despite the high degradation levels, there was
   still significant toxicity of the fractions toward goldfish macrophages
   and measurable toxicity toward Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity of such a
   complex matrix as OSPW may be attributed to other organic compounds and
   degradation by-products not currently detected. Thus, there is a need to
   elucidate which compounds are responsible for the remaining OSPW
   toxicity and to determine if combined processes, such as ozonation
   followed by biological treatment, are able to completely detoxify OSPW.
   This work is taking the first steps into this direction, narrowing down
   the range of compounds which might be responsible for the toxicity. (C)

   Nanocrystalline alpha-iron: an Atomistic Study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Claims are often found in the literature that metallic materials can be
   nanocrystallized by severe plastic deformation (SPD). However, SPD does
   not generate a well-defined nanocrystalline (NC) material, which can be
   achieved by subsequent annealing/recovery treatment. In this study,
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to study the effect of
   annealing on structure and mechanical properties of cyclic deformed NC
   alpha-iron, which simulates SPD-processed alpha-iron. It is demonstrated
   that grain boundaries in the deformed NC alpha-iron evolve to a more
   equilibrium state during annealing, eliminating or minimizing the
   residual stress. The annealing treatment increases the system's strength
   by reducing dislocation emission sources, and improves material
   ductility through strengthening grain boundaries' resistance to
   intergranular cracks. The results indicate that the annealing treatment
   is an essential process for obtaining a well-defined NC structure with
   superior mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate here a local- and remote-control of gel disintegration by
   using photoinduced proton transfer chemistry of photoacid generator
   (PAG). The gels were prepared by simply mixing two polymers,
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-5-methacrylamido-1,2-benzoxaborole)
   (P(NIPAAm-co-MAAmBO)) and poly(3-gluconamidopropyl methacrylamide)
   (PGAPMA) via the synergistic interaction of benzoxaborole and diol
   groups. The o-nitrobenzaldehyde (o-NBA) was then loaded into the gel as
   a PAG. The benzoxaborole-diol interaction was successfully disintegrated
   upon UV irradiation due to the local pH decrease inside the gel. When
   the gel was irradiated to a specific gel region, the synergistic
   interactions were disintegrated only at the exposed region. Of special
   interest is that the whole material eventually transitioned from gel to
   sol state, as the generated protons diffused gradually toward the
   nonilluminated region. The ability of the proposed gelsol transition
   system via photoinduced proton diffusion may be beneficial for not only
   prompt pH changes within the gel but also the design of predictive and
   programmable devices for drug delivery.}},

Title = {{Nanofiltration of oil sands boiler feed water: Effect of pH on water
   flux and organic and dissolved solid rejection}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{339-353}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Nanoflltration (NF) is a promising advanced treatment technique for
   oilfield wastewaters. In this study, we performed a crossflow NF on
   model boiler feed water (BFW) obtained from a thermal in-situ bitumen
   recovery process called steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) with the
   intent to remove dissolved organic matter and silica. Nanofiltration
   with a tight NF membrane was selected as the treatment technique since
   it provided reasonable product quality in a single-stage process and was
   found to be more energy efficient than reverse osmosis (RO). Two
   different feed pH values, 8.5 and 10.5, were investigated. Total organic
   carbon (TOC) and Si rejection of approximately 98\% and divalent cation
   rejection greater than 99\% was achieved at both pH values. Higher total
   dissolved solids (TDS) rejection, but lower flux rates were seen at pH
   8.5 compared to pH 10.5. Surface characterization of the fouled
   membranes indicated the presence of organics (primarily carbon and
   oxygen) and inorganics (mainly silicon and iron) in the fouling
   deposits. Larger amounts of deposit were seen at pH 8.5 compared to pH
   10.5. Increasing feed pH from 8.5 to 10.5 recovered the water flux more
   than 20\% which demonstrated the critical role of pH as a pulsation
   technique to reduce membrane fouling. Fluorescence excitation emission
   matrix spectros-copy (FEEMs) on the feed and permeate showed that the
   organic matter that passed through the membrane was mainly hydrophilic
   compounds. Overall, this research indicated that NF is a viable
   treatment process for silica and TOC removal for SAGD BFW. (C) 2014

Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{53-59}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{The free volume model is probably the most successful model for
   predicting the diffusivity of small molecules in polymers. However, the
   experimental procedure for parameterizing the model is not trivial and
   in fact extremely time consuming. In this work, we propose a much less
   time consuming approach for the parameterization step. In particular, we
   carried out isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics simulations to
   generate thermodynamic data of a few selected polymer/solvent systems
   and used the data to parameterize the corresponding Sanchez-Lacombe
   equation of state (SLEOS). The characteristic parameters of the SLEOS
   were then used in the parameterization of the lattice free volume (LFV)
   model so that diffusivity of the solvents in a polymer was then
   determined. To illustrate the newly proposed approach, we used
   poly(vinyl alcohol) and water, ethanol and benzene over a concentration
   range of 1 -20 wt\% and a temperature range of 270-370 K. We found that
   the LW model was much easier to be parametrized in the aforementioned
   approach and yielded predictions much better than those of the
   well-known Mackie-Meares model. We also demonstrated that the two
   adjustable parameters of the LW model are related to the size of the
   solvent molecules and their interaction with the polymer. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{A microbead-assisted planar microwave resonator for organic vapor
   sensing applications is presented. The core of this sensor is a planar
   microstrip split-ring resonator, integrated with an active feedback loop
   to enhance the initial quality factor from 200 to similar to 1M at an
   operational resonance frequency of 1.42 GHz. Two different types of
   microbeads, beaded activated carbon (BAC) and polymer based (V503)
   beads, are investigated in non-contact mode for use as gas adsorbents in
   the gas sensing device. 2-Butoxyethanol (BE) is used in various
   concentrations as the target gas, and the transmitted power (S21) of the
   two port resonator is measured. The two main microwave parameters of
   resonance frequency and quality factor are extracted from S21 since
   these parameters are less susceptible to environmental and instrumental
   noise than the amplitude. Measured results demonstrate a minimum
   resonance frequency shift of 10 kHz for a 35 ppm concentration of BE
   exposure to carbon beads and 160 kHz for the polymer based adsorbent at
   the same concentration. The quality factor of the resonator also changed
   for different concentrations, but a distinguishable variation is
   observed for the BAC adsorbents. The high quality factor of the sensor
   provides the opportunity of real time monitoring of the adsorbent
   behaviors in remote sensing mode with very high resolution. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a highly efficient, scalable approach to the
   total synthesis of conformationally unrestricted, electronically
   isolated arrays of alkyl-tethered polycyclic aromatic chromophores. This
   new class of modular molecules consists of polycyclic aromatic islands
   comprising significant structural fragments present in unrefined heavy
   petroleum, tethered together by short saturated alkyl chains, as
   represented in the archipelago model of asphaltene structure. The most
   highly branched archipelago compounds reported here share an
   architecture with first-generation dendrimeric constructs, making the
   convergent, chromatography-free synthesis described herein particularly
   attractive for further extensions in scope and applications to materials
   chemistry. The syntheses are efficient, selective, and readily adaptable
   to a multigram scale, requiring only inexpensive, ``earth-abundant{''}
   transition-metal catalysts for cross-coupling reactions and extraction
   and fractional crystallization for purification. This approach avoids
   typical limitations in cost, scale, and operational practicality. All of
   the archipelago compounds and synthetic intermediates have been fully
   characterized spectroscopically and analytically. The solid-state
   structure of one archipelago model compound has been determined by X-ray
   crystallography.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of CO2 over a CoPt/Al2O3 catalyst was investigated.
   Single-gas adsorption studies indicated that carbon was deposited on the
   catalyst by exposure to both CO2 and CO in the absence of H-2 cofeed.
   When CO2 was preadsorbed followed by H-2 flow, methane was produced, as
   well as traces of C-3-C-4 hydrocarbons, but no evidence of the reverse
   water gas shift reaction was found. Use was made of carbon-14-labeled
   carbon dioxide to track CO2 conversion and selectivity during reaction
   of syngas mixtures with different ratios of CO, CO2, and H-2. Absence of
   C-14 in unconverted CO and the unequal molar concentration of C-14 in
   the products from reaction at 220 degrees C and 2 MPa provided strong
   evidence that (CO2)-C-14 was not converted by the reverse water gas
   shift reaction. The antecedence of the carbon from CO2 mattered, and the
   carbon did not become part of a common carbon pool for hydrocarbon
   synthesis. Conversion of CO2 proceeded by a pathway separate from CO.
   Conclusions drawn from this experimental study were employed to
   determine implications for the industrial application of Co-catalyzed
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a microfluidics-based approach capable of
   continuously characterizing instantaneous Young's modulus
   (E-instantaneous) and specific membrane capacitance (C-specific
   membrane) of suspended single cells. In this method, cells were
   aspirated through a constriction channel while the cellular entry
   process into the constriction channel was recorded using a high speed
   camera and the impedance profiles at two frequencies (1 kHz and 100 kHz)
   were simultaneously measured by a lock-in amplifier. Numerical
   simulations were conducted to model cellular entry process into the
   constriction channel, focusing on two key parameters: instantaneous
   aspiration length (L-instantaneous) and transitional aspiration length
   (L-transitional), which was further translated to E-instantaneous. An
   equivalent distribution circuit model for a cell travelling in the
   constriction channel was used to determine C-specific membrane. A
   non-small-cell lung cancer cell line 95C (n = 354) was used to evaluate
   this technique, producing E-instantaneous of 2.96 +/- 0.40 kPa and
   C-specific membrane of 1.59 +/- 0.28 mu F/cm(2). As a platform for
   continuous and simultaneous characterization of cellular E-instantaneous

Abstract = {{Laboratory and field data, although limited in number, have shown that
   steam/solvent coinjection can lead to a higher oil-production rate,
   higher ultimate oil recovery, and lower steam/oil ratio, compared with
   steam-only injection in steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). However,
   a critical question still remains unanswered: Under what circumstances
   can the previously mentioned benefits be obtained when steam and solvent
   are coinjected? To answer this question requires a detailed knowledge of
   the mechanisms involved in coinjection and an application of this
   knowledge to numerical simulation. Our earlier studies demonstrated that
   the determining factors for improved oil-production rates are relative
   positions with respect to the temperature and solvent fronts, the steam
   and solvent contents of the chamber at its interface with reservoir
   bitumen, and solvent-diluting effects on the mobilized bitumen just
   ahead of the chamber edge. Then, the key mechanisms for improved oil
   displacement are solvent propagation, solvent accumulation at the
   chamber edge, and phase transition.
   This paper deals with this unanswered question by providing some key
   guidelines for selecting an optimum solvent and its concentration in
   coinjection of a single-component solvent with steam. The optimization
   considers the oil-production rate, ultimate oil recovery, and solvent
   retention in situ. Multiphase behavior of water/hydrocarbon mixtures in
   the chamber is explained in detail analytically and numerically. The
   proposed guidelines are applied to simulation of the Senlac
   solvent-aided-process pilot and the Long Lake expanding-solvent SAGD
   pilot.
   Results show that an optimum volatility of solvent can be typically
   observed in terms of the oil-production rate for given operation
   conditions. This optimum volatility occurs as a result of the balance
   between two factors affecting the oil mobility along the chamber edge:
   reduction of the chamber-edge temperature and superior dilution of oil
   in coinjection of more-volatile solvent with steam. It is possible to
   maximize oil recovery and minimize solvent retention in situ by
   controlling the concentration of a given coinjection solvent. Beginning
   coinjection immediately after achieving interwell communication enables
   the enhancement of oil recovery early in the process. Subsequently, the
   solvent concentration should be gradually decreased until it becomes
   zero for the final period of the coinjection. Simulation case studies
   show the validity of the oil-recovery mechanisms described. In the final
   section of the paper, a limited economic analysis of SAGD and different
   coinjection cases is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Flow of three phases, of which one is miscible with another, in porous
   media may commonly be encountered during enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR)
   applications in oil reservoirs. Typical examples include solvent
   (miscible-gas) injection alternated with water and coinjection or
   alternate injection of steam (or hot water) and solvent in
   heavy-oil/bitumen reservoirs. Oil, water, and solvent flow together
   under immiscible (water/oil and water/solvent) and miscible
   (oil/solvent) conditions at the same time, and the distribution of
   phases and removal of residual oil in those types of processes depend on
   many parameters. This paper reports microscale experimental
   investigations on this complex flow process and provides an extensive
   parametric analysis on the microscopic displacement efficiency of oil
   recovery using miscible solvent. For this purpose, micromodels created
   by use of a replica of sandstones were used.
   Waterflood residual-oil displacement requires contact of the injected
   solvent with the blocked oil. The efficiency of this process depends on
   several parameters, including matrix wettability, oil viscosity, initial
   water saturation, and reservoir heterogeneity. On the other hand, the
   sequence of injection of solvent and water is considered as another
   parameter by which oil recovery can be affected significantly. The
   results of the micromodel-visualization experiments showed that
   injection of solvent before the introduction of any water to the
   reservoir can increase the recovery factor significantly. Existence of
   the water phase in the reservoir creates capillary barriers that prevent
   oil/solvent contact. The matrix wettability and oil viscosity were
   observed to be critically important to the amount of oil recovery.}},

Title = {{Optimizing Well Trajectories in Steam-Assisted-Gravity-Drainage
   Reservoir Development}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-68}},

Abstract = {{An important task before starting a steam-assisted-gravity-drainage
   operation is optimizing the location of the well trajectories. There are
   shale barriers and other heterogeneous features at different positions
   in these reservoirs. Steam cannot pass a thick shale barrier. Also, if
   there is a shale barrier between the injector and producer, oil cannot
   drain to the producer. For these reasons, optimizing the injector-and
   producer-well trajectories is important. Running the reservoir simulator
   is time-consuming, and running trial-and-error cases to optimize the
   producer and injector trajectories is not practical. On the other hand,
   robust well-trajectory optimization must consider uncertainty in the
   reservoir parameters. This optimization problem cannot be solved by
   calling the simulator for many possible trajectories and geostatistical
   realizations. To tackle this problem, a new semianalytical approximate
   thermal simulator modeled after Butler's theory (a proxy) has been
   developed and tested on different synthetic and realistic
   history-matched 2D and 3D models (Dehdari and Deutsch 2013; Dehdari
   2014). Many modifications, extensions, and improvements have been made
   to Butler's original model. This proxy can be used as a substitute to
   the reservoir simulator.
   In this paper, two methods are tested for well-trajectory optimization.
   The first method is based on random sampling from a 3D box that has been
   selected for drilling wells. Then, the differential-
   evolution-optimization algorithm has been used for automatically
   improving the trajectory location. The second method is based on
   parameterizing the trajectory by use of a Hermite spline, then
   optimizing the parameters of the spline. The producer and injector
   trajectories of a realistic model with a single realization and a
   synthetic model with 100 realizations have been optimized by use of
   these methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background: An international Delphi panel has defined a harmonized
   protocol (HarP) for the manual segmentation of the hippocampus on MR.
   The aim of this study is to study the concurrent validity of the HarP
   toward local protocols, and its major sources of variance.
   Methods: Fourteen tracers segmented 10 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) cases scanned at 1.5 T and 3T following local
   protocols, qualified for segmentation based on the HarP through a
   standard web-platform and resegmented following the HarP. The five most
   accurate tracers followed the HarP to segment 15 ADNI cases acquired at
   three time points on both 1.5 T and 3T.
   Results: The agreement among tracers was relatively low with the local
   protocols (absolute left/right ICC 0.44/0.43) and much higher with the
   HarP (absolute left/right ICC 0.88/0.89). On the larger set of 15 cases,
   the HarP agreement within (left/right ICC range: 0.94/0.95 to 0.99/0.99)
   and among tracers (left/right ICC range: 0.89/0.90) was very high. The
   volume variance due to different tracers was 0.9\% of the total,
   comparing favorably to variance due to scanner manufacturer (1.2),
   atrophy rates (3.5), hemispheric asymmetry (3.7), field strength (4.4),
   and significantly smaller than the variance due to atrophy (33.5\%, P <
   .001), and physiological variability (49.2\%, P < .001).
   Conclusions: The HarP has high measurement stability compared with local
   segmentation protocols, and good reproducibility within and among human
   tracers. Hippocampi segmented with the HarP can be used as a reference
   for the qualification of human tracers and automated segmentation
   algorithms. (C) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: This study aimed to have international experts converge on a
   harmonized definition of whole hippocampus boundaries and segmentation
   procedures, to define standard operating procedures for magnetic
   resonance (MR)-based manual hippocampal segmentation.
   Methods: The panel received a questionnaire regarding whole hippocampus
   boundaries and segmentation procedures. Quantitative information was
   supplied to allow evidence-based answers. A recursive and anonymous
   Delphi procedure was used to achieve convergence. Significance of
   agreement among panelists was assessed by exact probability on Fisher's
   and binomial tests.
   Results: Agreement was significant on the inclusion of alveus/fimbria (P
   = .021), whole hippocampal tail (P = .013), medial border of the body
   according to visible morphology (P = .0006), and on this combined set of
   features (P = .001). This definition captures 100\% of hippocampal
   tissue, 100\% of Alzheimer's disease-related atrophy, and demonstrated
   good reliability on preliminary intrarater (0.98) and inter-rater (0.94)
   estimates.
   Discussion: Consensus was achieved among international experts with
   respect to hippocampal segmentation using MR resulting in a harmonized
   segmentation protocol. (C) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association. Published

Abstract = {{The major concern in estimating sonochemical yield and efficiency in
   ultrasound-assisted processes is in defining a ``silent{''} control
   experiment, without cavitation effects. To estimate the potential
   benefit of the ultrasonic treatment as compared to conventional heating,
   we propose that the effects should be compared at the same power input,
   when the energy in a silent experiment is dissipated as heat. Our
   calculations of possible temperature increase under the silent
   conditions for oil sands extraction and upgrading showed necessity of
   such approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this research was to develop a waste protein based
   adhesive, and to optimize its lap shear strength under dry and wet

   specified risk material (SRM) that is considered the tissue potentially
   at risk of containing misfolded prions. SRM was hydrolyzed in accordance
   with government approved techniques and modified with a resin system to
   develop a renewable adhesive platform. Eight of the nine formulated
   adhesives met the minimum dry shear strength requirement of urea
   formaldehyde type adhesive, and three of the formulations also met the
   soak shear strength requirement. This work demonstrates a general
   valorization platform for the utilization of animal waste protein as a
   renewable adhesive feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{The present work develops a strain rate-dependent cohesive zone model

   fracture of pipeline steels observed in recent drop-weight tear tests.
   Different than most of existing cohesive zone models, the
   traction-separation law of the present model considers the rate of
   separation in the cohesive zone, and a rate-dependent
   elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model is employed for the bulk
   material. The speed-dependences of CTOA and energy dissipation observed
   experimentally are reproduced in our simulations for moderate
   steady-state crack speed (up to 150 m/s). The present model gives
   detailed stress-strain fields surrounding the moving crack tip, which
   offer plausible explanation why the rate-effects in the bulk material
   and the cohesive zone could be largely responsible for all observed
   speed-dependent dynamic fracture phenomena of pipeline steels. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Maltose-binding protein is a periplasmic binding protein responsible for
   transport of maltooligosaccarides through the periplasmic space of
   Gram-negative bacteria, as a part of the ABC transport system. The
   molecular mechanisms of the initial ligand binding and induced large
   scale motion of the proteins domains still remain elusive. In this
   study, we use a new docking protocol that combines a recently proposed
   explicit water placement algorithm based on the 3D-RISM-KH molecular
   theory of solvation and conventional docking software (AutoDock Vina) to
   explain the mechanisms of maltotriose binding to the apo-open state of a
   maltose-binding protein. We confirm the predictions of previous NMR
   spectroscopic experiments on binding modes of the ligand. We provide the
   molecular details on the binding mode that was not previously observed
   in the X-ray experiments. We show that this mode, which is defined by
   the fine balance between the protein-ligand direct interactions and
   solvation effects, can trigger the proteins domain motion resulting in
   the holo-closed structure of the maltose-binding protein with the
   maltotriose ligand in excellent agreement with the experimental data. We
   also discuss the role of water in blocking unfavorable binding sites and
   water-mediated interactions contributing to the stability of observable
   binding modes of maltotriose}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{203-209}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a spinal deformity affecting 2-3\% of
   adolescents. Brace treatment, the most common non-surgical treatment,
   uses a hard plastic orthotic shell to prevent progression of the
   deformity. Previous studies have found association between treatment
   outcome and patients' compliance with the prescribed brace-wear regimen.
   However, the exact relationship between compliance and treatment outcome
   has yet to be elucidated. Current compliance monitoring techniques may
   not be providing enough information about patients' brace-wear habits.
   Building on previous work, we present a new compliance monitor which
   records both temperature and force applied to the patient's body. The
   combination of temperature and force readings shows both how often and
   how tightly the brace is worn. The new monitor is designed for minimal
   size and power consumption, measuring 5.2 cm x 2.5 cm x 0.8 cm, with a
   battery life of approximately one year. Seven patients wore the monitor
   in this pilot study. The temperature-based compliance estimate differed
   significantly from the force-based estimate in four out of seven cases.
   This suggests that some patients may wear their braces very loosely, and
   that existing temperature-only or force-only compliance monitors may not
   be giving a complete picture of brace-wear habits. (C) 2015 IPEM.

Abstract = {{Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity
   of spine associated with vertebra rotation. The Cobb angle and axial
   vertebral rotation are important parameters to assess the severity of
   scoliosis. However, the vertebral rotation is seldom measured from
   radiographs due to time consuming. Different techniques have been
   developed to extract 3D spinal information. Among many techniques,
   ultrasound imaging is a promising method. This pilot study reported an
   image processing method to reconstruct the posterior surface of
   vertebrae from 3D ultrasound data. Three cadaver vertebrae, a Sawbones
   spine phantom, and a spine from a child with AIS were used to validate
   the development. The in-vitro result showed the surface of the
   reconstructed image was visually similar to the original objects. The
   dimension measurement error was <5 mm and the Pearson correlation was
   >0.99. The results also showed a high accuracy in vertebral rotation
   with errors of 0.8 +/- 0.3 degrees, 2.8 +/- 0.3 degrees and 3.6 +/- 0.5
   degrees for the rotation values of 0 degrees, 15 degrees and 30 degrees,
   respectively. Meanwhile, the difference in the Cobb angle between the
   phantom and the image was 4 degrees and the vertebral rotation at the
   apex was 2 degrees. The Cobb angle measured from the in-vivo ultrasound
   image was 4 degrees different from the radiograph. (C) 2015 IPEM.

Abstract = {{Particle number emission factors, and the volatility of the particles,
   are measured on-road for five gasoline direct injection vehicles over a
   wide range of operating conditions including urban and highway driving
   conditions. Two condensation particle counters (CPC) were used to
   measure nascent and nonvolatile (thermodenuded) particle concentrations
   for transient urban and highway tests. To measure the non-volatile
   concentration and also the volatility of the particles, a thermodenuder
   was employed to remove the semi-volatile material from the aerosol
   sample. Rapid accelerations were also studied in more detail by
   measuring the particle size distributions in real-time using a
   differential mobility spectrometer (DMS). The ratio of semi-volatile
   particles to total particle number is generally higher during
   acceleration followed by the idle operating mode. The number emission
   factors (for particles larger than 2.5 nm) ranged between 5.46 x
   10(11)-3.50 x 10(12)/km for freshly emitted (nascent) particles and
   between 2.87 x 10(11)-3.31 x 10(12)/km for non-volatile (thermodenuded)
   particles. More particles per kilometer are produced during acceleration
   compared to cruise conditions where the non-volatile particle number
   emission factor for acceleration is 2.3 and 1.8 times higher than
   vehicle cruise for urban and highway driving cycles, respectively.
   Particle number emission factor models are also presented in terms of
   particle emission rate as a function of vehicle tractive power and also
   as a function of vehicle specific power as defined for the US
   Environmental Protection Agency's MOVES model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{It is well-known that the lateral-torsional buckling capacity of a
   wide-flange beam is lower when transverse loads between brace points are
   applied to the top flange instead of at the shear centre. Although
   top-flange loading is commonplace, the load height effect can often be
   neglected due to lateral restraint provided by the loading mechanism
   itself; however, there are several common cases for which it must be
   considered in design. This paper provides the research background to the
   current provisions in CSA Standard S16 to account for the load height
   effect and proposes an effective length method that expands on these
   provisions to reduce their conservatism, while maintaining a simplicity
   appropriate for use in design. Employing a large and diverse database of
   steel shapes, the proposed method is compared with a comprehensive
   variety of other design approaches and available numerical and
   experimental data.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The flow-tracing fidelity of sub-millimetre diameter helium-filled soap
   bubbles (HFSB) for low-speed aerodynamics is studied. The main interest
   of using HFSB in relation to micron-size droplets is the large amount of
   scattered light, enabling larger-scale three-dimensional experiments by
   tomographic PIV. The assessment of aerodynamic behaviour closely follows
   the method proposed in the early work of Kerho and Bragg (Exp Fluids
   50:929-948, 1994) who evaluated the tracer trajectories around the
   stagnation region at the leading edge of an airfoil. The conclusions of
   the latter investigation differ from the present work, which concludes
   sub-millimetre HFSB do represent a valid alternative for quantitative
   velocimetry in wind tunnel aerodynamic experiments. The flow stagnating
   ahead of a circular cylinder of 25 mm diameter is considered at speeds
   up to 30 m/s. The tracers are injected in the free-stream and high-speed
   PIV, and PTV are used to obtain the velocity field distribution. A
   qualitative assessment based on streamlines is followed by acceleration
   and slip velocity measurements using PIV experiments with fog droplets
   as a term of reference. The tracing fidelity is controlled by the flow
   rates of helium, liquid soap and air in HFSB production. A
   characteristic time response, defined as the ratio of slip velocity and
   the fluid acceleration, is obtained. The feasibility of performing
   time-resolved tomographic PIV measurements over large volumes in
   aerodynamic wind tunnels is also studied. The flow past a 5-cm-diameter
   cylinder is measured over a volume of 20 x 20 x 12 cm(3) at a rate of 2
   kHz. The achieved seeding density of <0.01 ppp enables resolving the
   Karman vortices, whereas turbulent substructures cannot be captured.}},

Abstract = {{An optimized communication and control infrastructure, based on the
   microgrid building block concept, for active distribution systems is
   essential to facilitate powerful control framework under the smart grid
   paradigm. In this paper, a novel methodology for designing a
   communication and control infrastructure is presented. The new design
   takes into account both communication system and distribution
   system-related aspects. The proposed design facilitates systematic and
   optimized clustering of the distribution system into a set of virtual
   microgrids with optimized communication requirements while considering
   the power quality aspects, characteristics of distributed generation
   units, distributed energy storage units, and distributed reactive
   sources. The new design facilitates robust infrastructure for smart
   distribution systems operation and control, e.g., self-healing control
   and optimized system-level operation, by using virtual microgrids as
   building blocks in future distribution systems. The motivations,
   conceptual design, problem formulation and solution algorithms are
   presented in this paper. The well-known PG\&E 69-bus distribution system
   is selected as a test case and through several sensitivity studies, the
   effect of optimization coefficients on the design, and the robustness of
   the algorithm are investigated. Finally, the algorithm is tested on the
   IEEE 123-bus distribution system.}},

Abstract = {{The communication channel power gain to the nearest neighbor of a node

   nodes is derived for a general fading environment. The result is
   specialized to the case where the communication links are modeled as
   generalized-gamma fading channels. The analytical results are verified
   and illustrated by computer simulations and numerical results. Some
   applications of the new theory are also presented. A novel criterion
   that represents the fading severity, i.e., the generalized amount of
   fading (GAF), is defined, and its value as an important measure for
   fading channels is justified.}},

Title = {{Effect of Electrostatic Charge on Deposition of Uniformly Charged
   Monodisperse Particles in the Nasal Extrathoracic Airways of an Infant}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL MEDICINE AND PULMONARY DRUG DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{30-34}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The fraction of inhaled particles depositing in the nasal
   extrathoracic airways determines the amount of particles delivered to
   the lungs of infants. Electrostatic charge on particles can affect this
   deposition, and for this reason, deposition of charged aerosol particles
   in the Alberta Idealized Infant nasal geometry is examined.
   Methods: Charged aerosol particles were generated via Plateau-Rayleigh
   jet breakup atomization with induction charging. Nasal deposition was
   measured by collecting particles on a filter membrane at the inlet and
   outlet of the airway and measuring their mass with an ultramicrobalance.
   The experiments were carried out using monodisperse, uniformly charged
   particles with aerodynamic diameters of 3-6 mu m at two flow rates of
   7.5 and 15 L/min, for a charge range of 0-10,000 e per particle.
   Results: Electrostatic charge effects are largest for the lowest flow
   rate, smallest particle size, and highest charge level, with deposition
   in this case being approximately three times that for neutral particles.
   Higher flow rates and larger particle size result in much weaker
   electrostatic effects, with even the highest charge levels giving only a
   few percent higher deposition for the largest particle size and flow
   rate considered in this study. A dimensionless empirical relation based
   on the experimental data was developed for predicting deposition of
   charged particles in the idealized infant airway.
   Conclusion: Electrostatic charge on inhaled aerosol particles has only a
   minor effect on deposition for large particles at higher flow rates,
   because in this case inertial impaction dominates deposition. However,
   for particles with low inertia, for example, small particles or low flow
   rates, large values of electrostatic charge strongly increase nasal
   deposition in the present infant extrathoracic airway.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We undertake an analytical study of the interaction of an edge
   dislocation with a finite crack whose faces are assumed to have separate
   surface elasticity. The surface elasticity on the faces of the crack is
   described by a version of the continuum-based surface/interface theory
   of Gurtin and Murdoch. By using the Green's function method, we obtain a
   complete exact solution by reducing the problem to three Cauchy singular
   integrodifferential equations of the first-order, which are solved by
   means of Chebyshev polynomials and a collocation method. The correctness
   of the solution is rigorously verified by comparison with existing
   analytical solutions. Our analysis shows that the stresses and the image
   force acting on the edge dislocation are size-dependent and that the
   stresses exhibit both the logarithmic and square root singularities at
   the crack tips when the surface tension is neglected.}},

Abstract = {{Here, for the first time, a monolithic wafer-level
   micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) waveguide switch for
   millimeter-wave application is presented. The switch is based on the
   monolithic integration of MEMS actuators (cantilever beams) inside the
   waveguide channel. The highly deflected beams are electrostatically
   actuated to provide ON and OFF states. In the OFF state, the beams are
   pushing against the upper inner wall of the waveguide to provide a short
   circuit, while the actuators are rolled flat to allow for maximum signal
   propagation during the ON state. The switch illustrates an excellent
   wideband RF performance, with an insertion loss as low as 0.2 dB in the
   ON state, and isolation of better than 22 dB in the OFF state, for the
   entire 60-75 GHz frequency band. A low-loss waveguide to CPW transition
   is also designed and integrated with the switch, which exhibits less
   than 1.1 dB loss for a back-to-back configuration across the band, and
   enables the on-wafer characterization of the entire structure.}},

Title = {{Using Sankey diagrams to map energy flow from primary fuel to end use}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The energy sector is the largest contributor to gross domestic product
   (GDP), income, employment, and government revenue in both developing and
   developed nations. But the energy sector has a significant environmental
   footprint due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Efficient production,
   conversion, and use of energy resources are key factors for reducing the
   environmental footprint. Hence it is necessary to understand energy
   flows from both the supply and the demand sides. Most energy analyses
   focus on improving energy efficiency broadly without considering the
   aggregate energy flow. We developed Sankey diagrams that map energy flow
   for both the demand and supply sides for the province of Alberta,
   Canada. The diagrams will help policy/decision makers, researchers, and
   others to understand energy flow from reserves through to final energy
   end uses for primary and secondary fuels in the five main energy demand
   sectors in Alberta: residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural,
   and transportation. The Sankey diagrams created for this study show
   total energy consumption, useful energy, and energy intensities of
   various end-use devices. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning
   System (LEAP) model is used in this study. The model showed that
   Alberta's total input energy in the five demand sectors was 189 PJ, 186
   PJ, 828.5 PJ, 398 PJ, and 50.83 PJ, respectively. On the supply side,
   the total energy input and output were found to be 644.84 PJ and 239 PJ,
   respectively. These results, along with the associated energy flows were
   depicted pictorially using Sankey diagrams. The Sankey diagrams reveal
   the current efficiencies within various end-use sectors and could help
   identify options for improving energy efficiency in order to reduce GHG
   emissions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a planetary gearbox, there are multiple vibration sources, and the
   transmission path of vibration signals changes due to the rotation of
   the carrier. This study aims to model the vibration signals of a
   planetary gearbox and investigate the vibration properties in the
   healthy condition and in the cracked tooth condition. A dynamic model is
   developed to simulate the vibration source signals. A modified Hamming
   function is proposed to represent the effect of the transmission path.
   By incorporating the effect of multiple vibration sources and the effect
   of transmission path, resultant vibration signals of a planetary gearbox
   are obtained. Through analyzing the resultant vibration signals, some
   vibration properties of a planetary gearbox are revealed and the fault
   symptoms of sun gear tooth crack are identified and located. Finally,
   the proposed approach is experimentally verified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Ferritic-Martensitic (F/M) steels are important candidate alloys to be
   used in the next generation (Generation-IV) SCWRs. In this work, two F/M
   steels with the same Cr content of around 12 wt.\% and varied Si content
   from 0.6 wt.\% to 2.2 wt.\% were evaluated in supercritical water (SCW)
   at 500 degrees C and 25 MPa for up to 1000 h. The effect of ultrasonic
   shot peening on the oxidation behavior of these F/M steels have been
   investigated. The results showed that the oxidation was affected by the
   Si content as well as the surface modification. The F/M steel with low
   Si concentration exhibited higher corrosion resistance than that of the
   alloy with high Si content. Shot peening, which could modify the
   microstructure at the surface, showed significantly beneficial effect to
   improving the oxidation resistance. A thin, uniform oxide layer formed
   on the peened sample could be attributed to the enhanced diffusion of Cr
   induced by the surface modification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   aqueous corrosion of a high-Cr cast iron in spots at different distances

   carbides in the cast iron may not act as effective cathodes due to their
   high electrical resistivity. Instead, the carbide/matrix interfacial
   mismatch makes the regions in vicinity of the interface highly anodic,
   which act as anodes while the regions away from the interface act as
   cathodes. As a result, the corrosion rate at the interface can be
   considerably larger than that of regions apart away from the interface.

Abstract = {{A numerical model was developed to evaluate the possibility of people
   walking in a flooding flow on a staircase with rest platforms.
   Commercial software was used and validated by experimental data for
   flows on staircases and stepped spillways. The effects of the rest
   platform, the staircase slope, and the staircase pattern on the flooding
   flow characteristics are discussed. A comparison of staircases with or
   without rest platforms shows that the flow velocity increases
   significantly downstream of the rest platform on a straight-run type,
   which would have negative effects on the safe evacuation of people
   walking through a flooding staircase. The slope of the staircase,
   ranging from 26.6 degrees to 30 degrees, has less effect on safe
   evacuation. A comparison of flows on straight-run (with or without rest
   platforms), 90 degrees-turn and 180 degrees-turn staircases (with rest
   platforms) shows that the rest platforms on the latter two staircases
   could induce a redistribution of the flow field on the rest platform and
   downstream. The distribution of evacuation indicators along the
   longitudinal planes of those staircases indicates that a 90 degrees-turn
   staircase or a straight staircase without rest platform would be the
   first choice for trapped people evacuating from underground spaces.}},

Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{19-29}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Dimensionality reduction is an important and challenging task in machine
   learning and data mining. It can facilitate data clustering,
   classification and information retrieval. As an efficient technique for
   dimensionality reduction, feature selection is about finding a small
   feature subset preserving the most relevant information. In this paper,
   we propose a new criterion, called maximum projection and minimum
   redundancy feature selection, to address unsupervised learning
   scenarios. First, the feature selection is formalized with the use of
   the projection matrices and then characterized equivalently as a matrix
   factorization problem. Second, an iterative update algorithm and a
   greedy algorithm are proposed to tackle this problem. Third, kernel
   techniques are considered and the corresponding algorithm is also put
   forward. Finally, the proposed algorithms are compared with four
   state-of-the-art feature selection methods. Experimental results
   reported for six publicly datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
   proposed algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NMR IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Composite MRI arrays consist of triplets where two orthogonal upright
   loops are placed over the same imaging area as a standard surface coil.
   The optimal height of the upright coils is approximately half the width
   for the 7cm coils used in this work. Resistive and magnetic coupling is
   shown to be negligible within each coil triplet. Experimental evaluation
   of imaging performance was carried out on a Philips 3T Achieva scanner
   using an eight-coil composite array consisting of three surface coils
   and five upright loops, as well as an array of eight surface coils for
   comparison. The composite array offers lower overall coupling than the
   traditional array. The sensitivities of upright coils are complementary
   to those of the surface coils and therefore provide SNR gains in regions
   where surface coil sensitivity is low, and additional spatial
   information for improved parallel imaging performance. Near the surface
   of the phantom the eight-channel surface coil array provides higher
   overall SNR than the composite array, but this advantage disappears
   beyond a depth of approximately one coil diameter, where it is typically
   more challenging to improve SNR. Furthermore, parallel imaging
   performance is better with the composite array compared with the surface
   coil array, especially at high accelerations and in locations deep in
   the phantom. Composite arrays offer an attractive means of improving
   imaging performance and channel density without reducing the size, and
   therefore the loading regime, of surface coil elements. Additional
   advantages of composite arrays include minimal SNR loss using
   root-sum-of-squares combination compared with optimal, and the ability
   to switch from high to low channel density by merely selecting only the
   surface elements, unlike surface coil arrays, which require additional
   hardware. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with predator-prey dynamics in individual and
   population perspectives. First, we build a discrete Markov model on
   predator-prey interactions in individual perspective. By shortening the
   time gap, from discrete time to continuous time, and increasing the
   number of individuals to infinity, a continuity equation on the
   predator-prey interactions is derived in a large population regime.
   Then, with the leading items of the continuity equation, that is the
   mean-field equation, following the approximate model, which entails
   qualitative analysis, we can obtain an asymptotically stable closed
   orbit or simply put, the parameter conditions where equilibrium point
   exists. These qualitative conclusions are the performance of individual
   microscopic interactions on macro-level groups, or can be treated as one
   component of microscopic models of various random statistical average
   results. This paper explored the accuracy and operability of the model
   constructed on individual level, which differs from traditional method,
   constructing population model directly via differential equations and
   difference equations. Therefore, by operating variables and data from
   individual behavior, it is probable for us to construct more accurate
   models for population dynamic.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents analytical modeling to study the seismic response of
   bridge systems with conventional and advanced details. For validation, a
   33 m quarter-scale model of a four-span bridge incorporating innovative
   materials and details seismically tested on the shake tables at the
   University of Nevada, Reno was taken. The bridge specimen involved use
   of advanced materials and details to reduce damage at plastic hinges and
   minimize residual displacements. A threedimensional, nonlinear model
   incorporating the response of the innovative materials was developed to
   study the bridge response using the finite-element software OpenSees.
   Existing finite-element formulations were used to capture the response
   of the advanced materials used in the bridge. The analytical model was
   found to be able to reproduce comparable bent displacements and bent
   shear forces within reasonable accuracy. The validated model was further
   used to study different types of bridges under suite of scaled
   bi-directional near-fault ground motions. Comparisons were made on
   behavior of five different bridge types, first conventional reinforced
   concrete bridge, second post-tensioned column bridge, third bridge with
   elastomeric rubber elements at the plastic hinge zone, fourth bridge
   with nickel-titanium superelastic shape memory alloy (SMA) reinforcing
   bar and fifth bridge with CuAlMn superelastic SMA reinforcing bar. Both
   the SMA used bridges also utilized engineered cementitious composite
   element at the plastic hinge zone. The results showed effectiveness of
   the innovative interventions on the bridges in providing excellent
   recentering capabilities with minimal damage to the columns.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle technology is starting to be explored by several groups
   worldwide in the petroleum industry, with potential applications of
   magnetic nanoparticle injection ranging from monitoring the progress of
   hydraulic fracturing jobs to enhancing oil recovery. However, there is
   currently a little published information regarding the optimum
   conditions for the transport of dispersed magnetic nanoparticles through
   reservoir material. Magnetic nanoparticles have a tendency to aggregate
   together, potentially blocking pore connections and degrading reservoir
   quality. We report results of initial experiments designed to determine
   the ideal conditions to transport superparamagnetic nanoparticle
   suspensions through simulated unconsolidated core material. We used a
   non-metallic flow cell and integrated magnetic susceptibility sensor
   technique to quantify the transport of the nanoparticle suspensions. The
   flow cell was made of an acrylic material and allowed simultaneous
   magnetic susceptibility monitoring at various positions along the cell
   whilst the flow experiments were taking place. Such ``in-line{''}
   quantitative magnetic susceptibility monitoring of the nanoparticle
   suspensions during a fluid flow experiment represents a significant step
   forward in characterization techniques. Simultaneous magnetic
   susceptibility monitoring is not possible using traditional stainless
   steel flow cells. The new flow cell is also transparent, allowing visual
   observation of the progress of the nanoparticle suspensions. We describe
   the effect of different dispersants, sonications, injection rates,
   permeability of the porous media and nanoparticle types on the transport
   of the nanoparticle suspensions. The flow cell and magnetic monitoring
   system have several other potential applications, including simultaneous
   monitoring of fines migration along the length of a core plug during
   various fluid flow experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for modeling and monitoring of the multivariate processes
   in presence of faulty and missing observations is introduced. It is
   assumed that operating modes of the process can transit to each other
   following a Markov chain model. Transition probabilities of the Markov
   chain are time varying as a function of the scheduling variable.
   Therefore, the transition probabilities will be able to vary adaptively
   according to different operating modes. In order to handle the problem
   of missing observations and unknown operating regimes, the expectation
   maximization algorithm is used to estimate the parameters. The proposed
   method is tested on two simulations and one industrial case studies. The
   industrial case study is the abnormal operating condition diagnosis in
   the primary separation vessel of oil-sand processes. In comparison to
   the conventional methods, the proposed method shows superior performance
   in detection of different operating conditions of the process. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Observer and optimal boundary control design for the objective of output
   tracking of a linear distributed parameter system given by a
   two-dimensional (2-D) parabolic partial differential equation with

   the system's model in a standard evolutionary form. By exploring
   dynamical model evolution and generating data, a set of time-varying
   empirical eigenfunctions that capture the dominant dynamics of the
   distributed system is found. This basis is used in Galerkin's method to
   accurately represent the distributed system as a finite-dimensional
   plant in terms of a linear time-varying system. This reduced-order model
   enables synthesis of a linear optimal output tracking controller, as
   well as design of a state observer. Finally, numerical results are

Volume = {{61}},

Pages = {{518-529}},

Abstract = {{Just-in-time (JIT) learning methods are widely used in dealing with
   nonlinear and multimode behavior of industrial processes. The locally
   weighted partial least squares (LW-PLS) method is among the most
   commonly used JIT methods. The performance of LW-PLS model depends on
   parameters of the similarity function as well as the structure and
   parameters of the local PLS model. However, the regular LW-PLS algorithm
   assumes that the parameters of the similarity function and structure of
   the local PLS model are known and do not fully utilize available
   knowledge to estimate the model parameters. A Bayesian framework is
   proposed to provide a systematic way for real-time parameterization of
   the similarity function, selection of the local PLS model structure, and
   estimation of the corresponding model parameters. By applying the Bayes'
   theorem, the proposed framework incorporates the prior knowledge into
   the identification process and takes into account the different
   contribution of measurement noises. Furthermore, Bayesian model
   structure selection can automatically deal with the model complexity
   problem to avoid the overfitting issue. The advantages of this new
   approach are highlighted through two case studies based on the
   real-world near infrared data. (c) 2014 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{The plate-load test (PLT) is widely performed at large dam sites to
   determine the rock mass deformability. Analytical relations based on the
   theory of elasticity, as suggested by the International Society for Rock
   Mechanics and the American Society for Testing and Materials test
   standards, are commonly used to interpret the test results and calculate
   the rock mass deformation modulus. However, because of inconsistency of
   the test gallery geometry with the half-space medium assumption embedded
   in the analytical relations, a systematic error occurs in the
   calculation of the deformation modulus. Furthermore, when the tests are
   conducted on jointed rock masses, the test results show a considerable
   scatter, mainly due to the anisotropy of the deformability of jointed
   rock masses. In this paper, numerical modeling is used to interpret the
   results of a series of PLTs conducted at the Bakhtiary dam site in
   southwest Iran. An equivalent continuum model, called JointedRock, is
   used to back-calculate the stiffness of bedding planes from the test
   results. Finally, the equivalent continuum deformation moduli of the
   rock mass are determined numerically for various directions of loading
   relative to the orientation of major joint sets. (C) 2014 American

   this paper. This model is developed based on the general framework of
   critical state soil mechanics and modified Cam-clay formulation. Most of
   the characteristics of saturated clays in temperatures lower than
   water's boiling temperature have been taken into account. An attempt has
   been made to use the lowest possible number of extra parameters compared
   with the original Cam-clay model and to ensure that these new parameters
   have clear physical interpretations. An important feature in the model
   is thermal dependency of the critical state line in the deviatoric

Title = {{Algorithm for Mobile Crane Walking Path Planning in Congested Industrial
   Plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{On-site construction of industrial projects relies heavily on large
   mobile cranes for the lifting of prefabricated modules, which over the
   years have become heavier and more voluminous. Industrial construction
   sites are frequently congested, a condition that reduces the area where
   cranes can freely maneuver. As a result, in some cases mobile cranes may
   not have sufficient clearance to perform the lifts and thus need to pick
   and walk with loads to a point from which the modules can ultimately be
   set in their resting positions. Since this type of crane operation
   presents higher risks of failure or accident in comparison to the
   traditional scenario, in which the location of the crane does not change
   for the duration of the lifting, a detailed analysis of these operations
   is paramount to ensure safety and efficiency. Paradoxically, many
   practitioners still rely on their best judgment for crane walking
   planning, which in the case of highly congested and complex construction
   sites is likely to lead to inefficiencies and errors since numerous
   obstacles may interfere with the crane body and the load. Furthermore,
   manual analysis is tedious, time-consuming and cannot respond rapidly to
   changes in work orders or project scope, especially considering the
   large number of lifts involved in modern industrial projects. In this
   paper, a generic algorithm is proposed for mobile crane walking path
   planning, which considers the typical site constraints, the geometry of
   lifted modules, and crane configuration. The proposed algorithm
   calculates the pick area and crane collision-free operation area, based
   upon which the crane's walking paths are determined. A case study, based
   on an actual industrial project, is presented to validate the developed
   algorithm. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeSodium signal from ordered environments can be selectively
   detected using a double-quantum magic angle (DQ-MA) sequence. This study
   presents the first DQ-MA sodium images of the human brain and evaluates
   the effect of preparation time () on the signal.
   Theory and MethodsThree phantoms of saline, agar gel, and xanthan gum
   were used to test the correct functioning of the DQ-MA sequence. Five
   healthy volunteers were imaged using DQ-MA with varying to determine the
   optimal preparation time. DQ-MA images were acquired with 1 or 2
   averages and nominal resolution of 15 mm isotropic in 3.5 or 7 min,
   respectively. In addition, higher nominal resolution (8.4 mm isotropic)
   DQ-MA images were acquired from another subject in 48 min. Post hoc
   simulations were performed to explain the effect of on imaging results.
   ResultsThe DQ-MA sequence generates signal from only the xanthan gum
   phantom, correctly suppressing signal from environments in which the
   time-averaged quadrupolar interaction is expected to be zero (saline,
   agar). This sequence generates signal throughout the brain with maximum
   detection when =3 ms.
   ConclusionThe existence of DQ-MA signal in the human brain indicates the
   presence of sodium nuclei in ordered environments and provides a novel

Abstract = {{PurposeConventional calculation of myocardial strain requires
   tissue-tracking. A surrogate for strain called global fractional
   shortening (GFS) is proposed based on changes in dimensions of
   endocardial and epicardial surfaces without tissue-tracking.
   MethodsThree-dimensional endocardial and epicardial left ventricular
   surfaces traced at end-diastole and end-systole using conventional
   steady-state free precession cine images were used to calculate GFS(cc)
   (circumferential), GFS(ll) (longitudinal), and GFS(rr) (radial) using
   fractional length changes in each direction over the heart surface. GFS
   values were validated using finite element models (FEM) and in vivo
   using tagging-derived strains (epsilon(cc),epsilon(ll),epsilon(rr)) in
   patients with a wide range of ejection fraction (EF) and diagnosis
   (n=32). GFS was also measured in 31 patients with Fabry disease and
   matched healthy controls.
   ResultsGFS values were within 3\% of average FEM-derived Lagrangian
   strains and had good agreement in vivo (GFS(cc)=-144\%, epsilon(cc)=-14
   +/- 4\%, R-2=0.85; GFS(ll)=-12 +/- 4\%, epsilon(ll)=-12 +/- 4\%,
   R-2=0.72; GFS(rr)=46 +/- 21\%). epsilon(rr) could not be measured
   reliably from tagging. Compared with healthy controls with matched EF,
   patients with Fabry disease had significantly increased GFS(cc (Endo))
   (-28 +/- 3\% versus -25 +/- 2\%), decreased GFS(cc(Epi)) (-10 +/- 2\%
   versus -11 +/- 2\%) and decreased GFS(ll) for all components.
   ConclusionGFS yields similar values to conventionally measured strains
   without requiring tissue-tracking. Compared with controls, patients with
   Fabry disease have significant differences in several GFS components.

Abstract = {{PurposeTo recover local phase contrast at the edges of the brain (e.g.,
   cortex), where it is otherwise unavailable with the conventional form of
   the technique sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data
   (SHARP).
   MethodsA harmonic potential field, such as the magnetic background
   field, is an analytic field and can thus be represented by a convergent
   power series. Using SHARP to obtain an initial estimate of the harmonic
   background field over a reduced inner portion of the brain, a
   three-dimensional Taylor expansion was performed to extend field
   coverage to the brain edges. The method, called Extended-SHARP, was
   quantitatively assessed through a numerical field-forward simulation and
   qualitatively demonstrated in vivo.
   ResultsUsing a typical spherical kernel (6 mm radius), Extended-SHARP
   recovered on average 26\% more in vivo brain volume than SHARP. When
   applied to the numerical model, local field contrast around an otherwise
   lost edge source was recovered, with the resulting error comparable to
   that of conventional SHARP.
   ConclusionThe lost field values near the edges of the brain can be
   recovered through an easily implemented adaptation to conventional

Abstract = {{The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is a Monte Carlo-based technique for
   assisted history matching and real-time updating of reservoir models.
   However, it often fails to detect precise locations of distinct facies
   boundaries and their proportions, as the facies distributions are
   non-Gaussian, while geologic data for reservoir modeling is usually
   insufficient. In this paper, a new re-sampling step is introduced to the
   conventional EnKF formulation; after certain number of assimilation
   steps, the updated ensemble is used to generate a new ensemble with a
   novel probability weighted re-sampling scheme. The new ensemble samples
   from a probability density function that is conditional to both the
   geological information and the early production data. After the
   re-sampling step, the forecast model is applied to the new ensemble from
   the beginning up to the last update step (without any intermediate
   Kalman updates). Full EnKF is again applied on the ensemble members to
   assimilate the remaining production history. Combination of EnKF and
   regenerating new members using the re-sampling method demonstrates
   reasonable improvement and reduction of uncertainty in history matching
   of reservoir models with multiple facies. The histogram and the
   experimental variogram of the updated ensemble members are more
   consistent with the static geologic information. Moreover, the technique
   helps maintaining ensemble variance which is essential for uncertainty
   estimation in the posterior probability distribution of facies
   proportions.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDThe aim of this study was to develop a system dynamics model
   for computation of yields and to investigate the dependency of yields on
   some major climatic parameters, i.e. temperature and rainfall, for Beta
   vulgaris subsp. (sugar beet crops) under future climate change
   scenarios.
   RESULTSA system dynamics model was developed which takes account of the
   effects of rainfall and temperature on sugar beetyields under limited
   irrigation conditions. A relationship was also developed between the
   seasonal evapotranspiration and seasonal growing degree days for sugar
   beet crops. The proposed model was set to run for the present time
   period of 1993-2012 and for the future period 2013-2040 for Lethbridge
   region (Alberta, Canada). The model provides sugar beet yields on a
   yearly basis which are comparable to the present field data. It was
   found that the future average yield will be increased at about 14\% with
   respect to the present average yield.
   CONCLUSIONThe proposed model can help to improve the understanding of
   soil water conditions and irrigation water requirements of an area under
   certain climatic conditions and can be used for future prediction of
   yields for any crops in any region (with the required information to be
   provided). The developed system dynamics model can be used as a
   supporting tool for decision making, for improvement of agricultural
   management practice of any region. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{During the catalytic hydroconversion of vacuum residue fractions of
   bitumen or petroleum, the formation of mesophase can lead to fouling of
   reactor internals. In this study we examine the dependence of the onset
   of mesophase in a batch microreactor designed to enable in situ
   microscopic observation of the reacting liquid. The following process
   variables were investigated: temperature, partial pressure of hydrogen,
   catalyst concentration, agitation speed, and their interactions.
   Athabasca vacuum residue was converted in the presence of an iron
   sulfide particulate catalyst, and a statistical model was developed to
   describe the effects of the process variables on the onset time for
   mesophase formation. The temperature and catalyst concentration,
   respectively, had the most effect on mesophase onset time. The time for
   mesophase formation dropped by 12.1 min when the operating temperature
   increased from 440 degrees C to 450 degrees C. The mesophase onset time
   increased by 7.4 min when 3 wt.\% of catalyst was added at 440 degrees
   C, compared to no catalyst addition. Partial pressure of hydrogen was
   not significant as an independent process variable for the range
   studied, from 2.4 to 5.2 MPa. The combined effects of hydrogen partial
   pressure and catalyst concentration were significant, as were the
   combined effects of temperature and catalyst concentration. (C) 2014

Volume = {{172}},

Abstract = {{Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown lower hippocampal
   volume in major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with MDD have
   consistently demonstrated worse performance than healthy controls a
   number of memory tests. Memory functions within the hippocampus in
   healthy younger subjects appear to be linked to cornu ammonis (CA1-3)
   and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields. Therefore, the main goal of the
   present study was to investigate whether memory deficits in MDD patients
   are related to reduction in hippocampal subfields volumes, particularly
   DG and CA 1-3.
   Methods: 15 MDD patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD vvith moderate
   or severe episodes vvere recruited, together vvith 15 healthy controls.
   We used T2 weighted 2D Fast Spin Echo (FSE) and TlvveighLed 3D MPRAGE
   sequences at 4.7 T to compare hippocampal subfield volumes at 0.09 p1
   voxel volume. Participants were administered the Wechsler Memory Scale.
   Results: MDD patients underperformed in several episodic visual memory
   tasks, as vvell as in visual vvorking memory, compared to healthy
   controls. Global hippocampal volumes were similar between groups;
   hovvever, MDD patients showed significantly reduced DG volumes within
   the hippocampal body. Duration of depression correlated with MDD
   patients' total volumes in the hippocampal body and CAI-3 and DG
   subfields within it Limitations: Our study sample was relatively small
   and the majority of patients were On antidepressant treatment.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that DG volumes in particular may be
   worthy of turthei study to further elucidate their precise role in MDD,
   both by itself as well as in relation to memory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In the process of modeling and forecasting of fuzzy time series, an
   issue on how to partition the universe of discourse impacts the quality
   of the forecasting performance of the constructed fuzzy time series
   model. In this paper, a novel method of partitioning the universe of
   discourse of time series based on interval information granules is
   proposed for improving forecasting accuracy of model. In the method, the
   universe of discourse of time series is first pre-divided into some
   intervals according to the predefined number of intervals to be
   partitioned, and then information granules are constructed in the
   amplitude-change space on the basis of data of time series belonging to
   each of intervals and their corresponding change (trends). In the
   sequel, optimal intervals are formed by continually adjusting width of
   these intervals to make information granules which associate with the
   corresponding intervals become most ``informative{''}. Three benchmark
   time series are used to perform experiments to validate the feasibility
   and effectiveness of proposed method. The experimental results clearly
   show that the proposed method produces more reasonable intervals
   exhibiting sound semantics. When using the proposed partitioning method
   to determine intervals for modeling of fuzzy time series, forecasting
   accuracy of the constructed model are prominently enhanced. (C) 2014

   hierarchy process (AHP) method, and then they are transformed into a
   constraint condition associating with each weight variable in the
   weighted clustering objective function. In the sequence, the weighted
   clustering objective function is solved by combining the Lagrange
   multiplier method with the gradient-based iteration computation. In the
   whole process of algorithm iteration, a compulsion strategy with
   human-computer cooperation is adopted to ensure each weight variable
   satisfies interval constraint itself. Three well-known data set are used
   to perform profound experiments. Experimental results clearly show that
   the proposed algorithm has better clustering performance than other the
   weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Evaluation of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) performance that
   involves detailed compositional simulations is usually deterministic,
   cumbersome, expensive (manpower and time consuming), and not quite
   suitable for practical decision making and forecasting, particularly
   when dealing with high-dimensional data space consisting of large number
   of operational and geological parameters. Data-driven modeling
   techniques, which entail comprehensive data analysis and implementation
   of machine learning methods for system forecast, provide an attractive
   alternative.
   In this paper, artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict
   SAGD production in heterogeneous reservoirs, an important application
   that is lacking in existing literature. Numerical flow simulations are
   performed to construct a training data set consists of various
   attributes describing characteristics associated with reservoir
   heterogeneities and other relevant operating parameters. Empirical Arps
   decline parameters are tested successfully for parameterization of
   cumulative production profile and considered as outputs of the ANN
   models. Sensitivity studies on network configurations are also
   investigated. Principal components analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce
   the dimensionality of the input vector, improve prediction quality, and
   limit over-fitting. In a case study, reservoirs with distinct
   heterogeneity distributions are fed to the model. It is shown that
   robustness and accuracy of the prediction capability are greatly
   enhanced when cluster analysis are performed to identify internal data
   structures and groupings prior to ANN modeling. Both deterministic and
   fuzzy-based clustering techniques are compared, and separate ANN model
   is constructed for each cluster. The model is then tested using a
   validation data set (cases that have not been used during the training
   stage).
   The proposed approach can be integrated directly into most existing
   reservoir management routines. In addition, incorporating techniques for
   dimensionality reduction and clustering with ANN demonstrates the
   viability of this approach for analyzing large field data set. Given
   that quantitative ranking of operating areas, robust forecasting, and
   optimization of heavy oil recovery processes are major challenges faced
   by the industry, the proposed research highlights the significant
   potential of applying effective data-driven modeling approaches in
   analyzing other solvent-additive steam injection projects. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Distributed generation (DG) microgrid systems are forming the building
   blocks for smart distribution grids. Enhanced networked-based control
   structure is needed not only to eliminate the frequency deviations,
   power-sharing errors, and stability concerns associated with
   conventional droop control in microgrids but also to yield: 1) improved
   microgrid dynamic performance, 2) minimized active/reactive
   power-sharing errors under unknown line impedances, and 3) high
   reliability and robustness against network failures or communication
   delays. This paper proposes a new hybrid distributed networked-based
   power control scheme that addresses the aforementioned problems in a
   distributed manner. The new method consists of a set of distributed
   power regulators that are located at each DG unit to ensure perfect
   tracking of the optimized set points assigned by the centralized energy
   management unit (EMU). The average power measurements are transmitted to
   the EMU to calculate the share of each unit of the total power demand
   based on real-time optimization criteria; therefore, a low-bandwidth
   communication system can be used. In the proposed method, the
   distributed nature of the power regulators allows them to adopt the
   delay-free local power measurements as the required feedback signals.
   Therefore, the proposed structure provides great robustness against
   communication delays. Further, this paper presents a generalized and
   computationally efficient modeling approach that captures the dominant
   dynamics of a microgrid system. The model can be used to study the
   impact of power-sharing controllers and delays in microgrid stability.
   Comparative simulation and experimental results are presented to show
   the validity and effectiveness of the proposed controller.}},

Abstract = {{For high-power PWM current-source drive systems, the distortion of
   dc-link current cannot be ignored due to the low converter switching
   frequency and the relative small dc choke for reduced cost/weight. The
   distorted dc-link current may introduce interharmonics in the grid side
   and the motor side through the rectifier and the inverter, and may give
   rise to the system resonance at certain motor speeds. When resonance
   occurs, significant interharmonics are introduced in the drive system,
   which will degrade the grid-side power quality and produce the excessive
   torque ripples on the motor side. In this paper, the harmonics
   interaction in a high-power PWM current-source drive system is
   investigated, and a method for the system resonance estimation is
   proposed. Based on the estimation of resonance conditions, a dc-link
   virtual impedance-based control method is developed to mitigate the
   resonance resulted from the harmonics interaction. The investigation of
   harmonics interaction, the proposed resonance estimation method, and the
   dc-link virtual impedance-based suppression method are verified through
   both simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for
   diseases such as bacteremia, chronic lung infection, and acute
   ulcerative keratitis. P. aeruginosa induced diseases can be fatal as the
   exotoxins and endotoxins released by the bacterium continue to damage
   host tissues even after the administration of antibiotics. As bacterial
   adhesion on cell surfaces is the first step in bacterial based pathogen
   infections, the control of bacteria-cell interactions is a worthwhile
   research target. In this work, thermally responsive
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) {[}P(NIPAAm)] based biomimetic surfaces were
   developed to study the two major bacterial infection mechanisms, which
   is believed to be mediated by hydrophobic or lectin-carbohydrate
   interactions, using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation.
   Although, a greater number of P. aeruginosa adhered to the NIPAAm
   homopolymer modified surfaces at temperatures higher than the lower
   critical solution temperature (LCST), the bacterium-substratum bond
   stiffness was stronger between P. aeruginosa and a galactose based
   P(NIPAAm) surface. The high bacterial adhesion bond stiffness observed
   on the galactose based thermally responsive surface at 37 degrees C
   might suggest that both hydrophobic and lectin-carbohydrate interactions
   contribute to bacterial adhesion on cell surfaces. Our investigation
   also suggests that the lectin-carbohydrate interaction play a
   significant role in bacterial infections.}},

   practical applications of HMMs is the difficulty in coupling light out
   of these modes because they become evanescent at the surface of the
   metamaterial. Here we report the first demonstration, to our knowledge,
   of simultaneous spontaneous emission enhancement and outcoupling of
   high-k modes in an active HMM using a high-index-contrast bullseye
   grating. Quantum dots embedded inside the metamaterial are used for
   local excitation of high-k modes. This demonstration could pave the way

Title = {{Determination of Charge on Asphaltene Nanoaggregates in Air Using

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide measurement of charge of asphaltene
   nanoaggregates in air using electrostatic force microscopy. We obtain
   the average surface charge density of the nanoaggregates as 43.7
   nC/cm(2). Among the different aspects of asphaltene, one of the least
   known is its charge and the effect of solvent and compositional
   variability (of asphaltene) in dictating this charge. For aqueous
   systems, asphaltene charge demonstrates a strong dependence on the pH
   and the salt concentration, indicating that a possible ionization of the
   surface groups leads to this charging. On the contrary, for asphaltene
   in nonpolar media (e.g., toluene and heptane), it is believed that
   asphaltene native charge is central in dictating this charging. This
   native charge is the solvent-independent charge or the asphaltene charge
   in air. Our measurements, therefore, provide the first direct
   quantification (i.e., a quantification of charge not from the
   measurement of the asphaltene mobilities, which in turn requires
   specification of the nonuniform asphaltene size distribution) of this
   asphaltene native charge by conducting the measurements in air. Similar
   measurements in a solvent may introduce a solvent-dependent value,
   thereby forbidding not only the exact quantification of this native
   charge but also the understanding of the specific role of the solvent.
   This measurement, therefore, will provide a useful starting point to
   quantify the mechanism of asphaltene charging in nonpolar solvents with
   important ramifications in deciphering the role of asphaltene in
   transport and handling of crude and heavy oils.}},

   impact, a weaker basal texture developed in the samples with lower
   content of yttrium. Experimental results also showed that by increasing
   the concentration of yttrium in the cast AE alloys, strength, ductility
   and dislocation density of the impacted alloys increased but, the
   fraction of twinning decreased, which indicate the effective influence
   of yttrium on the nucleation and growth of twins. Moreover, it was
   inferred that accumulation of dislocations at intersections of the twins
   led to the cracking and fracture of the samples under shock loading

Title = {{Impact of rock fabric on water imbibition and salt diffusion in gas
   shales}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{55-67}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Understanding water uptake of gas shales is critical for designing
   fracturing and treatment fluids. Previous imbibition experiments on
   unconfined gas shales have led to several key observations. The water
   uptake of dry shales is higher than their oil uptake. Furthermore, water
   imbibition results in sample expansion and microfracture induction. This
   study provides additional experimental data to understand the effects of
   rock fabric, complex pore network, clay swelling and osmotic potential
   on imbibition behavior.
   We systematically measure and compare the imbibition rates of deionized
   water and oil into wet/dry and confined/ unconfined rock samples from
   different shale members of the Horn River Basin. We also measure the ion
   diffusion rate from shale into water during imbibition experiments. The
   results show that initial water saturation decreases the water uptake of
   shale samples. However, it has no effect on oil imbibition rates. The
   liquid imbibition and ion diffusion rates along the lamination are
   higher than those against the lamination. The results also suggest that
   confining the shale samples decreases the water imbibition rate,
   parallel to the lamination. However, it has a negligible effect on water
   uptake, perpendicular to the lamination. Furthermore, confining does not
   significantly affect the ion diffusion rates. The comparative study
   suggests that, for both confined and unconfined samples, water uptake is
   higher than oil uptake. However, previous experiments on crushed shale
   samples show that the oil uptake of crushed packs is higher than their
   water uptake (Xu and Dehghanpour, 2014). The data suggest that the
   connected pore network of the intact samples is water wet while the
   majority of rock including poorly connected pores is oil wet. This
   argument is backed by BSE images and complete spreading of oil on fresh
   break surfaces of the rock. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   poly(alpha-carboxyl-co-benzyl carboxylate)-epsilon-caprolactone (PCBCL)
   having two different degrees of carboxyl group substitution on the PCBCL
   block. Block copolymers were synthesized through ring-opening
   polymerization of alpha-benzyl carboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone by
   dihydroxy PEG, leading to the production of poly(alpha-benzyl
   carboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone)-PEG-poly(alpha-benzyl
   carboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone) (PBCL-PEG-PBCL). This was followed by
   partial debenzylation of PBCL blocks under controlled conditions,
   leading to the preparation of PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL triblock copolymers with
   30 and 54 mol.\% carboxyl group substitution. Prepared PCBCL-PEG-PCBCL
   block copolymers have been shown to have a concentration-dependent sol
   to gel transition as a result of an increase in temperature above
   similar to 29 degrees C, as evidenced by the inverse flow method,
   differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. The
   sol-gel transition temperature/concentration and dynamic mechanical
   properties of the gel were found to be dependent on the level of
   carboxyl group substitution. Both hydrogels (30 and 54 mol.\% carboxyl
   group substitution) showed similar amounts of protein adsorption but
   striking differences in the profiles of the adsorbed proteome.
   Additionally, the two systems showed similarities in their clot
   formation kinetics but substantial differences in clot endpoints. The
   results show great promise for the above-mentioned thermoreversible in
   situ hydrogels as biocompatible materials for biomedical applications.

   develops the life cycle water footprint for 36 different coal-based

   technologies of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) or ultra
   supercritical technology with coal transportation by conventional means
   and using dry cooling systems have the least complete life cycle
   water-demand coefficients of about 1 L/kW h. Sensitivity analysis is
   conducted to study the impact of power plant performance and coal
   transportation on the water demand coefficients. The consumption
   coefficient over life cycle of ultra supercritical or IGCC power plants
   are 0.12 L/kW h higher when conventional transportation of coal is
   replaced by coal-log pipeline. Similarly, if the conventional
   transportation of coal is replaced by its transportation in the form of
   a slurry through a pipeline, the consumption coefficient of a
   subcritical power plant increases by 0.52 L/kW h. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   liquid phase heat capacity calculation}},
Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{385}},
Pages = {{182-195}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Constant pressure heat capacities for pure liquids and mixtures are by
   default evaluated indirectly, in process simulators and in general
   purpose calculations, using ideal gas isobaric heat capacity values to
   which equation of state based departure functions are added. As ideal
   gas heat capacities are known or can be calculated from theory with
   small uncertainties and typically comprise 75\% of liquid heat capacity
   values, the large relative deviations present in departure function
   calculations appear to be tolerated or ignored because deviations
   between indirectly calculated and measured constant pressure liquid heat
   capacities are typically less than 15\% and large deviations are
   uncommon. For hydrocarbon and petroleum applications, non-cubic
   equations of state have a limited range of application and a cubic
   equation of state departure function calculations possesses a systematic
   skew with respect to absolute and relative temperature. This provides
   application windows for stand alone departure function correlations: by
   Tyagi that requires the input properties (T-c,P-c, omega, M) at high
   reduced and absolute temperatures; and a difference calculation based on
   correlations by Dadgostar and Shaw (for hydrocarbon liquids) and
   Lastovka and Shaw (for ideal gases) which extend the range of fluids for
   which liquid state heat capacity departure functions can be evaluated to
   include poorly defined (Tc and M are available) individual hydrocarbons
   or mixtures or ill-defined (only elemental analysis is available)
   hydrocarbon mixtures. However, none of these approaches provides
   consistently low deviations from measurements and consequently, direct
   calculation of liquid phase heat capacities is recommended for detailed
   engineering calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Active anodes were fabricated via wet chemical impregnation of optimized
   amount of La0.4Sr0.6TiO3 (L4ST) into La0.4Ce0.6O1.8 (LDC)
   pre-infiltrated porous yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) matrix.
   Impregnations of 10 wt\% LDC with 16 wt\% L4ST significantly improved
   the performance of the fuel cell from 48 mW cm(-2) for pure L4ST to 161
   mW cm(-2) for LDC-L4ST at 900 degrees C in H-2. The contribution of the
   preloaded LDC to this improvement was investigated using electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well
   as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The measurement results
   indicated that pre-infiltrated LDC increased the activity of the anode
   more effectively by decreasing the total polarization resistance of the
   cell from 3.3 Omega cm(2) to 1.0 Omega cm(2) in humidified Hy at 900
   degrees C. More importantly, the LDC nano-deposits (<20 nm) behaved as
   an effective ``adhesive{''} that substantially enhanced the wettability
   of L4ST on YSZ matrix, resulting in finer and more uniform structure of
   L4ST infiltrates. The LDC L4ST cells also demonstrated significantly
   improved performances in 0.5\% H2S-H-2 and 0.5\% H2S- CH4 with higher
   stability than cells with pure L4ST anode. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Electrodeposition of Zn was conducted in a new electrolyte system
   composed of an alkaline solution (9 M KOH + 5 wt\% ZnO) modified with a
   small amount (0.5 wt\%) of room temperature ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMI-DCA). At a high deposition
   current density of 80 mA cm(-2), a porous, dendrite-free Zn film
   characterized by clusters of small Zn particles was obtained. The
   mechanism for the modified Zn morphology in the EMI-DCA containing
   electrolyte was studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry,
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron
   microscopy. It was found that the addition of EMI-DCA changed the Zn
   nucleation process and reduced the potential variation during
   electrodeposition, which suppressed the uneven growth of Zn deposits and
   the formation of Zn dendrites. EIS results indicated that there was
   adsorption of EMI+ cations at the Zn film/electrolyte interface, which
   may have contributed to suppressed dendritic Zn growth. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) measures bulk susceptibilities
   in the brain, which can arise from many sources. In iron-rich
   subcortical gray matter (GM), non-heme iron is a dominant susceptibility
   source. We evaluated the use of QSM for iron mapping in subcortical GM
   by direct comparison to tissue iron staining. We performed in situ or in
   vivo QSM at 4.7 T combined with Perls' ferric iron staining on the
   corresponding extracted subcortical GM regions. This histochemical
   process enabled examination of ferric iron in complete slices that could
   be related to susceptibility measurements. Correlation analyses were
   performed on an individual-by individual basis and high linear
   correlations between susceptibility and Perls' iron stain were found for
   the three multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects studied (R-2 = 0.75, 0.62,
   0.86). In addition, high linear correlations between susceptibility and
   transverse relaxation rate (R2{*}) were found (R-2 = 0.88, 0.88, 0.87)
   which matched in vivo healthy subjects (R-2 = 0.87). This work validates
   the accuracy of QSM for brain iron mapping and also confirms ferric iron
   as the dominant susceptibility source in subcortical GM, by
   demonstrating high linear correlation of QSM to Perls' ferric iron
   staining. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reactive oily bubble technology for flotation of apatite, dolomite and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{74-81}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Reactive oily bubble technology was applied to selectively floating
   apatite from dolomite and quartz. Kerosene containing 100 ppm fatty acid
   was chosen to generate reactive oily bubbles. Zeta potential and contact
   angle were measured to investigate the surface properties of reactive
   oily bubbles and single minerals. The induction time was determined to
   evaluate the effect of different bubbles on bubble-mineral attachment.
   This novel technology was compared with conventional air bubble
   flotation in which collectors were added in the pulp. A shorter
   induction time and hence a stronger collecting power of the reactive
   oily bubbles attaching to the unconditioned minerals than the air
   bubbles attaching to the collector-conditioned minerals were observed.
   With the addition of sodium silicate as depressant at pH 9, the
   induction time of reactive oily bubble attaching to dolomite becomes
   much longer than that attaching to apatite as a result of smaller
   contact angle of dolomite than apatite, which is opposite to the case of
   conventional air bubble flotation with collectors added in the pulp.
   Therefore, a novel phosphate flotation technology is proposed and
   tested. In this novel technology, apatite is separated from dolomite and
   quartz using reactive oily bubble with sodium silicate as depressant,
   followed by separation of dolomite from quartz with conventional air
   bubble flotation. The results of micro-flotation tests demonstrated a
   better flotation separation using the proposed novel technology. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the stabilization problem of the nonlinear
   networked control systems (NCSs) with drops and variable delays. The NCS
   is modeled as a sampled-data system. For such a sampled-data NCS, the
   stability properties are studied for delay that can be both shorter and
   longer than one sampling period, respectively. The exponential stability
   conditions are derived in terms of the parameters of the plant and time
   delay. On the other hand, a model-based control scheme based on an
   approximate discrete-time model of the plant is presented to guarantee
   the stability of the closed-loop system subject to variable time delays
   and packet losses. The performance of the proposed control schemes are
   examined through numerical simulations of an automated rendezvous and
   docking of spacecraft system. Moreover, the simulations show that by
   employing the model-based controller, a higher closed-loop control
   performance can be achieved. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   efficiency of bromate removal was affected by the amount of iron,
   initial concentration of bromate, pH, and reaction temperature. Bromate
   removal was based on pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics, assuming an
   irreversible surface reaction to be the rate-controlling step. The

Title = {{Effect of free volume redistribution on the diffusivity of water and

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Pages = {{258-267}},

Abstract = {{We used molecular dynamics simulation to study the diffusion of two
   selected penetrants, water and benzene, in poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)
   over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations to gain insights
   into their diffusion mechanisms under different conditions. To help
   understand the effect of free volume on the diffusion behavior of water
   and benzene, we used the technique of Voronoi tessellation to determine
   key characteristics of free volume redistribution. Unlike the Connolly
   surface analysis method. Voronoi tessellation yields information not
   only on the mean fractional free volume but also on the size
   distribution of the free volume surrounding each penetrant molecule and
   its time evolution in the case of water, we showed that it was the free
   volume redistribution frequency that led to an observation, previously
   reported in the literature, that the self diffusion coefficient of water
   increases with increasing water concentration despite the fact that
   increase in water concentration decreases the mean fractional free
   volume in PVA. In the case of benzene (non-polar) diffusing in PVA
   (polar), we demonstrated that the failure of the Macki-Meares model was
   not entirely due to the dissimilarity between the intermolecular
   interactions. Rather, one of the reasons was the inability of the
   benzene molecules to break the hydrogen bonds between the PVA chains
   which are essential to increase the polymer segments mobility. Higher
   polymer segmental mobility is needed to create larger fluctuations in
   free volume holes for benzene to diffuse. This would in turn prevent the
   benzene molecules, with a relatively larger size compared to water
   molecules, from diffusing by a fluid-like streaming mechanism that is
   required by the model. In fact, the Macki-Meares model also failed for
   water at low temperatures and concentrations, as water diffused by a
   hopping mechanism under such conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hip extensor strategy, specifically relative contribution of gluteus
   maximus versus hamstrings, will influence quadriceps effort required
   during squat exercise, as hamstrings and quadriceps co-contract at the
   knee. This research examined the effects of hip extensor strategy on
   quadriceps relative muscular effort (RME) during barbell squat. Inverse
   dynamics-based torque-driven musculoskeletal models were developed to
   account for hamstrings co-contraction. Net joint moments were calculated
   using 3D motion analysis and force platform data. Hamstrings
   co-contraction was modelled under two assumptions: (1) equivalent
   gluteus maximus and hamstrings activation (Model 1) and (2) preferential
   gluteus maximus activation (Model 2). Quadriceps RME, the ratio of
   quadriceps moment to maximum knee extensor strength, was determined
   using inverse dynamics only, Model 1 and Model 2. Quadriceps RME was
   greater in both Models 1 and 2 than inverse dynamics only at barbell
   loads of 50-90\% one repetition maximum. The highest quadriceps RMEs
   were 120 +/- 36\% and 87 +/- 28\% in Models 1 and 2, respectively, which
   suggests that barbell squats are only feasible using the Model 2
   strategy prioritising gluteus maximus versus hamstrings activation.
   These results indicate that developing strength in both gluteus maximus
   and quadriceps is essential for lifting heavy loads in squat exercise.}},

   simultaneously by measuring streamwise water velocity and depth using an
   acoustic Doppler current profiler. The full mixing length for this

Abstract = {{This work is devoted to the numerical study of the porosity distribution
   and gas flow within randomly packed fixed beds comprising polydisperse
   spherical particles with Rosin-Rammler particle size distribution in a
   cylindrical container. The fixed bed is numerically generated using
   gravity-forced sedimentation modeled utilizing the discrete element
   method. The radial porosity distribution of monodisperse fixed beds was
   validated against published experimental data and good agreement was
   achieved. The diameter ratio of smallest to largest particle was varied
   from 1:2 to 1:5 and then 1:10. The simulation revealed overall
   porosities of 0.38 for the monodisperse bed and 0.345 and 0.33 for
   polydisperse beds with ratios of 1:2 and 1:10, respectively. In the
   second part, the fluid flow within the generated fixed beds was examined
   using a numerical solution to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
   in the Brinkman-Forcheimer formulation. An analysis of the results
   showed that in the case of a monodisperse fixed bed and low Reynolds
   numbers (Re) the pressure drop predicted numerically is close to the
   values calculated using Ergun's relation. The increase inRe leads to the
   deviation between the numerical and analytical predictions. This effect
   is because of channeling due to the sinusoidal distribution of the void
   fraction close to the wall.}},

Abstract = {{Because packaged food needs to travel longer distances and to have
   longer shelf life than unpackaged food, the performance of packaging is
   vital. Due to their barrier and mechanical properties and their ease of
   processing, petroleum-based polymers have emerged as a major food
   packaging material. The increasing use of such polymers, which are
   non-biodegradable, has led to growing concerns about their negative
   impacts on the environment upon disposal. As a result, the possibility
   of replacing petroleum-based polymers by natural polymers has been
   intensively investigated over the past decade. In general, natural
   polymers are still, from the performance and price perspectives,
   inferior to petroleum-based polymers. Obviously, more research is needed
   to close this gap. Among the various natural sources available,
   biopolymers from wood, plants, or the forest sector have outstanding
   potential. This short review article intends to summarize the efforts of
   various researchers to explore the possibility of using wood fibres for
   food packaging applications. Specifically, the discussion will focus on
   cellulose and hemicelluloses (xylan in particular) as well as on the
   role of cellulose nanocrystals in improving packaging barrier
   properties.}},

   MCCs and network-induced time-varying communication delays occur in each

   channel switching phenomenon is modeled as a continuous-time Markov
   process and a Markov jump linear system (MJLS) is exploited to model the
   overall networked system. An H-infinity controller is designed such that
   the closed-loop MJLS is mean square exponentially stable and the
   disturbance attenuation level is bounded by an H-infinity bound. A
   numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed controller design and the advantages of exploiting MCCs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of different cooperative sensing
   strategies on erroneous spectrum sensing for an interweave cognitive
   radio network. The setup is as follows. Primary receiver nodes and
   secondary nodes are randomly distributed in R-2. We model them as two
   independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. Beacon (out-of-band)
   signals, periodically transmitted by primary receivers, indicate to the
   secondary nodes that spectrum is occupied. Whenever beacon detection
   fails, the transmissions of secondary nodes generate harmful
   interference. Thus, to alleviate this issue, the misdetection
   probability of secondary nodes must be reduced. To this end, we propose
   two strategies: 1) a secondary node cooperates with its closest
   neighbour, and 2) a secondary node cooperates with M random neighbours
   within a given radius. Furthermore, along with these co-operation
   strategies, we investigate three primary beacon detection methods for
   secondary nodes: 1) separately decoding each primary beacon, 2)
   detecting only the closest primary receiver? s beacon, and 3) detecting
   the aggregate beacon signal from all primary receivers. For the
   exponential path loss and Rayleigh fading considered, we derive the
   total misdetection probability for each scheme along with the resulting
   outage probability of a primary receiver. We finally show through
   numerical results that M co-operation works better for lower reception
   thresholds, and that for a reception threshold of -120 dBm, a 10(4) fold
   decrease in the misdetection probability is achievable.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient backscatter is a new communication technology that utilizes
   ambient radio frequency signals to enable battery-free devices to
   communicate with each other. In this paper, we study the problem of

   eliminate the necessity of channel estimation. We formulate a new
   transmission model, design the data detection approach, and derive the
   optimal/approximate closed-form detection thresholds. In addition, the
   performance at high signal-to-noise region (SNR) is also analyzed, where
   the lower and the upper bounds of BERs are found. Simulation results are
   then provided to corroborate our theoretical studies.}},

   exploit the partitions of partial products using recursive

Abstract = {{For the novel channel estimation method using compressed sensing (CS),
   many strategies have been proposed for its performance improvements.
   Nevertheless, random sequences are usually used to construct sensing
   matrix, but it is difficult and expensive to be implemented in hardware,
   and may cause large Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in OFDM system.
   Consequently, in this paper, the method that to obtain deterministic
   sensing matrix by deterministic sequence named as Golay Complementary
   Sequence is detailed investigated. Golay sequence has the properties as
   perfect periodic auto-correlations, simultaneously realizing timing
   acquisition and channel estimation. Also PAPR can be limited within 3dB
   in OFDM system by the method. Simulation results show that the
   deterministic sensing matrix can offer reconstruction performance
   similar to random matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Discretizing the continuous-time controller of a master-slave
   teleoperation system can simplify control implementation. However, in
   teleoperation systems, discrete-time control can cause a performance
   degradation compared to continuous-time control. In digitally controlled
   bilateral teleoperation systems, there exist stability-imposed bounds on
   the gains of the discrete-time controller and the sampling period, and a
   trade-off between the two. This means that given a sampling period, it
   is impossible for the discretized controller to have gains above a
   threshold, which may well be necessary for successful performance of
   teleoperated tasks requiring highly accurate master-slave position
   tracking. In a teleoperation system with analog controller, however,
   stability does not impose any upper bound on the control gains, thus
   facilitating the performance of tasks that do require highly accurate
   master-slave position tracking. Inspired by this advantage of analog
   control, in this paper we develop a Field Programmable Analog Arrays
   (FPAA) based controller for bilateral teleoperation, which can achieve
   higher control gain than its discrete-time counterpart. We present the
   results of a user study measuring the human performance for a task
   involving flipping a stiff switch through a teleoperation system. We
   experimentally show that large sampling periods, necessitating low
   control gains for maintaining stability, lead to unacceptable task
   performance. We then show that humans can successfully perform the same
   task with the FPAA-based controller for the teleoperation system.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental wireless sensor networks are usually composed of a large
   group of cooperating wireless sensor nodes spread over an area of
   interest. They often operate in remote locations and thus must be
   designed for energy-efficiency and reliability. At the same time, their
   deployment and operational characteristics must correspond to the
   spatial distribution of the phenomena of interest. There are a number of
   approaches that attempt to resolve this trade-off between energy
   consumption and quality of collected data. Most of them concentrate
   directly on energy efficiency and communication aspects of network
   operation. In this contribution, we propose a new method that uses data
   quality as the primary goal of network optimization. Based on the
   concept of data entropy, it develops a hierarchical heterogeneous
   network where individual nodes sample the measured quantities according
   to the potential information gain. This can be used to save energy by
   lowering sampling rates of nodes at location with low variability of
   monitored variables or high correlation with other nodes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a method to synthesize an optimal controller for the
   SCR section of the diesel exhaust after-treatment system, which is based
   on a system model consisting of coupled hyperbolic and parabolic partial
   differential equations (PDEs). This results in a boundary control
   problem, where the control objectives are to reduce the amount of NOx
   emissions and ammonia slip to the fullest extent possible using the
   inlet concentration of ammonia as the manipulated variable. The proposed
   method combines the method of characteristics and spectral decomposition
   to produce a non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) approach. The
   results show that the proposed NMPC is able to achieve a very high level
   of control performance in terms of NOx and ammonia slip reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by applications to distributed storage and computing, the
   multi-version coding problem was formulated by Wang and Cadambe in
   {[}4]. In this problem, a client sequently over time stores v
   independent versions of a message in a storage system with n server
   nodes. It is assumed that, a message version may not reach some servers,
   and that each server is unaware of what has been stored in other
   servers. The problem requires that any c servers must be able to
   reconstruct their latest common version. An extended multi-version
   problem introduced in {[}5] relaxes the above requirement by requiring
   any c servers to be able to reconstruct their latest common version or
   any version later than that. The objective in both the original and
   extended multi-version problem is to minimize the worst case storage
   cost.
   In this work, we propose codes for both the multi-version problem and
   its extension. For the original multi-version coding problem, we show
   that the storage cost of our proposed codes are near-optimal. For the
   extended multi-version coding problem, we show that the storage cost of
   our first algorithm is optimal when v vertical bar c - 1. Our second
   proposed extended multi-version code shows that storage cost of strictly
   less than one is achievable even when v is 50\% larger than c. This is
   interesting, as the storage cost of existing codes becomes one as soon
   as v becomes larger than c.}},

Abstract = {{In an underlay cognitive radio network, the secondary (underlay)
   transmitters generate interference to a primary receiver, while an
   underlay receiver is subject to interference from both the primary
   transmitters and other underlay transmitters not associated with it.
   Although guard regions, maximum allowable underlay transmit powers, and
   contention distances help guarantee a minimum performance to the primary
   network, no such safeguard exists for the underlay network. To this end,
   this paper characterizes the aggregate interference on an underlay
   receiver while considering power control and receiver association
   schemes for both networks. Transmitters and receivers of both networks
   are assumed to be distributed as independent Poisson fields in the 2-D
   plane, and all links undergo exponential path loss and Rayleigh fading.
   We derive the moment generating function of the aggregate interference
   on an underlay receiver and its outage probability. We show that the
   interference from the primary network does not depend on any node
   density, and that it dominates the aggregate interference. Furthermore,
   it is shown that increasing primary and underlay receiver densities
   reduce the outage probability under lower required power thresholds for
   the primary receivers.}},

Abstract = {{In a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) interference network, the maximum
   achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) determines the
   level of quality of service (QoS) that can be supported by each stream.
   In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing the minimum SINR of
   independent parallel data streams across all users in a MIMO
   interference network that employs interference alignment (IA) in the
   presence of channel state information (CSI) uncertainty. To this end, we
   propose a low-complexity robust SINR fairness algorithm based on the
   power allocation across data streams. Building on the conventional IA
   design, we provide a closed-form solution for the power allocation
   problem. It is observed that the proposed power allocation (PA)-based
   robust design outperforms the conventional robust design, when the
   channel changes drastically and the CSI uncertainty cannot be reliably
   bounded. Furthermore, the PA-based robust design provides significant
   performance gain over the benchmark Max-SINR algorithm.}},

   to maximizing the minimum of the determinant of the Wishart matrices

   is investigated by deriving the average sum rate approximations in

Abstract = {{Electric vehicle (EV) charging and discharging management is an
   essential component of the smart grids, especially in microgrids due to
   the high dependence on the local energy sources. In order to provide EV
   users with freedom to charge and travel, we propose a dynamic scheduling
   algorithm that does not require EV users to inform their charging time
   to the control center. The proposed algorithm serves the charging
   requests from EVs in a best-effort manner while minimizing the energy
   cost of EV users and guaranteeing the grid related constraint of
   microgrid. Specifically, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem
   to minimize the energy cost of charging and discharging for each EV with
   respect to the same constraints of the proposed algorithm. The
   simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves energy cost
   better or close to that of the conventional methods without requiring
   the a-priori knowledge of load demand, renewable energy source (RES)
   output, and EV charging plans.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption due to residential building operation is a crucial
   issue in cold-climate regions. In order to alleviate the energy demand
   from residential building operation, the concept of NetZero energy homes
   (NZEHs) has emerged as a solution. Appropriate design of the building
   envelope for NZEHs, (including insulation type and thickness,
   configuration, and other parameters), is a key to ensuring a high level
   of energy performance of NZEHs, and energy simulation provides a tool to
   investigate the energy performance of design options for each component
   of the NZEH building envelope. HOT2000, which is a widely used energy
   simulation tool in Canada, is used for energy simulation in this
   research; in order to achieve the goal of simulation automation, the
   Batch Version of HOT2000 is utilized. The energy performance of design
   options is simulated for such main components of NZEH building envelope
   as main wall, exposed floor, attic, basement wall, and basement floor,
   and, based on the simulation results, the functions and charts of energy
   performance are developed for these components. This research

Abstract = {{Power dissipation has become a significant concern for integrated
   circuit design in nanometric CMOS technology. To reduce power
   consumption, approximate implementations of a circuit have been
   considered as a potential solution for applications in which strict
   exactness is not required. In approximate computing, power reduction is
   achieved through the relaxation of the often demanding requirement of
   accuracy. In this paper, new approximate adders are proposed for low
   -power imprecise applications by using logic reduction at the gate level
   as an approach to relaxing numerical accuracy. Transmission gates are
   utilized in the designs of two approximate full adders with reduced
   complexity. A further positive feature of the proposed designs is the
   reduction of the critical path delay. The approximate adders show
   advantages in terms of power dissipation over accurate and recently
   proposed approximate adders. An image processing application is
   presented using the proposed approximate adders to evaluate the
   efficiency in power and delay at application level.}},

   simulation -based assessment of three inexact schemes for the PE are
   pursued with respect to circuit level performance (such as delay, power
   consumption and number of transistors) and figures of merit of
   approximate computing (such as the error distance). The execution of MM
   in each PE results in an inexact computation affecting only the outputs
   of the same columns, so the extension of inexact computation to a
   systolic array can also be performed with very limited error. The
   discrete cosine transform as application of the proposed inexact
   systolic arrays, is evaluated; simulation results show that the proposed
   inexact array is very effective, incurring in a small error.}},

Abstract = {{A survivable network is typically designed as 100\% single failure
   restorable with dual failure as the dominant failure scenarios. It is
   therefore of interest to assess how strong a survivable network is under
   dual failure scenarios, which is referred to as dual failure
   availability. Three indicators are currently employed as a surrogate for
   dual failure availability, including restorability, service path
   unavailability, and number of non-restored working capacities. It is
   common practice to enhance restorability and lower service path
   unavailability by minimizing number of non-restored working capacities.
   These three indicators, however, cannot evaluate availability accurately
   because they ignore the inner connection of channels on either failed
   spans under a specific dual failure scenario. Conversely, number of lost
   paths is proposed to replace them in this paper. Theoretical analysis
   proves that number of lost paths is more accurate compared with the
   traditional indicators. A case study further supports the assertion that
   the new indicator is more accurate than the old ones in span-restorable
   networks intuitively.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of liquid level and material identification using
   ultra-wideband radar is an active area of research. In this paper a
   compact 8-element antenna array is designed for ultra-wide band (UWB)
   pulsed radar in highly reflective metallic environments, such as storage
   and transport tankers. The designed Vivaldi antenna and array are
   characterized in terms of the transient gain for a 3-10 GHz excitation
   pulse and the signal fidelity given in terms of the off-angle signal
   correlation. The 10 dB transient gain beam width in the E-plane is 50
   degrees compared to 130 degrees using the 8-element array vs. single
   element. Additionally, the reflection data with the array is measured in
   a metallic tank environment and the noise/interference is shown to be
   greatly reduced compared to single antenna measurement. A calibrated
   layer stripping method used for material and layer-interface
   identification is outlined and the accuracy with an array compared to
   single element is shown. The measurement of a multilayer set-up
   consisting of canola oil on marble demonstrating the prediction accuracy

Abstract = {{Labor productivity is a fundamental building block of planning and
   controlling in construction, and therefore, predicting labor
   productivity levels for a given condition is very important in
   construction management. However, predicting labor productivity is
   extremely difficult due to a large number of factors that can affect
   productivity in perplexing ways. Another obstacle to predicting labor
   productivity is the qualitative nature and subjectivity of productivity
   factors. To address these issues, a soft computing technique called
   Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) is proposed as a tool to model the complex
   inter-relationships between productivity factors based on expert
   knowledge, and for assessing the impact of the productivity factors on
   labor productivity. In this paper, the methodology for creating and
   using FCMs for this purpose is introduced, and then an exercise is
   presented for demonstration purposes. Additionally, issues identified
   from this exercise are described, and the way that FCMs can be
   practically used in the field for predicting labor productivity is also
   discussed in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Construction companies always try to employ practical tools to assess
   risks and determine project contingency, yet the uncertain nature of
   risk makes it difficult to ensure that the assessment process is
   accurate or the agreed-upon project contingency is sufficient to deal
   with such uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel contingency
   determination procedure that employs fuzzy arithmetic in carrying out
   its computational steps. Fuzzy linguistic scales are used in this
   procedure to help experts assess the probability and impact of events
   using linguistic terms that are described by fuzzy numbers instead of
   inaccurate, single crisp values. The introduction of fuzzy logic helps
   experts use their own judgment-rather than relying on historical data-in
   determining contingency that deals with the shortcomings of applying the
   probabilistic risk analysis approaches in the absence of historical risk
   data. The paper also illustrates a new userfriendly software tool,
   namely, Fuzzy Contingency Determinator(C), which has been developed to
   carry out the steps of the procedure. The main contributions of this
   paper are (1) the introduction of a new contingency determination
   procedure, based on fuzzy logic, which can handle the subjective
   uncertainty of experts in assessing critical events leading to risk and
   opportunity and in determining contingency, and (2) the implementation
   of the procedure using a simple and user-friendly software tool.}},

Abstract = {{Construction crew worker behavior emerges from interaction with fellow
   crew members, social influence, interaction with the environment, and
   personal characteristics (e.g., self-efficacy, goal commitment).
   Agent-based modeling is a good solution for handling complex systems of
   interacting agents and therefore is suitable for modeling construction
   crew behavior. Agent-based modeling can handle system complexities that
   arise from interactions of the system components; however, many
   systems-especially those comprising human behavior and social
   relationships-also include subjective uncertainties, which are not
   accounted for in agent-based modeling. Fuzzy logic, on the other hand,
   is able to deal with subjective uncertainty; therefore, for modeling
   behavioral and social systems such as construction crew behavior,
   integrating these two techniques is advantageous. In this paper, we
   present the concept of agent-based modeling, then we introduce the
   concept of integrating fuzzy logic and agent-based modeling. Finally, we
   present the development of a fuzzy agent-based model of construction
   crew behavior that will allow us to predict construction crew
   performance. The contribution of this paper is in introducing the
   integration of fuzzy logic and agent-based modeling in construction
   modeling and developing a fuzzy agent-based model of construction crew

Abstract = {{Due to the effective attenuation on switching-frequency harmonics with a
   smaller size of passive components, the high-order filters using LC trap
   branch are recently emerging into grid-tied voltage-source inverter
   (VSI) systems. Based on the idea of LC trap branch, a new-type CL-LC
   line-side filter is proposed for high-power PWM current-source drive
   systems in this paper. Compared with the conventional line-side CL
   filter in the PWM current-source drives, the adoption of the proposed
   CL-LC filter not only saves the total size of line-side capacitor so
   that minimizes the reactive power flow through the line impedance, but
   also further attenuates the low-order dominant harmonics produced by
   high-power PWM current-source rectifier (CSR). As a result, the input
   power factor of the drive system is effectively improved. Simulation and
   experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed filter.}},

Abstract = {{As new materials, new technology such as cloud computing and new
   configurations for the manufacturing enterprise emerge, the distinctions
   among mechatronics, manufacturing, and service industries become
   blurred. Consequently, it is expected that the definitions of Industrial
   Processes become even broader. Outsourcing industrial processes is a
   common practice and also strategy weapon for many companies to reduce
   costs and enhance the utilization of internal resources forming core
   competencies. This paper presents the concept of an industrial
   product-service system for oil sands mining (om-iPSS) based on the
   utility enhancement of oil sands mining systems. The intelligent
   technologies such as the cloud computing are proposed as embedding
   knowledge in the outsourcing-oriented om-iPSS for the whole life cycle
   of production process. As a result, the om-iPSS with advanced
   characteristics such as distributed, intelligence, adaptation and
   self-organization is developed in which a novel approach for enabling
   individualized and highly-customized production is proposed.
   Architecture is proposed to enable the om-iPSS from the aspects of both
   hardware and software. Key techniques for implementing the architecture

Abstract = {{As the penetration level of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)
   increases, the charging demand of PHEVs is expected to have a major
   impact on the loading of distribution systems. Charging access control,
   which determines the starting time of PHEV charging, is critical to
   mitigate such impact. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve PHEV
   charging access control by leveraging the electricity price set by
   electricity retailer and the speculative prices of PHEV owners. A
   firm-union bargaining game approach is proposed to study the
   interactions between the electricity retailer and PHEV owners. In order
   to eliminate the requirement of a centralized energy management system,
   we extend the original centralized firm-union bargaining game approach
   to a semi-distributed approach. In particular, the retailer plays the
   role of the union for wage control by setting the electricity price for
   PHEV charging, while balancing the revenue and cost. On the other hand,
   each PHEV owner uses a responsive strategy to optimize his/her own
   benefit by choosing an appropriate charging starting time. Through
   nonlinear programming, a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium solution can
   be attained. The PHEV owners in the game can determine their strategies
   independently to maximize their own benefits. The model is further
   extended to consider the cost of charging demand fluctuation reflected
   by the cost of purchasing frequency regulation or spinning reserve
   services by distribution utilities. Extensive numerical results are
   presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, home energy storage system is emerging as one of the main
   driving forces to prompt the development of the future smart grid. By
   leveraging time-based electricity pricing, the home energy storage
   system can store energy during off-peak periods and supply energy to
   residential customers during on-peak periods, such that the stress on
   main power system can be relieved. Yet, an efficient use of home energy
   storage system is still a challenging issue, due to the nonlinear
   properties of the battery in terms of energy conversion loss and
   shortened battery life, and the randomness in residential energy demand.
   In this paper, we investigate the utilization of smart home monitoring
   and communication technologies to recognize the resident activity of
   daily life (ADL) and propose a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model
   (NHMM) to characterize the residential energy demand. An optimal energy
   storage management problem is formulated by taking into account the NHMM
   and nonlinear battery properties. This problem belongs to a class of
   adaptive stochastic control problems in smart grid with nonlinear value
   functions. In order to solve this problem efficiently, piecewise linear
   approximation is applied to the energy conversion function, and a
   state-dependent multi-threshold policy is proposed and proved to be
   optimal. The performance of the proposed energy management scheme is
   evaluated via a case study based on CASAS smart home dataset collected
   in real life by Washington State University. Numerical results indicate
   that our proposed energy storage management scheme can achieve energy
   cost savings, in comparison with existing schemes with uniform and

   harvesting networks, composed of nodes equipped with solar panels and

   this approach created using a collection of geospatially correlated
   atmospheric pressure and solar intensity measurements. The trained model
   is used to estimate next-day solar energy availability from a time
   series of recent atmospheric pressure values and their differences. The

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring sensor networks often operate in remote
   locations and thus must be designed for energy-efficiency and
   reliability. The first goal of energy efficiency can be achieved through
   low-power design of the monitoring hardware, often supplemented by
   energy management schemes of varying complexity and sophistication. In
   case of sensor nodes endowed with energy-harvesting capabilities, the
   energy management systems can take advantage of harvesting outlook that
   can take the form of prediction of energy available for harvest in the
   near future. When designing such sophisticated prediction and management
   schemes, it is important to consider the energy cost of gathering the
   predictor data and executing the forecasting algorithm. This
   contribution describes the results of experiments designed to assess the
   energy required to run a recently introduced energy-availability
   forecasting algorithm based on evolutionary fuzzy rules. In particular,
   it presents an analysis of experiments conducted using several hardware
   platforms typically used to implement the computational core of
   environmental sensor nodes. The results clearly show the advantages of
   using modern low-power, 32-bit hardware platforms. In addition, they
   demonstrate the advantages of support for floating point operations, as
   well the importance of embedded code optimization to maximize the
   benefits of the modern microcontroller units.}},

Abstract = {{It has become evident that for low-power design concept to be realized,
   modules within the system need to be optimized. Consequently, the sensor
   node architecture also known as sensor station is required to operate in
   an optimized manner to help contribute in reduction of total power
   consumption of the system. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
   data obtained in a Brazilian field study were used to investigate the
   errors in measurements that would have been missed if sampling time of
   PAR variable was increased from 5 minutes upto 30 minutes. This is
   required, not only to help reduce of energy consumption of the sensor
   station but also to help facilitate the integration of lower frequency
   bands of industrial scientific and medical (ISM) into the system.
   Results obtained indicate that daytime PAR variable should be sampled
   and logged every 20 minutes while longer sampling time may be used
   during the night-time. Daytime sampling of 30 minutes interval is not
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The current paper presents the Pseudo-Incident Wave method for the
   theoretical treatment of the dynamic interaction between general

   simulating the response of such complicated systems using purely
   numerical or analytical methods, the current technique will take the
   advantages of the accuracy and reliability of analytical solutions and
   the flexibility of numerical methods. Using this method the original
   interaction problem is reduced to the solution of coupled single
   inhomogeneity problems, for which analytical solutions or simpler
   numerical solutions could be derived. By considering the consistency
   condition between different inhomogeneities, the steady state dynamic
   solution of multiple interaction problems can be formulated in terms of
   coupled single inhomogeneity solutions. The current method is very
   general and can provide reliable simulation of complicated interaction
   problems. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the Pseudo-Incident Wave method in simulating dynamic

Abstract = {{People are highly efficient in recognizing faces. However, it is almost
   impossible for them to cope with huge datasets of facial images without
   any computational support. On the other hand, the way people describe
   the facial features using quite commonly encountered descriptors such as
   ``long nose{''}, ``small eyes{''} and also allude to their feelings
   according to a specific person like ``seems to be nice{''}, may be
   utilized to enhance automatic face recognition systems. This offers an
   interesting possibility to incorporate human perception of faces and
   relations between facial features into machine-made computations. To
   address this aspect, one can engage the linguistic descriptors and the
   linguistic modeling. In this study, we present a comprehensive survey of
   the state-of-the-art studies and elaborate on some promising

   problem is investigated for the individual channel estimation at the

   source-relay channels is conducted sequentially, the proposed scheme
   exploits the broadcast nature of the source-relay links to save training
   time and power. By analyzing the total mean square error (MSE) of all
   channel estimates and with the help of approximations, we derive a
   training power allocation solution among the source and the relays.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a simple but efficient permutation enhanced parallel
   reconstruction architecture for compressive sampling (CS) is proposed.
   In this architecture, a measurement matrix is constructed from a
   block-diagonal sensing matrix, the sparsifying basis of the target
   signal, and a pre-defined permutation matrix. In this way, the
   projection of the signal onto the sparsifying basis can be divided into
   several segments and all segments can be reconstructed in parallel.
   Thus, the computational complexity and the time for reconstruction can
   be reduced significantly. With a good permutation matrix, the error
   performance of the proposed method can be improved compared with the
   option without permutation. The proposed method can be used in
   applications where the computational complexity and time for
   reconstruction are crucial evaluation criteria and centralized sampling
   is acceptable. Simulation results show that the proposed method can
   achieve comparable results to the centralized reconstruction methods
   (i.e., standard CS and distributed CS), while requiring much less
   reconstruction time.}},

Abstract = {{Sensors are a common way of collecting health data on any sophisticated
   machinery. Utilizing the real time machine sensor data in order to
   predict problems ahead in time to mitigate the risk associated with
   unplanned failures has been of great interest to statisticians and
   reliability engineers as there are direct cost saving benefits. In
   effort to reduce downtime and improve overall reliability of the system,
   a robust, scalable modelling technique is desired to understand and
   forecast the future dynamics of the system as whole. We propose and
   analyze a framework for stochastic modeling of multidimensional machine
   sensor data. The system developed is self-adaptive and can be used with
   live data feed to provide real time predictions. We utilize the concept
   of low rank matrix approximation for efficient storage, retrieval and
   faster computation of real time data. Markov chain is used to model the
   process dynamics and to calculate short and long range probabilities of
   the system which can be used to identify potential failure introduction
   points in the system.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the performance of a non-isolated DC/DC boost converter is
   investigated during load variation since unexpected transients
   frequently happen in power systems. This boost converter is simulated in
   MATLAB/Simulink and the results are presented under different transient
   conditions. The simulation shows that the output voltage maintains in
   its desired value as long as the converter operates in continuous
   current mode operation. However, the system encounters the output
   voltage instability due to mode change from continuous to discontinuous
   current operation modes. Therefore, two distinct control methods are
   designed in order to maintain the output voltage in a constant desired
   value under the mode changing condition. First method is a closed-loop
   control with a pure integrator in the feedback path. The second one is
   the mode-change control method. This controller uses a calculating unit
   to find the proper duty ratio based on the value of the output current.
   In fact, this unit follows two different amounts of duty ratio for
   continuous and discontinuous modes. The results illustrate that the
   application of both controllers could properly control the output
   voltage and prevent its instability in discontinuous current operation
   modes. In addition, advantages and disadvantages of each method are
   presented and their comparison is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from an experimental investigation about the
   influence of loading history on the elastic modulus of high-density
   polyethylene (HDPE). The study uses a new approach, named two-test
   method, to introduce the loading history using the first test and at
   least one month later, to measure the elastic modulus using the second
   test. The period of minimum one month between the two tests is to ensure
   that recovery of the viscous deformation from the first tests does not
   affect the measured elastic modulus from the second tests. Parameters
   considered to vary the loading history include maximum deformation (with
   the area strain up to 0.5 in most cases), loading mode (monotonic,
   cyclic and creep tension), test speed (from 0.005 to 30 mm/min), and
   stress triaxiality (through the change in the specimen gauge length), in
   which the area strain is defined as the logarithmic ratio of the
   original cross sectional area (i.e., the cross sectional area of virgin
   specimen) to the deformed cross sectional area. All of the second tests
   were conducted under monotonic tension at the crosshead speed of 0.001
   mm/min. The results show the general trend of decrease of the elastic
   modulus, measured from the second tests, with the increase of the strain
   applied in the first tests. The results further indicate that test speed
   for deformation introduced in the first tests may have a significant
   influence on the elastic modulus measured from the second tests. The
   elastic modulus is used to determine damage parameter D based on the
   damage concept, based on influence of the loading history on the
   mechanical properties of HDPE is characterized.}},

   alternative method (named plate test) to ASTM D1693 for characterizing
   environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR) of polyethylene (PE).
   The plate test does not require any pre-notch in the specimens to
   initiate the crack growth. Rather, the crack is generated during the
   test, initiated by the constraints for lateral contraction in the
   necking process. This paper introduces the set-up for the plate test,
   describes the deformation process, presents preliminary results for 4
   types of PE, and compares results from the plate test with those from
   ASTM D1693.}},

Abstract = {{Vector quantization (VQ) is a general data compression technique that
   has a scalable implementation complexity and potentially a high
   compression ratio. In this paper, a novel implementation of VQ using
   stochastic circuits is proposed and its performance is evaluated. The
   stochastic and binary designs are compared for the same compression
   quality and the circuits are synthesized for an industrial 28-nm cell
   library. The effects of varying the sequence length of the stochastic
   design are studied with respect to the performance metric of throughput
   per area (TPA). When a shortened 512-bit encoding sequence is used to
   obtain a lower quality compression, the TPA is about 2.60 times that of
   the binary implementation with the same quality as that of the
   stochastic implementation measured by the L-1 norm error (i.e., the
   first-order error). Thus, the stochastic implementation outperforms the
   conventional binary design in terms of TPA for a relatively low
   compression quality. By exploiting the progressive precision feature of
   a stochastic circuit, a readily scalable processing quality can be
   attained by simply halting the computation after different numbers of
   clock cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of a power electronic system is identified with its system
   efficiency, system cost, and the devices being used. This work
   illustrates how a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based Pulse Width
   Modulation (PWM) switching scheme can be used as a low cost control
   solution to provide better excitation for the magnetic core of a 3-Limb
   Core Coupled Inductor Inverter (CII). A modified version of interleaved
   discontinuous PWM scheme with two carrier signals is conceptually chosen
   to keep the flux to the magnetic core. The PWM switching patterns are
   chosen to guarantee that all the inverter switching states maintain a
   zero inductor net winding voltage for the three phases. In a practical
   sense, this requires extensive control and modulation tasks which calls
   for a high-end processor with parallel and post processing capacities. A
   less complex solution, by manipulating the original conceptual scheme,
   is introduced as an alternative Pre-Processed scheme for a DSP
   environment using only one carrier signal. Experimental results verify
   that the DSP PWM module can successfully implement the target PWM
   scheme. The DSP realization of the PWM scheme not only provides cost
   effectiveness by eliminating the need for a high-end processor, but also
   minimizes the size of the control circuitry. Experimental results
   confirm that the DSP based scheme offers efficiency enhancements
   expected from the original conceptual scheme due to benefits related to
   the reduction of the high-frequency winding current ripple.}},

Abstract = {{To satisfy the requirement of operating DG units in both grid-tied and
   islanding microgrids, relatively large shunt capacitors are often
   selected for the output LCL filters of power converters. This
   modification can bring a few challenges, such as haimonic distortions
   and steady-state tracking errors, to the line current regulation during
   power converter grid-tied operation. In addition, the line current
   control problems can be more severe when the model-based one-step
   deadbeat current control scheme is used to reduce the computational load
   of DG unit controller and to enhance the dynamic current response. To
   overcome these limitations, a resonance dampened control method is
   developed utilizing the concept of the recently proposed weighted
   average current control with two current measurements. First, the
   weighted average current is accurately controlled via a modified
   deadbeat control scheme based on a virtual filter plant. To reduce the
   line current tracking errors caused by weighted average current
   approximation, a simple feed-forward term using existing grid voltage
   measurement is added to the line current reference of the proposed
   deadbeat control. Simulated and experimental results validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In order to integrate renewable energy into the utility grid with high
   penetration, AC/DC hybrid microgrids have obtained much attentions in
   recent years since they feature both advantages of AC microgrids and DC
   microgrids. In an AC/DC hybrid microgrid, the parallel-operated AC/DC
   bi-directional interfacing converters (IFCs) are key elements to connect
   AC bus and DC bus. When unbalanced grid faults occur at the AC bus, the
   active power transferred by the parallel-operated AC/DC interfacing
   converters is desired to be maintained constant and oscillation-free to
   ensure the stable operation of DC bus. However, with conventional
   control strategies in unbalanced grid conditions, the active power
   transfer capability of IFCs will be affected due to the current rating
   limitations. Therefore, the parallel operation of IFCs in a hybrid
   microgrid under unbalanced AC grid conditions is studied, and a control
   strategy, which enhances the active power transfer capability with zero
   active power oscillation, is proposed. Adjustable reference current
   coefficients for parallel IFCs are introduced in the proposed control
   strategy to enable the flexible current sharing among IFCs. By utilizing
   the proposed control strategy, only one IFC needs to be designed and
   installed with higher current rating to ensure the constant and
   oscillation-free output active power. Simulations and experiments have
   verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.}},

Abstract = {{For high-power PWM converters, selective harmonic elimination (SHE)
   modulation scheme is commonly adopted to reduce the low-order harmonics
   caused by low switching frequency. However, the SHE scheme itself lacks
   the capability to actively compensate the grid background harmonics. To
   enable the active compensation ability of the SHE modulated PWM
   converters, a selective harmonic compensation (SHC) scheme and an SHE
   phase jittering method have been proposed in previous works, and their
   effectiveness to actively attenuate one grid line current harmonic were
   verified on a high power PWM current-source rectifier (CSR) system
   application. Nevertheless, both of the two methods have difficulty in
   compensating two harmonics simultaneously, which limits their
   applications with a low resonant frequency of converter system's filter
   circuit. This paper extends the previous studies to enable the
   high-power PWM converters to actively compensate two grid background
   harmonics. The proposed method can not only further reduce the grid line
   current distortion, but also makes the application of the active
   compensation no longer limited by the filter circuit. Experimental
   results of its application on a high power PWM CSR system are provided
   to verify the effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{The high penetration level of power electronics interfaced Distributed
   Generation (DG) systems creates great ancillary services potential
   through the DG interfacing converters (IFCs) such as the grid unbalanced
   voltage compensation. However, the unbalanced voltage compensation may
   cause adverse effects on the IFCs' operation such as output active power
   oscillation and DC link voltage variations. Moreover, since the
   compensation is realized through the available rating of IFCs, it is
   equally important to consider the effectiveness of control strategy for
   unbalanced voltage compensation. Considering these challenging issues,
   two grid unbalanced voltage compensation strategies for three-phase
   power electronics interfaced DG system are proposed in this paper.
   Specially, the first control strategy aims at minimizing the IFC's
   active power oscillation and reducing the adverse effects of unbalanced
   voltage compensation on IFC's operation. The second control strategy
   focuses on the effectiveness of unbalanced voltage compensation by
   controlling IFC's negative sequence current to be in-phase with the grid
   negative sequence current. Performances of the two proposed control
   strategies under different grid conditions and IFC operating conditions
   are studied. Finally, validity of proposed strategies is verified by
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of grid-tied distributed generators (DGs) and nonlinear
   loads may generate harmful low order harmonics, polluting the grid and
   deteriorating the operation of other power electronics based loads and
   DGs. In order to improve the output current of the voltage source
   inverter (VSI) in grid-tied DG system, two methods are proposed in this
   paper to compensate the output harmonic under distorted voltage in a
   weak grid. The proposed methods do not rely on the close-loop feedback
   control of harmonic current and therefore are very suitable for VSI with
   low switching frequency, whose close loop control feedback bandwidth may
   be limited for harmonic regulation. The principle and stability analysis
   of the proposed two strategies are presented, and their effectiveness is
   verified by experiment results.}},

Abstract = {{Among high-power pulse-width modulation (PWM) current-source motor
   drives, the transformerless structure using the integrated dc choke has
   been widely acknowledged with superior advantages. A typical challenge
   faced by such transformerless PWM current-source drive systems is the
   potential common-mode resonance excited by the common-mode voltage
   (CMV). Since the implementation of power factor compensation (PFC) at
   low motor speeds may increase the CMV in such drives, the common-mode
   resonance could be serious and further aggravates the CMV stress on the
   system. In this paper, the critical factors on the common-mode resonance
   are thoroughly investigated. Based on the investigation, a solution
   based on average-value-reduction (AVR) space-vector-modulation (SVM) is
   proposed to suppress the common-mode resonance while maintaining the PFC
   function. The investigation of common-mode resonance and the
   effectiveness of the proposed resonance suppression solution are
   verified through experiments on a transformerless PWM current-source
   drive system.}},

Abstract = {{In order to enhance the redundancy and reliability for distributed
   generation, a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) generation system based on
   series-connected module integrated inverters (SC-MIIs) is proposed in
   this paper. In the proposed system, each MII is interfaced with a PV
   panel with independent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to harvest
   maximum solar energy. The outputs of Mils are at AC-line frequency and
   are connected in series to fulfill the voltage requirement by the
   utility grid. Since the high step-up power conversion in the
   conventional micro-inverter is avoided, the SC-MIIs based PV grid-tied
   structure is easier to be implemented and features higher efficiency. A
   distributed control strategy for SC-MIIs is also proposed for this
   system, in which the active power sharing between SC-MIIs is determined
   by the individual maximum power available from PV panels, while the
   reactive power of the system can be regulated through any of the SC-MIIs
   according to the utility grid command. Simulation and experimental
   results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system

   precipitate calcite inside the host media which has tremendous
   applications in reservoir and restoration engineering. As the biofilm
   evolves with time inside the confinement, the dynamics of transport is

Abstract = {{The spinal load sharing and mechanical stresses developed in the spine
   segments due to mechanical loads are dependent on the unique spinal
   anatomy (geometry and posture). Variation in spinal curvature alters the
   load sharing of the lumbar spine as well as the stiffness and stability
   of the passive tissues. In this paper, effects of lumbar spine curvature
   variation on spinal load sharing under compressive Follower Load (FL)
   are investigated numerically. 3D nonlinear Finite Element (FE) models of
   three ligamentous lumbosacral spines are developed based on personalized
   geometries; hypo-lordotic (Hypo-L), normal (Normal-L) and hyper-lordotic
   (Hyper-L) cases. Analysis of each model is performed under Follower Load
   and developed stress in the discs and forces in the collagen fibers are
   investigated. Stresses on the discs vary in magnitude and distribution
   depending on the degree of lordosis. A straight hypo-lordotic spine
   shows stresses more equally distributed among discs while a highly
   curved hyper-lordotic spine has stresses concentrated at lower discs.
   Stresses are unifounly distributed in each disc for Hypo-L case while
   they are concentrated posteriorly for Hyper-L case. Also, the maximum
   force in collagen fibers is developed in the Hyper-L case. These
   differences might be clinically significant related to back pain.}},

Abstract = {{Subspace based methods provide a good compromise between performance and
   complexity. However, these methods are exposed to performance breakdown
   at the low SNR and/or small sample size region. It has been known for a
   long time that a major reason for such performance breakdown is the
   subspace swap phenomenon. However, in some scenarios such as the case of
   closely spaced sources, the breakdown happens before the subspace swap
   occurs. The reason is identified to be the intersubspace leakage where
   some portion of the true signal subspace resides in the estimated noise
   subspace. In this paper, we formally define the notion of subspace
   leakage which can be used as a measure for performance analysis and
   comparison of different methods used for estimating the signal and noise
   subspaces. We further study the statistical properties of the subspace
   leakage for the case of sample data covariance matrix.}},

   Geological uncertainty has a significant impact on the optimal well

   reduce the computational efforts. A reservoir case study demonstrates
   that the selected smaller subset of realizations is a very good

Abstract = {{While most of the available Leak Detection Systems (LDS) can detect
   pipeline leaks, leak localization is still an unresolved problem. The
   main reason for this problem is the limited number of sensors installed
   in long pipelines. Because of lack of measurements, precise leak
   location cannot be easily determined. This study uses particle filter as
   soft-sensor to estimate the states at intermediate locations with the
   available end-point measurements. The residuals between the estimated
   states and the real measurements at the intermediate locations are awn
   used for leak detection and localization. The proposed method can
   improve the leak localization accuracy by proper use of the intermediate
   pressure measurements. Simulation results show the efficacy of the
   proposed method. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation or Automatic

Abstract = {{Uncertainty in data or in the parameters of models occurs in many real
   world applications. Quantifying this uncertainty and its effects is
   required for robust design, control and optimization. In this paper, we
   attempt to build a proxy model for the stochastic solutions of coupled
   governing equations describing coalbed methane (CBM) production at
   different well bottomhole pressures. To achieve this, monthly production
   from wells (output) is expanded as a linear combination of Legendre
   orthogonal polynomials in the input (well bottomhole pressure) and the
   Wiener-Askey polynomial chaos is used to propagate the uncertainty of
   the model parameters. A Gaussian quadrature technique is then employed
   to solve for the coefficients of the basis functions in the proxy model.
   Alternatively, nonlinear least squares curve fitting using the
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is also used with polynomial chaos
   expansion to generate the stochastic proxy model. The proxy model now
   enables robust optimization using statistical metrics of CBM production
   calculated over the entire parameter space. In the case of multiple
   decision variables, the appropriate proxy model built using these
   techniques will allow for robust optimization without the use of any
   search algorithms. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic

Abstract = {{Process models that are affected by uncertainties need a robust
   mechanism to account for them in the model based design of experiments
   (DOE). The aim of this study is to design a set of experiments to
   estimate the parameters of multiscale kinetic models for the catalytic
   decomposition of ammonia. Along with uncertainties in the model, the
   problem is challenging due to constraints on experimental conditions. A
   stochastic D-optimal design is used to find the optimal experimental
   conditions using maximization of the expectation of properties of the
   Fisher information matrix (FIM). The expectation of FIM is calculated by
   sample average approximation (SAA) based on Monte Carlo simulations.
   Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to perform stochastic
   optimization to find the optimal set of experimental conditions. A novel
   method based on the rescaling of velocities is proposed for handling of
   equality and inequality constraints in particle swarm optimization. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper considers the optimal strategies for constrained linear state
   estimation. Prior information for estimating state variables is often
   available in the form of inequality constraints on states. In the latest
   developments of optimal state estimation theory consideration of state
   constraints has been often neglected since constraints do not fit easily
   in the structure of the optimal filter, for example, the issue of state
   constraints being present has to be addressed adequately, for example
   nonnegativity of concentration. In order to address this issue and to
   extend previous developments on the accuracy of state estimation, this
   work develops the constrained optimal state estimation for
   finite-dimensional systems. Finally, a numerical example illustrating
   the proposed method is presented. (C) 2015, IFAC (International

Abstract = {{An alarm Hood is a cones only encountered problem in industrial alarm
   systems. It may distract operators from critical alarms and lead to
   plant failures. Thereby, addressing of alarm floods becomes an important
   task to achieve reliable alarm management. Some sequence alignment
   algorithms have been used to discover useful patterns of alarm floods
   from historical alarm data. In order to improve the computational
   efficiency of the existing algorithms, a Fast sequence alignment
   approach is developed based on a basic local alignment search tool. It
   accelerates the computation using a seed-and-extend strategy. The
   priority information is incorporated so that the algorithm is more
   sensitive to alarms of higher priorities. Besides, the set based
   pre-matching is proposed to avoid unnecessary computation by excluding
   irrelevant alarm floods and alarm tags. Industrial case studies
   demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the
   existing algorithms. (C) 2015, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{Alarm floods have always been serious hazards in industrial process
   monitoring since they overwhelm operators with large amount of alarm
   messages raised within a short period of time. In this paper, we propose

   be easily found. The pattern could reveal the correlation between alarm
   messages in the alarm floods. wlhich cannot be obtained by applying
   other alarm management techniques such as delay timers and dead-bands.
   The pattern could also help find the root cause, locate badly designed
   part in alarm systems, and predict incoming alarm floods. A dataset from
   an actual chemical plant has been used to test the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Distributed control is a computationally efficient and high performance
   approach for plantwide process systems, where the interactions between
   process units can be dealt with using the information exchanged among

   the sampling rate for the local process units. This is motivated by the
   observation that many chemical processes have plant-wide dynamics on a
   time-scale slower than that of the individual processes' dynamics. Based
   on the dissipative systems theory, this approach can be used to
   determine the impact of the reduced communication rate on the stability

Abstract = {{Wind is one of the fastest growing sources of renewable energy. However,
   its intermittency and stochastic nature often hamper integration of
   wind-generated energy in electric power networks. The most significant
   obstacles to efficient wind integration are the wind ramps, sudden
   changes of wind power output caused by dramatic changes in wind speed.
   Most ramp prediction methods derive future ramp estimates from forecast
   power series. This contribution suggests a different approach that would
   directly analyze wind power time series and other weather parameters to
   identify specific patterns and dependencies signaling approaching ramp
   events. In this paper, the 3D tables of ramp events' conditional
   probabilities are evaluated using principal component analysis. Two
   different datasets are analyzed. First one contains power production
   hourly collected from August 2011 to July 2012 on sample wind farm
   located close to Lethbridge, AB Canada. The other consists of total BPA
   wind power production in 2013 with 5 minute resolution. Frequency tables
   for the first three principal components are used to evaluate the
   conditional probability of a forthcoming wind ramp event. Utilization of
   resulting 3D tables for wind ramp event forecast is tested on the last
   quarter of the data. Advantage of proposed methodology compared to
   conventional methods is that numerical weather prediction (NWP) model
   producing wind forecasts is not required.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the performance of a solid-liquid separation process can help
   in comparing different separators for selection and design. This can be
   applied to hydrocyclone technology which is used widely in industry due
   to being an inexpensive device that is easy to operate and maintain and
   which has no moving parts. Environmental concerns and technological
   issues in separation processes are motivating the design of higher
   efficiency systems with less capital and operating costs. There is a
   need therefore for, methods to compare different separation
   technologies.
   In spite of extensive research into hydrocyclone performance, a
   mathematical model that can predict the performance of a hydrocyclone
   for comparison with other centrifugal separators is rare in the
   literature. The main objective of this research is to apply theoretical
   and experimental approaches to study hydrocyclone performance in order
   to propose an applicable separation performance model that represents
   the whole hydrocyclone operating range. A mathematical model is
   developed to explore the performance of the separator and to predict the
   hydrocyclone's equivalent area as compared to a continuous gravity
   settling tank. A performance chart that can be used for selection and
   design of hydrocyclones is the result of the model.}},

   optimal controller is not affected by either of the two parameters.
   Also, under these conditions, the controller parameters are explicitly
   calculated, the closed-loop system is shown to be stable, and the
   controller is dead-beat. The problem considered is related to the
   results on linear quadratic regulation of linear systems with time
   delays; however, the detailed parameterization of the state-space model
   introduced by the FOPTD process provides an additional opportunity to
   investigate the exact controller structure and properties (e.g., the
   locations of the closed-loop poles), which are also the major
   difficulties encountered and overcome in this work. This problem is
   motivated from phenomena experienced in designing industrial model
   predictive control (MPC) tuning algorithms, and extensive numerical
   examples indicate that the proposed results speed up the MPC autotuning
   algorithms by 70\%.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of fuzzy rule-based models we strive to develop models
   that are both accurate and interpretable (transparent). The approach
   proposed here is aimed at the enhancement of transparency of the fuzzy
   model already constructed with the accuracy criterion in mind by
   proposing two modifications to the rules. First, we introduce a
   mechanism of reduction of the input space by eliminating some less
   essential input variables. This results in rules with the reduced
   subspaces of input variables making the rules more transparent. The
   second approach is concerned with an isolation of input variables: fuzzy
   sets defined in the n-dimensional input space and forming the condition
   part of the rules are subject to a decomposition process in which some
   variables are isolated and interpreted separately. The reduced
   dimensionality of the input subspaces in the first approach and the
   number of isolated input variables in the second one are the essential
   parameters controlling impact of enhanced transparency on the accuracy
   of the obtained fuzzy model. The two problems identified above are of
   combinatorial character and the optimization tasks emerging there are
   handled with the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs). A series of numeric
   experiments is reported where we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   two approaches and quantify the relationships between the criterion of
   accuracy and interpretability.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet is perceived as a source of multiple types of information,
   a large shopping mall, a social forum and an entertainment hub. The
   users constantly browse and search the web in order to find things of
   interest. The keyword-based search becomes less and less efficient in
   the case of more refined searches where details of items become
   important. The introduction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) as a
   relation-based format for data representation allows us to propose a
   different way of performing a relevancy-based search. The approach
   proposed is based on representation of items as sets of features. This
   means that evaluation of items' relevance is based a feature-based
   comparison. A more realistic relevancy determination can be been
   achieved via categorization and ranking of features. The calculated
   relevancy measures for individual categories of features are aggregated
   using a fuzzy-based approach.}},

   quasi-linear singular PDEs within the nonlinear hyperbolic PDE setting
   to obtain single step state nonlinear transformation and feedback
   control law with prescribed closed loop dynamics. The solution of quasi
   linear singular PDE is guaranteed by the Lyapunov's auxiliary theorem

   range up to eight times rated speed. The circuit uses an inverter
   connected to a DC supply (the main bridge) and a floating DC link (the
   floating bridge). Applying this circuit the theoretical constant power
   region can be extended to above 11 times the base speed. Finite Element
   Analysis (FEA) is employed to evaluate the machine performance and its
   different parameters with the dual inverter structure. Loss analysis and

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as a new class of renewable
   material for various applications due to their remarkable properties and
   commercialization prospect. The relative low density, expected low cost,
   non-toxic character, uniform nanosize distribution, high aspect ratios,
   high surface area, thermal properties and high modulus of elasticity
   make CNCs attractive nanomaterials that recently prompted the industrial
   production of CNCs in North America. Surface functionalization of CNCs
   continues to be an exciting area of research for the design of novel
   CNC-based materials. In this work, we report the synthesis,
   characterization and cytotoxicity studies of novel cationic surface
   modified CNC derivatives. The negative surface of CNC was rendered
   positive after grafting with cationic polymers via surface-initiated
   living radical polymerization method. The modified CNCs were
   characterized by both spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Their
   cytotoxicity effects were evaluated using MTT assay in two cell lines
   such as mouse macrophages (J774.A1) and human breast cancer (MCF7).
   Preliminary studies indicated that only one of the modified CNCs caused
   significant decrease in J774.A1 cell viability (50\%), at the highest
   concentration tested (100 g/mL). However this concentration is well
   above of what would be applicable for biomedical purposes. MCF7 cells
   were not affected by any of the cationic CNCs at any concentration. A
   detailed cytotoxicity study is currently underway to fully understand
   the interaction of these cationic CNCs with the biological systems for
   possible bio-inspired applications.}},

Abstract = {{A facile electrochemical anodization method was used for producing
   hierarchically textured surfaces based on TiO2 nanotubes in two
   different configurations. It was found that peril uoro-functionalized
   TiO2 nanotubes exhibit high static contact angles for a variety of
   liquids such as apolar, polar aprotic and polar protic solvents. Wenzel
   and Cassie-Baxter theories were applied for theoretical contact angle
   calculations for the present study. By using Cassie theories, it is
   shown that a drop of polar liquid was in a fakir or Cassie-Baxter (CB)
   state on perfluoro-functionalized nanotube surfaces. The fakir state
   prevents spreading of the liquid on the surface. On the other hand, the
   wetting of non-polar liquids such as hexane is characterized by either
   Wenzel states or transition states characterized by partial imbibition
   that lie in between the CB and Wenzel states.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations into direct methane to methanol conversion are justified
   based on the avoidance of synthesis gas generation, which accounts for
   around 60\% of the capital cost of synthesis gas to methanol conversion.
   A significant body of information already exists on the process
   chemistry, but little has been reported on the engineering of such a
   process. An engineering evaluation of the process was performed and the
   potential of this process as a platform technology for small-scale
   gas-to-liquids (GTL) applications was evaluated. It was found that
   direct methane to methanol conversion had 35\% carbon efficiency and
   28\% thermal efficiency, which were about half of the process
   efficiencies of indirect methanol synthesis using synthesis gas. The
   poor process efficiency was mainly a consequence of the irreversible
   loss of carbon to COx during conversion. The direct methane to methanol
   process also required an air separation unit, which eroded the stated
   benefit of avoiding a synthesis gas generation step in the process. The
   utility footprint was typical of GTL processes, with large gas
   compression duties and cooling duties. Overall, the engineering
   evaluation indicated there was no benefit to employ direct methane to
   methanol conversion instead of indirect methanol synthesis (the industry
   standard), and there was no specific benefit of direct methane to
   methanol conversion, irrespective of scale, for GTL applications.}},

Abstract = {{Successful behavioural and communication strategies of biotic
   communities can serve as an inspiration for algorithms used to design,
   manage, and control real-world networks. Many natural systems exhibit
   complex yet efficient behaviours. Some animal communities display
   sophisticated behavioural patterns arising from fairly simple activities
   of their members. The behaviours of ant colonies, swarms of bees,
   schools of fish, and even some human communities, can be seen as
   properties of distributed systems consisting of individual agents
   performing straight-forward actions and communicating using simple
   strategies. Formally, the behaviour of such communities can be modelled
   as a massive yet intuitive multiagent system. The ensuing models can be
   applied to a variety of networking problems. This chapter looks at
   routing in wireless sensor networks and mobile ad-hoc networks as tasks
   that bear similarities to communication in biotic societies and swarms,
   and underlines the role of propagation phenomena in routing. It
   summarizes the basic principles of swarm intelligence and evolutionary
   computing and reviews recent advances in biologically-inspired network
   routing.}},

Title = {{Modeling Passenger Behavior in Nonpayment Areas at Rail Transit Stations}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2534}},
Pages = {{101-108}},
Abstract = {{The nonpayment area at urban transit stations in China usually becomes
   extremely crowded during peak hours because many passengers queue to buy
   tickets and pass through the fare gates. How to evaluate the performance
   of these activities is a critical issue for the design and management of
   the nonpayment area. This study used microscopic simulation models to
   investigate passenger behavior in the nonpayment area. The study
   developed a queue choice model, a passenger movement model, and a path
   navigation model. Some new ideas were involved. First, the study
   introduced the concepts of dynamic queue length and dynamic distance
   between the current passenger and alternative queues into the queue
   choice model. Second, a new factor, called direction of goal, was
   proposed to navigate a passenger through the dynamic end of a queue or
   other goals. This factor was used to construct the transition
   probability function of a cellular automata model. Finally, the proposed
   models were calibrated and verified on the basis of a field survey and
   sensitivity analysis. The results show that the proposed models can
   capture passenger behaviors in the nonpayment area and perform well for
   queue estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Initialization of neuron weights is one of key problems in artificial
   neural networks (ANNs). This problem is particularly important in ANNs
   implemented as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), where
   the number of the weights becomes large. When ANNs are implemented in
   software, the weights can be easily programmed. In contrast, in parallel
   systems of this type realized as ASICs it is necessary to provide
   programming and addressing lines to each weight that causes a large
   increase in the complexity of such designs. In this paper we present
   investigations that demonstrate that Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) in many
   situations may be trained without the initialization (with zeroed
   weights). We present example results of several thousands simulations
   for different topologies of the SOM, for different neighborhood
   functions and two distance measures between the learning patterns and
   particular neurons in the input data space. Simulations were performed
   for zero initial values, for small values (up to 1 \% of full scale
   range) and for neurons randomly distributed over the overall input data
   space. The results are comparable that allows to reduce the complexity
   of the SOM implemented in the CMOS technology.}},

Title = {{Establishing an ISO 10001-based promise in inpatients care}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{100-114}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore ISO 10001: 2007 in
   planning, designing and developing a customer satisfaction promise (CSP)
   intended for inpatients care.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through meetings and interviews with
   research participants, who included a program manager, unit managers and
   registered nurses, information about potential promises and their
   implementation was obtained and analyzed. A number of promises were
   drafted and one was finally selected to be developed as a CSP.
   Findings - Applying the standard required adaptation and novel
   interpretation. Additionally, ISO 10002: 2004 (Clause 7) was used to
   design the feedback handling activities. A promise initially chosen for
   development turned out to be difficult to implement, experience that
   helped in selecting and developing the final promise. Research
   participants found the ISO 10001-based method useful and comprehensible.
   Practical implications - This paper presents a specific health care
   example of how to adapt a standard's guideline in establishing customer
   promises. The authors show how a promise can be used in alleviating an
   existing issue (i.e. communication between carers and patients). The
   learning can be beneficial in various health care settings.
   Originality/value - To the knowledge, this paper shows the first example
   of applying ISO 10001: 2007 in a health care case. A few activities
   suggested by the standard are further detailed, and a new activity is
   introduced. The integrated use of ISO 10001: 2007 and 10002: 2004 is
   presented and how one can be ``augmented{''} by the other is
   demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal deformity is a three-dimensional (3D) spinal disorder with a
   lateral deviation and coupled with axial vertebral rotation (AVR). The
   current clinical practice only measures its severity on postero-anterior
   (PA) radiographs, which may underestimate the deformity. The actual
   severity should be obtained on the plane of maximal curvature (PMC),
   which requires a 3D spinal image. There are many approaches to
   reconstruct 3D spinal images; however, ultrasound is one of the
   promising techniques with its non-ionizing characteristic. This study
   proposed an image processing method using the voxel-based bilinear
   interpolation to reconstruct a 3D spinal image from ultrasound data,
   from which the AVR was measured and the spinal curvature on the PMC was
   determined. In-vitro and in-vivo experiments were performed to determine
   the accuracy of the measurements from the ultrasound method. The results
   showed that the 3D ultrasound spinal image could be reconstructed. The
   curvature angle on the PA and the PMC planes could also be determined.
   The tilt angle of each individual vertebra in in-vitro study showed high
   accuracy and correlation (MAD < 0.9 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees and r(2) >
   0.87) when comparing the measurements from CT with ultrasound. In
   in-vivo study, the curvature angles measured on the PA radiographs and
   ultrasound images yielded a small difference (MAD 3.4 degrees +/- 1.0
   degrees) and a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.63) within a clinical
   accepted error of 5 degrees.}},

   predefined threshold, the segmentation is suspected to be inaccurate. A
   second pass of fine segmentation using k-means algorithm is then carried
   out over these coarsely segmented result to enhance the performance.
   Experimental results on 64 different skin histopathological images show
   that the proposed technique provides a superior performance compared to

Abstract = {{In the diagnosis of skin melanoma by analyzing histopathological images,
   the epidermis and epidermis-dermis junctional areas are regions of
   interest as they provide the most important histologic diagnosis
   features. This paper presents an automated technique for segmenting
   epidermis and dermis regions from whole slide skin histopathological
   images. The proposed technique first performs epidermis segmentation
   using a thresholding and thickness measurement based method. The dermis
   area is then segmented based on a predefined depth of segmentation from
   the epidermis outer boundary. Experimental results on 66 different skin

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present mathematical frameworks for error performance
   analysis in interference limited networks such as cellular networks. Due
   to the increasing irregularity in the spatial deployment of nodes in the
   emerging heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs), we employ stochastic
   geometry approach by abstracting the node locations as a homogeneous
   Poisson point process (PPP). First, we characterize the average error
   probability of an intended communication link with a given
   transmitter-receiver separation, which is subject to interference from
   these Poisson distributed nodes. More specifically, we develop uniform
   approximation (UA), which is highly accurate over the whole range of
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and hence, serve as an alternative to
   existing complex analytical results. Error probability UAs for both
   single-antenna and maximal ratio combining (MRC) receivers are derived
   in this paper. Next, we evaluate the average error probability of any
   typical user in the network, which is served by the node providing the
   maximum received power. Mellin-transform based method is proposed in
   this case, which often yield closed-form solution. An example of BPSK

Abstract = {{Multi-way relaying is a cooperative scheme for communication scenarios
   where several users want to share their data with each other. While the
   capacity of multi-way relay channels (MWRCs) is still unknown to
   completely understand their potentials, the achievable data rates of
   MWRCs have been studied for specific setups. In this work, we aim to get
   a better understanding of the achievable data rates of an
   amplify-and-forward (AF) MWRC. To this end, we first present an
   achievable upper bound for the common data rate of an AF MWRC and
   discuss how users' power allocation affects the common rate. While full
   power transmission at the users assures reaching the maximum achievable
   common rate in one-way relaying, we show that it is not the case for
   MWRCs. Thus, we formulate an optimization problem to find the optimal
   users' power allocation to gain the maximum common rate. Finding an
   optimal solution for this optimization problem is quite complex since
   the number of constraints grows exponentially with the number of users.
   We then focus on a relaxed version of the rate optimization problem and
   propose a suboptimal algorithm to solve it. Our simulation results show
   that the proposed algorithm can achieve rates higher than the ones
   achieved through full power transmission with noticeably lower transmit
   power at the users.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing performance of a cognitive radio (CR) deploying the
   traditional energy detector (ED) degrades in the presence of random
   network interference where both the number and locations of the
   interferers are random, thus preventing correct detection of primary
   user (PU) in the band of interest. However, it is not clear how the ED
   performance in such random network interference can be improved.
   Moreover, the previous studies do not consider complete modeling of the
   wireless environment including the cumulative effects of path-loss,
   fading and random network interference. We thus take these effects into
   account and investigate the performance of the p-norm detector, which
   offers the flexibility of adapting p to the operating conditions (as
   against fixed p = 2 for ED). Such adaptability yields remarkable
   performance gains over ED (say, 15\% gain even at 10 dB lower (than that
   for ED) PU signal powers). Further, cooperative spectrum sensing with
   multiple CRs yields additional performance gains (say, 30\% better
   performance at optimal cooperative detection threshold) compared to
   single CR based sensing even under the cumulative effects of path-loss,
   fading and random network interference.}},

Abstract = {{This paper represents an extension to the kinematic bicycle model for
   beveled-tip needle motion in soft tissue, which accounts for
   non-constant curvature paths for the needle tip. For a tissue that is
   not stiff relative to the needle, the tissue deformation caused by
   needle insertion deviates the needle tip position from a constant
   curvature path. The proposed model is obtained by replacing the bicycle
   wheels with omni-directional wheels that move in two orthogonal
   directions independently. Such wheels can move sideways, providing a
   means for modeling the deviations of the needle tip from a constant
   curvature path by incorporating new parameters in the model. Using an
   experimental setup, the needle is inserted into soft phantom tissue at
   different constant velocities and model parameters are fitted to
   experimental data. The model is verified by comparing the results from
   the model to empirical data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new passivity-based technique is proposed to analyze
   and guarantee the stability of haptics-enabled telerobotic
   rehabilitation systems where there is a possibility of having more
   sources of non-passivity than communication delays. In practice, the
   difficulty of therapeutic exercises should be tuned taking into account
   the stage of physical disability. However, tuning the difficulty and
   intensity should not violate the stability of patient-robot interaction.
   This usually puts conservative prefixed limits on the allowable exercise
   intensity. In this paper, patient-robot interaction safety is studied in
   the context of Strong Passivity Theory (SPT). Our goal is to ultimately
   relax the limitation on the allowable robotic therapies while preserving
   system stability. The proposed stabilizing scheme does not try to make
   the entire non-passive component passive. This allows the therapist to
   have freedom in injecting energy into the system for assistive therapies
   while ensuring safe patient-robot interaction. In this paper, the case
   of telerobotic rehabilitation is considered. Experimental implementation
   and evaluation are presented to support the proposed theory.}},

Abstract = {{Off-chip antenna excitation through magnetic inductive coupling at 60GHz
   has been proposed to facilitate the industrial RFIC measurement or the
   antenna connection to the RFIC chip. To verify the concept, a slot
   antenna at top layer of the PCB was excited through magnetic coupling
   from the RFIC chip set at the proximity of the antenna. Minimum return
   loss of -17dB, gain of 6dBi, and bandwidth of 7GHz at 60GHz achieved
   through simulation to serve all the applications at unsilenced 60GHz
   frequency. The case can be extended to multi-port or MIMO RFIC chips by
   using antennas with orthogonal polarization.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a design of a compact multi-band antenna with
   reconfigurability is presented. The design is based on incorporating two
   split-ring resonators to an F-shaped monopole antenna. Electronic
   switches are mounted across these resonators to serve in activating or
   deactivating their resonance frequency, thus leading to
   reconfigurability. The antenna is microstrip line-fed, and is on a 40 mm
   x 35 mm FR4-epoxy substrate over a partial ground plane. Ansys HFSS is
   used to design and simulate the proposed antenna. A prototype is
   fabricated and experimentally tested, where a credible agreement between
   simulated and measured results is observed. The final configuration is
   compact, low-cost, easy-to-fabricate and is suitable for many wireless
   applications.}},
