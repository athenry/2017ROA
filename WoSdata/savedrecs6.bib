Abstract = {{Having accurate knowledge of the positions of people around a robot
   provides rich, objective and quantitative data that can be highly useful
   for a wide range of tasks, including autonomous person following. The
   primary objective of this research is to promote the development of
   robust, repeatable and transferable software for robots that can
   automatically detect, track and follow people in their environment. The
   work is strongly motivated by the need for such functionality onboard an
   intelligent power wheelchair robot designed to assist people with
   mobility impairments. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for
   robust detection, tracking and following from laser data. We show that
   the approach is effective in various environments, both indoor and
   outdoor, and on different robot platforms (the intelligent power
   wheelchair and a Clearpath Husky). The method has been implemented in
   the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework and will be publicly released
   as a ROS package. We also describe and will release several datasets
   designed to promote the standardized evaluation of similar algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A tissue-independent model to estimate needle deflection during
   insertion in soft tissue is presented in this paper. A force/torque
   sensor is connected to the needle base in order to measure forces and
   moments during insertion due to needle deflection. A static mechanical
   model, which is based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation and the
   balance of forces applied by the tissue onto the needle takes these
   force and moment measurements as input. The needle tip deflection can
   then be calculated based on the beam model undergoing these forces.
   Three different needle-tissue interaction models are presented. Their
   estimation performance is evaluated and experimentally compared by
   carrying out insertion experiments into phantom tissue. The experimental
   results show a precise estimate of needle tip deflection for a novel
   virtual sensor introduced in this work. The main advantage of this
   virtual sensor approach is that measurements obtained from the
   force/torque sensor are the only necessary model inputs. Furthermore,
   the approach does not rely on ultrasound or other image-based needle
   observation techniques. This makes the virtual sensor suitable for
   real-time feedback of needle tip deflection.}},

Abstract = {{In needle-based medical procedures, beveled-tip flexible needles are
   steered inside soft tissue with the aim of reaching pre-defined target
   locations. The efficiency of needle-based interventions depends on
   accurate control of the needle tip. This paper presents a comprehensive
   mechanics-based model for simulation of planar needle insertion in soft
   tissue. The proposed model for needle deflection is based on beam
   theory, works in real-time, and accepts the insertion velocity as an
   input that can later be used as a control command for needle steering.
   The model takes into account the effects of tissue deformation,
   needle-tissue friction, tissue cutting force, and needle bevel angle on
   needle deflection. Using a robot that inserts a flexible needle into a
   phantom tissue, various experiments are conducted to separately identify
   different subsets of the model parameters. The validity of the proposed
   model is verified by comparing the simulation results to the empirical
   data. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in
   predicting the needle tip deflection for different insertion velocities.}},

   observation in ultrasound images is used as the input to a needle-tissue
   interaction model that predicts the entire needle shape. The needle
   shape predicted by the model is compared to the segmented needle shape
   based on camera images to validate the proposed approach. The results

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an automatic method to visualize 3D needle shapes
   for reliable assessment of needle placement during needle insertion
   procedures. Based on partial observations of the needle within a small
   sample of 2D transverse ultrasound images, the 3D shape of the entire
   needle is reconstructed. An intensity thresholding technique is used to
   identify points representing possible needle locations within each 2D
   ultrasound image. Then, a Random Sample and Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm
   is used to filter out false positives and fit the remaining points to a
   polynomial model. To test this method, a set of 21 transverse ultrasound
   images of a brachytherapy needle embedded within a transparent tissue
   phantom are obtained and used to reconstruct the needle shape. Results
   are validated using camera images which capture the true needle shape.
   For this experimental data, obtaining at least three images from an
   insertion depth of 50 mm or greater allows the entire needle shape to be
   calculated with an average error of 0.5 mm with respect to the measured
   needle curve obtained from the camera image. Future work and application
   to robotics is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{With a proper energy management strategy (EMS), supercapacitor can be
   integrated into autonomous DC microgrid as an independent energy storage
   unit. The resulting microgrid could supply repeatedly quick bursts of
   electrical power without compromising power quality and lifetime of
   other distributed generations (DGs) or distributed energy storages. In
   this paper, a novel control strategy for supercapacitor is proposed. The
   method uses the virtual impedance loop to add a virtual resistor and a
   virtual capacitor connected in series between the converter and DC bus,
   which decouples power flow between supercapacitor and other DGs while
   ensuring the plug'n'play feature of supercapacitor (SC). The results
   show that the proposed EMS has a competing dynamic performance with
   excellent flexibility as compared to previous methods.}},

Abstract = {{A method for reducing the capacitor size used in single phase floating
   capacitor voltage source converter modules is presented. A Transformer
   Coupled Asymmetrical half-Bridge (TCAB) is used to exchange energy
   between the capacitor regulated dc sources of the main power converter
   modules, without using separate power sources. This energy exchange
   (bidirectional) compensates for naturally occurring low frequency
   voltage ripple in the floating capacitor main power converters. This
   enables smaller film dc capacitors to be used. The latter can be used to
   reduce the overall system size/cost with a longer system working
   lifetime. The ripple voltage reduction and voltage balancing features
   provided is not intended to be specific to a particular modular power
   converter system, MMC systems are an example, but are illustrated here
   using utility connected single phase floating converters. The switching
   control methods described avoid the use of extra filter components and
   to maximize the average current used to transfer energy between the
   modules. Simulations and experimental results are presented to validate
   the operation and performance of the proposed system with the emphasis
   placed on the voltage ripple reduction feature.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESPs) are commonly used in deep wells in
   oil and gas industry. In order to monitor ESP systems operating
   conditions, downhole monitoring tools are used to transmit data
   representing physical conditions of downhole such as temperature,
   pressure, and vibration to the surface. The most common downhole
   communication method implemented in the field is to use a DC signal over
   three phases of the main power cable and uses the ground as a return
   path. However, this method cannot operate in the event of a
   single-phase-to-ground fault, because the signal path would be shorted
   although the electrical submersible pump is still in operation due to
   the ungrounding practice in downhole ESP systems. Experience has also
   shown that this existing method is prone to failure in presence of
   unbalance conditions in the system. In this paper, a new phase-to-phase
   communication scheme for the downhole monitoring tool design is proposed
   where intentional disturbances in the power supply to the motor are used
   as means of binary communication. The proposed scheme is immune to
   single-phase-to-ground faults and unbalance conditions. Theoretical
   formulas defining this method are developed and the performance of the
   method is evaluated using simulation through case and sensitivity
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{A Minimal Path (MP) vector for a system state d is called a d-MP. Most
   reported works on generating d-MPs are for a particular d value. If all
   d-MPs for all possible integer d values are required, we need to call
   those methods multiple times with respect to all d values. Virtually,
   each d-MP candidate can be generated by a combination of one (d-1)-MP
   and one binary minimal path vector. Thus, we can use binary MP vectors
   as building blocks to generate 2-MP candidates, and use 2-MPs and binary
   MPs as building blocks to generate 3-MP candidates ... and so forth.
   During the process, each newly generated candidate will be validated by
   certain constraints and real d-MPs are obtained. When the d-MPs with the
   maximum d value have been found, all the d-MPs for all possible integer
   d value are found as well. Based on the observations above, we report a
   recursive algorithm based on the concept of backtracking. By
   computational experiments, it is found that the proposed algorithm is
   more efficient than existing algorithms for finding all d-MPs for all
   possible integer d values. The generated d-MPs can be used for system
   state distribution evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The assumption of stochastic independence between components is
   frequently made in studies of system reliability. However, in a specific
   system, the failure of a component can trigger the failure of other
   components, or the current health condition of a component may affect
   the performance of other components. Thus, the state of a component can
   affect the state and degradation of other components in a multicomponent
   system, that is, stochastic dependence (s-dependence) may exist in real
   and complex systems. In this paper, reliability analysis of multi-state
   systems (MSS) with sdependent components will be considered. The MSS
   consists of 2 multi-state components in series, with each component
   possibly operating at different performance levels, varying from perfect
   functioning to complete failure. When the first component degrades to a
   lower performance level, it affects the state as well as the degradation
   of the other component in the system. A combined technique of stochastic
   process and modified universal generating function is used to evaluate
   the system reliability. The combined approach is then verified using the
   Monte Carlo Simulation method. An illustrative example on reliability
   analysis of MSS with dependent components is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{The attitude control system (ACS) is crucial for the satellite operation
   in the space, and it is a typical phased-mission system (PMS). Some
   features caused by the system designs bring difficulties in the ACS
   mission risk analysis, and the traditional risk analysis method
   probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) must be modified to model and
   analyze the redundant and dynamic features in the system. This paper
   proposes an improved method for mission risk analysis based on the
   traditional PRA framework, and combines the dynamic fault tree (DFT) and
   Bayesian networks (BN) methods with the traditional framework to solve
   the redundancy features, operation sequence dependencies, and relevant
   failure properties of some components in the ACS. This method can give a
   more accurate description of the ACS mission, and the analysis results
   show that this proposed method can provide more useful information for
   system design improvements.}},

   constructed in a way that the objective function is concerned with only
   the low-order modes, while the state constraints involve both the

   using a refined Euler model formulated via tractable linear matrix
   inequalities (LMIs). This scheme is shown to be input-to-state stable
   from exogenous disturbances to the estimation error in a semiglobal
   practical sense for the unknown exact discrete-time plant model. Then,
   the proposed observer is modified appropriately to cope with the
   practical case of multirate sampling by preserving similar stability
   property. A simulation example justifies the efficiency of both
   observers for the one-sided Lipschitz systems and demonstrates the
   superiority of the multirate observer when the input and output signals

Abstract = {{In operational control of most industrial systems, two layers, the
   control layer and the operational layer, exist, and are communicated via
   networks. Network induced time delays have negative impact on
   operational control performance. For a class of industrial processes,
   this paper proposes a method of setpoint dynamic compensation based on
   output feedback control with network induced stochastic delays. Firstly,
   given a process, a multi-input multi-output PID controller with an
   adjustable response speed is designed to stabilize the plant without any
   steady-state error for setpoint tracking. Secondly, a network stochastic
   time-delay model is established by analyzing the characteristics of data
   transmission in the Ethernet, and is used in designing an operational
   layer controller based on output feedback. In particular, a condition to
   guarantee asymptotic stability of the whole closed-loop system is given.
   Finally, a simulation experiment in an industrial flotation process is
   employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

   the proposed design, a local estimator is designed for each subsystem
   and the distributed estimators communicate to collaborate. Within each
   local estimator, an open-loop predictor is embedded. A two-step
   prediction-update strategy is used in the predictor design in order to
   handle delays and data losses simultaneously. Based on the predictions
   provided by the predictor, an auxiliary nonlinear observer is taken
   advantage of to calculate a reference subsystem state estimate based
   upon which a confidence region of the state of the subsystem is
   generated. Within the confidence region, the local estimator optimizes
   its subsystem state estimate. Sufficient conditions under which the
   proposed design gives decreasing and ultimately bounded estimation error

Abstract = {{With an increasing popularity of real-time applications, such as live
   chat and gaming, latency prediction between personal devices including
   mobile devices becomes an important problem. Traditional approaches
   recover all-pair latencies in a network from sampled measurements using
   either Euclidean embedding or matrix factorization. However, these
   approaches targeting static or mean network latency prediction are
   insufficient to predict personal device latencies, due to unstable and
   timevarying network conditions, triangle inequality violation and
   unknown rank of latency matrices. In this paper, by analyzing latency
   measurements from the Seattle platform, we propose new methods for both
   static latency estimation as well as the dynamic estimation problem
   given 3D latency matrices sampled over time. We propose a
   distance-feature decomposition algorithm that can decompose latency
   matrices into a distance component and a network feature component, and
   further leverage the structured pattern inherent in the 3D sampled data
   to increase estimation accuracy. Extensive evaluations driven by
   real-world traces show that our proposed approaches significantly
   outperform various state-of-the-art latency prediction techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The downhole monitoring tool is a critical component in electrical
   submersible pump (ESP) wells to monitor downhole parameters such as the
   pump intake pressure, the temperature of motor winding and oil
   reservoir, the motor vibration etc. to ensure proper ESP system
   operation and to optimize production. In this paper, a downhole
   monitoring tool design method is proposed using power line disturbances.
   This method is based on the technology of two-way automatic
   communication system (TWACS). The AC current signal is used for the
   downhole tool. This new design scheme utilizes an external impedance
   connecting one phase of the ESP system to the ground on the wellhead,
   and a controlled thyrsitor connected between the neutral of the ESP
   motor and the ground by conducting at a specific firing angle and
   cycles. This design can overcome the impact of single-Iine-to-ground
   faults of the ESP system on the communication of downhole tools. The
   design method is verified through the simulation using PSCAD by case and
   sensitivity studies. The lab testing is conducted to further validate
   the effectiveness of the proposed design method.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of solar energy availability is an important part of a number
   of applications, from weather and climate modeling, to forecasting power
   output of photovoltaic cells. This work proposes and evaluates the use
   of evolutionary fuzzy rules, discovered by genetic programming, for
   accurate and inexpensive forecasting of next day available solar energy,
   based solely on atmospheric pressure. The use of only one meteorological
   variable simplifies the collection, storage and prediction tasks, making
   this approach suitable for a number of hardware-limited applications.
   The proposed forecasting system uses a time series of pressure values
   for the hours leading up to the sunrise of the day for which predictions
   are made. The pressure values and their differences are submitted to the
   evolutionary optimizer that combines these values into simple fuzzy
   rules. The resulting rule set provides predictions that are a
   substantial improvement over simple analytical estimates. The results of
   pressure-based forecasters also compare favorably with other simple
   estimation systems presented in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the multiple attribute group decision
   making (MAGDM) problems based on grey system theory and utility theory
   to accommodate situations where attribute values take the form of
   interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). Motivated by the idea of grey
   incidence analysis theory, we propose two new grey incidence degrees for
   aggregating the uncertain information and further extend the concept to
   accommodate interval type-2 fuzzy environment. Meanwhile, based on the
   flexible three parameter (FTP) utility function, we develop an interval
   type-2 fuzzy ranking weighted utility averaging (IT2FRWUA) operator,
   some desirable mathematical properties are discussed in detail. Then, we
   further integrate the proposed grey incidence degrees and the IT2FRWUA
   operator to develop two methods for handling MAGDM problems within the
   context of IT2FSs. Finally, some practical examples are provided to
   illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

   is reported. The proposed sensor is based on a passive ring resonator
   with an active feedback loop to generate negative resistance and

   increases the quality factor of the system. High quality factor offers
   high-resolution readout with large field penetration depth and thus
   enables distant, non-contact sensing of liquid materials in a career
   tube. The active loop technique increases the quality factor of the
   resonator from 240 to 200000 in air. It also provides flexibility of
   adjusting the quality factor by varying DC voltage. To our knowledge,
   this is the first time that a non-contact liquid measurement technique

Abstract = {{In practical multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, the channel
   matrices often have reduced rank especially for propagation environments
   with limited scattering. For this scenario, reliable detection of the
   channel rank is essential in achieving the high performance provided by
   the MIMO configuration. In traditional rank detection schemes, a single
   threshold is used and the channel rank is detected as the number of
   singular values of the observation matrix that are larger than the
   threshold. In this work, we propose a multiple-threshold-based rank
   detection scheme, where each threshold corresponds to one possible rank
   value. The thresholds are optimized based on the derived lower bounds on
   the rank detection probability for different channel rank values.
   Simulation results show that the proposed detection scheme outperforms
   existing schemes in the probability of correct rank detection.}},

Abstract = {{The compact arithmetic units in stochastic computing can potentially
   lower the implementation cost with respect to silicon area and power
   consumption. In addition, stochastic computing provides inherent
   tolerance of transient errors at the cost of a less efficient signal
   encoding. In this paper, a novel FIR filter design using the stochastic
   approach based on multiplexers are proposed. The required stochastic
   sequence length is determined for different signal resolutions by
   matching the performance of the proposed FIR filter with that of the
   conventional binary design. Silicon area, power and maximum clock
   frequency are obtained to evaluate the throughput per area (TPA) and the
   energy per operation (EPO). For equivalent filtering performance, the
   stochastic FIR filter underperforms in terms of TPA and EPO compared to
   the conventional binary design, albeit with some advantages in circuit
   area and power consumption. The stochastic design, however, shows a
   graceful degradation in performance with a significant reduction in
   energy consumption as the stochastic sequences are shortened. The
   fault-tolerance of the stochastic circuit is compared with that of the
   binary circuit equipped with triple modular redundancy. It is shown that
   the stochastic circuit is more reliable than the conventional binary
   design and its triple modular redundancy (TMR) implementation with
   unreliable voters, but it is less reliable than the binary TMR
   implementation when the voters are fault-free.}},

Abstract = {{After incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), training of walking function
   that emphasizes both endurance and speed may produce different changes
   in spared neural pathways compared to precision training that emphasizes
   walking over obstacles and precise placement of the foot. To examine
   this, 16 participants with iSCI received 2 months of endurance or
   precision training, in random order, with 2 months of rest before
   crossing-over to the other type of training. Both forms of training
   increased the maximum motor-evoked potential (MEPmax) elicited by
   transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, but only in
   tibialis anterior (TA) muscles that had small (<0.5 mV) MEPmax values
   before training, no matter when the specific type of training was
   performed. A similar pattern of training-induced increases in maximum
   voluntary contractions was also observed. Although walking function was
   improved by both forms of training, a positive correlation between
   MEPmax and clinical measures of walking function only occurred after
   endurance training. Endurance and precision training also increased the
   excitability of inhibitory spinal networks, as demonstrated by an
   increase in the suppression of TA MEPs by a prior, low-threshold
   stimulation to the common peroneal nerve and by increases in the
   inhibitory component of the cutaneomuscular reflex. The increase in the
   descending excitation of the spinal cord and the increase in
   excitability of inhibitory spinal networks may mediate the improved
   volitional control of walking and reduction of involuntary muscle
   spasticity, respectively, that are observed in response to intensive
   motor training in participants with incomplete spinal cord injury.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a point-of-care biosensor design. The
   uniqueness of our design is in its capability for detecting a wide
   variety of target biomolecules and the simplicity of nanoparticle
   enhanced electrical detection. The electrical properties of
   interdigitated electrodes and the mechanism for gold
   nanoparticle-enhanced impedance-based biosensor systems based on these
   electrodes were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics software.
   Understanding these properties and how they can be affected by the
   design of the sensor, environment during detection, and target
   biomolecules is vital in designing effective biosensor devices.
   Simulations were used to show electrical screening for interdigitated
   electrodes in a salt solution as well as the electric field between
   individual digits of electrodes. Using these simulations, it was
   observed that gold nanoparticles bound closely to interdigitated
   electrodes can lower the electric field magnitude between the digits of
   the electrode.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an electrical interface design for a vibration-based
   energy harvester which is aimed for low power electronics applications.
   The electrical interface circuits consist of two distinct components: a
   voltage doubler and a voltage booster circuits. The voltage doubler and
   voltage booster circuits were simulated in the LTSpice IV simulator to
   determine the output response when the magnitude of the input voltage or
   the oscillating frequency was changed. The sensitivity study carried out
   in simulation was later validated through experimental studies. An AC
   power supply and a resistive loading R were used to simulate the energy
   harvester and the battery management circuit, respectively. In this
   study, the maximum efficiency for the combined voltage doubler and
   booster circuits was found to be approximately 40\% for an input voltage
   of 4 Vp-p, input frequency of 100 Hz at 50 k Omega loading. The overall
   efficiency was found to decrease with increasing of loading resistance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a system topology for potential use as a Wireless
   Networked Control System (WNCS). The topology has a plant to be
   regulated, a dedicated controller that makes control decisions, and an
   intermediate network of nodes. The network assists the controller in
   stabilizing the closed-loop system and provides the means for connecting
   the sensors and actuators of the plant and the inputs and outputs of the
   controller. Further, the paper presents a framework for modelling the
   closed-loop system such that controller and network systems can be
   designed. The paper also provides an LMI-based algorithm for computing
   optimal controller and network systems that achieve a stable closed-loop
   system while meeting performance measures. The deigned systems have a
   fixed structure and hence the associated design complexity is reduced.
   Finally, the paper also illustrates with examples the effectiveness of
   the proposed design and computational procedures.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of dimensional accuracy and material properties of the
   MakerBot 3D desktop printer}},
Journal = {{RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{618-627}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to evaluate the material properties and
   dimensional accuracy of a MakerBot Replicator 2 desktop 3D printer.
   Design/methodology/approach - A design of experiments (DOE) test
   protocol was applied to determine the effect of the following variables
   on the material properties of 3D printed part: layer height, per cent
   infill and print orientation using a MakerBot Replicator 2 printer.
   Classical laminate plate theory was used to compare results from the DOE
   experiments with theoretically predicted elastic moduli for the tensile
   samples. Dimensional accuracy of test samples was also investigated.
   Findings - DOE results suggest that per cent infill has a significant
   effect on the longitudinal elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the
   test specimens, whereas print orientation and layer thickness fail to
   achieve significance. Dimensional analysis of test specimens shows that
   the test specimen varied significantly (p < 0.05) from the nominal print
   dimensions.
   Practical implications - Although desktop 3D printers are an attractive
   manufacturing option to quickly produce functional components, this
   study suggests that users must be aware of this manufacturing process'
   inherent limitations, especially for components requiring high geometric
   tolerance or specific material properties. Therefore, higher quality 3D
   printers and more detailed investigation into the MakerBot MakerWare
   printing settings are recommended if consistent material properties or
   geometries are required.
   Originality/value - Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a rapidly
   expanding manufacturing method. Initially, 3D printing was used for
   prototyping, but now this method is being used to create functional
   final products. In recent years, desktop 3D printers have become
   commercially available to academics and hobbyists as a means of rapid
   component manufacturing. Although these desktop printers are able to
   facilitate reduced manufacturing times, material costs and labor costs,
   relatively little literature exists to quantify the physical properties
   of the printed material as well as the dimensional consistency of the
   printing processes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel power quality enhancement strategy for

   three DG unit control schemes based on proportion integration resonance

   objectives. Frequency analysis and performance evaluation show the
   flexible and seamless transition of these control schemes. The proposed

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel topology optimization (TO) method which
   relies on design history retrieval and surrogate modeling. With this
   method, a new design case starts by retrieving the design history to
   find similar cases in both design domain geometry and boundary condition
   (BC), for which an innovative BC similarity evaluation has been
   developed. For the best-match history case, feature based topological
   design was available in database and is predictably similar to that of
   the new design case. Therefore, it can be used as the feature model
   input of the new design case, and the TO problem is simplified into a
   sizing optimization problem to find the optimal feature parameter set.
   Surrogate model based method has been employed to solve the sizing
   optimization problem. Overall, this new TO method characterizes as:
   first, the efficiency is much higher than the conventional TO methods;
   second, it obtains feature-based topological design without

   Data Analysis}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2513}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Abstract = {{The analysis of before after speed data to evaluate the effectiveness of
   safety interventions is often limited to a non-model-based comparison of
   speed-related indicators. Moreover, modeling of speed data often does
   not take into account the nested nature of the data. The objective of
   the study was to quantify the effect of posted speed limit (PSL)
   reductions in an urban, residential context. The study employed a
   mixed-effect intervention model, which could address limitations of
   existing methods. To model mean free-flow speed and the probability of a
   speed being below or equal to various thresholds, mixed-effect normal
   regression and binomial logistic regression models were used. Use of a
   comprehensive, unique, and disaggregated data set enabled not only the
   before after evaluation of the PSL reduction but also the exploration of
   the effects of various temporal, traffic, and road geometry factors on
   speed. Results demonstrated the appropriateness of using the
   mixed-effect model for speed data. Parameter estimations showed that
   nighttimes; weekends; a high proportion of vans, buses, and trucks;
   evening peak periods; collector roads; and low hourly traffic volumes
   were all associated with an increase in the mean free-flow speed and a
   decrease in the probability of speeds being below or equal to various
   thresholds. Evaluation results showed the mean free-flow speed was
   reduced by 3.85 km/h in the after period and that speeds below or equal
   to 50, 60, 70, and 80 km/h increased by 20.0\%, 9.2\%, 2.8\%, and 0.9\%,
   respectively. All improvements were statistically significant; this
   finding implied that the PSL reduction was effective at influencing
   vehicle speed.}},

Title = {{Before-and-After Empirical Bayes Evaluation of Automated Mobile Speed
   Enforcement on Urban Arterial Roads}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2516}},
Pages = {{44-52}},
Abstract = {{Speeding is a leading factor in road collisions and is found to
   contribute to approximately one-third of all fatal collisions. Speed
   enforcement is one of the most common countermeasures used to reduce
   speed. However, a gap exists in the literature regarding the
   effectiveness of automated mobile photo enforcement on urban arterial
   roads. This study addresses this gap using the before-and-after
   empirical Bayes method to account for regression to the mean effects and
   other confounding factors. Locally developed safety performance
   functions and yearly calibration factors for different collision
   severities were obtained by using a reference group of urban arterial
   roads. The evaluation period covers 8 years. Collision records,
   deployment information, traffic counts, and road geometric data were
   collected. The results showed consistent reductions in different
   collision severities; the reductions ranged from 14\% to 20\%, with the
   highest reductions observed for severe collisions. The enforced segments
   were further categorized according to site selection criteria and
   deployment hours to examine the effect of enforcement on collision
   reduction. More reductions were found at segments that had more
   collisions during the before period and longer deployment hours. The
   study also compared the safety effects of continuous and discontinuous
   enforcement strategies on different arterials, and the analysis revealed
   that continuous enforcement achieved more reductions across all
   severities and types of collisions. The study also investigated the
   spillover effects on adjacent unenforced approaches. Significant
   reductions were found, and these results are discussed with regard to
   the general and specific deterrence of the enforcement.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of component and temperature on mechanical and thermodynamic
   properties of (Nb1-xTix)C complex carbides were studied. The results
   show that it is easier to mix a small amount of NbC with TiC to form
   Ti-rich complex carbides than mixing small amounts of TiC with NbC to
   form Nb-rich complex carbides. Elastic modulus, hardness, ductility and
   fracture toughness of the complex carbide can be optimized by
   controlling the fractions of Nb and Ti in the complex carbide. The
   electronic property analysis on the complex carbides reveals that strong
   metal-metal and metal-carbon interactions exist in NbC, while strong
   metal-carbon interactions but weaker metal-metal interactions in TiC.
   The metal-metal interactions in the complex carbides attenuated when Nb
   is replaced by Ti. The bulk modulus and linear thermal expansion
   coefficient of the complex carbides demonstrate that a small amount of
   Ti atoms in the complex carbides may effectively alleviate the loss of
   the bulk modulus at elevated temperatures.}},

Title = {{Multivariate Full Bayesian Hot Spot Identification and Ranking: New
   Technique}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2515}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{The present study introduces a new technique for multivariate
   identification and ranking of hot spots based on the Mahalanobis
   distance. This approach aims to extend the univariate potential for
   safety improvement to cases in which multiple response variables are
   modeled jointly. Because the literature shows that ranking techniques
   based on Bayesian methods are superior to those that rely simply on the
   observed collision count, the proposed method was developed in a full
   Bayesian (FB) context. The new technique involves the following steps:
   (a) applying multivariate Poisson-lognormal regression models to the
   data by means of the FB method, (b) using the estimates of the Poisson
   posterior means for each site to compute the multivariate (Mahalanobis)
   distance from what is the normal Poisson mean for similar sites, and (c)
   preparing an ordered list of potentially hazardous sites. This method
   was applied to a sample of 173 signalized intersections in the city of
   Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for the years 2008 to 2012. The
   study also examines the consistency of the technique itself by analyzing
   the mathematical intersection of ranked sites identified in subsequent
   time periods. Finally, the consistency of the multivariate FB ranking
   was assessed against the independent (separate) univariate one that is
   still dominant in road safety evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring systems are useful for the study of various
   natural phenomena. They are often deployed in remote locations, making
   their reliability and energy independence important. This leads to the
   use of energy harvesting technologies that allow the sensor platforms to
   operate either independently or for extended periods of time. However,
   it is also important to maintain quality of the collected data, namely
   its temporal resolution for a given purpose. To balance the trade-off
   between these two aspects, an energy management scheme is required. The
   performance of such schemes strongly depends on the accuracy of the
   energy forecast, often used as one of their inputs. In this
   contribution, several methods of varying complexity are used to predict
   the total amount of daily solar energy available for harvest in the near
   future. All proposed methods are based solely on atmospheric surface
   pressure, with the aim of keeping the prediction algorithm as simple as

Abstract = {{Environmental monitoring systems often operate in remote locations and
   thus must be designed for energy-efficiency and reliability. As the main
   tasks of such systems are sensing, logging and delivering environmental
   measurements, the frequency with which are these operations executed
   significantly affects the overall energy consumption of the monitoring
   devices. This work presents the results of statistical analysis of
   environmental measurements (air temperature, air humidity, soil moisture
   and photosynthetically active radiation), and evaluates how the
   frequency of their collection affects the accuracy of collected samples.
   In particular, two independent approaches are discussed. The first
   approach is based on the concept of stationarity for evaluating time
   series models, while the second seeks to determine the probability
   density function through the combination of descriptive statistics with
   ANOVA parametric analysis. The results of these analyses show that
   different environmental variables should be sampled with different
   frequencies. Implementation of this principle will decrease energy
   requirements of the environmental monitoring devices, and allow their
   energy-efficient design and long-term uninterrupted operation under
   demanding field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Focusing on the mechanical engineering undergraduate program at the

   evaluation of teaching (SET) results that could be attributed to SET

   compiled for five academic years of paper based SET evaluation and one
   semester of online SET evaluation. 20 core undergraduate courses were
   included; class size from 70-130; 35 professors. Statistical analysis
   included compilation of frequency histograms, determination of means and
   standard deviations, and rank-sum tests for significant differences
   based on aggregated data for several stratifications. Results showed
   significantly reduced response rate for online SET when compared to
   paper; ratings of professor evaluation were not different. No
   significant differences were found when results were compared on the
   basis of course content or delivery mode. Our aggregated data showed SET
   protocol lead to lower response rate, but not significant differences in
   instructor evaluation. Course content and delivery mode did not manifest
   in significant changes in SET results. Typical variability in instructor
   rating was 0.4/5.0 considering all data. Administrators and senior
   faculty should be aware of these results when ascertaining instructor
   performance. Although focused on one department, the study is a first
   step in a larger evaluation of SET in engineering. The study identified
   key variables that must be further evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) promise many
   advantages over traditional piezoelectric transducers. One such
   advantage is the potential to construct large, cost-effective 2D arrays.
   However, due to wiring constraints, fully wired 2D arrays are
   impractical. An alternative approach, Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom Electrode
   (TOBE) CMUT arrays, consist of only 2N wires for an array size of NxN.
   However, due to the size of the arrays and the many parameters
   influencing array performance, optimally designing a TOBE array is a
   significant challenge. In this paper we present large-scale TOBE CMUT
   simulations based on a nonlinear CMUT lumped-model. We analyze the
   different parasitic effects which limit dominant element isolation.
   These simulated result are then compared with measurements of TOBE
   arrays fabricated using a sacrificial release process.}},

Abstract = {{Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) have admirable
   performance that make them suitable for use in ultrasound imaging and
   therapeutic applications. Maximizing acoustic power output from CMUTs is
   of major importance to ensure competitive signal-to-noise ratio. In this
   paper, ADS validated models were used to predict device performance
   before and after using impedance matching networks. Electrical impedance
   matching of the large signal models of the CMUT cells were studied in
   detail. Membrane velocity and acoustic pressure of a single 3MHz CMUT
   cell, a 2 by 10 linear CMUT array and 6 by 6 CMUT square array were
   measured and compared with and without matching networks. For a given
   bias voltage, we found the maximum possible AC drive-level we could
   apply without collapsing the membrane, then found the mean membrane
   velocity at this signal drive-level in the cases where a matching
   network was present or absent. The results show remarkable improvements
   in output acoustic pressure which can be useful for some imaging and
   especially ultrasound therapeutic applications. The scattering
   parameters of a 5 by 100 linear CMUT array were measured using a vector
   network analyzer. Different kinds of impedance matching networks were
   designed to transfer more power to the arrays. Experiments show
   admirable improvements and have a good agreement with simulation

Abstract = {{Recently closely packed interlaced capacitive micromachined ultrasonic
   transducers (CMUTs) with different membrane sizes, on a scale smaller

   introduced for multi-band operation, imaging-therapy, contrast and
   photoacoustic imaging. An accurate model including the effects of the
   self and mutual acoustic interactions between CMUT cells for simulating
   the multi-frequency arrays is necessary. However, the previous works
   evaluated the effects of the mutual radiation impedance on CMUT arrays
   with the same membrane sizes. Using the Bouwkamp integral method for
   integrating the farfield directionality factor of two flexural disks
   with different sizes, vibrating in phase, series expressions have been
   obtained for the mutual radiation impedance between two circular
   radiators of different radii in a rigid plane. Models for the mutual
   acoustic impedance between membranes of different sizes were validated
   against previous piston results but extended to flexural disks. The
   obtained expressions were implemented in an equivalent circuit model of
   multi-frequency CMUTs. Model predictions of resonance frequencies and
   displacements closely matched experimental vibrometer measurements of
   multi-frequency CMUT arrays that were done for low and high frequency

Abstract = {{Frequently it happens that during symbols recognition, not all of them

   enclosing ``wheat{''} and excluding ``chaff{''}. We assume that entities
   of wheat, called native elements, are structured in some way and that

Abstract = {{This study reports a method to achieve dispersion of freeze-dried
   Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in a
   water-methanol co-solvent system using purely mechanical means; in this
   case, magnetic stirring and sonication. During this study, no chemical
   modifiers or surfactants of any kind were added during the dispersion
   process as they increase the cost and duration of the manufacturing
   process for CNC reinforced composites and nanocomposites. The effect of
   CNC loading (0-20wt\% of PVP) and preparation method on solution
   viscosity, dispersion, and mechanical properties of electrospun PVP/CNC
   nanocomposite fiber mats were examined. In particular, this study
   demonstrates that pre-dispersion of the hydrophilic CNCs in pure
   deionized water before the addition of methanol and PVP is critical to
   improving dispersion and achieving greater homogeneity of the system.
   All samples were examined for birefringence by polarized light
   microscopy, which was correlated to the level of CNC dispersion within
   the polymer matrix. The effect of CNC loading on the mechanical
   properties of the composite mats was investigated via tensile testing.
   Humidity was identified as an important factor affecting the PVP
   nanofiber morphology and strength, though its effects were not
   characterized in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Proton-conducting perovskite oxides such as doped barium cerate and
   barium zirconate are promising electrolytes for solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFCs). Here we report that the typical high performance proton
   conductor, BaZr0.1 Ce0.7Y0 2O3 +/-delta (BZCY), is prone to physical,
   chemical and thereby electrochemical degradations as it ages under
   ambient conditions. This aging effect destroys the electrolyte disk and
   breaks down the perovskite lattice. Electrochemical measurements
   indicate degraded BZCY based SOFC suffers from significant performance
   losses, and various advanced materials characterization results confirm
   that this degradation of BZCY is exclusively caused by water and CO2
   from the surrounding environment. The water molecules catalyze the
   degradation, initiating and promoting the carbonatation of BZCY. The
   subsequent reaction with CO2 creates two major phases: BaCO3 nano-rod
   single crystals and amorphous oxide mixtures. The entire process is
   visualized via TEM observations, based on which we propose that this
   occurs via the microcrucible mechanism. As this mechanism does not incur
   significant segregations of decomposition products, the aged BZCY powder
   is easily regenerated by re-calcination. We then study the effects of
   doping on the stability of BZCY, showing that a higher Zr content
   obviously improves the aging resistance. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{A new damage detection framework with emphasis on damage detection under
   varying temperature effects is introduced in this paper in the context
   of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). One of the most important issues
   with continuous SHM is the environmental effects (such as temperature,
   humidity, wind) on the measurement data, which can produce bigger
   effects in the response of the structures than the damage itself.
   Without appropriately considering these factors in the damage detection
   process, the efficiency of this process may be questionable for
   practical applications. Temperature is considered as one of the most
   important and influential environmental effect. In this study, an
   artificial neural network based approach integrated with a sensor
   clustering time series analysis is employed for damage detection under
   the temperature effects. This methodology is applied to a finite element
   footbridge model, where it is demonstrated that the method can
   successfully determine the existence, location and extent of the damage
   for different types of load cases, and with different levels of the
   noise.}},

Abstract = {{Modal frequencies are one of the most easily quantifiable damage
   features for damage detection. However, the fact that changes in modal
   parameters caused by temperature variations usually mask those induced
   by structural damage is one the main challenges for the reliability of
   modal parameter-based damage identification methods. Hence, removing the
   adverse temperature effects from the damage detection process is a
   crucial need to prevent false positives or negatives. Although
   auto-associative neural network (AANN) has been extensively used in this
   context, the fact that temperature values can be measured precisely and
   easily due to maturing sensing technologies has hardly been exploited in
   the AANN-based damage identification methods. To fill this void, a
   modified AANN-based method, which add the representational temperature
   values to the inputs, is explored in this paper. Numerical models based
   on an experimental grid structure, with varying temperature conditions
   and different extents of simulated damage, are used to test the
   performance of the proposed technique. After training the modified AANN
   model using the frequency and temperature data sets from models in
   intact states, corresponding data sets from models in unseen states are
   used to verify the detectability and robustness of this method by taking
   the Euclidean Norm as a damage index. Results show that this
   unsupervised learning method can discern the presence and severity of
   damage reliably in all of the cases investigated. Various temperature
   effects and increasing levels of noises introduced into the models
   hardly influence the damage identification, revealing the high
   robustness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{Operational effects on the structures (such as mass changes due to
   traffic crossing a bridge) introduce uncertainties in the damage
   detection process. When such changes and structural deteriorations
   happen simultaneously, damage detection becomes more complicated in
   defining how changes in mass and stiffness affect the changes in the
   structural properties and eventually the collected data. Thus, this
   paper focuses on developing a new methodology to detect changes in
   stiffness and eliminate operational effects e.g. mass separately based
   on a novel time series approach using output only vibration data. In
   this methodology, the difference Autoregressive moving average models
   with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) coefficients are utilized as Stiffness
   Damage Features (SDFs) and Mass Damage Features (MDFs) to determine the
   existence, location and severity of the damage or mass change. The shear
   type IASC-ASCE benchmark problem was utilized to verify the approach.
   The results show that changes in mass and stiffness can be clearly
   detected and damage's severity, location are also revealed successfully.
   Current limitations and plans are also discussed.}},

   The results showed that the total entropy generation increased with the
   increase of Rayleigh number, irreversibility coefficient, aspect ratio
   or solid volume fraction while it decreased with the increase of the
   corner radius. It should be noted that the best way for minimizing
   entropy generation is decreasing Rayleigh number. This is the first
   priority for minimizing entropy generation. The other parameters such as
   radius, volume fraction, etc. are placed on the second priority.
   However, Bejan number had an inverse trend compared with total entropy
   generation. As an exception, Bejan number and total entropy number had
   the same trend whenever solid volume fraction increased Moreover,

   vanadium oxide grafted TiO2 nanopartides (VOx/TiO2) infiltrated into a
   porous La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3,5 electron-conductive composite. A number of
   chemisorbed vanadia species on TiO2 have been identified by XRD, FTIR,
   XPS and ToF-SIMS anaEyses; the morphoEogies of grafted TiO2 nanopartides
   were characterized using SEM and TEM. The thermal stability of vanadia
   was greatly enhanced due to strong binding interaction with the support.
   In the chemical activity investigation using a fixed bed catalytic
   reactor, VOx/TiO2 showed significantly improved activity towards sour
   methane gas (0.5\% H2S + CH4) oxidation in a diluted stream of oxygen.
   The Eectrochemical activity was determined using a SOFC that empEoyed
   the VOx/TiO2 infiltrated titanate anode. This cell had a maximum power
   density of 160 mW cm(-2) and a non-ohmic poEarization resistance of <1
   cm(2) in 0.5\% H2S + CH4. Additionay, the performance of the novel anode
   materiaE did not degrade during the 24 h test at 0.7 V with VOx/TiO2
   suppressing coke formation on the anode.}},

Abstract = {{A carbon black/MnO2 nano-composite (CB/MnO2) of coral-like architecture
   was synthesized from a commercially available conductive carbon black
   (CB) using an in situ method. The morphology and structural analysis of
   the synthesized CB/MnO2 revealed 10 nm thick MnO2 nano-sheets grown on
   the CB. TheMnO(2) nano-sheets of poorly crystalline d-MnO2 birnessite
   structure assembled into a coral-like architecture. Energy dispersive
   X-ray (EDX) microanalysis showed high Mn content in the composite.
   Electrochemical tests using the synthesized CB/MnO2 showed a specific
   capacitance of 946 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.3 A g(-1), which
   was much higher than that of the composites reported in the literature.
   Under a current density of 30 A g(-1), the CB/MnO2 electrode was shown
   to retain a high specific capacitance after 5000 charge/discharge
   cycles. The results from this study demonstrate that the CB/MnO2 nano
   composite materials of coral-like architecture fabricated with
   commercially available CB and MnO2 achieved a good electrochemical
   performance, exhibiting promising application prospects.}},

Abstract = {{The pre-treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater (PWW) by wet hydrogen

   of the complex-mixture of organic compounds present in the wastewater.
   The influence of different crucial parameters such as temperature,

   initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) have been evaluated. The optimum
   conditions for degradation led to COD reductions of up to 80\% in only 1
   h of treatment. The results showed that WHPO is an effective process for
   treating pharmaceutical wastewater. Fe2+ addition improved COD removal.
   When reaction temperature is 440 degrees C, reaction time is 4 h,
   hydrogen peroxide excess is 0.8 and initial COD is 60 000 mg/l, and COD

Abstract = {{There is an increasing demand for rapid detection of waterborne
   pathogens to monitor drinking water safety. We demonstrate a compact,
   label-free sensor array for rapid detection of Escherichia coli (E.
   coli) in contaminated water samples using antimicrobial peptide assisted
   impedimetric sensor platform. Interdigitated electrode arrays
   immobilized with the antimicrobial peptide Colicin V (ColV) were used to
   screen the affinity towards different bacterial strains by monitoring
   impedance variations in real-time. This ColV assisted impedance
   biosensor exhibited high selectivity towards Gram-negative strains
   particularly towards E. coli strains. This selective detection of E.
   coli from other strains was observed at 10(2) cfu mL(-1), which is
   clinically relevant. The sensor can detect E. coli from 10(2) to 10(6)
   cfu mL(-1) in water sample at pH 7 to 9. These results show that the
   antimicrobial peptide ColV assisted impedimetric array is capable of
   rapid, specific detection of E. coli in contaminated water samples.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, Ni based cermet anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs)
   have been suffering from poisoning from sulfur in fuel and carbon
   deposition while operating on hydrocarbon fuel. Using perovskite as an
   alternative can effectively alleviate these problems. However, its
   performance is unsatisfying. In this work, a lanthanum strontium
   titanate based perovskite oxide with facile modification of Ni and Ce
   (LSCNT) was fabricated by a modified sol-gel method. The exsolution of
   Ni surrounded by uniformly dispersed Ce species in the perovskite
   lattice could only be obtained by sintering the material in consecutive
   atmospheres of air and 10\% H-2/Ar. The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
   equipped with an LSCNT anode exhibited desirable electrochemical
   performance and stability with 5000 pm H2S/H-2 and dry methane fuel. The
   presence of exsolved metallic Ni provided strong active sites for the
   fuel oxidation reaction and simultaneously the Ce species with a redox
   couple provided Ni with abundant oxygen ions. The synergetic effect
   between Ce and Ni facilitates the electrochemical reaction and promotes
   the removal of carbon deposition. All these features make LSCNT a
   promising sulfur and carbon-deposition tolerant anode material for
   SOFCs.}},

Abstract = {{Biomolecule-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been studied
   vastly in recent years due to their potential applications for instance
   in cancer detection, purification and separation of CNTs, and
   nanoelectronics. Studying the electrostatic potential generated by a
   biomolecule-CNT hybrid is important in predicting its interactions with
   the surrounding environment such as charged particles and surfaces. In
   this paper, we performed atomistic simulations using a QM: MM approach
   to evaluate the electrostatic potential and charge transfer for a hybrid
   structure formed by a DNA nucleotide and a CNT in solution. Four types
   of DNA nucleotides and two CNTs with chiralities of (4,4) and (7,0) were
   considered. The types of nucleotides and CNTs were both found to play
   important roles in the electrostatic potential and charge transfer of
   the hybrid. At the same distance from the CNT axis, the electrostatic
   potential for the nucleotide-(4,4) CNT hybrids was found to be stronger
   compared with that for the nucleotide-(7,0) CNT hybrids. Higher electric
   charge was also shown to be transferred from the DNA nucleotides to the
   (7,0) CNT compared with the (4,4) CNT. These results correlate with the
   previous finding that the nucleotides bound more tightly to the (7,0)
   CNT compared with the (4,4) CNT.}},

Abstract = {{n-Type anatase-phase one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructure arrays coated
   with nanoparticles of Cu or CuPt have emerged as high performance
   photocatalysts for both photooxidation and photoreduction. The
   properties of the catalyst-promoter interface are recognized to be
   critical to this high performance but are largely unknown. Using X-ray
   and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS/UPS), we probed the
   electronic properties of the CuPt-TiO2 interface in transparent TiO2
   nanotube arrays (TTNTAs) coated with photodeposited CuPt nanoparticles
   (CuPt-TTNTA hybrids) as well as those coated with sputtered CuPt
   (Sput-CuPt-TTNTA hybrids). XPS and UPS spectra provided the evidence of
   a Schottky barrier with a band-bending of 0.49-0.67 eV at the CuPt-TiO2
   interface in CuPt-TTNTA hybrids due to which photo-excited electrons are
   expected to be retained in the TiO2 while photoexcited holes will be
   collected by the CuPt nanoparticles. For Sput-CuPt-TTNTA hybrids, no
   such band-bending was observed. These results point to the importance of
   the metal nanoparticle preparation technique on interfacial
   band-alignments and challenge the conventional understanding of the
   promoting action of noble metal nanoparticles on TiO2 photocatalysts as
   sinks for photoexcited electrons.}},

   sequel, successful knowledge representation, for instance through
   graphs, enables knowledge-based reasoning. There exist various forms of
   knowledge representation through graphs; some of which allow to handle
   uncertainty and imprecision by invoking the technology of fuzzy sets.
   The paper provides an overview of different types of graphs stressing
   their relationships and their essential features. An example is included
   for didactical reasons. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The Ordered Fuzzy Numbers (OFN) were defined over 10 years ago as a tool
   for processing fuzzy numbers. This model has an additional feature used
   in processing, namely direction. It allows to define arithmetical
   operations in a new way. Proposed methods retain the basic computational
   properties of the operations known for the real numbers. Apart from a
   good calculations, OFNs also offer new possibilities for processing
   imprecise information. The new property - a direction - has a major
   impact on the calculations, but gives also a new potential for
   processing data in the fuzzy systems. We can include to the fuzzy value
   some more interpretation than membership value. If we want take into
   account this additional information in the processing of fuzzy system,
   we need the methods which are sensitive for the direction.
   This publication presents the basic tool for processing a fuzzy
   statement `A is B' where A and B are OFNs. It can be called a
   compatibility of A with B. New proposition is sensitive for the
   direction and bases on the conception of the Direction Determinant
   proposed in previous studies on the topic.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory (DFT) was used to explore the mechanism of the

   firstly achieved by means of a concerted intermolecular hydrogen
   exchange between two molecules of 2-pyrrolidinone, 1. Then, the formed
   lactim 2 and an aldehyde reacted to yield a hemiaminal 3 via a
   nucleophilic reaction and a hydrogen transfer. Finally, the product 5
   was generated through a dehydrogenation of the hemiaminal 3, catalyzed
   by ruthenium complex 4. The total Gibbs energy barrier in the catalytic
   cycle of N-acylation is 23.9 kcal mol(-1), and the generation of the

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2501}},
Pages = {{18-24}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for obtaining airfield capacity estimates
   using historical data from FAA's Aviation System Performance Metrics
   (ASPM) database. The process first involves merging individual flights
   and quarter-hour airport runway operations data sets from ASPM to create
   a new data set. Data for Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in
   New Jersey and San Diego International Airport in California from 2006
   to 2011 were used. Then, filters for meteorological condition, runway
   configuration, called rates, and fleet mix were applied to the two
   airport data sets. The filtered data sets were then used in a censored
   regression model of capacity that included queue length (number of
   aircraft waiting to arrive or depart) and arrival departure throughput
   count splits as independent variables. These attributes were found to
   affect airfield capacity at statistically significant levels, and
   parameters had expected signs and magnitudes. Additionally, capacities
   under ideal conditions were found to be reasonably close to other
   sources. The model also confirmed that average capacities at EWR during
   hours when a ground delay program (GDP) was running were lower than when
   there was no GDP in effect. The method described in this paper could be
   used to more precisely quantify airfield capacities in specific
   conditions of particular interest to air traffic controllers and airport
   operators to better facilitate decisions that rely heavily on a good
   understanding of capacity in these conditions. The data exploration and
   preparation undertaken as part of the study reveal some of the finer
   points of the ASPM data and how they can be used in a more meaningful
   way for airfield capacity estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional Ni-based cermet anodes such as Ni-gadolinia doped ceria
   (Ni-GDC) suffer from Low carbon deposition resistance in direct methane
   solid oxide fueL cells (SOFCs). Here we show that impregnating proton
   conducting perovskites Like BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-delta(BCY)and
   BaCe0.9Yb0.103O3-delta (BCYb) in Ni-GDC not 9 Y-0.1 only improves the
   initial polarization performance but aka, most importanty, significanty
   enhances the stability in wet methane fueL (3\% H2O in CH4) by
   inhibiting carbon deposition and formation. In wet methane, the voltage
   of the cell with the conventional Ni-GDC anode decreases rapidly from
   0.58 to 0.15 V within 6 h at 200 mA cm(-2) and 750 degrees C. In
   contrast, in the case of the cells with BCY + Ni-GDC and BCYb + Ni-GDC
   anodes, the ceLL voltage is essentiay constant at 0.62-0.65 V over a
   period of 48 h tested under identical conditions. The microstructure and
   Raman spectroscopy analysis reveal that the impregnated fine BCY and
   BCYb particles are preferentiay distributed on the surface of the Ni
   grains in the Ni-GDC anode, decreasing the exposed surface of Ni grains
   and inhibiting carbon deposition. Aka, the proton conducting and fine
   BCY and BCYb particles can adsorb and decompose water, which in turn
   reacts with deposited carbon to form CO and H-2, alleviating the carbon
   deposition problem in the anode and thus significanty improving the ceLL
   stability of direct methane SOFCs.}},

Title = {{Kinetic Study and Thermal Decomposition Behavior of Lignite Coal}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{A thermogravimetric analyzer was employed to investigate the thermal
   behavior and extract the kinetic parameters of Canadian lignite coal.
   The pyrolysis experiments were conducted in temperatures ranging from
   298K to 1173K under inert atmosphere utilizing six different heating
   rates of 1, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 K min(-1), respectively. There are
   different techniques for analyzing the kinetics of solid-state reactions
   that can generally be classified into two categories: model-fitting and
   model-free methods. Historically, model-fitting methods are broadly used
   in solid-state kinetics and show an excellent fit to the experimental
   data but produce uncertain kinetic parameters especially for
   nonisothermal conditions. In this work, different model-free techniques
   such as the Kissinger method and the isoconversional methods of Ozawa,
   Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose, and Friedman are employed and compared in
   order to analyze nonisothermal kinetic data and investigate thermal
   behavior of a lignite coal. Experimental results showed that the
   activation energy values obtained by the isoconversional methods were in
   good agreement, but Friedman method was considered to be the best among
   the model-free methods to evaluate kinetic parameters for solid-state
   reactions. These results can provide useful information to predict
   kinetic model of coal pyrolysis and optimization of the process
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{RNA secondary structure prediction by energy minimization is the central
   computational tool for the analysis of structural noncoding RNAs and
   their interactions. Sparsification has been successfully applied to
   improve the time efficiency of various structure prediction algorithms
   while guaranteeing the same result; however, for many such folding
   problems, space efficiency is of even greater concern, in particular for
   long RNAs and complex folding algorithms. So far, space-efficient
   sparsified RNA folding with fold reconstruction was solved only for
   simple pseudo-energy models. Here, we revisit the problem of
   space-efficient free energy minimization. Whereas the space-efficient
   minimization of the free energy has been sketched before, the
   reconstruction of the optimum structure has not even been discussed. We
   show that this reconstruction is not possible in trivial extension of
   the method for simple energy models. Then, we present the time-and
   space-efficient sparsified free energy minimization algorithm
   SPARSEMFEFold, which guarantees optimal structure prediction. In
   particular, this novel algorithm provides efficient fold reconstruction
   based on dynamically garbage collected trace arrows. We provide

Title = {{Effect of sol stabilizer on the structure and electronic properties of
   solution-processed ZnO thin films}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{106}},
Pages = {{87007-87018}},
Abstract = {{ZnO is an increasingly important wide bandgap semiconductor for
   optoelectronic applications. Solution processing provides a facile and
   inexpensive method to form ZnO thin films with high throughput. The sol
   stabilizer used in the solution processing of ZnO functions variously as
   a sol homogenizer, chelating agent, wettability improver and capping
   agent. In spite of its obvious importance in influencing ZnO film
   properties, a restricted set of short chain alkaline sol stabilizers
   have been used in prior reports. We examined the effect of six different
   sol stabilizers, including acidic and longer chain species, along with a
   recipe without any stabilizer, on the grain size, crystallographic
   texture, and resistivity of solution processed ZnO films on thermal
   oxide-coated silicon substrates, and found large variations in the
   structural and electrical properties as a consequence of the choice of
   sol stabilizer. We found that ZnO films formed using oleic acid as the
   sol stabilizer possessed a strong (002) preferred orientation with a
   Lotgering factor as high as 0.86. The key insight we obtained is that
   the sol stabilizer strongly influences the film surface area and
   activation energy barrier for inter-grain transport. We comprehensively
   studied the steady state and transient behavior of ZnO films deposited
   using different stabilizers and compared their lifetime and
   mobility-lifetime products. When exposed to illumination, the
   conductivity of the deposited films increased by several orders of
   magnitude. This is attributed to the trapping of the nonequilibrium
   holes by the surface adsorbed oxide species, which produces equivalent
   number of excess electrons in the conduction band. Impedance
   spectroscopy and C-V measurements were performed to calculate the doping
   of the ZnO thin films. ZnO thin film transistors were also fabricated
   and the effects of the sol stabilizer on the different parameters of the
   TFT like mobility and threshold voltage were investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Use of crumb rubber from scrap tire in the reinforced concrete along
   with Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) bar is a novel way of recycling tire
   and providing durable and sustainable concrete structure. The
   performance of reinforced concrete structures depends on the proper
   transfer of forces between concrete and reinforcement. And this proper
   transfer of forces depends of the quality of bond between concrete and
   reinforcement bar. In this study, the bond characteristics of sand
   coated Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) bar embedded in lightweight
   concrete with crumb rubber as partial or full replacement of sand has
   been evaluated. Quasi static bond pullout tests were performed on 60
   cylindrical test specimens to determine the effects of crumb rubber
   percentage, FRP bar diameter and short steel fibre presence on bond
   performance. Two different bar sizes (10mm and 16 mm diameters) were
   used while keeping the constant embedment length of five times the bar
   diameter. The study showed that increase in crumb rubber content reduces
   the bond strength. Presence of short steel fibre disrupts the bond with
   FRP bar. The research also showed that bond strength is higher with 16
   mm bar compare to 10mm bar due to prominent surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental investigation was focused on the study of compressive
   behavior of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) subjected to
   different sustained elevated temperature ranging from 100(0) C to 400(0)
   C. In order to evaluate the effect of elevated temperature on M40 grade
   SFRC steel fibers of length 30 mm were used. Specimens were casted by
   using 0\%, 1\%, and 2\% volume fractions. Data obtained from laboratory
   test results showed that residual strength varied inversely with the
   quantity of fibers at all levels of sustained elevated temperatures. The
   compressive toughness of SFRC was also evaluated to investigate the
   mechanical properties of SFRC at sustained elevated temperatures of
   100(0) C, 200(0) C 300(0) C and 400(0) C. Test results showed that
   increase in the volume of steel fibers does not have significant
   variation in compressive strength at room temperature whereas it is
   observed that there is a decreasing trend in the residual compressive
   strength of SFRC up to sustained elevated temperature of 400(0) C.}},

Title = {{Molecular theory of solvation: Methodology summary and illustrations}},
Journal = {{CONDENSED MATTER PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Integral equation theory of molecular liquids based on statistical
   mechanics is quite promising as an essential part of multiscale
   methodology for chemical and biomolecular nanosystems in solution.
   Beginning with a molecular interaction potential force field, it uses
   diagrammatic analysis of the solvation free energy to derive integral
   equations for correlation functions between molecules in solution in the
   statistical-mechanical ensemble. The infinite chain of coupled integral
   equations for many-body correlation functions is reduced to a tractable
   form for 2- or 3-body correlations by applying the so-called closure
   relations. Solving these equations produces the solvation structure with
   accuracy comparable to molecular simulations that have converged but has
   a critical advantage of readily treating the effects and processes
   spanning over a large space and slow time scales, by far not feasible
   for explicit solvent molecular simulations. One of the versions of this
   formalism, the three-dimensional reference interaction site model
   (3D-RISM) integral equation complemented with the Kovalenko-Hirata (KH)
   closure approximation, yields the solvation structure in terms of 3D
   maps of correlation functions, including density distributions, of
   solvent interaction sites around a solute (supra)molecule with full
   consistent account for the effects of chemical functionalities of all
   species in the solution. The solvation free energy and the subsequent
   thermodynamics are then obtained at once as a simple integral of the 3D
   correlation functions by performing thermodynamic integration
   analytically. Analytical form of the free energy functional permits the
   self-consistent field coupling of 3D-RISM-KH with quantum chemistry
   methods in multiscale description of electronic structure in solution,
   the use of 3D maps of potentials of mean force as scoring functions for
   molecular recognition and protein-ligand binding in docking protocols
   for fragment based drug design, and the hybrid MD simulation running
   quasidynamics of biomolecules steered with 3D-RISM-KH mean solvation
   forces. The 3D-RISM-KH theory has been validated on both simple and
   complex associating liquids with different chemical functionalities in a
   wide range of thermodynamic conditions, at different solid-liquid
   interfaces, in soft matter, and various environments and confinements.
   The 3D-RISM-KH theory offers a ``mental microscope{''} capable of
   providing an insight into structure and molecular mechanisms of
   formation and functioning of various chemical and biomolecular systems
   and nanomaterials.}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{39}},

Abstract = {{A series of platinum(II) biphenyl 2,2'-bipyridine complexes containing
   electron-donating and electron-withdrawing moieties on the 4 and 4'
   positions of the bipyridine ligand exhibit emission from excited states
   in the 600 nm region of the spectrum upon excitation in the
   metal-to-ligand charge transfer transition located near 450 nm. These
   complexes are distorted from planarity based on both single crystal
   structure determinations and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations of isolated molecules in acetonitrile. The DFT also reveals
   the geometry of the lowest-lying triplet state (LLTS) of each complex
   that is important for emission behavior. The LLTS are assigned based on
   the electron spin density distributions and correlated with the singlet
   excited states to understand the mechanism of electronic excitation and
   relaxation. Time-dependent DFT calculations are performed to compute the
   singlet excited state energies of these complexes so as to help
   interpret their UV-Vis absorption spectra. Computational and
   experimental results, including absorption and emission energy maxima,
   electrochemical reduction potentials, LLTS, singlet excited states, and
   LUMO and HOMO energies, exhibit linear correlations with the Hammett
   constants for para-substituents sigma(p). These correlations are
   employed to screen complexes that have not yet been synthesized. The
   correlation analysis indicates that the electronic structure and the
   HOMO-LUMO energy gap in Pt(II) complexes can be effectively controlled
   using electron-donating and electron-withdrawing moieties covalently
   bonded to the ligands. The information presented in this paper provides
   a better understanding of the fundamental electronic and thermodynamic
   behavior of these complexes and could be used to design systems with
   specific applications.}},

Title = {{Needle-free drop deposition: the role of elastic membranes}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{100}},
Pages = {{82374-82380}},
Abstract = {{Contact angle measurement of low-energy surfaces (superhydrophobic,
   superoleophobic, etc.) with needle-drop assembly is critical for
   characterizing such substrates. However, it is extremely difficult to
   detach the needle from the drop when it is brought into contact with a
   characterizing substrate and often one has to report contact angles with
   the needle attached to the drop itself. To overcome this challenge, here
   we present a new technique to achieve a `needle-free' drop by bringing
   the drop into contact with an additional elastic membrane, kept between
   the needle-drop assembly and the characterizing substrate. The
   detachment of the drop from the needle is achieved by retracting the
   needle-drop assembly at a finite speed and allowing the drop to receive
   the elastic energy of the soft flexible membrane. Such interaction of
   the drop with the elastic membrane allows the drop to be repelled from
   the elastic membrane and further be deposited on a characterizing
   substrate. The repelling behavior of the drop can be controlled by
   appropriately selecting the mechanical and wetting properties of this
   additional elastic membrane. This technique not only provides a
   needle-free drop deposition that is independent of the physical
   properties of the liquid and the needle but it also allows achievement
   of drop sizes independent of the needle diameter. Experimental analysis
   and theoretical investigations suggest that the mechanical properties of
   the elastic membrane, particularly its elasticity, play an important
   role towards the success of the drop deposition technique.}},

Title = {{Effects of a helium/oxygen mixture on individuals' lung function and
   metabolic cost during submaximal exercise for participants with
   obstructive lung diseases}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Helium/oxygen therapies have been studied as a means to
   reduce the symptoms of obstructive lung diseases with inconclusive
   results in clinical trials. To better understand this variability in
   results, an exploratory physiological study was performed comparing the
   effects of helium/oxygen mixture (78\%/22\%) to that of medical air.
   Methods: The gas mixtures were administered to healthy, asthmatic, and
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) participants, both moderate
   and severe (6 participants in each disease group, a total of 30); at
   rest and during submaximal cycling exercise with equivalent work rates.
   Measurements of ventilatory parameters, forced spirometry, and
   ergospirometry were obtained.
   Results: There was no statistical difference in ventilatory and cardiac
   responses to breathing helium/oxygen during submaximal exercise. For
   asthmatics, but not for the COPD participants, there was a statistically
   significant benefit in reduced metabolic cost, determined through
   measurement of oxygen uptake, for the same exercise work rate. However,
   the individual data show that there were a mixture of responders and
   nonresponders to helium/oxygen in all of the groups.
   Conclusion: The inconsistent response to helium/oxygen between
   individuals is perhaps the key drawback to the more effective and
   widespread use of helium/oxygen to increase exercise capacity and for
   other therapeutic applications.}},

Title = {{Use of Extrathoracic Deposition Models for Patient-Specific Dose
   Estimation during Inhaler Design}},
Journal = {{CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{3984-3992}},
Abstract = {{The lung dose of inhaled pharmaceutical aerosol that an individual will
   receive from an inhaler can now be more accurately estimated in light of
   recent extrathoracic deposition modeling that has correlated
   characteristic airway dimensions with deposition. This paper first
   summarizes the current state of extrathoracic deposition models,
   including recent developments that have quantified the effects of
   aerosol electrostatics and inhaler mouthpiece diameter on deposition. A
   generalized equation for predicting extrathoracic deposition in
   different subjects is then developed and average characteristic airway
   dimensions representative of different age groups are indicated. A
   methodology is then presented to predict the lung dose per unit body
   surface area individuals will receive from an inhaler. A sample
   calculation shows that a typical 10-year-old child subject would receive
   a lower lung dose per unit body surface area than an adult subject
   inhaling through the same inhaler at the same 90 L min(-1) flow rate,
   due to greater extrathoracic deposition in the child. In order to
   provide an equivalent lung dose per unit body surface area to the child
   as to the adult, an inhaler particle size adjustment is specified.
   Finally, the use of idealized geometries for developing inhaler-specific
   empirical correlations and improving upon inhaler design is outlined.}},

Title = {{Assessing Responses of Fish to Habitat Enhancement in Barrenlands
   Streams of the Northwest Territories}},
Journal = {{NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{755-764}},
Abstract = {{We examined the effectiveness of three fishpasses (two gabion-style
   pool-weir fishpasses and one nature-like choke-and-pool fishpass) at
   enhancing connectivity among three small, headwater lakes as part of a
   fish habitat compensation project in the Barrenlands region of the
   Northwest Territories. We quantified fish attraction and passage
   efficiency of fishpasses using PIT antennae, and compared fish use of
   fishpasses to reference streams using visual and electrofishing surveys
   for 1 year before and 2 years after their construction. We did not
   detect, observe, or capture any fish in either of the gabion-style
   pool-weir fishpasses during the first year after construction, and these
   two fishpasses were subsequently retrofitted to improve their hydraulic
   performance. After retrofits were completed, we still did not detect any
   tagged fish (>= 150 mm) migrating through the two fishpasses using PIT
   telemetry, but identified some small fish moving downstream through
   these fishpasses during visual and electrofishing surveys. Conversely,
   we detected tagged Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus migrating upstream
   and downstream through the nature-like choke-and-pool fishpass during
   both postenhancement years, and also encountered fish throughout this
   fishpass during visual and electrofishing surveys. Compared with
   reference streams, gabion-weir fishpasses limited fish movement and use
   even after modification, whereas the nature-like fishpass successfully
   facilitated fish movement and use. We recommend against using
   gabion-style pool-weir fishpasses in Barrenlands headwater lake-stream
   systems, particularly when stream flow is limited, and suggest future
   projects aimed at enhancing lake-stream connectivity explore nature-like
   fishpass designs in an experimental management framework.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the application of Response
   Surface Methodology in defining the effect of self-assembly condition on
   the average diameter of polymeric micelles. Di- and tri-block copolymers
   of poly(ethylene
   oxide)-b-poly(alpha-benzylcarboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-PBCL)
   and PBCL-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-PBCL (PBCL-PEG-PBCL) were synthesized
   through ring opening polymerization of alpha-benzyl-epsilon-carboxylate
   using MePEO or dihydroxy PEG as initiator, respectively. Polymeric
   micelles were formed through solubilization of block copolymers in
   acetone followed by drop-wise addition of this solution to water.
   Polymer concentration was changed and the intensity mean diameter of
   self-assembled structures was measured by dynamic light scattering. The
   experimental data were fitted to a mathematical model. The experimental
   conditions leading to the production of micelles of certain size (30, 60
   or 90nm for tri-block and 30nm for di-block copolymers) was predicted. A
   good match between predicted and experimental data was observed. The
   results showed it would be possible to obtain micelles of certain size
   using block copolymers of different molecular weights or obtain micelles
   of different size at a given block copolymer molecular weight, by
   manipulating the polymer concentration. These observations show
   reproducible micelles of defined average diameter can be prepared by
   co-solvent evaporation by controlling the used polymer concentration.}},

   that increasing activation temperature/KOH ratio improves pore
   development, but will result in pore widening effect and eventually
   decrease of Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area and micropore
   volume. It has also been determined that a proper preheating stage leads
   to the formation of network-like nanostructures through polymeric
   cross-linking. These nanostructures are beneficial to the pore
   development during subsequent activation at high temperatures and can

Abstract = {{Using W6Mo5Cr4V2 HSS (High-speed steel) as a sample material, effects of
   cryogenic treatment on residual surface stress of ground W6Mo5Cr4V2 HSS
   specimens were investigated. The residual stress in the ground surface
   and its change caused by cryogenic treatment were analyzed using both
   X-ray diffraction technique and finite element method. It was
   demonstrated that the cryogenic treatment reduced the equivalent stress
   Max Mises from 248.9 MPa to 114.3 MPa, and the principal stress reduced
   from 124.0 MPa to 91.6 MPa. The residual stress at X direction (S11)
   parallel to the grinding direction was tensile stress, which was reduced
   from the Max. 105.8 MPa to 63.48 MPa. However, the residual stress (S22)
   perpendicular to the grinding direction was compressive stress, which
   was slightly increased from 272.6 MPa to 287.8 MPa by the cryogenic
   treatment. The changes in both the tensile and compressive residual
   stress components are beneficial to material performance, e.g., wear
   resistance. Results from the computational and experimental analyses are
   consistent.}},

Abstract = {{A pre-requisite for any calculation of the stability of a natural slope
   is a hypothesis about how the slope may move. No formal method for
   estimating likely kinematic modes of slopes exists. We have suggested a
   working hypothesis that similar landslides in similar materials are
   caused by similar processes under similar conditions. During the IDNDR
   (1990-2000), the IAEG Commission on Landslides contributed to the
   Working Classification of Landslides which now records an international
   consensus. A landslide can be typed by a term describing the natural
   materials before they were displaced and a second term describing the
   movement. Materials are rock, debris or earth; earth may be sand, silt
   or clay. Movements may be falls, flows, slides, spreads or topples.
   Water conditions in the displaced material may range from dry thru'
   moist and wet to very wet. In permafrost terrain, frozen and thawed
   displaced material may occur. Water conditions, material and mode of
   movement may govern the rate of movement of the displacing mass. It can
   range from extremely slow to the extremely rapid movements, which may
   have catastrophic impacts. Activity, its distribution and style may
   affect anticipated modes of movement in preparatory or marginal slopes.
   Styles of movement may be complex, composite, successive and multiple.
   Compilations of historic activity as landslide inventories suggest
   hazard scenarios which can form plausible initial hypotheses for risk
   assessments.}},

Abstract = {{The Thompson River, south of Ashcroft, British Columbia, Canada is a
   particularly unique area where complex glacial geology, active
   geomorphic processes and critical infrastructure (both major national
   rail lines-CPR and CN) intersect with and are affected by a long history
   of slope instability. Well documented landslides along a + 10 km stretch
   of the valley have been impacting infrastructure as far back as the 19th
   century. The Ripley landslide is a small slow moving translational
   failure that is known to have been active since 1951. It poses a hazard
   to the onsite infrastructure since both the CN and CPR tracks run
   adjacent to each other along the entire breadth of the landslide. The
   economic repercussions of severing both railways here would be
   pronounced. In response to this threat, an extensive suite of monitoring
   technology is now being applied that includes: traditional applications
   including permanent monitoring using GPS stations and piezometers;
   subsurface investigations involving drilling and shallow seismic
   surveys; the adoption of novel technologies such as linear fibre optic
   sensing and vertical subsurface ShapeAccelArray (SAA) inclinometry, the
   installation of corner reflectors for satellite based (RADARSAT-2)
   interferometry and the deployment of ground-based SAR and LiDAR for
   ongoing quantitative assessment. Herein we summarize the collective
   efforts associated with this extensive array of instrumentation and
   monitoring studies being undertaken to better manage this and other
   landslide hazards in Canada and elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity of rockfall processes induces potential uncertainties in
   the modeling of rockfall trajectory. However, the stochasticity of
   rockfall trajectory has not yet been well addressed owing to either the
   over-simplification of numerical models or the over-complexity of real
   rockfall cases. In this paper, a field experiment was implemented to
   investigate the stochasticity of rockfall trajectory. A single sample of
   rock block was repeatedly used throughout the experiment to avoid
   complications derived from diversities of the properties of samples. The
   results showed that significant scattering of rockfall trajectory exist
   among different trials of rockfall using the same sample released from
   the same height on the same site. This suggests that minor variations of
   parameters and conditions can propagate during rockfall processes and
   finally result in significant stochasticity of rockfall trajectory. To
   the best knowledge of the authors, the stochasticity of rockfall
   trajectory is for the first time revealed by a physical experiment using
   a single sample strategy.}},

Abstract = {{An in situ explosion test on dynamic responses of one single surface
   slope (stepped slope) of open-pit iron mine in Miyun County, Beijing has

   with blocky structure and its surface is strongly disturbed due to
   excavation and explosion. Four explosion recorders have been used as
   data acquisition instruments in the experiment. Each of the recorder has
   two channels and can record horizontal and vertical component at the
   same time. Four recorders have been placed at different elevation of the
   slope to monitor the dynamic responses of the slope during explosion.
   The explosion point was located at the foot of the slope. The results
   indicate that peak ground velocity (PGV) and peak ground acceleration
   (PGA) varies with elevation changing. It can be seen that both PGV and
   PGA decrease gradually with elevation increasing, and then amplify at
   the near crest of the slope.}},

Abstract = {{Multipopulational metaheuristic methods have been used to solve a
   variety of problems. The use of multiple populations evolved in parallel

   maintaining a sole panmictic population of candidate solutions.
   Moreover, multipopulational algorithms can be easily parallelized and
   efficiently accelerated by contemporary multicore and distributed
   architectures. In this work, we study two populational real-parameter
   optimization metaheuristics in a traditional and multipopulational
   configuration, and propose a new heterogeneous multipopulational
   approach. The usefulness of the new method is briefly evaluated on

   to elaborate concepts of aforementioned tools based on automatic data

   in a form of granular cognitive maps. Linguistic approach to data
   structuring allows for establishing a suitable perspective at the

   indicate that when the concentration of the thiosulfate ions increases,
   the semiconductivity is converted from the n-type to the p-type. This
   conversion is postulated to be due to the incorporation of sulfur into
   the passive film, which changes the vacancy type. The breakdown behavior

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{359-368}},
Abstract = {{The Canadian oil sands - the third largest proven reserves of oil after
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela-are located in Northern Alberta, Canada;
   these deposits of unconventional oil are an attractive investment for
   oil \& gas developers and governments not only because of the size of
   the reserves but also the geopolitical stability of the region.
   Nevertheless, the development of the projects and current operations are
   facing opposition and struggling with a negative campaign around the
   world due in part to misinformation of the facts, lack of knowledge of
   the process throughout the projects life cycle, and years of stakeholder
   mismanagement. Indisputably, the development of the projects carries a
   series of impacts (environmental, social, economic, and health);
   developers and operators may dispute the intensity of the impacts but
   not the existence of them. The manuscript discusses the impacts on land,
   water and air resources based on indicators included in sustainability
   reports presented by oil sands developing and operating organizations.
   These reported statistics give a broader understanding of the current
   state of the Canadian oil sands and their development. The aim of the
   manuscript is to present these statistics four most common environmental
   impacts from oil sands development: greenhouse gas emissions, land use,
   water use, and tailing ponds.}},

   targeting of drugs to liver is a serious challenge. Specific delivery of
   molecules to hepatocytes is accomplished by targeting cell surface
   lectins, asialoglycoprotein receptors. Asialofetuin, N-acetyl
   glucosamine and galactose are high-affinity ligands of
   asialoglycoprotein receptors. The bioconjugation of drugs, fluorescent
   molecules and gene delivery vectors with lectin-targeting agents, and
   their delivery in liver hepatocytes, is discussed. Mannose and N-acetyl
   glucosamine conjugates are evaluated for their delivery to hepatic
   stellate and kupffer cells. The glycosylated gene and drug delivery
   vectors in clinical trials are outlined.}},

Title = {{Principal Components of Superhigh-Dimensional Statistical Features and
   Support Vector Machine for Improving Identification Accuracies of
   Different Gear Crack Levels under Different Working Conditions}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Gears are widely used in gearbox to transmit power from one shaft to
   another. Gear crack is one of the most frequent gear fault modes found
   in industry. Identification of different gear crack levels is beneficial
   in preventing any unexpected machine breakdown and reducing economic
   loss because gear crack leads to gear tooth breakage. In this paper, an
   intelligent fault diagnosis method for identification of different gear
   crack levels under different working conditions is proposed. First,
   superhigh-dimensional statistical features are extracted from continuous
   wavelet transform at different scales. The number of the statistical
   features extracted by using the proposed method is 920 so that the
   extracted statistical features are superhigh dimensional. To reduce the
   dimensionality of the extracted statistical features and generate new
   significant low-dimensional statistical features, a simple and effective
   method called principal component analysis is used. To further improve
   identification accuracies of different gear crack levels under different
   working conditions, support vector machine is employed. Three
   experiments are investigated to show the superiority of the proposed
   method. Comparisons with other existing gear crack level identification
   methods are conducted. The results show that the proposed method has the
   highest identification accuracies among all existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional (3D) spinal
   deformity. Radiography is the standard method to diagnose AIS, but the
   2D image cannot reveal the true nature of scoliosis. It also exposes
   patients to harmful ionizing radiation. Ultrasound (US) imaging has been
   reported as a non-radiation method to acquire 3D information of the
   spine. Vertebral rotation (VR) that can be assessed from US image is an
   important parameter to predict curve progression and to evaluate
   treatment outcomes. To improve the image quality and reduce human
   errors, a semi-automatic program was developed to measure the VR. The
   purpose of this study was to determine the intra-observer reliability
   and the accuracy of the measurements using the developed program. Three
   cadaver vertebrae, T7, L1, and L3, were scanned with 39 rotation
   configurations from -30 degrees to 30 degrees with 5 degrees increment.
   The US images were randomly arranged to reduce memory bias. One observer
   performed the semiautomatic VR measurements twice with one-week
   interval. The semi-automatic VR measurements showed high intra-observer
   reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC): 0.999, mean
   absolute difference with standard deviation (MAD +/- SD): 0.2 degrees
   +/- 0.3 degrees) and agreed well with the experimental setup (ICC:
   0.956, MAD +/- SD: 2.5 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees). The results
   demonstrated the developed program was an accurate and reliable
   measurement tool to assess the VR for in-vitro study.}},

   investigate the optimal 3D ultrasound parameters by comparing the
   reconstructed images and the phantom.
   A medical ultrasound system, a convex and a linear ultrasound probes,
   both with built-in positioning sensors, were used to scan cadaveric
   vertebra T7 immersed in a water tank. The operating frequencies were set
   at 2.5 MHz, 3.3MHz, 4.0 MHz, 6.6 MHz, and 10.0 MHz. The voxel-based
   method was deployed for the 3D reconstruction. The minimum distances
   (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mm) between two adjacent B-scan images and the
   reconstruction resolutions (0.2, 0.6, and 1.0 mm) were the inputs for
   the reconstruction algorithm. A total of 45 configurations were
   investigated. Four distance parameters were measured three times on both
   the images and the cadaveric vertebra by one rater in one week apart to
   minimize memory bias. The mean absolute difference was the distance
   measurement difference between the images and phantom. The paired
   Student's t-test was used to determine the probability between the two
   populations. The determination of the optimal configuration was based on
   both accuracy and intuitive image quality.
   The results showed that the convex probe with the configuration (0.2-mm
   minimum distance, 0.6-mm reconstruction resolution, and 4.0 MHz)
   provided the best reconstructed image.}},

Pages = {{5446-5494}},
Abstract = {{With the ever increasing demand for energy to meet the needs of growth
   in population and improvement in the living standards in particular in
   developing countries, the abundant unconventional oil reserves ( about
   70\% of total world oil), such as heavy oil, oil/tar sands and shale
   oil, are playing an increasingly important role in securing global
   energy supply. Compared with the conventional reserves unconventional
   oil reserves are characterized by extremely high viscosity and density,
   combined with complex chemistry. As a result, petroleum production from
   unconventional oil reserves is much more difficult and costly with more
   serious environmental impacts. As a key underpinning science,
   understanding the interfacial phenomena involved in unconventional
   petroleum production, such as oil liberation from host rocks, oil-water
   emulsions and demulsification, is critical for developing novel
   processes to improve oil production while reducing GHG emission and
   other environmental impacts at a lower operating cost. In the past
   decade, significant efforts and advances have been made in applying the
   principles of interfacial sciences to better understand complex
   unconventional oil-systems, while many environmental and production
   challenges remain. In this critical review, the recent research findings
   and progress in the interfacial sciences related to unconventional
   petroleum production are critically reviewed. In particular, the
   chemistry of unconventional oils, liberation mechanisms of oil from host
   rocks and mechanisms of emulsion stability and destabilization in
   unconventional oil production systems are discussed in detail. This
   review also seeks to summarize the current state-of-the-art
   characterization techniques and brings forward the challenges and
   opportunities for future research in this important field of physical
   chemistry and petroleum.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium nitride (GaN) is considered one of most important semiconductor
   materials for the 21st century due to its combination of properties
   (high breakdown field, high electron saturation velocity and mobility,
   and good thermal conductivity) that make it suitable for high power,
   high frequency and high temperature applications. In this paper we
   demonstrate a possible route for the deposition of single crystal GaN on
   sapphire at 275 degrees C using plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition.
   TEM images and electron diffraction show that the first 5 nm of growth
   is epitaxial then transitions to 3D growth. The films have a
   preferential (002) growth direction, and a small in-plane and
   out-of-plane misorientation. The refractive index, extinction
   coefficient, and optical band gap are on par with those of GaN films
   grown at higher temperatures. The films are p-type with a carrier
   concentration of 1.68 x 10(18) cm(-3) and hole mobility of 110 cm(2) V-1

   reconstructions by synchrotron Xray micro-tomography of several droplets
   reveal different morphologies in droplets of similar diameter and
   produced in the same batch. Moreover, microstructural features also
   indicate that the development of the dendrite arms occurs in some
   droplets along < 111 > crystallographic axes instead of the usual < 100

   been observed that such an unusual growth direction of the dendrites is
   directly related to the solidification velocity. We underpin these
   results by carrying out comparisons with a solidification model.
   Predictions are used to discuss the change of dendrite growth direction,
   as well as the existence of a dendrite growth direction range for a
   given type of droplets. In addition, the effect of the droplet size and
   the cooling gas on the dendrite growth direction range observed
   experimentally is also investigated by using the model.}},

Abstract = {{Mid-Infrared standoff spectroscopy using Quantum Cascade Lasers has been
   a focus of on-going research for many years. When attempting to detect
   trace analyte residues, the greatest challenge facing this technology is
   not in the lasers, but the difficulty in creating a spectroscopic
   background reference for an unknown surface. Such techniques as
   Differential Location Measurements fail when analyte concentrations are
   below 1 mu g/cm(2). To overcome this challenge of unknown surface
   backgrounds, we propose a technique to alter the IR absorption peaks of
   a target analyte by exposing the surface to a high intensity,
   alternating electric field in a standoff fashion. The high intensity
   electric field generates ozone radicals from the local air, oxidizing
   organic compounds on the surface. A spectrum of the surface before and
   after the ozone radicals is obtained. The ozone altered spectrum acts as
   the reference background and is compared against the un-altered
   spectrum, generating a differential signal used to identify the target
   analyte.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium nitride films were deposited via plasma-enhanced atomic layer
   deposition (PEALD) using triethylgallium and forming gas as precursors.
   An optimized process was developed and the effect of growth temperature
   on the structure and optical properties of the films investigated.
   In-depth X-ray diffraction analyses show that there is a critical
   temperature, below which the films are amorphous. Raising the growth
   temperature above the critical temperature increases the grain size of
   the polycrystalline film, while degrading the degree of preferred
   orientation. Azimuthal XRD scans show clear signs of a crystallographic
   relationship between the (002) planes of the sapphire substrate and GaN.
   Growth rate shows a steady rise until a rapid jump at 425 degrees C
   occurs. The study of the surface profile by AFM shows that the hillocks
   on the surface start to grow in diameter as well as height, increasing
   the total growth front area. This also decreases the surface roughness.
   XRR studies reveal that mass density reaches its maximum value at 240
   degrees C, and is stable after that. Carrier mobility is increased by
   two orders of magnitude, when the growth temperature is raised from 150
   degrees C to 425 degrees C. As expected, a similar but reverse trend was
   observed for the electrical resistivity. Refractive index follows the
   trends of mass density and crystal quality with a clear increase at the
   onset of crystallinity. Overall, the surface profile and the engineering
   properties improve as growth temperature is increased. At the high end
   of the growth temperature range, PEALD GaN films grown on (002) sapphire
   were p-type with a hole mobility of 575 cm(2) V-1 s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Partitioning of 11 globular proteins was examined in aqueous
   dextran-PEG-sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (0.01 M K/NaPB, pH 7.4)
   two-phase systems (ATPSs) containing 0.5 M sorbitol. The data obtained
   were analyzed together with those reported previously for the same
   proteins in osmolyte-free ATPS and ATPS containing 0.5 M sucrose, TMAO,
   or trehalose. It was found that all the partition coefficients for
   proteins determined in the presence of 0.5 M of different osmolytes and
   in the absence of osmolytes may be described in terms of the differences
   between solvent properties of the coexisting phases. Solute-specific
   coefficients characterizing different types of solute-solvent
   interactions were calculated for each protein. These solute-specific
   coefficients are linearly interrelated implying cooperativity of
   different types of protein-water interactions. The data obtained
   indicate the lack of any association of the aforementioned osmolytes at
   concentration of 0.5 M with proteins. Computational analysis of one of
   the solute-specific coefficient Ss-values characterizing dipole-dipole
   protein-water interactions shows that it is determined by the
   peculiarities of protein surface.}},

Abstract = {{Many industrial systems such as aircrafts, ships, manufacturing systems,
   etc. are required to perform several missions with finite breaks between
   missions. Maintenance is only available within the breaks. Due to the
   limitation of resources, all components in the system may not be
   maintained as desired. The selective maintenance problem helps the
   decision makers figure out what critical components to select and how to
   perform maintenance on these components. This paper studies the
   selective maintenance for multi-state series-parallel systems with the
   benefit of repairing multiple components simultaneously. Both time and
   cost savings can be acquired when several components are simultaneously
   repaired in a selective maintenance strategy. As the number of repaired
   components increases, the saved time and cost will also increase due to
   the share of setting up between components and another additional
   reduction amount from the repair of multiple identical components. A
   non-linear optimization model is developed to find the most reliable
   system subjected to time and cost constraints. Genetic algorithm is used
   to solve the optimization model. An illustrative example will be
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{A unique structure of graphene-wrapped mesoporous single crystals (MSCs)
   of MnCO3 has been successfully synthesized and used as the anode for
   lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In a departure from previous
   high-temperature (> 500 degrees C) synthesis approaches to MSCs, we have
   developed a simple, low-temperature (70 degrees C) and template-free
   method, referred to as dynamic floating electrodeposition (DFE), to
   fabricate graphene-wrapped MnCO3 MSCs. In the DFE method, we achieved
   the reduction of GOs to RGOs, the deposition of MnCO3 MSCs on graphene,
   and a graphene-wrapped morphology, all three goals in one
   electrochemical process. The resulting submicron, graphene-wrapped MnCO3
   MSCs reached a high reversible capacity of 900 mA h g(-1) after the
   initial cycle and delivered over 1000 mA h g(-1) after 130 cycles. The
   reversible capacity also remained at this high level for more than 400
   cycles, and maintained 422 mA h g(-1) at a high rate of 5000 mA g(-1).
   It is the first time that this high performance has been achieved using
   MnCO3 for lithium-ion storage. Furthermore, this superior
   electrochemical performance was found to be highly related to the
   designed structure, graphene-wrapped MSCs, of MnCO3.}},

Abstract = {{Preparation of thin film composite (TFC) polyamide (PA) membranes by
   interfacial polymerization (IP) reaction is remarkably sensitive to the
   interactions between synthesis parameters. Here we report the effect of
   the simultaneous change in four synthesis parameters, namely monomers
   concentrations (m-phenylenediamine, MPD, and trimesoyl chloride, TMC),
   reaction time and curing temperature, on the surface morphology and on
   the permeation properties of TFC membranes. By varying several synthesis
   parameters at the same time using a Taguchi robust design (L9 orthogonal
   arrays), it was found that monomers concentration and curing temperature
   significantly affected water permeation by creating a substantial change
   in morphology of the PA films. More importantly, a strong interaction
   between monomers concentration was observed, which demonstrates the
   importance of smart adjustment of these parameters in the preparation
   process. Permeation properties were justified by thickness and by the
   cross-link density of the synthesized films; the latter was found to be
   more influential. Based on analysis of variance (ANOVA), the
   contribution of the synthesis parameters towards change in water
   permeation was determined as: curing temperature (40.7\%) > MPD
   concentration (28\%) similar to TMC concentration (27.8\%) > reaction
   time (1.9\%). The findings will provide valuable guidelines to develop
   practical low cost, robust and high performance membranes by changing
   the curing temperature and the monomer concentrations as critical
   parameters.}},

Title = {{Electron Transport, Trapping and Recombination in Anodic TiO2 Nanotube
   Arrays}},
Journal = {{CURRENT NANOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{593-614}},
Abstract = {{Anodically synthesized TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) constitute an
   exciting ordered large bandgap semiconductor nanoarchitecture for use as
   scaffolds and active layers for solutionprocessable devices including
   but not limited to, optoelectronic sensors, photovoltaics,
   photodetectors, photocatalysts and photoelectrochemical cells. Charge
   transport, trapping and recombination are key attributes of the material
   architecture that significantly influence the properties and performance
   of the resulting optoelectronic devices, thus motivating this review
   article. Since nanocrystalline mesoporous TiO2 films (np-TiO2) are
   actively researched for the same applications, in many cases, TNTAs and
   np-TiO2 are direct competitors and it is therefore meaningful to compare
   the optoelectronic properties of the two architectures head-to-head. In
   addition, there exists a whole host of TNTA-specific applications such
   as bottom-up fabricated photonic crystals, bulk heterojunction organic
   solar cells and metallodielectric metamaterials that leverage the
   ordered channel architecture. Recent studies have established the order
   of magnitude superior recombination lifetimes in sensitized TNTAs as
   compared to sensitized np-TiO2 as well as the salutary effect of lower
   structural disorder in TNTAs resulting in trap-free electron diffusion
   coefficients approaching those of single crystals and two orders of
   magnitude larger than np-TiO2. Photoconductivity measurements using
   bandgap illumination in both single nanotubes and nanotube ensembles
   have resulted in similar values of the mobility-lifetime product
   (10(-5)-10(-4) cm(2)V(-1)), which are four to six orders of magnitude
   higher than in nanoparticle electrodes. At the same time, TiO2 nanotubes
   have a larger trap density and a greater average trap-depth than
   nanoparticulate TiO2 films, pointing to the importance of synthesis
   modification to improve material quality and post-synthesis techniques
   for trap passivation.}},

Abstract = {{To date, most investigations of Ni-Fe bimetallic catalysts for solid
   oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have focused on materials with micro-scale
   particle sizes, which severely restrict their catalytic activity. In
   this study, we fabricated a Ni-and/or Fe-doped A-site-deficient LaSrCrO3
   perovskite (A-LSC) bimetallic anode material on which the in situ
   exsolution of uniformly dispersed nano Ni, Fe and Ni-Fe alloy with an
   average particle size of 25 to 30 nm was facilitated by the introduction
   of A-site deficiency under a reducing atmosphere. The dopants were shown
   to significantly enhance the electrical conductivity of the material by
   many orders of magnitude. Further characterization of the bimetallic
   material showed that the addition of Fe changed the reduction behavior
   and increased the amount of oxygen vacancies in the material. Fuel cell
   performance tests demonstrated that the prepared bimetallic anode
   catalyst with a highly catalytically active nano Ni-Fe alloy promoted
   the electrochemical performance in 5000 ppm H2S-syngas and improved the
   carbon deposition resistance compared to a monometallic anode catalyst.}},

Title = {{Numerical Simulation of Vibration Deflection Effects on the Energy
   Efficiency of Ultrasonic Transducer for Sonochemistry}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The energy efficiency of ultrasound transducers for sonochemistry
   applications was studied from the point of view of vibration deflection
   effects of different transducer structures, including the configurations
   of rectangular plate, cylindrical shell, triangular strip array,
   rectangular strip array, and pentagonal strip array. It was found that
   the deflections are not uniform over the transducer surface with the
   maximum deflection locating at the geometry center of transducers. The
   simulated maximum deflection of rectangular plate results in the value
   of 2.5 x 10(-16), which is larger than the maximum deflection of
   cylindrical shell with the value of 2 x 10(-16). This finding suggests
   that the envelope deflection volume of two transducers has significant
   difference, which has been neglected in the design and selection of
   ultrasound transducer. For this reason, a quantitative index involving
   the envelope deflection volume was proposed to compare the efficiency of
   ultrasound transducers. Based on the simulation results, the triangular
   strip array transducer structure with higher ultrasound generation
   efficiency was proposed, which was also theoretically validated by the
   MATLAB simulation.}},

Title = {{Active and passive flow control on a precessing jet}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A precessing jet nozzle with water as the working fluid is investigated
   under passive and active flow control. The actuation effectiveness of 12
   microjets around the nozzle inlet for active control of the precessing
   jet is the focus of this work. Passive control is also applied by
   modifying the geometry of the precessing jet either by adding a center
   body near the chamber exit or varying the chamber length. The flow
   behavior under control is studied using pressure measurement at the
   chamber exit plane to monitor jet precession. The pressure data are
   analyzed using a phase plane representation to determine the motion of
   the jets high-velocity region in the chamber exit plane. The standard
   deviation of the phase of the triggered pressure data is used for
   stability analysis. This analysis results in a phase diagram in terms of
   Reynolds number and actuation frequency. Active control can be utilized
   over a range of actuation frequencies (and corresponding Strouhal
   numbers) to control precession direction and stability which can be
   further enhanced with passive control mechanisms. However, the flow
   follows the actuation with the lowest variation when the active
   actuation matches with the natural Strouhal number (0.002 < St < 0.006)
   of the nozzle jet flow.}},

Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For some geotechnical design projects where soils are exposed to dynamic
   loads (vibrations), it becomes necessary to evaluate the strength and
   deformation characteristics of the soil under existing and/or
   anticipated vibrations. In order to investigate the effect of the
   vibrations on the strength and deformation properties of soils,
   representative samples should be collected and tested in laboratories
   and subjected to vibration of expected magnitudes. In this case, it is
   important that the laboratory equipment used is able to simulate field
   conditions as close as possible to provide the necessary parameters that
   can successfully be used in the design. A vibrational direct shear
   apparatus has been developed based on the conventional direct shear
   apparatus to evaluate the strength and deformation characteristics of
   soils (granular and cohesive) under a wide range of vibrational
   accelerations and frequencies. The apparatus makes it possible to test
   soils in both stress and displacement controlled modes. The design of
   the apparatus is such that it allows modification of the most commonly
   used direct shear apparatuses into the vibrational ones. The new
   apparatus was built and tested to prove its performance and reliability.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with a fundamental issue of time series
   representation for modeling and prediction with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. We
   introduce two distinct time series representation schemes for Fuzzy
   Cognitive Map design. First method is based on time series amplitude,
   amplitude change, and change of amplitude change (dynamics perspective).
   Second scheme is based on three consecutive historical observations:
   present value, past value and before past value (history perspective).
   Introduced procedures are experimentally verified and compared on
   several synthetic and real-world time series of various characteristics.
   The history-oriented time series representation turned out to be more
   advantageous. Quality of FCM-based time series models and one-step-ahead
   predictions were measured in terms of Mean Squared Error. We have shown
   that models designed with history-oriented time series representation
   generally require less FCM nodes to be of comparable quality as models
   built on dynamics-oriented time series representation. As a result, with
   the history-oriented time series representation scheme we are able to
   construct simpler and therefore better models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we outline some of the manufacturing advantages and
   challenges of working with thermoplastic elastomers as an alternative to
   traditional polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) for flexible and reversibly
   bonded microfluidic systems. Unlike PDMS, thermoplastic elastomers can
   be processed with many industrial polymer manufacturing technologies
   such as extrusion, injection molding, hot embossing and others,
   potentially permitting much more scalable production and cheaper costs
   per part. Unlike a more rigid thermoplastic, these thermoplastic
   elastomers are typically much easier to bond, either reversibly or
   permanently due to their inherent compliance and subsequent low
   pressures necessary to seal channels and reservoirs. Unlike PDMS
   however, where one material (Sylgard 184) dominates the literature,
   there have not been many in depth investigations into thermoplastic
   elastomers and their relative performance and applicability to
   microfabrication. We show a comparison between several categories of
   thermoplastic elastomer to demonstrate what issues may be encountered
   and to demonstrate that even for labs with minimal equipment, academic
   prototyping with these materials is not necessarily any more challenging

Abstract = {{It has previously been shown that photoacoustic imaging can interrogate
   lifetimes of exogenous agents by a sequence of pulses with varying
   pump-probe delay intervals. Rather than attempt to unmix molecules based
   on their composite lifetime profile, we introduce a technique called
   lifetime weighted imaging, which preferentially weights signals from
   chromophores with long lifetimes (including exogenous contrast agents
   such as methylene blue and porphyrins with microsecond-scale lifetimes)
   while nulling chromophores with short lifetimes (including hemoglobin
   with ps-nsscale lifetimes). A probe beam is used to interrogate samples
   with or without a pump beam. By subtracting probebeam photoacoustic
   signals with pump-from those without a pump excitation, we effectively
   eliminate probe signals from chromophores with short lifetimes while
   preserving excited-state photoacoustic signals from long-lifetimes. This
   differential signal will be weighted by a decaying exponential function
   of the pump-probe delay divided by the exogenous agent lifetime. This
   technique enabled the imaging of both triplet excited state lifetime and
   ground-state recovery lifetime. We demonstrate the oxygen-dependent
   lifetime of both methylene blue and porphyrins. Lifetimeweighted imaging
   could be used for photodynamic therapy dosimetry guidance, oxygen
   sensing, or other molecular imaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the first time a widely tunable MOPA (Master Oscillator
   Power Amplifier) laser system for Optical resolution photoacoustic
   microscopy (OR-PAM). This unique laser is capable of tuning the
   repetition rate (0.1-120MHz), the wavelength (1030-1080nm), the
   pulse-width (100ps-5ns) and power (up to 1.1W). It is also capable of
   programmable dithering and synchronization with other laser systems to
   within similar to ps jitter. To apply it to OR-PAM we take advantage of
   frequency doubling to convert IR light into green light. For doubling, a
   periodically poled magnesium doped lithium niobate (MgO:LiNbO3) crystal
   was chosen. Wavelength tuning was accomplished by tuning the output
   wavelength of the MOPA then tuning the temperature of the MgO:LiNbO3
   crystal to generate tunable visible light. Characterization of the
   system performance revealed a lateral resolution of similar to 7 mu m
   and a SNR of similar to 21dB when imaging 7 mu m carbon fibers.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic drug resistance is a major worldwide issue. Development of
   new therapies against pathogenic bacteria requires appropriate research
   tools for replicating and characterizing infections. Previously
   fluorescence and bioluminescence modalities have been used to image
   infectious burden in animal models but scattering significantly limits
   imaging depth and resolution. We hypothesize that photoacoustic imaging,
   which has improved depth-toresolution ratio, could be useful for
   visualizing MelA-expressing bacteria since MelA is a bacterial
   tyrosinase homologue involved in melanin production. Using an inducible
   expression system, E. coli expressing MelA were visibly black in liquid
   culture. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), MelA-expressing bacteria (at
   different dilutions in PBS), and chicken embryo blood were injected in
   plastic tubes which were imaged using a VisualSonics Vevo LAZR system.
   Photoacoustic imaging at 6 different wavelengths (680, 700, 750, 800,
   850 and 900nm) enabled spectral de-mixing to distinguish melanin signals
   from blood. The signal to noise ratio of 9x diluted MelA bacteria was
   55, suggesting that similar to 20 bacteria cells could be detected with
   our system. When MelA bacteria were injected as a 100 mu L bolus into a
   chicken embryo, photoacoustic signals from deoxy- and oxy- hemoglobin as
   well as MelA-expressing bacteria could be separated and overlaid on an
   ultrasound image, allowing visualization of the bacterial location.
   Photoacoustic imaging may be a useful tool for visualizing bacterial
   infections and further work incorporating photoacoustic reporters into
   infectious bacterial strains is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical deposition is widely used to enhance the performance of
   perovskite anodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). However, the
   anodes thus produced still have unsatisfactory activity and experience
   reproducibility problems. For the first time, this paper reports that
   the in situ exsolution of nano-Ni could be facilitated on Ni-doped
   (La0.7Sr0.3)CrO3 (LSCNi) anodes with A-site deficiency, showing a
   maximum power density of 460 mW cm(-2) in 5000 ppm H2S-H-2 compared to
   only 135 mW cm(-2) of fuel cells with stoichiometric LSCNi. Besides, the
   fuel cell also demonstrates desirable redox stability in sour fuel. The
   introduction of A-site deficiency can help the formation of highly
   mobile oxygen vacancies and remarkably enhance the reducibility of Ni
   nano-particles, thus significantly increasing electronic conductivity
   and catalytic activity simultaneously. Such fabricated perovskite has
   the potential to be decorated with diverse nano-active particles for a
   wide range of applications in industrial fields.}},

Abstract = {{It has been challenging to modify primary cells with non-viral gene
   delivery. Herein, we developed a ternary nano-formulation for gene
   delivery to umbilical cord blood and bone marrow derived mesenchymal
   stem cells (MSC) by using lipid-modified small (1.2 kDa) molecular
   weight polyethylenimine (PEI1.2). Linoleic acid (LA) was end-capped with
   carboxyl functionality by coupling with mercaptopropionic acid through
   thio-ester linkage, and then grafted onto PEI1.2 via N-acylation. The
   thio-ester LA grafted PEI1.2 (PEI-tLA) displayed a significantly lower
   (up to 6-fold) DNA binding capability and a higher propensity to
   dissociate upon polyanionic challenge. The dissociation ability of the
   complexes was further enhanced by incorporating hyaluronic acid (HA)
   into plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexes of PEI-tLA. The HA incorporation
   influenced the surface charge of complexes more so than the hydrodynamic
   size, but it clearly increased the propensity for dissociation upon a
   polyanionic challenge. The PEI-tLAs were less toxic on MSC and displayed
   significantly higher transgene expression in MSC than conventional
   PEI-LA. Ternary complexes of with HA (pDNA/HA = 2, w/w) further enhanced
   the efficiency of PEI-tLAs of low (B2 lipid/PEI) lipid substitution,
   which was comparable to or higher than commercial transfection reagents.
   We conclude that PEI-tLA of low lipid substitution can be employed as a
   gene carrier to design supersensitive nano-formulations.}},

Abstract = {{Attachment of single cells via hemifusion of cellular membranes using
   femtosecond laser pulses is reported in this manuscript. This is a
   method to attach single cells using sub-10 femtosecond laser pulses,
   with 800 nm central wavelength delivered from a Ti: Sapphire laser is
   described. A fluorescent dye, Calcein AM, was used to verify that the
   cell's cytoplasm did not migrate from a dyed cell to a non-dyed cell, in
   order to ascertain that the cells did not go through cell-fusion
   process. An optical tweezer was used in order to assess the mechanical
   integrity of the attached joint membranes. Hemifusion of cellular
   membranes was successful without initiating full cell fusion. Attachment
   efficiency of 95\% was achieved, while the cells' viability was
   preserved. The attachment was performed via the delivery of one to two
   trains of sub-10 femtosecond laser pulses lasting 15 milliseconds each.
   An ultrafast reversible destabilization of the phospholipid molecules in
   the cellular membranes was induced due to a laser-induced ionization
   process. The inner phospholipid cell membrane remained intact during the
   attachment procedure, and cells' cytoplasm remained isolated from the
   surrounding medium. The unbounded inner phospholipid molecules bonded to

Abstract = {{We present the detailed investigation of an ultrafast silicon based
   nanoplasmonic three terminal device. The device operates on the
   principle of ponderomotive acceleration of two-photon absorption
   generated electrons within a nanoplasmonic waveguide structure. Due to
   high spatial mode confinement, high spatial asymmetry, and high
   enhancement of the nanoplasmonic electric field, electrons are
   accelerated to high kinetic energies and are directed towards the copper
   anode generating an output current. Application of a negative grid
   voltage modulates an effective energy barrier that restricts the number
   of electrons reaching the anode, thus reducing the output current.
   Operating at electric field strengths up to 1x10(7) V/cm generates a 150
   fs output current pulse of 628 mA/mu m. Careful consideration of the
   materials used facilitates monolithic integration with current
   complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor nanoelectronics devices.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo models are widely used to model light transport in turbid
   media, however their results implicitly contain stochastic variations.
   These fluctuations are not ideal, especially for inverse problems where
   Jacobian matrix errors can lead to large uncertainties upon matrix
   inversion. Yet Monte Carlo approaches are more computationally favorable
   than solving the full Radiative Transport Equation. Here, a
   non-stochastic computational method of estimating fluence distributions
   in turbid media is proposed, which is called the Non-Stochastic
   Propagation by Iterative Radiance Evaluation method (NSPIRE). Rather
   than using stochastic means to determine a random walk for each photon
   packet, the propagation of light from any element to all other elements
   in a grid is modelled simultaneously. For locally homogeneous
   anisotropic turbid media, the matrices used to represent scattering and
   projection are shown to be block Toeplitz, which leads to computational
   simplifications via convolution operators. To evaluate the accuracy of
   the algorithm, 2D simulations were done and compared against Monte Carlo
   models for the cases of an isotropic point source and a pencil beam
   incident on a semi-infinite turbid medium. The model was shown to have a
   mean percent error less than 2\%. The algorithm represents a new
   paradigm in radiative transport modelling and may offer a non-stochastic
   alternative to modeling light transport in anisotropic scattering media
   for applications where the diffusion approximation is insufficient.}},

Abstract = {{Alberta is Canada's largest oil producer, and its oil sands deposits
   comprise 30\% of the world's oil reserves. The process of bitumen
   extraction and upgrading releases trace gases and aerosols to the
   atmosphere. In this study we present satellite-based analysis to
   explore, for the first time, various contributing factors that affect
   tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) levels over Alberta. The multispectral
   product that uses both near-infrared (NIR) and the thermal-infrared
   (TIR) radiances for CO retrieval from the Measurements of Pollution in
   the Troposphere (MOPITT) is examined for the 12-year period from 2002 to
   2013. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal
   anomaly product from 2001 to 2013 is employed to investigate the
   seasonal and temporal variations in forest fires. Additionally, in situ
   CO measurements at industrial and urban sites are compared to satellite
   data. Furthermore, the available MOZAIC/IAGOS (Measurement of Ozone,
   Water Vapor, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Oxide by Airbus In-Service
   Aircraft/In service Aircraft for Global Observing System) aircraft CO
   profiles (April 2009-December 2011) are used to validate MOPITT CO data.
   The climatological time curtain plot and spatial maps for CO over
   northern Alberta indicate the signatures of transported CO for two
   distinct biomass burning seasons: summer and spring. Distinct seasonal
   patterns of CO at the urban sites (Edmonton and Calgary) point to the
   strong influence of traffic. Meteorological parameters play an important
   role in the CO spatial distribution at various pressure levels. Northern
   Alberta shows a stronger upward lifting motion which leads to larger CO
   total column values, while the poor dispersion in central and southern
   Alberta exacerbates the surface CO pollution. Interannual variations in
   satellite data depict a slightly decreasing trend for both regions,
   while the decline trend is more evident from ground observations,
   especially at the urban sites. MOPITT CO vertical averages and
   MOZAIC/IAGOS aircraft profiles were in good agreement within the
   standard deviations at all pressure levels. There is consistency between
   the time evolution of high-CO episodes monitored by satellite and ground
   measurements and the fire frequency peak time, which implies that
   biomass burning has affected the tropospheric CO distribution in
   northern Alberta. These findings have further demonstrated the potential
   use of the MOPITT V5 multispectral (NIR + TIR) product for assessing a
   complicated surface process.}},

Abstract = {{Marine microfossils provide a useful record of the Earth's resources and
   prehistory via biostratigraphy. To study hydrocarbon reservoirs and
   prehistoric climate, geoscientists visually identify the species of
   microfossils found in core samples. Because microfossil identification
   is labour intensive, automation has been investigated since the 1980s.
   With the initial rule-based systems, users still had to examine each
   specimen under a microscope. While artificial neural network systems
   showed more promise for reducing expert labour, they also did not
   displace manual identification for a variety of reasons, which we aim to
   overcome. In our human-based computation approach, the most difficult
   step, namely taxon identification is outsourced via a frontend website
   to human volunteers. A backend algorithm, called dynamic hierarchical
   identification, uses unsupervised, supervised, and dynamic learning to
   accelerate microfossil identification. Unsupervised learning clusters
   specimens so that volunteers need not identify every specimen during
   supervised learning. Dynamic learning means interim computation outputs
   prioritize subsequent human inputs. Using a dataset of microfossils
   identified by an expert, we evaluated correct and incorrect genus and
   species rates versus simulated time, where each specimen identification
   defined a moment. The proposed algorithm accelerated microfossil
   identification effectively, especially compared to benchmark results
   obtained using a k-nearest neighbour method.}},

Title = {{Efficient Multiway Relaying for Data Sharing in Energy Harvesting Sensor
   Networks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SENSORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{In a wireless sensor network (WSN), sensors often need to share their
   measurements for applications like distributed estimation and detection
   or data aggregation. Here, we suggest using multiway relaying (MWR) for
   data sharing between energy harvesting sensors that cannot directly
   communicate with each other. We first start by studying the achievable
   data rate of amplify-and-forward (AF) MWR for energy harvesting sensors.
   Then, we show that, by backing off the transmit power at the sensors,
   not only better energy efficiency and longer lifetime are achieved, but
   also the data sharing rate increases. Based on this result, we further
   improve the performance of AF MWR in the assumed WSN by smartly
   adjusting the transmit power at the sensors. Our power allocation is
   devised in a way to improve the energy efficiency of MWR and increase
   the sum rate of data sharing between the sensors over the network
   lifetime. Simulation results are presented to verify the enhancement
   achieved by using our proposed power allocation technique.}},

   for removal of methylene blue}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{41}},
Pages = {{32272-32282}},
Abstract = {{A polyacrylic acid (PAA) functionalized magnetic Fe3O4
   nanoparticle-graphene oxide nanocomposite (PAA/MGO) was synthesized by a
   facile method. The structure and surface properties of MGO and PAA/MGO
   composites were characterized by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HRTEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and zeta potential
   measurements. The adsorption of a model dye pollutant, methylene blue
   (MB), on MGO and PAA/MGO was investigated in batch tests. The
   functionalization of PAA to MGO significantly enhances the maximum
   adsorption capacity of MB (at pH = 7) from similar to 70 mg g(-1) (on
   MGO) to similar to 291 mg g(-1) (PAA/MGO). The adsorption of MB on MGO
   and PAA/MGO was mainly driven by the electrostatic attraction between
   positively charged MB molecules and negatively charged nanocomposite
   surfaces, and the higher adsorption capacity of PAA/MGO is mainly
   attributed to the functionalization of PAA and its higher content of
   charged carboxyl groups than MGO. The adsorption capacity of MB on both
   MGO and PAA/MGO adsorbents also increases with increasing solution pH
   from 3 to 11, due to enhanced electrostatic attraction at high pH
   conditions. The limited adsorption capacity of MB on MGO and PAA/MGO at
   pH 3, when electrostatic attraction is almost negligible, indicates that
   pi-pi interaction between the GO surface and MB also plays a role in the
   adsorption process. The PAA/MGO shows a rapid adsorption rate and high
   adsorption capacity of MB with magnetic properties for easy separation
   and excellent recyclability, which endows the nanocomposite with great
   potential for the removal of cationic organic pollutants in wastewater
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the effect of activated carbon preparation
   conditions on their adsorption performance. Pinewood and wheat straw
   were used as source materials to prepare activated carbon via a fast
   activation process using KOH and microwave heating. The iodine numbers
   and carbon yields were determined to evaluate the adsorption properties
   of the activated carbon. The effects of various KOH/char mass ratios,
   particle sizes, humidity levels, and microwave heating times on the
   physical characteristics of the activated carbon were investigated. The
   iodine number and yield and SEM images were used to characterize the
   activated carbon. Small particle sizes, the presence of humidity in the
   purge gas, and high KOH/char ratios resulted in higher iodine numbers.
   The best activated carbons were obtained using a KOH/char ratio of 3.0,
   a microwave power of 600 W, a radiation time of 30 min, and a particle
   size of 0.1 to 0.42 mm in a humid environment; these carbons showed
   iodine numbers of 2208 mg/g (pinewood activated carbon) and 1420 mg/g
   (wheat straw activated carbon), with carbon yields of 73\% and 52\%,
   respectively. Longer microwave heating times increased the iodine
   number. The iodine numbers and yields of the pinewood activated carbons
   were much higher than those of their wheat straw counterparts.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},

Pages = {{941-955}},
Abstract = {{This is the first report of a hybrid sodium ion capacitor (NIC) with the
   active materials in both the anode and the cathode being derived
   entirely from a single precursor: peanut shells, which are a green and
   highly economical waste globally generated at over 6 million tons per
   year. The electrodes push the envelope of performance, delivering among
   the most promising sodiation capacity-rate capability-cycling retention
   combinations reported in the literature for each materials class. Hence
   the resultant NIC also offers a state-of-the-art cyclically stable
   combination of energy and power, not only in respect to previously but
   also as compared to Li ion capacitors (LICs). The ion adsorption cathode
   based on Peanut Shell Nanosheet Carbon (PSNC) displays a hierarchically
   porous architecture, a sheet-like morphology down to 15 nm in thickness,
   a surface area on par with graphene materials (up to 2396 m(2) g(-1))
   and high levels of oxygen doping (up to 13.51 wt\%). Scanned from
   1.5-4.2 V vs. Na/Na+ PSNC delivers a specific capacity of 161 mA h g(-1)
   at 0.1 A g(-1) and 73 mA h g(-1) at 25.6 A g(-1). A low surface area
   Peanut Shell Ordered Carbon (PSOC) is employed as an ion intercalation
   anode. PSOC delivers a total capacity of 315 mA h g(-1) with a flat
   plateau of 181 mA h g(-1) occurring below 0.1 V (tested at 0.1 A g(-1)),
   and is stable at 10 000 cycles (tested at 3.2 A g(-1)). The assembled
   NIC operates within a wide temperature range (0-65 degrees C), yielding
   at room temperature (by active mass) 201, 76 and 50 W h kg(-1) at 285,
   8500 and 16 500 W kg(-1), respectively. At 1.5-3.5 V, the hybrid device
   achieved 72\% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles tested at 6.4 A
   g(-1), and 88\% after 100 000 cycles at 51.2 A g(-1).}},

Title = {{Demonstration of the CPMA-Electrometer System for Calibrating Black
   Carbon Particulate Mass Instruments}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{152-158}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to improve regulations for particulate emissions from
   aircraft engines, the Aircraft Exhaust Emissions Measurement Committee,
   SAE E-31, is investigating instruments to measure black carbon mass
   concentration in real time. The current candidates are a laser-induced
   incandescence instrument (LII 300) and a photo-acoustic Micro-Soot
   Sensor (MSS). However, both of these instruments use indirect
   techniques, measuring parameters other than the actual mass of
   particulate in the exhaust, and therefore require calibration.
   Previously, it has been shown that a centrifugal particle mass analyzer
   (CPMA) can be used in conjunction with an aerosol electrometer to
   traceably generate an aerosol with known mass concentration. This system
   can be used to rapidly calibrate particle mass instruments (on the order
   of minutes), without the time-consuming process of filter sampling,
   which is often used for calibration and prone to sampling artifacts.
   Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of the CPMA-electrometer system for
   calibrating two LII 300 instruments and two MSS instruments, which were
   calibrated to the NIOSH 5040 standard. The correlations between the
   CPMA-electrometer system and the challenge instrument were highly linear
   for both the LII and the MSS, and agreed well with the previous
   calibration. All four instruments were found to correlate with the
   CPMA-electrometer system with R-2 values of 0.993 to 0.999. The standard
   uncertainty in the CPMA-electrometer system averaged 4.3\% and was as
   low as 2.6\% for some measurements. With a simple improvement to the
   aerosol electrometer, we estimate this average uncertainty would be less
   than 3\%. This lower uncertainty and much higher speed of measurement
   support the use of the CPMA-electrometer system as a mass measurement
   calibration method for black carbon instruments.}},

Title = {{Characterizing the effects of amplitude, frequency and limb position on
   vibration induced movement illusions: Implications in sensory-motor
   rehabilitation}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Strategic vibration of musculotendinous regions of a limb
   elicits illusionary sensations of movement. As a rehabilitation
   technique, this `kinesthetic illusion' has demonstrated beneficial
   results for numerous sensory-motor disorders. However, literature shows
   little consistency in the vibration parameters or body positioning used,
   and their effects have yet to be comprehensively investigated.
   OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effects of the vibration amplitude,
   frequency, and limb position on the kinesthetic illusion.
   METHODS: Movement illusions were induced in 12 participants' biceps and
   triceps. The effect of amplitude (0.1 to 0.5 mm), frequency (70 to 110
   Hz), and two limb positions were quantified on the strength of illusion
   (SOI), range of motion (ROM) and velocity.
   RESULTS: Amplitude significantly affected the illusionary SOI, ROM and
   velocity in the biceps and triceps (p < 0.05). Increasing amplitude
   resulted in an increase of all three output variables. Limb position
   showed an effect on illusionary velocity in the biceps as well as ROM
   and velocity in the triceps (p < 0.05). Frequency demonstrated no
   statistical effect.
   CONCLUSIONS: Amplitude demonstrated the most profound impact on the
   kinesthetic illusion in the experimental ranges tested. This work may
   help guide clinicians and researchers in selecting appropriate vibratory
   parameters and body positions to consistently elicit and manipulate the
   kinesthetic illusion.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between an anionic surfactant, viz., sodium
   dodecylbenzenesulfonate and nonionic surfactants with different
   secondary ethoxylated chain length, viz., Tergitol 15-S-12, Tergitol
   15-S-9, and Tergitol 15-S-7 have been studied in the present article. An
   attempt has also been made to investigate the effect of ethoxylated
   chain length on the micellar and the thermodynamic properties of the
   mixed surfactant systems. The micellar properties like critical micelle
   concentration (CMC), micellar composition (X-A), interaction parameter
   (beta), and the activity coefficients (f(A) and f(NI)) have been
   evaluated using Rubingh's regular solution theory. In addition to
   micellar studies, thermodynamic parameters like the surface pressure
   (Pi(CMC)), surface excess values (Gamma(CMC)), average area of the
   monomers at the air-water interface (A(avg)), free energy of
   micellization (Delta G(m)), minimum energy at the air-water interface
   (G(min)), etc., have also been calculated. It has been found that in
   mixtures of anionic and nonionic secondary ethoxylated surfactants, a
   surfactant containing a smaller ethoxylated chain is favored
   thermodynamically. Additionally, the adsorption of nonionic species on
   air/water interface and micelle increases with decreasing secondary
   ethoxylated chain length. Dynamic light scattering and viscometric
   studies have also been performed to study the interactions between
   anionic and nonionic surfactants used.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{We employed a glucose mediated hydrothermal self-assembly method to
   create a SnO2-carbon nanocomposite with promising electrochemical
   performance as both a sodium and a lithium ion battery anode (NIBs NABs
   SIBs, LIBs), being among the best in terms of cyclability and rate
   capability when tested against Na. In parallel we provide a systematic
   side-by-side comparison of the sodiation vs. lithiation phase
   transformations in nano SnO2. The high surface area (338 m(2) g(-1))
   electrode is named C-SnO2, and consists of a continuous Li and Na active
   carbon frame with internally imbedded sub-5 nm SnO2 crystallites of high
   mass loading (60 wt\%). The frame imparts excellent electrical
   conductivity to the electrode, allows for rapid diffusion of Na and Li
   ions, and carries the sodiation/lithiation stresses while preventing
   cycling-induced agglomeration of the individual crystals. C-SnO2
   employed as a NIB anode displays a reversible capacity of 531 mA h g(-1)
   (at 0.08 A g(-1)) with 81\% capacity retention after 200 cycles, while
   capacities of 240, 188 and 133 mA h g(-1) are achieved at the much
   higher rates of 1.3, 2.6 and 5 A g(-1). As a LIB anode C-SnO2 maintains
   a capacity of 1367 mA h g(-1) (at 0.5 A g(-1)) after 400 cycles, and 420
   mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1). Combined TEM, XRD and XPS prove that the much
   lower capacity of SnO2 as a NIB anode is due to the kinetic difficulty
   of the Na-Sn alloying reaction to reach the terminal Na15Sn4
   intermetallic, whereas for Li-Sn the Li22Sn5 intermetallic is readily
   formed at 0.01 V. Rather, with applied voltage a significant portion of
   the material effectively shuffles between SnO2 and beta-Sn + NaO2. The
   conversion reaction proceeds differently in the two systems: LiO2 is
   reduced directly to SnO2 and Li, whereas the NaO2 to SnO2 reaction
   proceeds through an intermediate SnO phase.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{7564-7575}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid materials formed by DNA and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown
   very interesting properties, but their simulation in solution using
   quantum mechanical approaches is still a challenge in the computational
   chemistry community. In this paper, we developed a QM:MM model to study
   the interactions between charged DNA nucleotides and carbon nanotubes in
   solution. All four types of DNA nucleotides were taken to interact with
   two CNTs of similar diameter but different chiralities: (4,4) and (7,0).
   The nucleotides and CNTs were treated at the QM level, while added water
   and neutralizing ions were modeled at the MM level. ONIOM simulations
   were performed at the (M06-2X/6-31G(d): Amber) level for the hybrids, as
   well as for individually solvated CNTs and nucleotides, which allowed us
   to evaluate the energy of binding. Our binding energy (BE) values range
   from 146.60 to 503.43 kJ mol(-1), indicating strong physisorption of
   nucleotides on CNTs. The relatively large BE, compared with past studies
   on nucleobase-CNT binding in a vacuum, could be due to the larger size
   of nucleotides compared with nucleobases, the charges on the
   nucleotides, and the inclusion of solution which causes the release of
   water molecules upon hybridization.}},

Title = {{Treating cancer stem cells and cancer metastasis using glucose-coated
   gold nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{2065-2077}},
Abstract = {{Cancer ranks among the leading causes of human mortality. Cancer becomes
   intractable when it spreads from the primary tumor site to various
   organs (such as bone, lung, liver, and then brain). Unlike solid tumor
   cells, cancer stem cells and metastatic cancer cells grow in a
   non-attached (suspension) form when moving from their source to other
   locations in the body. Due to the non-attached growth nature, metastasis
   is often first detected in the circulatory systems, for instance in a
   lymph node near the primary tumor. Cancer research over the past several
   decades has primarily focused on treating solid tumors, but targeted
   therapy to treat cancer stem cells and cancer metastasis has yet to be
   developed. Because cancers undergo faster metabolism and consume more
   glucose than normal cells, glucose was chosen in this study as a reagent
   to target cancer cells. In particular, by covalently binding gold
   nanoparticles (GNPs) with thio-PEG (polyethylene glycol) and
   thio-glucose, the resulting functionalized GNPs (Glu-GNPs) were created
   for targeted treatment of cancer metastasis and cancer stem cells.
   Suspension cancer cell THP-1 (human monocytic cell line derived from
   acute monocytic leukemia patients) was selected because it has
   properties similar to cancer stem cells and has been used as a
   metastatic cancer cell model for in vitro studies. To take advantage of
   cancer cells' elevated glucose consumption over normal cells, different
   starvation periods were screened in order to achieve optimal treatment
   effects. Cancer cells were then fed using Glu-GNPs followed by X-ray
   irradiation treatment. For comparison, solid tumor MCF-7 cells (breast
   cancer cell line) were studied as well. Our irradiation experimental
   results show that Glu-GNPs are better irradiation sensitizers to treat
   THP-1 cells than MCF-7 cells, or Glu-GNPs enhance the cancer killing of
   THP-1 cells 20\% more than X-ray irradiation alone and GNP treatment
   alone. This finding can help oncologists to design therapeutic
   strategies to target cancer stem cells and cancer metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the effects of permeability heterogeneity on gas
   production in water-bearing tight gas reservoirs, the combined series of
   cores obtained from Sulige gas field, one of the important water-bearing
   tight gas reservoirs in China, were tested. Based on different scenarios
   of permeability heterogeneity, the low-velocity non-Darcy flow
   mathematical models considering threshold pressure gradient (TPG) were
   established. The finite difference method was applied to numerically
   solve the nonlinear mathematical model, and the corresponding numerical
   program was completed. The consistency between the numerical results
   considering TPG and the experimental data indicates the validity and
   accuracy of the mathematical models. The numerical and experimental
   results show that ignoring the influence of TPG in water-bearing tight
   gas reservoirs will lead to inaccurate assessment of the well
   productivity. For heterogeneous water-bearing tight gas reservoir
   development, the production wells allocated in high permeability region
   will boost the recovery. However the higher the initial constant
   production rate, the shorter the stable production time. So an
   appropriate production rate should be allocated to maximize both the
   economic and social benefits. This research can quantitatively analyze
   the impacts of permeability heterogeneity in water-bearing tight gas
   reservoir developments and optimize the production rate and production
   pressure accordingly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2193-2202}},
Abstract = {{In the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) patterning process, electrostatic
   destabilization of the air-polymer interface results in micro- and
   nano-size patterns in the form of raised formations called pillars. The
   polymer film in this process is typically assumed to behave like a
   perfect dielectric (PD) or leaky dielectric (LD). In this study, an
   electrostatic model is developed for the patterning of an ionic liquid
   (IL) polymer film. The IL model has a finite diffuse electric layer
   which overcomes the shortcoming of assuming infinitesimally large and
   small electric diffuse layers inherent in the PD and LD models
   respectively. The process of pattern formation is then numerically
   simulated by solving the weakly nonlinear thin film equation using
   finite difference with pseudo-staggered discretization and an adaptive
   time step. Initially, the pillar formation process in IL films is
   observed to be the same as that in PD films. Pillars initially form at
   random locations and their cross-section increases with time as the
   contact line expands on the top electrode. After the initial growth, for
   the same applied voltage and initial film thickness, the number of
   pillars on IL films is found to be significantly higher than that in PD
   films. The total number of pillars formed in 1 mu m(2) area of the
   domain in an IL film is almost 5 times more than that in a similar PD
   film for the conditions simulated. In addition, the pillar structure
   size in IL films is observed to be more sensitive to initial film
   thickness compared to PD films.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on quantifying the effects of the liquid-side
   boundary conditions on the burning characteristics of a laboratory-scale

   C to 50 degrees C. Burning rate, flame height, and wall and liquid
   temperature distributions were measured. The burning rate increased with
   a decrease in the wall thermal conductivity. Significantly different
   vertical profiles of fuel and wall temperature resulted from the
   different wall materials. Wall heat fluxes estimated from these
   temperature measurements were used in the pool fire energy analysis to
   estimate the burning rate within +/- 10\% from the measured values. This
   analysis revealed that convection and conduction pathways dominate the
   heat transfer from the flame to the pool and their contributions were a
   function of the pool wall material. The ratio of the conduction to
   convection pathways was 4-10\% for the copper pool and 26-37\% for the

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-80}},
Abstract = {{Fuzzy soft sets realize a hybrid soft computing model in which the
   methods of gradualness and parametrization for dealing with uncertainty
   are combined effectively. Up to now, fuzzy soft sets have shown to be
   useful in various fields such as algebra, logic, data mining, supply
   chains risk management, forecasting, prediction and decision making
   under uncertainty. Also it is well-known that the level set approach and
   decomposition theorems play an important role in investigating fuzzy
   concepts or structures. Thus decomposition of fuzzy soft sets is a
   meaningful research topic from both theoretical and practical
   viewpoints.
   Nevertheless, so far as we know very few works contribute to this
   important issue. The present study endeavors to fill this blank in the
   theory of fuzzy soft sets. It offers a systematic investigation of
   scalar products of fuzzy soft sets. Particularly it is shown that scalar
   product operations can be regarded as semimodule actions and algebraic
   structures like ordered idempotent semimodules of fuzzy soft sets over
   ordered semirings can be constructed. Also the collection of all t-level
   soft sets of a fuzzy soft set can form a distributive lattice under soft
   union and intersection operations. Finally, some decomposition theorems
   for fuzzy soft sets are established using scalar products and level soft
   sets with either constant thresholds or variable thresholds given by
   fuzzy sets.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this review was to assess research methods used to
   determine the fracture toughness of Y-TZP ceramics in order to
   systematically evaluate the accuracy of each method with regard to
   potential influencing factors.
   Materials and Methods: Six databases were searched for studies up to
   April 2013. The terms ``tough{*},{''} ``critical stress intensity
   factor,{''} ``zirconi{*},{''} ``yttri{*},{''} ``dent{*},{''}
   ``zirconia,{''} ``zirconium,{''} and ``stress{''} were searched. Titles
   and abstracts were screened, and literature that fulfilled the inclusion
   criteria was selected for a full-text reading. Test conditions with
   potential influence on fracture toughness were extracted from each
   study.
   Results: Ten laboratory studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a
   significant variation in relation to test method, ambient conditions,
   applied/indentation load, number of specimens, and geometry and
   dimension of the specimen. The results were incomparable due to high
   variability and missing information. Therefore, 10 parameters were
   listed to be followed to standardize future studies.
   Conclusions: A wide variation in research methods affected the fracture
   toughness reported for Y-TZP ceramics among the selected studies;
   single-edge-precracked beam and chevron-notched-beam seem to be the most
   recommended methods to determine Y-TZP fracture toughness; the
   indentation methods have several limitations. Clinical significance: The
   accurate calculation of toughness values is fundamental because
   overestimating toughness data in a clinical situation can negatively
   affect the lifetime of the restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the statistical correspondence between phases of the
   transmitted and received vectors, we present a fast decoding method for
   quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes (QOSTBCs) in this paper. The
   proposed decoder selects proper candidates from precomputed and sorted
   sets by focusing on the phase of a specific entry of the combined and
   decoupled vector. The ML metric of the most probable candidates is first
   evaluated, and then, the remaining candidates are assessed based on the
   similarity between the phases. The new algorithm can work with any type
   of constellation such as QAM and PSK and supports generalized
   block-diagonal QOSTBCs. Theoretical results backed by simulation tests
   confirm the solution's superior performance in terms of the decoder
   complexity compared with popular approaches found in the literature.
   This feature is achieved through far fewer computations operations
   compared with many of the state-of-the-art models reported in the
   literature.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{68-76}},

Abstract = {{We calculated the binding free energy of short oligonucleotides
   (9-20-mers DNA) by using molecular dynamics, followed with
   post-processing based on molecular theory of solvation (MM/3D-RISM-KEI
   approach). A comparison with the PBSA and GBSA continuum salvation
   models was performed to identify the approach in the best agreement with
   experimental results for the binding free energy. Compared to the PBSA
   or GBSA methods, the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of salvation provides a
   more accurate description of the nonpolar contribution to the salvation
   free energy from the first principles of statistical mechanics. The
   binding free energy was calculated by using separate trajectories for
   the DNA complex and its two strands, as well as based on a single
   trajectory for the complex, both with and without account for explicit
   counter ions in post-processing of molecular dynamics trajectories to
   calculate the binding free energy of oligonucleotides. Overall, both
   GBSA and 3D-RISM-KH predict the binding free energy obtained from
   ``separate trajectory{''} calculations with implicit account for counter
   ions in a good agreement with experiment, the latter showing a better
   performance for larger oligonucleotides. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Contact angles of surfactant solutions on heterogeneous surfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{5574-5585}},
Abstract = {{Using Gibbs' adsorption equation and a literature isotherm, a new
   general model to predict the contact angle of surfactant solutions on
   (smooth or rough) chemically heterogeneous surfaces is constructed based
   on the Cassie equation. The model allows for adsorption at the
   liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor interfaces. Solid-vapor
   adsorption is allowed in order to model the autophobic effect on
   hydrophilic surfaces. Using representative values for the coefficients
   which describe adsorption at each interface, model predictions for
   contact angles as a function of f parameters (area fractions) and
   surfactant concentration are made for heterogeneous surfaces made up of
   different materials. On smooth surfaces, the f parameters serve as
   weighting factors determining how to combine the effects of surfactant
   adsorption on each material to predict the behavior on the heterogeneous
   surface. Due to the non-linear nature of the model, the inclusion of a
   small amount of hydrophobic material has a greater effect on a
   predominantly hydrophilic material than vice versa, explaining the
   result seen in literature that a small amount of hydrophobic
   contamination (such as oil) significantly increases contact angle on a
   hydrophilic surface. The fact that even a small amount of heterogeneity
   can greatly change experimental results could lead to incorrect
   experimental conclusions about surfactant adsorption if a surface were
   wrongly assumed to be homogeneous. Model predictions rapidly become more
   complex as the number of differently wettable materials present on the
   surface increases. Also, an approximately equal weighting of different
   materials generally leads to more complex behaviors compared to
   heterogeneous surfaces composed largely of a single material. Rough
   heterogeneous surfaces follow previous results for surfactant wetting of
   rough homogeneous surfaces, leading to an amplification/attenuation of
   surfactant effects for penetrated/unpenetrated wetting, and further
   increasing the complexity of predictions. These potential complexities
   point to the importance of characterizing the heterogeneities of any
   surface under consideration. With proper characterization, the model
   described in this paper will allow for prediction of contact angles on
   all types of heterogeneous surfaces, and design of surfaces for specific
   interactions with surfactant solutions.}},

Title = {{Measuring Forces and Spatiotemporal Evolution of Thin Water Films
   between an Air Bubble and Solid Surfaces of Different Hydrophobicity}},
Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-104}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and reflection
   interference contrast microscopy (RICM) was used to measure
   simultaneously the interaction force and the spatiotemporal evolution of
   the thin water film between a bubble in water and mica surfaces with
   varying degrees of hydrophobicity. Stable films, supported by the
   repulsive van der Waals-Casimir-Lifshitz force were always observed
   between air bubble and hydrophilic mica surfaces (water contact angle,
   theta(w) < 5 degrees) whereas bubble attachment occurred on
   hydrophobized mica surfaces. A theoretical model, based on the Reynolds
   lubrication theory and the augmented Young-Laplace equation including
   the effects of disjoining pressure, provided excellent agreement with
   experiment results, indicating the essential physics involved in the
   interaction between air bubble and solid surfaces can be elucidated. A
   hydrophobic interaction free energy per unit area of the form: W-H(h) =
   -gamma(1 - cos theta(w))exp(-h/D-H) can be used to quantify the
   attraction between bubble and hydrophobized solid substrate at
   separation, h, with gamma being the surface tension of water. For
   surfaces with water contact angle in the range 45 degrees < theta(w) <
   90 degrees, the decay length D-H varied between 0.8 and 1.0 nm. This
   study quantified the hydrophobic interaction in asymmetric system
   between air bubble and hydrophobic surfaces, and provided a feasible
   method for synchronous measurements of the interaction forces with
   sub-nN resolution and the drainage dynamics of thin films down to nm
   thickness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper extends the backstepping-based observer design to the state
   estimation of parabolic PDEs with time-dependent spatial domain. The
   design is developed for the stabilization of a collocated boundary
   measurement and actuation of an unstable 1D heat equation with the
   application to the temperature distribution regulation in Czochralski
   crystal growth process. The PDE system that describes the estimation
   error dynamics is transformed to an exponentially stable target system
   through invertible transformations to obtain the time-varying kernel PDE
   defined on the time-varying triangular-shape domain. The exponential
   stability of the closed-loop system with an observer-based
   output-feedback controller is established by the use of a Lyapunov
   function. Finally, numerical solutions to the kernel PDEs and
   simulations are given to demonstrate successful stabilization of the

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{14294-14304}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to characterize the interactive effects of
   light and aging on physicochemical properties and antimicrobial activity
   of nanocrystalline silver wound dressings Acticoat that might find their
   way into the environment. Nanocrystalline silver films deposited on
   high-density polyethylene were exposed to a light source that mimics
   natural daylight for various time lengths and characterized using atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and secondary
   ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). Bactericidal efficacy of the light exposed
   nanocrystalline silver was measured using a log reduction assay. A
   change in color from dark blue to purple and then brown was observed
   after exposure to light. The change in color was attributed to an
   increase in surface roughness as emphasized by the AFM imaging. A
   decrease in silver oxide thickness followed by an increase in silver
   sulfide and silver carbonate content was observed during SIMS analysis.
   Interestingly, the XPS analysis confirmed this result by the breakage of
   the Ag-O bonds and formation of silver sulfide in the nanocrystalline
   matrix. Even though nanocrystalline silver exposed to light for four
   weeks maintained its bactericidal capacity, the observed physicochemical
   changes (grain growth, chemical composition changes) suggest that given
   sufficient time, nanocrystalline silver dressings should deactivate in
   time, in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury emission from combustion flue gas causes considerable
   environmental challenges and serious adverse health threats, and
   elemental mercury (Hg-0) is the most challenging chemical form for
   removal. In this work, four types of graphene oxide (GO) based composite
   adsorbents were successfully synthesized by depositing Ag nanoparticles
   (NPs) and/or magnetic ferrite NPs on GO sheets (denoted as GO, GO-Ag,
   MGO and MGO-Ag), characterized and applied for the removal of Hg-0 for
   the first time. The presence of Ag NPs on GO greatly enhances the Hg-0
   removal capability of GO-Ag and MGO-Ag as compared to that of pure GO,
   which is mainly attributed to the amalgamation of Hg-0 on Ag NPs. MGO-Ag
   shows the best Hg-0 removal performance and thermal tolerance among the
   four types of adsorbents developed, which can effectively capture Hg-0
   up to 150-200 degrees C in a simulated flue gas environment and can be
   also effectively recycled and reused. Our results indicate that the
   graphene oxide based composites (i.e. MGO-Ag) have significant potential
   applications for mercury emission control in coal-fired power plants.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo evaluate white matter (WM) integrity of distinct groups of
   patients with antiepileptic drug (AED)-resistant localization-related
   epilepsies.
   MethodsWe used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fiber-tractography and
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate differences of WM micro-
   and macrostructural integrity in patients with different drug-resistant
   localization-related epilepsies: 17 with temporal lobe epilepsy with
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs of hippocampal sclerosis
   (TLE-HS), 17 with TLE and normal MRI (TLE-NL), 14 with frontal lobe
   epilepsy and subtle MRI signs of focal cortical dysplasia (FLE-FCD), and
   112 healthy controls. We performed fiber-tractography using a
   semiautomatic deterministic method to yield average fractional
   anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), and radial (RD) diffusivity ipsilateral and
   contralateral to the epileptogenic zone of the following tracts based on
   their functional and anatomic relevance: body of fornix (BoF), body of
   cingulum (BoC), inferior frontal occipital (IFO), and uncinate fasciculi
   (UF). In addition, we performed VBM of the WM maps to assess
   macrostructural integrity differences among groups.
   ResultsTLE-HS had ipsilateral and contralateral decreased FA and
   increased RD for all tracts. VBM showed WM alterations mainly in the
   ipsilateral parahippocampal region and contralateral superior temporal
   gyrus. FLE-FCD showed bilateral FA decreases only in the BoC and
   ipsilateral RD increases also in the BoC. VBM showed WM reduction mainly
   in the ipsilateral precuneus and posterior and anterior cingulum. No
   significant WM alterations were found in the TLE-NL in DTI or VBM
   analysis.
   SignificanceWM abnormalities differ in distinct AED-resistant
   localization-related epilepsies. The diverse distribution of the WM
   damage in these patients suggests that the localization of the epileptic
   networks may play a role in the WM burden. However, the distinct degree
   of this damage, more accentuated in TLE-HS, also suggests that the
   underlying cause of the epilepsy is probably an additional factor to
   explain this WM damage.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of hydrogen sulfide in biofilms and sediments in sewer
   systems can cause severe pipe corrosions and health hazards, and
   requires expensive programs for its prevention. The aim of this study is
   to propose a new control strategy and the optimal condition for sulfide
   elimination by intermittent nitrate dosing in sewer sediments. The study
   was carried out based on lab-scale experiments and batch tests using
   real sewer sediments. The intermittent nitrate dosing mode and the
   optimal control condition were investigated. The results indicated that
   the sulfide-intermittent-elimination strategy by nitrate dosing is
   advantageous for controlling sulfide accumulation in sewer sediment. The
   oxidation-reduction potential is a sensitive indicator parameter that
   can reflect the control effect and the minimum N/S (nitrate/sulfide)
   ratio with slight excess nitrate is necessary for optimal conditions of
   efficient sulfide control with lower carbon source loss. The optimal
   control condition is feasible for the sulfide elimination in sewer
   systems. (C) 2014 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{41-49}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Unexpected or time-varying deterministic type load disturbances are
   often encountered when performing identification tests in practical
   applications. A bias-eliminated subspace identification method is
   proposed in this paper by developing an orthogonal projection approach
   to guarantee consistent estimation on the deterministic part of the
   plant, in combination with a Maclaurin time series approximation on the
   output response arising from deterministic type load disturbance. The
   rank condition for such an orthogonal projection is disclosed in terms
   of the state-space model structure adopted for identification. Using
   principal component analysis (PCA), the extended observability matrix
   and the lower triangular Toeplitz matrix of the state-space model are
   explicitly derived. Accordingly, the plant state-space matrices can be
   retrieved from the above matrices through a shift-invariant algorithm. A
   benchmark example from the literature and an illustrative example of
   industrial injection molding are used to demonstrate the effectiveness
   and merit of the proposed identification method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{On specular reflectivity measurements in high and low-contrast

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Using both experiment and 2D3V particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we
   describe the use of specular reflectivity measurements to study
   relativistic (I lambda(2) > 10(18) W/cm(2).mu m(2)) laser-plasma
   interactions for both high and low-contrast 527 nm laser pulses on
   initially solid density aluminum targets. In the context of hot-electron
   generation, studies typically rely on diagnostics which,
   more-often-than-not, represent indirect processes driven by fast
   electrons transiting through solid density materials. Specular
   reflectivity measurements, however, can provide a direct measure of the
   interaction that is highly sensitive to how the EM fields and plasma
   profiles, critical input parameters for modeling of hot-electron
   generation, evolve near the interaction region. While the fields of
   interest occur near the relativistic critical electron density,
   experimental reflectivity measurements are obtained centimeters away
   from the interaction region, well after diffraction has fully manifested
   itself. Using a combination of PIC simulations with experimentally
   inspired conditions and an analytic, non-paraxial, pulse propagation
   algorithm, we calculate reflected pulse properties, both near and far
   from the interaction region, and compare with specular reflectivity
   measurements. The experiment results and PIC simulations demonstrate
   that specular reflectivity measurements are an extremely sensitive
   qualitative, and partially quantitative, indicator of initial
   laser/target conditions, ionization effects, and other details of
   intense laser-matter interactions. The techniques described can provide
   strong constraints on many systems of importance in ultra-intense laser
   interactions with matter. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{A complete analysis of strain tolerance in a stretchable transparent
   conductor (TC) should include tracking of both electrical conductivity
   and transparency during strain; however, transparency is generally
   neglected in contemporary analyses. In this paper, we describe an
   apparatus that tracks both parameters while TCs of arbitrary composition
   are deformed under stretching-mode strain. We demonstrate the tool by
   recording the electrical resistance and light transmission spectra for
   indium tin oxide-coated plastic substrates under both linearly
   increasing strain and complex cyclic strain processes. The optics are
   sensitive across the visible spectrum and into the near-infrared region
   (similar to 400-900 nm), and without specifically optimizing for
   sampling speed, we achieve a time resolution of similar to 200 ms. In
   our automated analysis routine, we include a calculation of a common TC

   TC application, we also weigh both our transparency and FOM results
   against the solar power spectrum to determine ``solar transparency{''}

Abstract = {{We observe unique, absorption resonances in silver/silica
   multilayer-based epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterials that are related

   medium, metamaterial description the unique effect of the excitation of
   these microscopic modes is counterintuitive and captured within the
   complex propagation constant, not the effective dielectric
   permittivities. Theoretical analysis of the band structure for our
   metamaterials shows the existence of multiple Ferell-Berreman branches
   with slow light characteristics. The demonstration that the propgation
   constant reveals subtle microscopic resonances can lead to the design of
   devices where Ferell-Berreman modes can be exploited for practical
   applications ranging from plasmonic sensing to imaging and absorption

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Coating of bitumen by clays, known as slime coating, is detrimental to
   bitumen recovery from oil sands using the warm slurry extraction
   process. Sodium hydroxide (caustic) is added to the extraction process
   to balance many competing processing challenges, which include
   undesirable slime coating. The current research aims at understanding
   the role of caustic addition in controlling interactions of bitumen with
   various types of model clays. The interaction potential was studied by
   quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). After
   confirming the slime coating potential of montmorillonite clays on
   bitumen in the presence of calcium ions, the interaction of kaolinite
   and illite with bitumen was studied. To represent more closely the
   industrial applications, tailings water from bitumen extraction tests at
   different caustic dosage was used. At caustic dosage up to 0.5 wt \% oil
   sands ore, a negligible coating of kaolinite on the bitumen was
   determined. However, at a lower level of caustic addition, illite was
   shown to attach to the bitumen, with the interaction potential
   decreasing with increasing caustic dosage. Increasing concentration of
   humic acids as a result of increasing caustic dosage was identified to
   limit the interaction potential of illite with bitumen. This fundamental
   study clearly shows that the critical role of caustics in modulating
   interactions of clays with bitumen depends upon the type of clays,
   guiding the multi-billion dollar oil sands industry to identify clay
   type as a key operational variable.}},

Abstract = {{Direct current (dc) motor drive systems are extensively used in paper,
   steel, mining, material handling, and other industrial applications due
   to the high starting torque and easy speed control over a wide range.
   They could account for 10\%-20\% load demand in some industrial
   facilities and thus have significant impact on the overall system
   dynamics. However, an adequate dynamic model for this type of loads is
   not available for power system dynamic studies. In this paper, a
   comprehensive modeling method for dc motor drive systems is proposed
   considering two scenarios: 1) The drive will trip when subjected to
   severe voltage sags, and 2) the drive can ride through when experiencing
   mild voltage sags. The dc drive trip curve and a simple procedure to
   determine if the drive needs to be included for dynamic studies are
   proposed for Scenario 1. The dynamic model for dc motor drive systems,
   which can be readily inserted in the simulation software, is developed
   and verified through case studies for Scenario 2.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Empirical models for the density and the viscosity of squalane (C30H62;
   2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosane) have been developed based on an
   exhaustive review of the data available in the literature and new
   experimental density and viscosity measurements carried out as a part of
   this work. The literature review shows there is a substantial lack of
   density and viscosity data at high temperature (373 to 473) K and high
   pressure conditions (pressures up to 200 MPa). These gaps were addressed
   with new experimental measurements carried out at temperatures of (338
   to 473) K and at pressures of (1 to 202.1) MPa. The new data were
   utilized in the model development to improve the density and viscosity
   calculation of squalane at all conditions including high temperatures
   and high pressures. The model presented in this work reproduces the best
   squalane density and viscosity data available based on a new combined
   outlier and regression algorithm. The combination of the empirical
   models and the regression approach resulted in models which could
   reproduce the experimental density data with average absolute percent
   deviation of 0.04 \%, bias of 0.000 \%, standard deviation of 0.05 \%,
   and maximum absolute percent deviation of 0.14 \% and reproduce the
   experimental viscosity data with average absolute percent deviation of
   1.4 \%, bias of 0.02 \%, standard deviation of 1.8 \%, and maximum
   absolute percent deviation of 4.9 \% over a wide range of temperatures
   and pressures. On the basis of the data set used in the model regression
   (without outliers), the density model is limited to the pressure and
   temperature ranges of (0.1 to 202.1) MPa and (273 to 525) K, whereas the
   viscosity model is limited to the pressure and temperature ranges of
   (0.1 to 467.0) MPa and (273 to 473) K. These models can be used to
   calibrate laboratory densitometers and viscometers at relevant
   high-temperature, high-pressure conditions.}},

Abstract = {{UV radiometers are widely employed for irradiance measurements, but
   their periodical calibrations not only induce an extra cost but also are
   time-consuming. In this study, the KI/KIO3 actinometer was applied to
   calibrate UV radiometer detectors at 254nm with a quasi-collimated beam
   apparatus equipped with a low-pressure UV lamp, and feasible calibration
   conditions were identified. Results indicate that a washer constraining
   the UV light was indispensable, while the size (10 or 50 mL) of a beaker
   containing the actinometer solution had little influence when a proper
   washer was used. The absorption or reflection of UV light by the
   internal beaker wall led to an underestimation or overestimation of the
   irradiance determined by the KI/KIO3 actinometer, respectively. The
   proper range of the washer internal diameter could be obtained via
   mathematical analysis. A radiometer with a longer service time showed a
   greater calibration factor. To minimize the interference from the inner
   wall reflection of the collimating tube, calibrations should be
   conducted at positions far enough away from the tube bottom. This study
   demonstrates that after the feasible calibration conditions are
   identified, the KI/KIO3 actinometer can be applied readily to calibrate
   UV radiometer detectors at 254nm.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider distributed moving horizon state estimation of
   nonlinear systems subject to communication delays and data losses. In
   the proposed design, a local estimator is designed for each subsystem
   and the distributed estimators communicate to collaborate. To handle the
   delays and data losses simultaneously, a predictor is designed for each
   subsystem estimator. A two-step prediction-update strategy is used in
   the predictor design in order to get a reliable prediction of the system
   state. In the design of each subsystem estimator, an auxiliary nonlinear
   observer is also taken advantage of to calculate a reference subsystem
   state estimate. In the local estimator, the reference state estimate is
   used to generate a confidence region within which the local estimator
   optimizes its subsystem state estimate. Sufficient conditions under
   which the proposed design gives decreasing and ultimately bounded
   estimation error are provided. The effectiveness of the proposed
   approach is illustrated via the application to a chemical process
   example. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cleft Palate Reconstruction Using Collagen and Nanofiber Scaffold
   Incorporating Bone Morphogenetic Protein in Rats}},
Journal = {{TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{85-95}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) loaded with bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is approved for selected clinical
   applications; however, burst release limits its widespread use.
   Therefore, nanofiber (NF)-based scaffold with ACS backbone was developed
   to sustain release of loaded BMP-2 to improve the outcomes of bone
   grafting in a rodent model of cleft palate.
   Methods: BMP-2 was loaded on ACS scaffold and then NF hydrogel with
   different densities (1-2\%) was added to sustain the BMP-2 release. The
   release profiles of BMP-2 from constructs with different NF densities
   were evaluated in vitro to explore the optimum NF density that could
   recapitulate physiological bone healing process. Subsequently, scaffold
   with the appropriate NF density was implanted into a rodent model of
   cleft palate. Wistar rats, with surgically induced maxillary cleft
   defects, were then assigned to one of the following groups (n=6/group):
   no scaffold (control), ACS, ACS+BMP-2, NF+ACS, and NF+ACS+BMP-2.
   Micro-computed tomography (mu CT) was utilized to evaluate percent bone
   filling (\%BF) at defect site as well as changes in anteroposterior and
   transverse dimensions of the maxilla at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Histological
   assessment of bone healing was performed at week 8.
   Results: In vitro release experiments showed that scaffolds containing
   2\% NF exhibited a release profile conducive to the natural stages of
   bone healing and, hence, it was utilized for subsequent in vivo studies.
   Bone healing occurred at the defect margins leaving a central bone void
   in the control, ACS, and NF+ACS groups over the 8-week study period.
   BMP-2-treated groups demonstrated higher \%BF as compared with other
   groups at week 8 (p<0.05). Whereas the NF+ACS+BMP-2 group showed bone
   bridging of the defect as early as 4 weeks, which was not evident in
   ACS+BMP-2 group. In all groups, bone grafts did not disrupt
   anteroposterior and transverse growth of maxilla. Based on histological
   evaluations together with mu CT data, NF+ACS+BMP-2 treatment resulted in
   clinically significant and consistent bone healing throughout the
   implanted scaffold when compared with the ACS+BMP-2 group.
   Conclusion: NF+ACS+BMP-2 constructs exhibited osteoinductive properties
   together with preparation simplicity, which makes it a novel approach
   for BMP-2 delivery for cleft palate reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, acetabular rounding is only subjectively assessed on
   ultrasound for developmental dysplasia of the hip. We tested whether
   acetabular rounding can be quantified reliably and can distinguish
   between hips requiring and not requiring treatment. Consecutive infants
   (n = 90) suspected of having dysplasia of the hip, seen at a pediatric
   orthopedic clinic, were separated into four diagnostic categories
   (normal, borderline but resolved, treated by brace, treated surgically).
   Acetabular rounding was assessed by semi-quantitative grade (0 = nil, 1
   = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) by three observers and by direct
   measurement of acetabular radius of curvature (AROC) by two observers.
   Inter-observer reliability of rounding grade was poor (k = 0.30-0.37).
   AROC had an inter-observer intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.84
   and coefficient of variation of 29\%-34\%. Mean AROC was significantly
   higher for hips requiring treatment than for those not requiring
   treatment (3.3 mm vs. 1.6 mm, p = 0.007). AROC reliably quantifies an
   observation currently being made subjectively by radiologists and
   surgeons, and may be useful as a supplementary ultrasound index of
   dysplasia of the hip in future prospective studies. (C) 2015 World

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) continue to gain increasing attention in
   the materials community as sustainable nanoparticles with unique

   (poly(AEM)) and poly(N-(2-aminoethylmethacrylamide) (poly(AEMA)) CNC
   brushes via the surface-initiated single-electron-transfer living
   radical polymerization technique. The resulting modified CNCs were
   characterized for their chemical and morphological features using a
   combination of analytical, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques.
   Zeta potential measurements indicated a positive surface charge, and
   further proof of the cationic nature was confirmed by gold deposition as
   evidenced by electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity of these cationic
   modified CNCs was evaluated utilizing a
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
   in two different cell lines, J774A1 (mouse monocyte cells) and MCF-7
   (human breast adenocarcinoma cells). The results indicated that none of

Abstract = {{Skilled labour shortages have been projected for Alberta's construction
   industry. As the career paths tradespeople follow significantly affect
   future supplies of skilled labour, this study explored the career paths
   of tradespeople in the provincial construction industry. Three major
   characteristics of the career paths of tradespeople were analyzed: first
   industry career stage, number of years spent in each stage, and number
   of projects worked on during each stage. Sector-based comparisons
   discovered that tradespeople in the industrial/pipeline sector
   progressed more quickly through some career stages. Analysis also
   revealed that in general, switching industry sectors during a career
   stage lengthens the duration of that stage. We also explored which
   factors affect construction tradespeople's career paths using a
   chi-square correlation test. Intergenerational differences were
   observed; a correlation between educational level and highest industry
   career stage was detected. Study findings will support the development
   of labour projections, educational programming, and human resources
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{A key advancement target for oxygen reduction reaction catalysts is to
   simultaneously improve both the electrochemical activity and durability.
   To this end, the efficacy of a new highly conductive support that
   comprises of a 0.5 nm titanium oxynitride film coated by atomic layer
   deposition onto an array of carbon nanotubes has been investigated.
   Support effects for pure platinum and for a platinum (50 at \%)/nickel
   alloy have been considered. Oxynitride induces a downshift in the d-band
   center for pure platinum and fundamentally changes the platinum particle
   size and spatial distribution. This results in major enhancements in
   activity and corrosion stability relative to an identically synthesized
   catalyst without the interlayer. Conversely, oxynitride has a minimal
   effect on the electronic structure and microstructure, and therefore, on
   the catalytic performance of platinum-nickel. Calculations based on
   density functional theory add insight with regard to compositional
   segregation that occurs at the alloy catalyst-support interface.}},

Abstract = {{Particle motion due to ultrasonic acoustic radiation in a macroscale,
   multiwavelength acoustic chamber is investigated and compared with
   available theories. Primary acoustic radiation force theory has been
   extensively developed to predict single particle motion in a microscale,
   single-node acoustic chamber/channel. There is a need to investigate the
   applicability of this theory to macroscale, multiwavelength acoustic
   channels utilizing the acoustic radiation force for separating
   polydispersed particles. A particle-tracking velocimetry (PTV) approach
   for measuring individual particle motion is developed specifically to
   track particles as they densify at an acoustic pressure node. Particle
   motion is tracked over the lifetime of their motion to a node. Good
   agreement between the experimental and theoretical results is observed
   in the early stages of particle motion, where particles can be
   considered individually. Only in the densified region of the acoustic
   pressure node is there some mismatch with theory. The acoustic energy
   density of the acoustic chamber, a parameter intrinsically associated
   with the system by the theory, is also determined experimentally for
   different conditions and shown to be constant for all investigated
   system settings. The investigation demonstrates the capability of
   available theory in predicting the motion of polydispersed particles in

Journal = {{APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{71-76}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Although Portland cement (PC) is widely used for marine soft clay
   stabilization, there are significant environmental impacts associated
   with its production. Hence, the use of industrial by-products has been
   encouraged. In this paper, quicklime and hydrated lime were used to
   activate ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS), a by-product of the
   steel industry, for stabilization of marine soft clay in comparison to
   PC. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury
   intrusion porosimetry (MIP), and unconfined compressive strength
   (UCS),were used to investigate the microstructural and mechanical
   properties of stabilized clays. The microstructural analysis results
   revealed that the main hydration products in the two types of lime-GGBS
   stabilized clays were calcium silicate hydrates (CSH), calcium
   aluminates (CAH), calcium aluminum silicate hydrates (CASH), and
   alumino-ferrite monosulfate (AFm), and both types of lime-activated GGBS
   stabilized clays could yield lower porosity than PC stabilized clay. The
   UCS results demonstrated that hydrated lime-activated GGBS achieved

Abstract = {{A MEMS-tunable beam-shaping half phase-gradient (HPG) resonant cavity
   antenna (RCA) is presented. Traditionally, the full phase-gradient (FPG)
   partially reflective surface (PRS) is used in center-fed RCA for
   generating asymmetric off-broadside beams. Here, the novel configuration
   of HPG-PRS is offered with the advantages of faster real-time tracking
   and an improved scan profile compared to the FPG-PRS. A HPG-PRS is
   designed to scan 12 500 off broadside with frequency and also steer its
   beam for 69 at fixed frequency. Finally, the tunable PRS unit cell
   required for beam-steering in an RCA is realized using hybrid-integrated
   in-house developed RF-MEMS switches. These switches can be used to
   control the beam shape among: broadside, symmetric conical, and also an
   asymmetric single beam which is either frequency-scanned or steered at
   fixed frequency.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the radiation performance of open-ended

   arrangement employing a shielded-loop source embedded inside the
   miniaturized waveguide is developed to efficiently excite the mode and
   avoid the excitation of other modes across the frequency-reduced band
   while maintaining the antenna's compactness. A metamaterial-lined
   circular-waveguide probe antenna operating over 42\% below its natural
   cutoff frequency is designed to provide a radiation efficiency of up to

Title = {{Wide-bandwidth piezoelectric energy harvester with polymeric structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A polymer based energy harvester with wide bandwidth is designed,
   fabricated and tested in this work. A polymer based structure has a
   lower resonance frequency compared to a silicon based structure with the
   same dimensions due to the much lower stiffness of polymeric materials.
   Therefore, a polymeric energy harvester is more useful for situations
   with lower ambient vibration frequencies. Aluminum nitride pads are
   fabricated on an SU-8 membrane to convert mechanical vibration of the
   membrane to electrical voltage. A new and scalable microfabrication
   process flow is proposed to properly fabricate piezoelectric layers on
   SU-8 structures. The nonlinear stiffness due to the stretching strain in
   the membrane provides a wider harvestable frequency bandwidth than
   conventional linear oscillators. Wideband energy harvesters are more
   useful for practical applications due to uncontrollable ambient
   vibration frequency. The load-deflection equation of the device is
   calculated using finite element simulation. This equation is then used
   in an analytical solution to estimate the nonlinear effect of the
   structure. A bandwidth of similar to 146 Hz is obtained for the
   fabricated device and a maximum open circuit voltage of 1.42 V, maximum
   power of 1.37 mu W, and power density of 3.81 mu W cm(-2) were measured
   at terminal load of 357.4 k Omega under an excitation acceleration of 4
   g. A power output of 10.1 mu W and power density of 28.1 mu W cm(-2) was
   estimated using a synchronized switch harvesting on interface (SSHI)
   electrical interface with electrical quality factor of 5. In addition,
   the lumped element model has been employed to investigate the scaling
   effect on a polymeric circular diaphragm.}},

Abstract = {{Plant biomass recalcitrance, a major obstacle to achieving sustainable
   production of second generation biofiiels, arises mainly from the
   amorphous cell-wall matrix containing lignin and hemicellulose assembled
   into a complex supramolecular network that coats the cellulose fibrils.
   We employed the statistical-mechanical, 3D reference interaction site
   model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure approximation (or 3D-RISM-KH
   molecular theory of solvation) to reveal the supramolecular interactions
   in this network and provide molecular-level insight into the effective
   lignin-lignin and lignin-hemicellulose thermodynamic interactions. We
   found that such interactions are hydrophobic and entropy-driven, and
   arise from the expelling of water from the mutual interaction surfaces.
   The molecular origin of these interactions is carbohydrate-pi and pi-pi
   stacking forces, whose strengths are dependent on the lignin chemical
   composition. Methoxy substituents in the phenyl groups of lignin promote
   substantial entropic stabilization of the ligno-hemicellulosic matrix.
   Our results provide a detailed molecular view of the fundamental
   interactions within the secondary plant cell walls that lead to
   recalcitrance.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradable blended films from methylcellulose (MC) and potato starch
   (PST) have been developed by the casting process. In the present work
   the influences of concentrations of MC and PST on rheological
   properties, swelling, mechanical properties such as tensile strength,
   percentage elongation at break and water vapor transmission rate (WVTR)
   of the prepared blended films have been studied. Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) analysis of pure MC, PST, their mixture and the mixture
   with glutaraldehyde and urea was performed to investigate the
   interactions in blended films. The blended films of MC and PST showed an
   increase in tensile strength due to the cross linking reactions of the
   amylopectin molecule of PST in the physical gel state. The change of
   percentage elongation at break increased with MC concentration and the
   opposite trend was found in the case of the WVTR due to the network
   structure of the blended films. The blended films showed a large
   improvement in the above mentioned properties compared with each single
   component, due to the interaction formed between hydroxyl groups of PST
   and the methoxy groups of MC. Experiments were also conducted to
   investigate the controlled urea release through blended films and the
   kinetics of the process. Interesting results were found with the
   prepared MC and PST blended films.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging new applications and growing demands of plasma-sprayed coatings
   initiate the development of new materials. Regarding ceramics, often
   complex compositions are employed to achieve advanced material
   properties, e. g., high thermal stability, low thermal conductivity,
   high electronic and ionic conductivity as well as specific
   thermo-mechanical properties and microstructures. Such materials
   however, often involve particular difficulties in processing by plasma
   spraying. The inhomogeneous dissociation and evaporation behavior of
   individual constituents can lead to changes of the chemical composition
   and the formation of secondary phases in the deposited coatings. Hence,
   undesired effects on the coating characteristics are encountered. In
   this work, examples of such challenging materials are investigated,
   namely pyrochlores applied for thermal barrier coatings as well as
   perovskites for gas separation membranes. In particular, new plasma
   spray processes like suspension plasma spraying and plasma
   spray-physical vapor deposition are considered. In some cases, plasma
   diagnostics are applied to analyze the processing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years witnessed increased interest in intrinsically disordered
   proteins and regions. These proteins and regions are abundant and
   possess unique structural features and a broad functional repertoire
   that complements ordered proteins. However, modern studies on the
   abundance and functions of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions
   are relatively limited in size and scope of their analysis. To fill this
   gap, we performed a broad and detailed computational analysis of over 6
   million proteins from 59 archaea, 471 bacterial, 110 eukaryotic and 325
   viral proteomes. We used arguably more accurate consensus-based disorder
   predictions, and for the first time comprehensively characterized
   intrinsic disorder at proteomic and protein levels from all significant
   perspectives, including abundance, cellular localization, functional
   roles, evolution, and impact on structural coverage. We show that
   intrinsic disorder is more abundant and has a unique profile in
   eukaryotes. We map disorder into archaea, bacterial and eukaryotic
   cells, and demonstrate that it is preferentially located in some
   cellular compartments. Functional analysis that considers over 1,200
   annotations shows that certain functions are exclusively implemented by
   intrinsically disordered proteins and regions, and that some of them are
   specific to certain domains of life. We reveal that disordered regions
   are often targets for various post-translational modifications, but
   primarily in the eukaryotes and viruses. Using a phylogenetic tree for
   14 eukaryotic and 112 bacterial species, we analyzed relations between
   disorder, sequence conservation and evolutionary speed. We provide a
   complete analysis that clearly shows that intrinsic disorder is
   exceptionally and uniquely abundant in each domain of life.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, LSBT-LDC (La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3-La0.4Ce0.6O1.8) was
   successfully prepared by impregnating LSBT and LDC solutions on porous
   YSZ matrix. The prepared anode material exhibited higher catalytic
   performance and better resistance against carbon deposition than LSBT
   anode material in 5000 ppm H2S containing methane. Electrochemical
   impedance spectra (EIS) characterizations revealed that the addition of
   LDC significantly reduces the activation polarization resistance.
   Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results indicated that the
   distribution of impregnated oxides in the matrix was uniform. The
   results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   temperature-programed oxidation (TPO) indicated that LSBT-LDC anode
   could enhance the tolerance against carbon deposition. The gas
   chromatography (GC) analysis proved that the modification of LDC could
   effectively promote the activation of methane and contribute to remove
   carbon deposition formed on the catalyst simultaneously. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD) was used to prepare 500 nm long Ni
   nanopillars directly on glassy carbon disc electrodes (Ni-GLAD/GC).
   Ni-GLAD\{Pt\}/GC core-layer nanopillars were prepared by depositing Pt
   on the Ni-GLAD substrate via a novel rotating disc electrode
   galvanostatic deposition, where a stationary blackened Pt counter
   electrode served as the Pt source. Scanning electron microscopy, cyclic
   voltammetry, and inductively-coupled mass spectrometry were employed to
   characterize the deposits. Results indicated that the Pt was deposited
   in a conformal manner on the Ni-GLAD giving a loading of 11.6 mu g. The
   Ni-GLAD\{Pt\}/GC electrode was ca. three fold more active than a
   \{Pt\}/GC (made with the same deposition in the absence of Ni) towards
   the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 1.0 M KOH. As well, long term
   potentiostatic ORR studies showed the Ni-GLAD\{Pt\}/GC deposit was more
   durable than the \{Pt\}/GC, with the former completely retaining its
   initial performance after 5000 s polarization at 0.85 V vs. RHE, while
   \{Pt\}/GC lost 38\% of its activity. Subsequent control experiments in
   the absence of O-2 showed that such decay was not due to loss of Pt over
   the prolonged ORR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wind energy is going to be a significant part of electric energy
   generation in the very near future. However, in addition to its
   intermittent nature that could lead to major difficulties for power
   system reliability and stability, the conventional control applied to
   wind turbines and their generators, usually doubly-fed induction
   generators (DFIGs), does not allow them to participate in frequency
   regulation, whether short or long term. Moreover, the use of wind
   generators for autonomous frequency regulation is becoming an essential
   objective in power grids with reduced inertia and isolatedmicrogrid
   operation. While droop-control is suggested by many researchers to solve
   these problems, detailed analysis of droop-controlled DFIG units in
   microgrids has not been reported. To fill-out this gap, this paper
   presents torque-and power-droop implementations in DFIG-based units by
   some simple modifications in the conventional control and then, bymeans
   of small-signal modeling and eigen-value studies, shows how both
   techniques influence frequency stability. Sensitivity studies, with
   respect to the presence of turbine-and inverter-based generators in
   microgrids; and impacts of pitch-angle controller, wind speed variation
   and isolated mode operation with only wind-generators, are conducted.
   Time-domain simulation is utilized to verify the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents qualitative and quantitative analysis of single and
   multiphase flow in a single fracture based on experimental results and
   demonstrates relationships between the roughness and fluid movement and
   distribution.
   Experiments were conducted on seven perfectly-matching and
   tightly-closed rough model fractures reproduced from the single
   fractures of lithologically different seven rock blocks that were
   jointed artificially through laboratory indirect tensile tests.
   Transparent upper and opaque lower walls of these models facilitated the
   visualization of the flow experiments. Rough surfaces of the model
   fractures were first digitized. Then, using the gathered data in
   variogram analysis, surface roughness was quantified by fractal
   dimension. Another roughness quantification parameter was also handled
   as the ratio between total fracture surface area and planar surface
   area. Experimental measurements of flow were quantitatively correlated
   to surface roughness under different normal loading (aperture)
   conditions. Also, constant rate immiscible displacement experiments were
   performed to assess the roughness effect represented by seven different
   lithologies and wettability effect controlled by the material used in
   manufacturing the fracture samples on the residual saturation
   development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Single phase water flow experiments were performed on seven tightly
   closed, rough model fractures. Each model has mirror-image transparent
   upper and opaque lower walls reproduced from the original single
   fractures created by laboratory indirect tensile tests of different rock
   types. The experiments were conducted under both non-loading and normal
   loading conditions as well as in two opposite injection directions.
   Surface roughness of model fractures was quantified using variogram
   fractal dimension.
   While a short linear portion was distinguished in the beginning,
   pressure versus injection rate curves showed nonlinear characteristic at
   higher values. This nonlinearity was attributed to the predominance of
   fracture expansion compensating the turbulence effect. This was the case
   regardless of injection direction and loading. The compensation of
   turbulence effect developed earlier for rough fractures compared to the
   smooth parallel plate model and was longer for the fractures with higher
   fractal dimensions. Transmissivity values showed a decrease with
   increasing fractal dimensions and normal loading, and also exhibited
   directional-dependent behaviour. The percentages of water-invaded wet
   planar areas showed a tendency to decrease with increasing fractal
   dimension. This relationship was more obvious with a higher correlation
   when the fractal dimension was replaced by the ratio of fracture surface
   area to the apparent fracture area, which was used as another parameter
   to quantify the roughness. The percentage of the dry planar areas that
   do not involve any flow could be as high as 20\% and is controlled by
   tortuous flow channeling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the solvent type and operation conditions on the
   high-temperature thermal gradient interaction chromatography (HT-TGIC)
   of ethylene homopolymers, ethylene-1-octene copolymers, and their blends
   are investigated. While the HT-TGIC profiles of single polymers measured
   with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) and chloronaphthalene (CN) are
   similar, they are always narrower when o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) is used,
   particularly for samples with lower 1-octene fractions. Significant
   differences between the experimental and the calculated profiles of
   binary blends are observed with all three solvents, but better peak
   separation is seen when the ODCB is used. Having higher fractions of a
   1-octene-poor component in the blend causes a more significant
   distortion of the shape expected for the peak from the component with
   the higher 1-octene fraction. The effect of the molecular weight on
   HT-TGIC profiles is also studied using samples with the same comonomer
   content and different molecular weights. Samples with low molecular
   weight have broader distributions and significant lower-temperature
   tails, particularly when TCB is used. Chain crystallization after
   adsorption effects may also play a minor role for low-comonomer samples.
   Finally, HT-TGIC profiles are compared with their equivalent
   crystallization elution fractionation (CEF) profiles. The HT-TGIC curves
   are broader than the equivalent CEF profiles, but these differences
   decrease as the comonomer content increases.}},

Title = {{Mineral carbon storage in pre-treated ultramafic ores}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{43-54}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Mineral carbon sequestration (MCS) is a type of carbon storage based on
   natural rock weathering processes where CO2, dissolved in rainwater,
   reacts with alkaline minerals to form solid carbonates. Although MCS has
   advantages over other carbon storage techniques, an economic MCS process
   has not yet been developed. Two approaches were taken in this work to
   attempt to reduce the cost of MCS. The first approach was to use a waste
   material, serpentine waste from ultramafic nickel ore processing, as a
   feedstock. The second approach was to develop pre-treatments to increase
   the carbon storage capacity of the feedstock. Two pre-treatments were
   investigated in this work, including microwave pre-treatment and
   leaching with ligands at neutral to alkaline pH. The carbon uptake of
   ultramafic ores was found to increase with increasing microwave
   pre-treatment after a threshold heating time of 4 min was surpassed. A
   maximum carbon uptake of 18.3 g CO2/100 g ore (corresponding to a
   carbonate conversion of 36.6\%) was observed for microwave pre-treated
   ore. The increase in carbon uptake was attributed primarily to the
   conversion of serpentine to olivine in ultramafic ores that occurs as
   result of microwave pretreatment. The effect of five different ligands
   (catechol, citrate, EDTA, oxalate and tiron) on the carbon uptake of
   ultramafic ores was investigated. Of the ligands tested, only catechol
   and tiron were found to both improve the leaching of magnesium from the
   ores and the quantity of CO2 stored. A maximum carbon uptake of 9.7
   g/100 g ore (corresponding to a carbonate conversion of 19.3\%) was
   observed for ultramafic ore pre-leached and carbonated in tiron solution
   at pH 10. This is the first time ligands have been reported to improve
   the carbon uptake of mineral carbon sequestration feedstock. Although
   process optimization work was not conducted, both microwave
   pre-treatment and leaching with ligands at neutral to alkaline pH show
   promise as ways to lower the cost of MCS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this brief, we explore the use of conformal mapping theory to reduce
   the complexity in PDE backstepping boundary observer design. The
   technique is applied to a genetic analysis microchip that features a
   collocated sensor-actuator architecture in which the temperature of the
   reaction chamber is the spatially distributed control variable. The size
   and structure of the microchip do not allow for sensor placement within
   the reaction chamber, making temperature estimation mandatory. The PDE
   backstepping boundary observer design is chosen to provide real-time
   data from the temperature inside the microchip. The standard PDE
   backstepping boundary observer design results in a partial differential
   equation for the kernel function with double the spatial dimension of
   the original problem, which makes the design intractable for the
   problems with dimensions higher than one. We show that the spatial
   domain of the original problem can be reduced with the use of the
   conformal mapping. The resulting observer is tested and experimentally
   validated, shown excellent performance with respect to the spacial L2
   norm of the estimation error.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a clarification study to identify the potential
   resonance phenomenon between photovoltaic (PV) inverters and the
   distribution system. LCL and LC filters are widely applied in PV
   inverters to mitigate high-order harmonic components generated by PV
   inverters. There is a possibility that these filters will excite
   harmonic resonance by interacting with the system impedance. The
   mechanism of this phenomenon is investigated here by mathematical
   analysis and measurement. The results indicate that the resonance can be
   attenuated if the damping resistance, such as damping resistor and
   residential linear loads, is large enough. Alternatively, three sets of
   field tests are conducted in the laboratory to verify and clarify the
   potential harmonic resonance and its factors. Furthermore, a full case
   of an actual North American distribution system with PV installations is
   also studied. The results indicate that the harmonic resonance caused by
   the PV filter is almost attenuated and cannot cause serious problems. At
   the same time, the filter may have some advantages in mitigating
   harmonics. Finally, to complete this paper, other sustainable energy
   resources with voltage-source converters (VSCs) are compared.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of alternative micromechanical models
   on the macroscopic behavior of a functionally graded plate based on
   classical and shear-deformation plate theories. Several micromechanical
   models are tested to obtain the effective material properties of a
   two-phase particle composite as a function of the volume fraction of
   particles which continuously varies through the thickness of a
   functionally graded plate. The static, buckling, and free- and
   forced-vibration analyses are conducted for a simply-supported
   functionally graded plate resting on a Pasternak-type elastic
   foundation. The volume fraction of particles are assumed to change
   according to the power-law, Sigmoid, and exponential functions. The
   governing partial differential equations are solved in the spatial
   coordinate by Navier solution, while a numerical time integration
   technique is employed to treat the problem in the time domain. Finally,
   the numerical results are provided to reveal the effect of explicit
   micromechanical models such as Voigt, Reuss, Hashin-Shtrikman bounds,
   and LRVE as well as the semi-explicit model of self-consistent on the
   static and dynamic displacement and stress fields, critical buckling
   load, and fundamental frequency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Overdue Invoice Management: Markov Chain Approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The gross domestic product (GDP) of the Canadian construction industry
   in 2012 amounted to \$ 111 billion, all having been exchanged in the
   form of invoices. In fact, a typical construction company processes tens
   of thousands of invoices for payment annually. There are two significant
   challenges associated with this invoice processing: (1) process costs
   due to remuneration of the construction owner's highly paid personnel,
   and (2) the cost of delayed invoice payments, which is typically a cost
   absorbed by the contractor that is consequently added to the overall
   project cost. Ensuring on-time payment of invoices, even when funds are
   available, can be a challenging exercise because of variety, volume, and
   the unpredictable number of received invoices. These realities make
   overdue invoices a pressing problem to be addressed, which in the long
   term leads to loss in profit and damaged reputation for both contractors
   and owners. The research presented in this paper utilizes a cohort
   Markov model to evaluate invoice processing. It seeks to identify and
   rank bottlenecks to highlight and prioritize opportunities for process
   improvement, thereby leading to a null-overdue invoice-processing
   approach. Furthermore, given the stochastic nature of invoice
   processing, various probabilistic sensitivity analyses are proposed,
   including an empirical approach that can be used at the experimental
   design stage where data are either limited or unavailable. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The in-plane dynamic crushing behaviors and energy-absorbed
   characteristics of honeycombs with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) have
   been studied by means of explicit dynamic finite element analysis (DFEA)
   using ANSYS/LS-DYNA. First, the honeycomb models filled with different
   reentrant cells by the variation of micro-cell configuration parameters
   (cell-wall angle and shape ratio) are established. The respective
   influences of micro-structure and impact velocities on the deformation
   behaviors, the dynamic plateau stresses and the absorbed energy of
   reentrant honeycombs are explored in detail. It is shown that owing to
   the variation of cell micro-structure, reentrant honeycombs display
   different macro-/micro- deformation properties during the crushing. For
   the given impact velocity, the dynamic plateau stresses are related to
   the shape ratio by a power law and to the cell-wall angle by
   least-square curves. And they are also proportional to the square of
   impact velocities for a high impact velocity. Based on the finite
   element simulated results and one-dimensional shock wave theory, an
   empirical formula for auxetic honeycomb to predict the dynamic plateau
   stress is derived in terms of relative density and impact velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteria in natural and artificial environments often reside in
   self-organized, integrated communities known as biofilms. Biofilms are
   highly structured entities consisting of bacterial cells embedded in a
   matrix of self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The
   EPS matrix acts like a biological `glue' enabling microbes to adhere to
   and colonize a wide range of surfaces. Once integrated into biofilms,
   bacterial cells can withstand various forms of stress such as
   antibiotics, hydrodynamic shear and other environmental challenges.
   Because of this, biofilms of pathogenic bacteria can be a significant
   health hazard often leading to recurrent infections. Biofilms can also
   lead to clogging and material degradation; on the other hand they are an
   integral part of various environmental processes such as carbon
   sequestration and nitrogen cycles. There are several determinants of
   biofilm morphology and dynamics, including the genotypic and phenotypic
   states of constituent cells and various environmental conditions. Here,
   we present an overview of the role of relevant physical processes in
   biofilm formation, including propulsion mechanisms, hydrodynamic
   effects, and transport of quorum sensing signals. We also provide a
   survey of microfluidic techniques utilized to unravel the associated
   physical mechanisms. Further, we discuss the future research areas for
   exploring new ways to extend the scope of the microfluidic approach in
   biofilm studies.}},

Abstract = {{Coke drums as major pressure vessels in delayed coking process
   experience cyclic thermal and mechanical loading during operation. The
   elastic-plastic behavior of coke drums including global and local (hot
   and cold spot) stress distribution has been analyzed using finite
   element analysis (FEA) method in our previous study. Here, instead of
   using FEA simulations, simplified theoretical models (STM) for global
   and local stress determination are developed. The global stress model is
   developed based on a single cladded shell element with temperature and
   pressure loading cycle. The local stress model is built on an
   axisymmetric circular cladded plate experiencing a non-uniform
   temperature distribution history. With the same input data, stress and
   strain values estimated by the STM are consistent with those from the
   FEA. An ease-of-use software package with built-in STMs is developed. It
   is the objective of this paper to show that STM can be a very time- and
   cost-saving analysis tool for general industrial users compared to
   professional commercial FEA software.}},

Abstract = {{A novel ruthenium complex developed by Casey exhibits some outstanding
   features such as effective antidimerization, highlighted catalytic
   activity and a mild reaction condition. Density functional theory (DFT)
   was used to explore the catalytic cycle of the hydrogenation of PhCHO
   catalyzed by this enhanced ruthenium complex. The catalytic cycle of
   aldehyde hydrogenation involves two stages, hydrogen transfer and
   regeneration of the active catalyst, which can be achieved by means of a
   concerted outer-sphere hydrogen transfer and an intramolecular hydrogen
   migration, respectively. Hydrogen transfer is the ratedetermining step
   in the total catalytic hydrogenation cycle, having a low free energy
   barrier of 16.2 kcal mol(-1). The hydrogenated product, alcohol, can
   remarkably improve the regeneration activity of the catalyst via an
   alcohol-mediated intramolecular hydrogen migration. The free energy
   barrier of regeneration of the active catalyst is only 13.8 kcal
   mol(-1). This catalytic hydrogenation of aldehyde is demonstrated to be
   an autocatalytic process.}},

Abstract = {{Natural zeolite supported nano TiO2 photocatalysts were prepared by a
   modified electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) method. First,
   -mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane with sulfhydryl (?SH) functional groups
   was modified on the zeolite powders by using a dry process'. Second,
   silane with ?SH functional groups was oxidized to sulfonate (?SO3H)
   groups by using a hydrogen peroxide/glacial acetic acid mixed solution,
   and the surface of ?SO3H silane-zeolite was electronegative charged due
   to the ionization of ?SO3H. Third, the hydrolytic titanium polycation
   from TiCl4 solution assembled onto the electronegative charged zeolite
   under electrostatic attraction in the reaction solutions. Finally,
   zeolite supported nano TiO2 photocatalysts can be obtained after the
   above compounds calcined at certain temperature. The samples were
   characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)
   surface areas, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The
   photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the
   degradation of methyl orange in aqueous solution. The results showed
   that ESA method effectively improved the composite efficiency of zeolite
   with TiO2. The photocatalysts prepared by ESA method exhibited higher
   photocatalytic and recycling activities than that of traditional method.

Abstract = {{This paper relies on the principles of inexact computing to alleviate
   the issues arising in static masking by voting for reliable computing. A
   scheme that utilizes approximate voting is proposed; it is referred to
   as inexact double modular redundancy (IDMR). IDMR does not resort to
   triplication, thus saving overhead due to modular replication; moreover,
   this scheme is adaptive in its operation, i.e., it allows a threshold to
   determine the validity of the module outputs. IDMR operates by initially
   establishing the difference between the values of the outputs of the two
   modules; only if the difference is below a preset threshold, then the
   voter calculates the average value of the two module outputs. An
   extensive analysis of the voting circuits and an application to image
   processing are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the development of a state feedback regulator for a
   class of first order hyperbolic PDE systems with spatially varying
   coefficients and single point observation. The plant is assumed to be
   exponentially stabilizable and driven by a linear finite dimensional
   exosystem which is neutral stable and generates the reference signal and
   disturbance for the plant. The regulator design problem is to control
   the fixed plant such that the plant output tracks the reference signal
   and/or rejects the disturbance. Under the standard assumption of
   stabilizability, this work shows that the solvability of a constrained
   Sylvester equation is sufficient to guarantee the solvability of the
   regulator problem. Moreover, the Riccati and Lyapunov equations are
   utilized to provide a choice of stabilizing feedback gain which
   guarantees the closed-loop stability. An adequate numerical example of
   constant tracking for the first order hyperbolic PDE system with
   spatially varying coefficients is explored within the proposed regulator
   design.}},

Abstract = {{The ever increasing demands for mobile Internet access have resulted a
   significant growth in bandwidth usage. Multi-way relay networks (MWRNs)
   can address this challenge by improving the system spectral efficiency.
   In this work, we further improve the spectral efficiency of MWRNs by
   proposing a novel linear beamforming design, namely partial zero-forcing
   (PZF), for MWRNs with a multiple-input-multiple-output relay. Compared
   to zero-forcing (ZF), in PZF, the constraints on the relay beamforming
   are relaxed such that only partial user-interference, instead of all, is
   canceled at the relay. After receiving the relay's signal, the users
   eliminate the remaining interferences through self-interference and
   successive interference cancellation. By taking such two-stage
   interference cancellation, PZF better exploits the degrees-of-freedom in
   MWRNs and achieves higher data rates than ZF.}},

Abstract = {{Due to cost constraints, geological conditions are investigated using
   boreholes. However, this means conditions are never known exactly,
   particularly for deep and long tunnels, because uncertainties exist
   between neighboring boreholes. Simulation can deal with underlying
   uncertainty, and offers benefits to project planners in the development
   of better alternatives and optimization. This research developed a
   simulation model using Bayes theorem and Markov chain, aiming to
   continuously update geological conditions of one-meter sections for
   tunnel construction, given the geological condition of the previous
   one-meter section is observed as construction progresses. An actual
   tunneling project is used as a case study to demonstrate the
   applicability of the developed methodology. The impacts are analyzed and
   discussed in detail. The simulation results show that continuous updates
   during construction can significantly improve prediction of project
   performance by eliminating uncertainty in the original assumption. The
   model can be expanded to predict results of future geologic exploration
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{The use of discrete-event simulation (DES) in the construction and
   manufacturing industry has been increasing significantly over the past
   few decades. However, DES at present is mainly utilized during the
   construction planning phase as a planning tool, and it still remains a
   challenge to apply simulation during the execution phase for the purpose
   of construction control without an automated real-time data acquisition
   system. This study exploits an approach that involves the integration of
   a radio frequency identification (RFID) system and DES model in order to
   capture the real-time production state into the simulation model,
   thereby enabling real-time, simulation-based performance monitoring. The
   proposed methodology is implemented at Landmark Building Solutions, a
   wood-frame panel prefabrication plant in Edmonton, Canada. A simulation
   model is developed in Simphony. NET and integrated with the RFID system
   in order to enable the online simulation and to obtain real-time
   simulation results for the purpose of production control.}},

Abstract = {{Off-site construction is a shift toward a more efficient building
   process in terms of minimizing cost and decreasing duration of projects.
   However, since off-site construction consists of two separate phases, a
   comprehensive cost - time trade-off is essential. It gives control for
   the overall process where the direct and indirect effect of work
   performed on an individual task can be measured and evaluated with
   respect to the final project performance factors. The research presented
   in this paper develops a simulation model to study the dynamic
   relationship between off-site manufacturing and cost-time trade-off. A
   multi-objective analysis for two main indirect costs and inventory cost
   of the manufactured building components are proposed in order to provide
   a decision support system tool to clarify any ambiguity in the dynamic
   relationship between the project's two stages, and assist the manager to
   improve project planning and control.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic congestion has already been a distinctly serious problem in both
   developed and developing countries. Among the proposed methods to solve
   the traffic congestion problem, variable speed limit (VSL) is considered
   as one of the most promising methods. But to the traditional VSL, the
   speed limit sign and the control distance is fixed, which makes VSL lack
   deployment and control flexibility. Whereas, in connected vehicle (CV),
   which is a crossing field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS)
   and internet of things (IoT), control and deployment flexibility can
   both be achieved. Furthermore, a big data environment is formed in CV to
   solve the traffic problems. In this paper, connect vehicle-based
   variable speed limit (CV-VSL) is proposed, and a simulation platform
   SimIVC is used to study the influence of control distance. The results
   show that the improvement of traffic performance increases 0.72\% when
   the control distance is 270 metres than that of 250 metres, which means
   that the traffic performance can be further improved by CV-VSL.}},

Abstract = {{The properties and performance of lead-free solder alloys such as
   fluidity and wettability are defined by the alloy composition and
   solidification microstructure. Rapid solidification of metallic alloys
   is known to result in refined microstructures with reduced
   microsegregation and improved mechanical properties of the final
   products as compared to normal castings. The rapidly solidified Sn-based
   solders by melt spinning were shown to be suitable for soldering with
   low temperature and short soldering duration. In the present study,
   rapidly solidified Sn-0.7 wt.\%Cu droplets generated by impulse
   atomization (IA) were achieved as well as directional solidification
   under transient conditions at lower cooling rate. This paper reports on
   a comparative study of the rapidly solidified and the directionally
   solidified samples. Different but complementary characterization
   techniques were used to fully analyze the solidification microstructures
   of the samples obtained under the two cooling regimes. These include
   X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In
   order to compare the tensile strength and elongation to fracture of the
   directionally solidified ingot and strip castings with the atomized
   droplet, compaction and extrusion of the latter were carried out. It was
   shown that more balanced and superior tensile mechanical properties are
   available for the hot extruded samples from compacted as-atomized Sn-0.7
   wt.\%Cu droplets. Further, elongation-to-fracture was 2-3x higher than
   that obtained for the directionally solidified samples. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Approximate circuit design is an emerging paradigm in which a designer
   deliberately changes the specified Boolean function to reduce area,
   delay, and/or power consumption of a circuit. This paper focuses on the
   synthesis of approximate logic circuits (or ALS) under a given error
   constraint. In particular, we consider ALS for a two-level design under
   an error rate constraint. A dynamic programming-based algorithm is
   proposed to find a nearly optimal approximate function by identifying
   the most promising set of cubes to be added to the on-set of the
   original function. Then, an off-the-shelf two-level logic synthesis tool
   is applied to further optimize the sumof-product (SOP) expression. The
   experimental results show that the literal reduction is close to the
   optimal solution when the error rate constraint is tight and that more
   than 50\% literal reduction is achieved for error rate below 0.8\% for
   an 8-bit adder and a square root circuit.}},

   noise in a Phase Change Memory (PCM); this investigation is based on
   HSPICE simulation by taking into account cell-level (with its neighbors)
   and array-level considerations. State switching phenomena in binary PCM
   memories are dealt in detail to assess the impact of these two types of
   noise. It is shown that a lower feature size is of concern for flicker
   noise in terms of value and percentage variation (while not
   substantially affecting array-level performance). This paper also shows
   that spike noise has a radically different behavior: spike noise shows a
   dependency on the PCM resistance more than the type of state of the PCM.
   It increases substantially when the amorphous resistance increases and
   has a nearly constant value when the memory cell is changing to an
   amorphous state.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated a habitat compensation project on a lake-outlet
   stream in the Canadian Barrenlands. West Island Stream (WIS) was
   modified through the construction of nature-like fishway structures to
   increase habitat connectivity and allow fish access to productive
   habitat. The ecohydraulics of five pools were evaluated for resting
   habitat suitability for arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). An
   acoustic doppler velocimeter was used to measure point velocities within
   each pool on a 0.1 m x 0.1 m grid under flow conditions of 1.0, 9.9 and
   21.9 l/s. Arctic grayling were placed in WIS under each flow condition
   and their resting behaviour was observed. Results showed that fish
   preferred deep pools with large surface areas. Based on the findings of
   this studies, it is recommended that resting pools be designed to
   provide a minimum depth of 0.6 m, a minimum surface area of 1.4 m(2)
   (1.4 m length x 1.0 m width) and horizontal velocities less than 0.2 m/s

Abstract = {{In present study, a numerical model was built to predict the air
   requirement in a circular pipe system with changing slopes. A Volume of
   Fluid (VOF) type free surface model with blending functions on
   morphologic parameters were adopted and ANSYS CFX-14.0 was used for the
   modelling. A corresponding physical experiment was conducted to
   calibrate the numerical model and verify the accuracy of the numerical
   model. Water flow rate, air flow rate, water depth upstream and
   downstream of the jump and air velocity profile in headspace were
   measured and plotted with numerical modelling outcomes. It is found that
   the numerical model is able to model the bulk air mass flow rate with
   hydraulic jump and some of the detailed flow structures can be modeled
   relatively in good agreement with physical experiments. It is also found
   that the amount of air entrained into the system is higher than
   published data. Pressure gradient and the existence of water surface
   drag may act together on affecting the bulk air flow rate. The present
   numerical model has the potential in predicting more complicated flow
   scenarios such as flow with transient water discharge, supercritical
   water flow etc.}},

Title = {{Prescriptive analytics applied to brace treatment for AIS: a pilot
   demonstration}},
Journal = {{SCOLIOSIS AND SPINAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prescriptive analytics is a concept combining statistical
   and computer sciences to prescribe an optimal course of action, based on
   predictions of possible future events. In this simulation study we
   investigate using prescriptive analytics to recommend optimal in-brace
   corrections for braced Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) patients.
   The objectives were to estimate the efficacy of these recommendations,
   ultimately working toward improved brace design protocols.
   Methods: Data was obtained for 90 AIS patients who had finished brace
   treatment at our center (60 full-time and 30 nighttime braces). Rates of
   >= 6 degree progression were 53\% for daytime and 30\% for nighttime
   braces. A modeling technique previously developed by our group was used
   to predict these patients' likely treatment outcomes given a range of
   in-brace corrections - the model was blinded to the true outcomes during
   this process. Each patient's `recommended' correction was identified as
   the least aggressive correction resulting in a desirable predicted
   outcome. The efficacy of these recommendations was estimated using a
   technique called ``clinical trial simulation{''} (CTS). This technique
   used a statistical model to predict progression rate under the
   model-recommended treatment, and compared it to the true progression
   rate, observed retrospectively, under the actual treatment. Significance
   was calculated using a permutation test.
   Results: Model-recommended corrections ranged from 20\%-58\% for daytime
   and 65\%-130\% for nighttime braces, roughly corresponding with previous
   literature. Interestingly, in 37\% of cases the recommended correction
   was less than that which had actually been applied, suggesting some
   opportunity for less aggressive (more comfortable) braces without
   compromising treatment outcome. The CTS estimated 26\% fewer progressive
   cases using the model-recommended in-brace correction, over the actual
   correction observed retrospectively in the charts (p=0.05). The patients
   whose correction decreased under the model's recommendation did not show
   an increased progression rate.
   Conclusions: Optimal correction may be less than the maximum achievable
   correction. The preliminary results suggest that considering
   model-generated recommendations during brace fitting could improve
   outcomes. Future work will expand the system to recommend wear-times as
   well as corrections, improving its clinical relevance. We envision this
   pilot demonstration to promote development of model-based decision
   support in scoliosis treatment, and prompt discussion on its future
   role.}},

Title = {{Measurement of axial vertebral rotation using three-dimensional
   ultrasound images}},
Journal = {{SCOLIOSIS AND SPINAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Axial vertebral rotation (AVR) is one of the important
   parameters to evaluate the severity and predict the progression of
   scoliosis. However, the AVR measurements on radiographs may
   underestimate its actual value. This pilot study investigated a new
   three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound method to measure AVR.
   Methods: Three cadaveric vertebrae T7, L1, and L3 were scanned with a 3D
   medical ultrasound system. Nine sets of ultrasound data, the vertebral
   rotation from 0 to 40 degrees with 5 degrees increments, were recorded
   from each vertebra. An in-house program was developed to reconstruct and
   measure the 3D vertebral images. The rotation of each reconstructed
   vertebra was determined by the angle between the line going through the
   centres of either laminae (L-L) or transverse processes (TP-TP) and a
   reference vertical plane. Three raters measured the rotation in 3
   sessions, in which they used the mouse pointer to select the L-L or
   TP-TP according to their knowledge of vertebral anatomy. The program
   detected the 3D coordinates of these points and calculated the AVR. The
   intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to calculate the
   intra-reliability and inter-reliability. The mean absolute difference
   (MAD +/- SD) and the range of difference (RD) between the actual values
   and the average measurements of each rater were computed to evaluate the
   accuracy of methods.
   Results: When rotation was greater than 30 degrees for both L1 and L3,
   all raters found it difficult to determine one of the lamina areas due
   to the lack of ultrasound information in an area behind the spinous
   process. Therefore, the corresponding measurements were excluded. The
   ICC values of the intra-reliability (L-L, TP-TP) for the three raters
   were (0.987, 0.991), (0.989, 0.998) and (0.997, 1.000), respectively;
   meanwhile, the inter-reliability were 0.991 for (L-L) and 0.992 for
   (TP-TP). All ICC values were greater than 0.98 indicating both methods
   were highly reliable. The MAD +/- SD values (L-L, TP-TP) for the three
   raters were (1.5 +/- 0.3 degrees, 1.2 +/- 0.2 degrees), (1.6 +/- 0.3
   degrees, 1.3 +/- 0.3 degrees), and (1.7 +/- 0.5 degrees, 0.9 +/- 0.2
   degrees), respectively. The RD (L-L, TP-TP) were (0-4.5 degrees, 0-3.5
   degrees), (0-5.1 degrees, 0-4.3 degrees), and (0-5.1 degrees, 0-2.8
   degrees) for the three raters, respectively.
   Conclusions: The (L-L) and (TP-TP) methods could be used to measure AVR
   reliability from the 3D ultrasound images.}},

Abstract = {{Shear tab connections are considered amongst the most popular shear
   connections in design and construction. Low fabrication expenses and
   ease of assembly are the two key factors contributing to the
   desirability of this type of connection. In spite of the benefits, some
   problems appear in the construction of special cases. When the shear tab
   is intended to be framed into the web of a supporting column or girder,
   the flanges of the supporting element form an obstacle in field
   construction. To overcome this issue, one solution is to extend the
   shear tab beyond the supporting element flanges. This configuration is
   referred to as an ``extended shear tab{''}. Although extended shear tabs
   are negligibly different from conventional shear tabs in terms of
   fabrication and erection costs, their behavior is significantly changed
   due to the considerably increased length. Moreover, instability issues
   may arise resulting from the increased slenderness. To investigate the
   behavior of extended shear tabs, a comprehensive research program
   consisting of both numerical and experimental studies has been defined.
   This paper outlines some of the results and observations acquired from
   the testing phase of the program, which is conducted on full-scale
   extended shear tab specimens. The test matrix is organized to
   investigate the effect of a number of connection parameters on the
   overall behavior of the extended shear tab connection. The parameters
   subjected to investigation in this paper include shear tab length, shear
   tab thickness and bolt configuration. The behavior of these specimens is
   studied in terms of connection capacity, failure mode and shear load
   eccentricity. Results of the tests together with those of the numerical
   modelling will be used to propose reliable and efficient guidelines for
   the design of extended shear tabs.}},

Abstract = {{Steel Plate Shear Walls (SPSWs) are efficient and economical energy
   dissipating systems for buildings located in regions of high seismic
   risk. In spite of many benefits of SPSWs, however, their overturning
   stiffness is relatively low, especially in mid-to-high rise buildings.
   Therefore, there is a need for incorporating other structural elements
   in conjunction with such systems to resist high overturning moments
   resulting from lateral loads. A logical solution that can be effectively
   used in SPSW systems is to rigidly connect the girders of adjacent bays
   to the columns of SPSWs (on both sides) forming an interacting system of
   shear wall and moment frame in which the adjacent girders act as
   outriggers to reduce the overturning moments in the SPSW. However,
   insufficient information exists on behavior and efficiency of such
   structural system, herein referred to as SPSW with Outriggers (SPSW-O).
   As part of a comprehensive research project on SPSWs being conducted at
   the University of Alberta, this paper describes different potential
   SPSW-O options and discusses their effectiveness in improving the
   flexural stiffness of the system. The performance of these options is
   evaluated for 20-story SPSW-O systems using nonlinear static and
   response history analyses.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, we propose a new
   approach to data clustering. The objective of this clustering is to
   adhere to some principles of grouping exercised by humans when
   determining a structure in data. Compared with other clustering
   approaches, the proposed approach offers more detailed insight into the
   cluster's structure and the underlying decision making process. This
   contributes to the enhanced interpretability of the results via the
   representation capabilities of AFS theory. The effectiveness of the
   proposed approach is demonstrated by using real-world data, and the
   obtained results show that the performance of the clustering is
   comparable with other fuzzy rule-based clustering methods, and benchmark
   fuzzy clustering methods FCM and K-means. Experimental studies have
   shown that the proposed fuzzy clustering method can discover the
   clusters in the data and help specify them in terms of some
   comprehensive fuzzy rules. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the lectins and glycopolymers from the nanofiber surface. As expected,
   once the glycopolymers are displaced, no lectins were adhered to the

Abstract = {{The goal of the present study is to provide a detailed description of
   rheological and wetting properties of barley protein and establish a
   linkage between these properties and the protein structure. In order to
   achieve this goal, we first measure the interfacial properties,
   including interfacial tension and interfacial rheology (viscous modulus
   and elastic modulus). Secondly, we investigate the secondary structural
   changes of the deamidated barley protein and hydrolysates through FTIR.
   Thirdly, we measure molecular weight by using HPLC. Finally, we
   determine the wetting properties with dynamic contact angle
   measurements. The solubility of barley protein can be greatly enhanced
   by applying deamidation process. After deamidation, more flexible
   secondary structures are detected through FTIR analysis. These changes
   in secondary structure are reflected in interfacial properties. The
   interfacial protein concentration and rheological properties of protein
   samples are determined by interfacial tension measurement. The
   equilibrium interfacial tension and contact angle for protein solution
   decrease as the concentration of protein increases. The deamidated
   protein with large molecular weight parts shows the highest elastic
   modulus, while hydrolysates with low molecular weight shows the highest
   viscous modulus. The results also indicate that deamidated protein forms
   more stable film at interface compared to the low molecular
   hydrolysates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   spectroscopy and XRD were employed to detail the fouling phenomenology
   for a heated stainless steel wire immersed in atmospheric bottoms
   fraction crude oil, exposed for 1-1400 min. A key microstructural
   observation is the transformation of the wire's as-received near-surface
   textured austenitic grain structure into a micron scale (e. g. similar
   to 10 mu m at 1400 min) highly porous inner-sulfide/chromium oxide
   bilayer composite. Additionally, we observe significant localized
   sulfidic attack into the bulk of the metal. During testing, an iron
   sulfide (pyrrhotite Fe-(1 (chi)) S) corrosion product forms almost
   instantaneously at the metal surface, followed by coke formation around
   its periphery at longer times. This temporal sequence, combined with the
   observation that the thicker regions of the foulant are clearly
   associated with detached plumes of the sulfide, leads us to argue that
   the sulfide is essential for promoting organic fouling. This is brought
   about by the sulfide's action as a potent dehydrogenation catalyst that
   drives the transformation of pitch to coke. We hypothesize that the
   tremendous fouling inhibition effect of the thiophene originates from
   its adsorption onto the sulfide surfaces, thereby blocking the
   dehydrogenation reactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It remains unclear if changes of the cerebral cortex occur gradually
   from childhood to adulthood, or if adolescence marks a differential
   period of cortical development. In the current study of 90 healthy
   volunteers aged 5-32 years (48 females, 85 right handed) with 180 scans
   (2 scans for each participantwith similar to 4 year gaps), thinning of
   overall mean thickness and across the four major cortical lobes
   bilaterally was observed across this full age span. However, the
   thinning rate, calculated as Delta cortical thickness / Delta age
   (mm/year) between scans of each participant, revealed an accelerated
   cortical thinning during adolescence, which was preceded by less
   thinning in childhood and followed by decelerated thinning in young
   adulthood. Males and females showed similarly faster thinning rates
   during adolescence relative to young adults. The underlying basis and
   role of accelerated cortical thinning during adolescence for cognition,
   behaviour and disorders that appear at such a stage of development
   remains to be determined in future work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Time-varying mesh stiffness is a periodic function caused by the change
   of the number of the contact tooth pairs and the contact positions of
   the gear teeth. In this study, we have derived the analytical equations
   of the time-varying mesh stiffness of a planetary gear set using the
   potential energy method. Three simulations are conducted with a common
   planetary gear set under fixed carrier, fixed ring gear, and fixed sun
   gear. The results indicate that the obtained time-varying mesh stiffness
   can reflect the stiffness variation, and the proposed approaches can be
   extended in the future to model the stiffness of a planetary gear set

Abstract = {{We have developed a sensitive and selective sensor for hydrocarbon/water
   vapor mixtures using nanomechanical infrared (IR) spectroscopy with a
   porous silicon (P-Si) microcantilever. Facile and direct anodization
   process is utilized to fabricate vertically aligned nanopores of 20-50
   nm diameters on a plain silicon microcantilever. The effective Young's
   modulus and surface area of a P-Si microcantilever can be easily
   controlled by the thickness of the anodized P-Si layer. Here we
   demonstrate the detection of 1 wt\% naphtha/water vapor mixtures using
   nanoporous cantilever IR spectroscopy. Nanoporous nature of the
   cantilever surface enhances its thermomechanical sensitivity. In
   addition, trapping the volatile hydrocarbon molecules in the nanowells
   increases the analyte concentration on the surface. Nanomechanical IR
   spectra of adsorbed vapors were obtained by plotting the deflection
   amplitudes of the microcantilever as a function of the illuminating IR
   wavenumber. The mass of the adsorbed vapors was determined from
   variations in the resonance frequency of the cantilever. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Dimensionality reduction is an important and challenging task in machine
   learning and data mining. Feature selection and feature extraction are
   two commonly used techniques for decreasing dimensionality of the data
   and increasing efficiency of learning algorithms. Specifically, feature
   selection realized in the absence of class labels, namely unsupervised
   feature selection, is challenging and interesting. In this paper, we
   propose a new unsupervised feature selection criterion developed from
   the viewpoint of subspace learning, which is treated as a matrix
   factorization problem. The advantages of this work are four-fold. First,
   dwelling on the technique of matrix factorization, a unified framework
   is established for feature selection, feature extraction and clustering.
   Second, an iterative update algorithm is provided via matrix
   factorization, which is an efficient technique to deal with
   high-dimensional data. Third, an effective method for feature selection
   with numeric data is put forward, instead of drawing support from the
   discretization process. Fourth, this new criterion provides a sound
   foundation for embedding kernel tricks into feature selection. With this
   regard, an algorithm based on kernel methods is also proposed. The
   algorithms are compared with four state-of-the-art feature selection
   methods using six publicly available datasets. Experimental results
   demonstrate that in terms of clustering results, the proposed two
   algorithms come with better performance than the others for almost all
   datasets we experimented with here. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new architecture of a fuzzy decision tree based on
   fuzzy rules - fuzzy rule based decision tree (FRDT) and provides a
   learning algorithm. In contrast with ``traditional{''} axis-parallel
   decision trees in which only a single feature (variable) is taken into
   account at each node, the node of the proposed decision trees involves a
   fuzzy rule which involves multiple features. Fuzzy rules are employed to
   produce leaves of high purity. Using multiple features for a node helps
   us minimize the size of the trees. The growth of the FRDT is realized by
   expanding an additional node composed of a mixture of data coming from
   different classes, which is the only non-leaf node of each layer. This
   gives rise to a new geometric structure endowed with linguistic terms
   which are quite different from the ``traditional{''} oblique decision
   trees endowed with hyperplanes as decision functions. A series of
   numeric studies are reported using data coming from UCI machine learning
   data sets. The comparison is carried out with regard to
   ``traditional{''} decision trees such as C4.5, LADtree, BFTree,
   SimpleCart, and NBTree. The results of statistical tests have shown that
   the proposed FRDT exhibits the best performance in terms of both
   accuracy and the size of the produced trees. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Evidence That the Heterogeneity of a T4 Population Is the Result of
   Heritable Traits}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Many bacteriophage populations display heterogeneity in their adsorption
   characteristics; a portion of the phage population remains free in
   solution throughout adsorption experiments (residual fraction). This
   residual fraction generally constitutes a minority of phages that
   exhibit significantly slower adsorption kinetics than the main phage
   stock (main fraction). While this phenomenon is likely the result of
   evolutionary driving forces, the present study demonstrates that the
   residual fraction is not always the result of phenotypic variations
   within a single genotype, as is generally thought. Experiments with
   phage T4 showed that two subgroups with distinct adsorption traits that
   were passed on to their progeny could be isolated from the original
   phage stock. Sequencing of genes involved in adsorption revealed two
   point mutations in gene 37 of residual fraction isolates, which resulted
   in modifications to the long tail-fiber, the organelle of attachment and
   host cell recognition. Adsorption studies consistently showed that T4
   phage stocks amplified from residual fraction isolates had significantly
   lower adsorption efficiencies than those amplified from main fractions.
   The conducted experiments provide convincing evidence that the observed
   heterogeneity in T4 adsorption behavior is the result of conserved
   mutations to the phage genome and is not exclusively the result of
   phenotypic variations within the population. While it is believed high
   mutation rates exist to hasten phage adaptation, this study shows that
   this bet hedging strategy can also, in the short term, inadvertently
   handicap the phage's adsorption capabilities to a given host under
   normal infection conditions, resulting in the residual fraction observed
   in adsorption experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Strong, reversible underwater adhesion using gecko-inspired surfaces is
   achievable through the use of a hydrophobic structural material and does
   not require surface modification or suction cup effects for this
   adhesion to be effective. Increased surface energy can aid in dry
   adhesion in an air environment but strongly degrades wet adhesion via
   reduction of interfacial energy underwater. A direct comparison of
   structurally identical but chemically different mushroom shaped fibers
   shows that strong, reversible adhesion, even in a fully wetted, stable
   state, is feasible underwater if the structural material of the fibers
   is hydrophobic and the mating surface is not strongly hydrophilic. The
   exact adhesion strength will be a function of the underwater interfacial
   energy between surfaces and the specific failure modes of individual
   fibers. This underwater adhesion has been calculated to be potentially
   greater than the dry adhesion for specific combinations of hydrophobic
   surfaces.}},

   axis, 200-300 nm in the thickness of shell) is built up by irregular
   nanoparticles attached to each other, and corresponding to the ellipsoid
   with concentration gradient, the Co/Mn atomic ratios of core and shell
   are about 1.76:1 and 2.34:1, respectively. The good performance,
   including high initial discharge capacities (1433.3 mAhg(-1) at 0.1 Ag-1
   and 1248.4 mAhg(-1) at 0.4 Ag-1), advanced capacity retention (similar

Journal = {{CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{114}},

Abstract = {{The electrolyte (NaCl) influences on the sol-gel transition of the
   complex solution composed of oppositely charged nanocrystalline
   cellulose (NCC) and polyelectrolyte (quaternized hydroxyethylcellulose
   ethoxylate, QHEC) were investigated by the rheological means in the
   present paper. Winter and Chambon theory was applicable to describe the
   sol-gel transition, and the critical gel points have been successfully
   determined. When increasing the NaCl concentration, more NCC were needed
   to form a critical gel due to the screening of the electrostatic
   interaction, and the larger loss tangent and relaxation exponent (n)
   values at the gel point demonstrated a less elastic nature of the
   complex solution with more NaCl. The results indicated the gel network
   was composed of entanglements and association of QHEC (as polymer
   network), as well as the electrostatic adsorption interaction between
   QHEC chains and NCC rods (as cross-linking). With the addition of NaCl,
   the screening effect led to the enhancement of the entanglements and
   weakening of the electrostatic adsorption, however, the gel strength
   decreased with increasing the NaCl amount, suggesting the electrostatic
   adsorption interaction played a more dominant role than the
   entanglements when the gel was formed. Moreover, the exponents of the
   scaling law eta(0) alpha epsilon(-gamma) and G(e) alpha epsilon(z) of
   the QHEC/NCC/NaCl solution revealed that the scaling law n = z/(z +
   gamma) between n, gamma, and z was only feasible at the highest NaCl
   concentration, as a result of that the intermolecular electrostatic
   interaction was completely screened, indicating the scaling law was only
   feasible when intermolecular interaction was small enough to be
   neglected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The microdrop concentrating process, which is one of the manipulations
   in the microdrop platform of microfluidic technologies, is a useful
   technique, especially in biological applications. This process may
   encounter a solute precipitation within the droplet if the solute
   reaches its solubility limit. In the case of very small solid
   precipitates, the solid particle size will affect the solubility limit,
   and the Ostwald-Freundlich equation (OFE) describes this dependency.
   Including the OFE in analysis affects the design parameters for this
   type of system and the system's thermodynamic stability. Here, by means
   of Gibbsian surface thermodynamics, we provide the thermodynamic
   description and stability analysis of this system considering the role
   of the Ostwald-Freundlich equation. Previously we have investigated the
   stability of the system without considering the OFE, which is equivalent
   to using a constant solubility limit. Herein it is shown that the OFE

Abstract = {{Most existing methods for the state estimation in batch processes are
   similar to those for continuous processes, and these methods usually
   only consider the state dynamics within a single batch and ignore the
   dynamics across batches. In this paper, the state estimation in batch
   processes is investigated based on a two-dimensional state-space model
   by employing the Bayesian recursive algorithm. In addition to the
   dynamics along the time dimension (the dynamics within a single batch),
   the batch process is also characterized by the dynamics along the batch
   dimension (batch-to-batch dynamics). In the proposed method, both the
   batch-to-batch dynamics and the dynamics within a single batch are taken
   into account. The current state is dependent on the previous states both
   along the time dimension and along the batch dimension, so the filtering
   and smoothing for previous batches should be performed before doing
   current state estimation. In this way, the information on measurements
   from the previous batches as well as from the current batch can be
   incorporated into the estimation. The proposed method is illustrated and
   evaluated through a simple numerical example as well as a simulated
   two-state batch reaction process.}},

Abstract = {{Restructuring of monodisperse soot aggregates due to coatings of
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) derived from hydroxyl radical-initiated
   oxidation of toluene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, and benzene was
   investigated in a series of photo-oxidation (smog) chamber experiments.
   Soot aggregates were generated by combustion of ethylene using a McKenna
   burner, treated by denuding, size-selected by a differential mobility
   analyzer, and injected into a smog chamber, where they were exposed to
   low vapor pressure products of aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation, which
   formed SOA coatings. Aggregate restructuring began once a threshold
   coating mass was reached, and the degree of the subsequent restructuring
   increased with mass growth factor. Although significantly compacted,
   fully processed aggregates were not spherical, with a mass-mobility
   exponent of 2.78, so additional SOA was required to fill indentations
   between collapsed branches of the restructured aggregates before the
   dynamic shape factor of coated particles approached 1. Trends in
   diameter growth factor, effective density, and dynamic shape factor with
   increasing mass growth factor indicate distinct stages in soot aggregate
   processing by SOA coatings. The final degree and coating mass dependence

Abstract = {{The thermodynamics of adsorption and competitive interactions of five
   weak acids on a graphite surface was assessed in alkaline solutions.
   Adsorption of the acids in mono- and multicompound solutions followed
   their Freundlich isotherms which suggest a diversity of graphite
   adsorption sites as confirmed by the presence of carboxylic and phenolic
   groups observed on graphite surfaces. Thermodynamic calculations
   assigned the formation of the negatively charged assisted hydrogen bond
   (-CAHB) between ionized solutes and adsorbent surface groups as the
   possible adsorption mechanism. However, the similar pK(a) values of
   current acids resulted in comparable free energies for -CAHB formation
   (Delta G(-CAHB)) being less than solvation free energies (Delta
   G(Solv)). Thus, additional Delta G is supplemented by increased
   hydrophobicity due to proton exchange of ionized acids with water (Delta
   Delta G(Hydrophobicity)). Adsorption capacities and competition
   coefficients indicated that Delta Delta G(Hydrophobicity) values depend
   on the neutral and ionized acid Kow. Competitive adsorption implies that
   multilayer adsorption may occur via hydrophobic bonding with the CH3
   ends of the self-assembled layer which affects the acid adsorption
   capacities in mixtures as compared to monocompound solutions. The
   determination of adsorption mechanisms will assist in understanding of
   the fate and bioavailability of emerging and classical weak acids
   released into natural waters.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of electrostatic force on the dynamics, morphological
   evolution, and drainage time of ultrathin liquid bilayers (<100 nm) are
   investigated for perfect dielectric-perfect dielectric (PD-PD) and ionic
   liquid-perfect dielectric (IL-PD) bilayers. The weakly nonlinear thin
   film equation is solved numerically to obtain spatiotemporal evolution
   of the liquid-liquid interface responses to transverse electric field.
   In order to predict the electrostatic component of conjoining/disjoining
   pressure acting on the interface for IL-PD bilayers, an analytical model
   is developed using the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. It is found
   that IL-PD bilayers with electric permittivity ratio of layers (lower to
   top), epsilon(r), greater than one remain stable under an applied
   electric field. An extensive numerical study is carried out to generate
   a map based on epsilon(r) and the initial mean thickness of the lower
   layer. This map is used to predict the formation of various structures
   on PD-PD bilayer interface and provides a baseline for unstable IL-PD
   bilayers. The use of an ionic liquid (IL) layer is found to reduce the
   size of the structures, but results in polydispersed and disordered
   pillars spread over the domain. The numerical predictions follow similar
   trend of experimental observation of Lau and Russel. (Lau, C. Y.;

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A nanoscale three terminal silicon based nanoplasmonic triode is
   proposed as a nanometer transistor. The device is suitable for
   monolithic integration with complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor
   technology. Due to the highly spatially inhomogeneous, highly confined
   nanoplasmonic mode, electrons generated through two-photon absorption in
   the silicon are ponderomotively accelerated towards the copper anode
   producing an output current. Application of a negative grid voltage
   allows for control of the output current. The nanoplasmonic triode is
   able to achieve output current as high as 628mA/mu m on an ultrafast
   timescale of 150 fs in a compact footprint of 0.07 mu m(2). Reduction of
   the plasmonic field strength allows for a CMOS compatible current of
   11.7mA/mu m. The results demonstrate the potential for the compact
   optical control of current useful for applications in high-speed, high
   current switching, and amplification. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   Cyclosporine A (CSA) with several proteins besides its molecular target,

   inverse ligand binding prediction, ILbind, we determined a comprehensive
   set of 100+ putative partners of CSA. We empirically show that
   predictive quality of ILbind is better compared with other available
   predictors for this compound. We linked the putative target proteins,
   which include many new partners of CSA, with cellular functions,
   canonical pathways and toxicities that are typical for patients who take
   this drug. We used complementary approaches (molecular docking,
   molecular dynamics, surface plasmon resonance binding analysis and
   enzymatic assays) to validate and characterize three novel CSA targets:
   calpain 2, caspase 3 and p38 MAP kinase 14. The three targets are
   involved in the apoptotic pathways, are interconnected and are

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{535-542}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The extraction of bitumen from the oil sands in Canada generates tonnes
   of mature fine tailings (MFT), consisting of a mineral matrix of sand,
   clay, and water, which without treatment requires thousands of years to
   fully consolidate. We assessed the performance of a novel ozonation
   method designed to enhance the settling of MFT and explored the
   mechanisms involved. The solid content of MFT obtained from oil sands
   tailings was adjusted to 1, 3, 5 wt \% with water before applying 15,
   30, and 60 min of ozonation. MFT settled after a short (15 min)
   ozonation treatment, resulting in a sample with clear released water on
   the top and condensed sludge at the bottom. The water chemistry
   characteristics, particles' surface charge and chemical bonding were
   measured. Ozonation led to the increased organic acids concentrations in
   MFT suspension through converting of organic matter from high to low
   molecular weight, and detaching organic coating on MFT particles. The pH
   and the concentrations of ions in the MFT suspension were changed
   significantly, an association of metal ions with MFT particles was
   promoted, and the surface charges of MFT particles were neutralized.
   Consequently, the MFT suspension was destabilized and MFT particle
   precipitation was observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Polymeric filament like type IV Pilus (TFP) can transfer forces in
   excess of 100 pN during their retraction before stalling, powering
   surface translocation(twitching). Single TFP level experiments have
   shown remarkable nonlinearity in the retraction behavior influenced by
   the external load as well as levels of PilT molecular motor protein.
   This includes reversal of motion near stall forces when the
   concentration of the PilT protein is loweblack significantly. In order
   to explain this behavior, we analyze the coupling of TFP elasticity and
   interfacial behavior with PilT kinetics. We model retraction as reaction
   controlled and elongation as transport controlled process. The reaction
   rates vary with TFP deformation which is modeled as a compound elastic
   body consisting of multiple helical strands under axial load. Elongation
   is controlled by monomer transport which suffer entrapment due to excess
   PilT in the cell periplasm. Our analysis shows excellent agreement with
   a host of experimental observations and we present a possible
   biophysical relevance of model parameters through a mechano-chemical
   stall force map.}},

Title = {{Treatment of oil sands process-affected water by submerged ceramic
   membrane microfiltration system}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{198-209}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid expansion of the oil sands in Northern Alberta over past
   decade, oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) management has become a
   significant issue. Currently, there is an urgent need for the OSPW reuse
   and/or safe discharge. In this study, coagulation followed by submerged
   microfiltration (MF) with a range of ceramic membranes was investigated
   as a potential process for pretreating OSPW. The ceramic MF membranes
   with the average pore size of 100 nm were made of Al2O3 and their
   selective layer was further modified with SiO2 or TiO2 nanoparticles.
   Our results showed that membrane surface charge played an important role
   in controlling membrane fouling. The maximum fouling reduction was
   achieved when OSPW was treated by SiO2-modified membrane. Surface
   roughness studies also demonstrated its significant effect on membranes'
   filtration performance and fouling. More foulants were deposited on the
   surface of rough TiO2-modified membrane as compared to smoother
   SiO2-modified membrane. It was found that removal of organic and
   inorganic fractions in OSPW was not affected neither by the
   type/concentration of coagulant nor by membrane's surface modification.
   Thus, more than 93\% removal of the total suspended solids and less than
   17\% and 10\% removals of the total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD), respectively, were achieved regardless of the
   membrane type and applied treatment. When MF permeate was used as an
   influent to the reverse osmosis (RO), this resulted in 98\% and 100\%
   reductions in TOC and COD concentrations, respectively. Moreover, RO
   filtration achieved more than 95\% removal of magnesium, calcium, iron,
   fluoride, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, sodium and potassium and silica.
   The results of this study showed that combination of RO and MF could be
   considered as an effective and feasible option for OSPW treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Copper oxide powders intended for use as oxygen carriers in high
   temperature air separation and chemical looping combustion have been
   synthesized by a range of ceramic synthesis techniques including citrate
   gel, Pechini, precipitation, alanine assisted combustion, and high
   temperature oxidation. The evolution of morphology and crystal structure
   in the synthesis of powders was characterized using scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface chemical
   properties of the powders were studied using X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS). The oxygen sorptive/desorptive kinetics was studied
   using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Kinetics of the oxygen exchange
   reactions were analyzed and explained using empirical kinetics models
   with minimum error. A strong correlation was observed between the oxygen
   desorption parameters and oxygen to copper ratio calculated from
   measured XPS spectra. Copper oxide powders synthesized using the alanine
   assisted combustion and citrate gel methods resulted in optimum kinetic
   properties for use as an oxygen carrier at high temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations have been performed using the free-energy binary-liquid
   lattice Boltzmann method with sufficient resolution that the critical
   capillary number for coalescence was determined for collisions between
   droplets in simple shear with a small initial offset in the shear
   gradient direction. The simulations were used to study the behavior of
   the interacting interfaces and the film between them during collisions
   over a wide range of capillary numbers with emphasis on near-critical
   conditions. From these three-dimensional simulations with deforming
   interfaces, several features of the evolution of the film between the
   drops were observed. The critical film thickness was determined to be
   similar to the interface thickness, a power law described the dependence
   of the minimum film thickness on the capillary number in collisions
   without coalescece, and an inflection point was found in the dynamics of
   the minimum distance between drops that eventually coalesce. The
   rotation of the film and the flow in it were also studied, and a
   reversal in the flow was found to occur before coalescence. The mobility
   of the phase field was therefore important in the continued thinning of
   the film at the points of minimum thickness after the flow reversal. A
   comparison of the critical capillary number and critical film thickness
   in the simulations with the values for experiments in confined simple
   shear indicated that the effective physical radius of the simulated
   droplets was on the order of several micrometers. The results are
   significant for simulations of droplet interactions and emulsion flows
   in complex geometries and turbulence because they demonstrate the
   necessary scale of the computations and how parameters, such as the
   interface thickness and phase field mobility, should be selected for
   accurate results.}},

Abstract = {{The cooling and freezing of stagnant water in cylindrical pipes were
   investigated under conditions of varying ambient air temperatures.
   Experiments were conducted to measure the transient temperature of water
   in a 50.8 mm nominal Schedule 80 steel pipe that was exposed to stagnant
   and forced air at temperatures ranging from -25 degrees C to -5 degrees
   C. There was a 10 vol.\% air gap in the pipe to avoid excessive increase
   of fluid pressure during the freezing process. A one-dimensional
   transient heat conduction mathematical model was developed to estimate
   the freezing time of the liquid in the pipe. The model was based on the
   separation of variables method for a finite length-scale solidification
   problem, and was verified with the experimental transient temperature
   data. It was found that the model predicted the solidification time of
   the water in the pipe to within 15\% of that which was measured by
   experiments for most of the tests that were conducted. The model was
   applied to predict the cooling and freezing behaviors of water in steel
   and copper pipes of various inner diameters and in insulated pipes. The
   results of the model and their agreement with experimental data suggest
   that a separation of variables method for a finite length-scale heat
   conduction problem may be applied to moving or free boundary problems to
   predict phase change phenomena. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{615}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify the effect of yttrium (Y) addition
   on the phase development and strain hardening behavior of an extruded
   Mg-Zn-Mn (ZM31) magnesium alloy. The addition of a small amount (0.3
   wt.\%) of Y in the alloy led to the formation of icosahedral
   quasicrystalline I (Mg3YZn6) phase. Both I-phase and W-phase (Mg3Y2Zn3)
   were present in the extruded ZM31+3.2Y alloy, while long period stacking
   ordered (LPSO) X-phase (Mg12YZn) and Mg24Y5 were observed in the
   extruded ZM31+6Y alloy. The Y addition significantly refined grains in
   the extruded state. The presence of I-phase in the extruded ZM31+0.3Y
   alloy increased hardness, compressive yield strength, and Stage B strain
   hardening rate. The extruded ZM31+3.2Y alloy exhibited a lower hardness
   and Stage B hardening rate due to the formation of W-phase. Both
   extruded ZM31+0.3Y and ZM31+3.2Y alloys showed a yield point phenomenon
   with an initial negative strain hardening rate. The extruded ZM31+6Y
   alloy had a high hardness and compressive yield strength without Stage B
   hardening, suggesting a change of major deformation mode from twinning
   to slip mainly due to the role of LPSO X-phase. After solution treatment
   and aging, the hardness and compressive yield strength gradually
   increased with increasing Y content, while the strain hardening exponent
   and the extent of Stage B strain hardening decreased due to the
   dissolution of I- and W-phases and the presence of LPSO X-phase. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel procedure for classification of normal and
   abnormal operating conditions of a process when multiple noisy
   observation sequences are available. Continuous time signals are
   converted to discrete observations using the method of triangular
   representation. Since there is a large difference in the means and
   variances of the durations and magnitudes of the triangles at different
   operating modes, adaptive fuzzy membership functions are applied for
   discretization. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to
   obtain parameters of the different modes for the durations and
   magnitudes assuming that states transit to each other according to a
   Markov chain model. Applying Hamilton's filter, probability of each
   state given new duration and magnitude is calculated to weight the
   membership functions of each mode previously obtained from a fuzzy
   C-means clustering. After adaptive discretization step, having discrete
   observations available, the combinatorial method for training hidden
   Markov models (HMMs) with multiple observations is used for overall
   classification of the process. Application of the method is studied on
   both simulation and industrial case studies. The industrial case study
   is the detection of normal and abnormal process conditions in the
   primary separation vessel (PSV) of an oil sand industry. The method
   shows an overall good performance in detecting normal and risky
   operating conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature gradients and distribution evolution within the crystal
   domain in Czochralski crystal growth process have important role in
   produced crystal's quality. Precise and tight regulation of temperature
   distribution and gradients is the most promising approach to ensure the
   crystal quality. In this work, the coupled crystal pulling dynamics and
   heat transfer models in Czochralski crystal growth with a time-varying
   boundary is considered. The moving boundary finite element method is
   used to obtain the optimal reference temperature trajectory associated
   with the reference crystal shape taking into account constraints on
   input and the temperature gradients. The obtained reference trajectory
   is used to implement a model predictive control strategy to track the
   reference temperature despite uncertainties in crystal domain geometry
   evolution and disturbances. Finally, the proposed method is implemented
   on a high fidelity finite element process model with non-planar
   interface and results are presented to validate the success of the
   proposed methodology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of reservoir oil and carbon dioxide (CO2) can exhibit complex
   multiphase behavior at temperatures typically less than 120 degrees F,
   in which a third CO2-rich liquid (L-2) phase can coexist with the oleic
   (L-1) and gaseous (V) phases. The three-phase behavior is bounded by two
   types of critical endpoints (CEPs) in composition space. The lower CEP
   (LCEP) is a tie line in which the two liquid phases merge in the
   presence of the V phase, and the upper CEP (UCEP) is a tie line in which
   the L-2 and V phases merge in the presence of the L-1 phase. Slimtube
   tests reported in the literature show that low-temperature oil
   displacement by CO2 can result in the high displacement efficiency of
   more than 90\% when three phases are present during the displacement.
   The nearly piston-like displacements can be quantitatively reproduced in
   numerical simulations when the CEP behavior is properly considered.
   However, it is uncertain how multicontact miscibility (MCM) is developed
   through the interaction of flow and three-hydrocarbon-phase behavior.
   This research presents a detailed analysis of mass conservation on
   multiphase transitions between two and three phases for the limiting
   three-phase flow, where the L-1 phase is completely displaced by the L-2
   phase on the LCEP. The analysis indicates that interphase mass transfer
   on multiphase transitions occurs in the most-efficient way for MCM
   development. Simple analytical conditions derived for MCM through three
   phases are applied to 1D fine-scale simulations of CO2 floods by use of
   four and more components. Results show that the MCM conditions are
   nearly satisfied when the effect of numerical dispersion is small. MCM
   is likely developed through three hydrocarbon phases on the LCEP in the
   cases studied. This is consistent with analytical solutions of water and
   gas injection presented in the literature, in which MCM is developed on
   a CEP for the aqueous, V, and L-1 phases. For MCM cases in this
   research, the L-2-V two phases are present upstream of the miscible
   front if the composition path does not go through the UCEP tie line.
   However, they also can be miscible on the non-L-1 edge of the UCEP tie
   line if the MCM composition path goes through it.
   Three-phase flow gradually changes to two-phase flow with varying
   pressure in the presence of numerical dispersion. It is shown that
   interphase mass transfer on multiphase transitions becomes less
   efficient during the change until the three-phase region completely
   disappears.}},

Title = {{Understanding the Thermo-Hydromechanical Pressurization in Two-Phase
   (Steam/Water) Flow and Its Application in Low-Permeability Caprock
   Formations in Steam-Assisted-Gravity-Drainage Projects}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is one successful
   thermal-recovery technique applied in Alberta oil-sand reservoirs. When
   considering in-situ production from bitumen reservoirs, one must reduce
   viscosity for the bitumen to flow toward the production well. Steam
   injection is currently the most promising thermal-recovery method.
   Although steamflooding has proved to be a commercially viable way to
   extract bitumen from bitumen reservoirs, caprock integrity and the risk
   of losing steam containment can be challenging operational problems.
   Because permeability is low in Albertan thermal-project caprock
   formations, heating greatly increases the pressure on any water trapped
   in pores as a result of water thermal expansion. This water also sees a
   great increase in volume as it flashes to steam, causing a large
   effective-stress reduction. After this condition is established,
   porepressure increases can lead to caprock shear failure or tensile
   fracturing, and to subsequent caprock-integrity failure or potential
   casing failure. It is typically believed that low-permeability caprocks
   impede the transmission of pore pressure from reservoirs, making them
   more resistant to shear failure (Collins 2005, 2007). In considering the
   ``thermo-hydromechanical pressurization{''} physics, low-permeability
   caprocks are not always more resistant. As the steam chamber rises into
   the caprock, the heated pore fluids may flash to steam. Consequently,
   there is a vapor region between the steam-chamber interface penetrated
   into the caprock and the water region within the caprock which is still
   at a subcritical state.
   This study develops equations for fluid-mass and thermal-energy
   conservation, evaluating the thermo-hydromechanical pressurization in
   low-permeability caprocks and the flow of steam and water after steam
   starts to be injected as part of the SAGD process. Calculations are made
   for both short-term and long-term responses, and evaluated thermal
   pressurization is compared for caprocks with different stiffness states
   and with different permeabilities. One can conclude that the stiffer and
   less permeable the caprock, the greater the thermo-hydromechanical
   pressurization; and that the application of SAGD can lead to high pore
   pressure and potentially to caprock shear, and to subsequent steam
   release to the surface or potential casing failure.}},

Abstract = {{To satisfy the ever increasing wireless service demand, it is effective
   to form a converged network by utilizing interworking mechanisms, such
   that the resources of heterogeneous wireless networks can be allocated
   in a coordinated and efficient manner. Despite the potential advantages
   of a converged network, its performance needs further improvement,
   especially at cell edges and rural areas where only one network is
   available. In this article, we investigate how to leverage
   device-to-device, D2D, communication to further improve the performance
   of a converged network which consists of an LTE-A cellular network and
   IEEE 802.11n WLANs. Three main technical challenges that complicate
   resource allocation are identified: allocation of resources capturing
   diverse radio access technologies of the networks, selection of users'
   communication modes for multiple networks to maximize hop and reuse
   gains, and interference management. To address these challenges, we
   propose a resource allocation scheme that performs mode selection,
   allocation of WLAN resources, and allocation of LTE-A network resources
   in three different timescales. The resource allocation scheme is
   semi-distributedly implemented in the underlying converged D2D
   communication network, and the achievable performance improvements are
   demonstrated via simulation results.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose Hybrid Radial Basis Function Neural Networks
   (HRBFNNs) realized with the aid of fuzzy clustering method (Fuzzy
   C-Means, FCM) and polynomial neural networks. Fuzzy clustering used to
   form information granulation is employed to overcome a possible curse of
   dimensionality, while the polynomial neural network is utilized to build
   local models. Furthermore, genetic algorithm (GA) is exploited here to
   optimize the essential design parameters of the model (including
   fuzzification coefficient, the number of input polynomial fuzzy neurons
   (PFNs), and a collection of the specific subset of input PFNs) of the
   network. To reduce dimensionality of the input space., principal
   component analysis (PCA) is considered as a sound preprocessing vehicle.
   The performance of the HRBFNNs is quantified through a series of
   experiments, in which we use several modeling benchmarks of different
   levels of complexity (different number of input variables and the number
   of available data). A comparative analysis reveals that the proposed
   HRBENNs exhibit higher accuracy in comparison to the accuracy produced
   by some models reported previously in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We show through experiments that a transition from laser wakefield
   acceleration (LWFA) regime to a plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA)
   regime can drive electrons up to energies close to the GeV level.
   Initially, the acceleration mechanism is dominated by the bubble created
   by the laser in the nonlinear regime of LWFA, leading to an injection of
   a large number of electrons. After propagation beyond the depletion
   length, leading to a depletion of the laser pulse, whose transverse
   ponderomotive force is not able to sustain the bubble anymore, the high
   energy dense bunch of electrons propagating inside bubble will drive its
   own wakefield by a PWFA regime. This wakefield will be able to trap and
   accelerate a population of electrons up to the GeV level during this
   second stage. Three dimensional particle-in-cell simulations support
   this analysis and confirm the scenario. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Suitable animal models are necessary to test the efficacy of
   new bone grafting therapies in cleft palate surgery. Rodent models of
   cleft palate are available but have limitations. This study compared and
   modified mid-palate cleft (MPC) and alveolar cleft (AC) models to
   determine the most reliable and reproducible model for bone grafting
   studies.
   Methods: Published MPC model (9 x 5 x 3 mm(3)) lacked sufficient
   information for tested rats. Our initial studies utilizing AC model (7 x
   4 x 3 mm(3)) in 8 and 16 weeks old Sprague Dawley (SD) rats revealed
   injury to adjacent structures. After comparing anteroposterior and
   transverse maxillary dimensions in 16 weeks old SD and Wistar rats,
   virtual planning was performed to modify MPC and AC defects dimensions,
   taking the adjacent structures into consideration. Modified MPC (7 x 2.5
   x 1 mm(3)) and AC (5 x 2.5 x 1 mm(3)) defects were employed in 16 weeks
   old Wistar rats and healing was monitored by micro-computed tomography
   and histology.
   Results: Maxillary dimensions in SD and Wistar rats were not
   significantly different. Preoperative virtual planning enhanced
   postoperative surgical outcomes. Bone healing occurred at defect margin
   leaving central bone void confirming the critical size nature of the
   modified MPC and AC defects.
   Conclusions: Presented modifications for MPC and AC models created
   clinically relevant and reproducible defects. (C) 2014 European

Title = {{Numerical Simulation of Complex Fracture Network Development by
   Hydraulic Fracturing in Naturally Fractured Ultratight Formations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The creation of large complex fracture networks by hydraulic fracturing
   is imperative for enhanced oil recovery from tight sand or shale
   reservoirs, tight gas extraction, and hot-dry-rock (HDR) geothermal
   systems to improve the contact area to the rock matrix. Although
   conventional fracturing treatments may result in biwing fractures, there
   is evidence by microseismic mapping that fracture networks can develop
   in many unconventional reservoirs, especially when natural fracture
   systems are present and the differences between the principle stresses
   are low. However, not much insight is gained about fracture development
   as well as fluid and proppant transport in naturally fractured tight
   formations. In order to clarify the relationship between rock and
   treatment parameters, and resulting fracture properties, numerical
   simulations were performed using a commercial discrete fracture network
   (DFN) simulator. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is presented to
   identify typical fracture network patterns resulting from massive water
   fracturing treatments in different geological conditions. It is shown
   how the treatment parameters influence the fracture development and what
   type of fracture patterns may result from different treatment designs.
   The focus of this study is on complex fracture network development in
   different natural fracture systems. Additionally, the applicability of
   the DFN simulator for modeling shale gas stimulation and HDR stimulation
   is critically discussed. The approach stated above gives an insight into
   the relationships between rock properties (specifically matrix
   properties and characteristics of natural fracture systems) and the
   properties of developed fracture networks. Various simulated scenarios
   show typical conditions under which different complex fracture patterns
   can develop and prescribe efficient treatment designs to generate these
   fracture systems. Hydraulic stimulation is essential for the production
   of oil, gas, or heat from ultratight formations like shales and basement
   rocks (mainly granite). If natural fracture systems are present, the
   fracturing process becomes more complex to simulate. Our simulations
   suggest that stress state, in situ fracture networks, and fluid type are
   the main parameters influencing hydraulic fracture network development.
   Major factors leading to more complex fracture networks are an extensive
   pre-existing natural fracture network, small fracture spacings, low
   differences between the principle stresses, well contained formations,
   high tensile strength, high Young's modulus, low viscosity fracturing
   fluid, and large fluid volumes. The differences between 5 km deep
   granitic HDR and 2.5 km deep shale gas stimulations are the following:
   (1) the reservoir temperature in granites is higher, (2) the pressures
   and stresses in granites are higher, (3) surface treatment pressures in
   granites are higher, (4) the fluid leak-off in granites is less, and (5)
   the mechanical parameters tensile strength and Young's modulus of
   granites are usually higher than those of shales.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeThe aim of this systematic review was to assess enamel wear on
   teeth opposing zirconia restorations and to evaluate factors related to
   the wear of natural teeth opposing zirconia restorations.
   Materials and MethodsFive electronic databases were searched through May
   2013 without limitations. The terms antagonist{*}, enamel, wear, and
   zirconi{*} were used. Titles and abstracts were initially screened, and
   those that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected for a
   full-text assessment. Studies that evaluated only the material wear were
   not included.
   ResultsThe database search strategy retrieved 142 potentially eligible
   studies. After the duplicate studies were removed, 62 studies were
   obtained. Titles and abstracts that fulfilled the inclusion criteria
   were selected for a full-text assessment (25). Seven laboratory studies
   met the inclusion criteria. In addition, reference lists from the
   finally selected studies were also screened.
   ConclusionsThere was a large variation in relation to wear test method
   quantification, applied force, lateral movement, number and frequency of
   cycles, number of specimens, and enamel specimen preparation. In all
   studies, enamel wear rates were lower against polished zirconia.
   Differences in the test methods did not allow for comparisons of wear
   rates among the studies. Clinical Significance: Polishing the surface is
   recommended for a full-contour zirconia restoration because polished
   zirconia presents favorable wear behavior opposing natural teeth.}},

Abstract = {{Bitumen liberation is known to be an essential step for bitumen recovery
   from sand grains using the current warm/hot-water-based extraction
   process. This study aims at understanding the role of naphtha or toluene
   addition in enhancing bitumen liberation. Results from an in situ
   bitumen liberation visualization measurement indicate that soaking two
   oil sands ores by solvents at 10-30 wt \% of the bitumen could
   significantly enhance not only the ultimate degree of bitumen liberation
   (UDBL) but also the rate of bitumen liberation (RBL) in the process
   water at ambient conditions. Although ore-type- and
   solvent-type-dependent, both the UDBL and RBL would increase sharply at
   10-20 wt \% solvent dosage. A further increase in solvent dosage showed
   a diminished increase in the UDBL. To understand the observed
   improvement, viscosities of bitumen directly extracted from the ores and
   its mixture with solvents were measured, as well as diluted bitumenwater
   interfacial tensions. Results showed that adding solvent into the
   bitumen reduced bitumenwater interfacial tension and more so for the
   reduction in bitumen viscosity. Interestingly, the viscosity and
   interfacial tension of diluted bitumen were found to be dependent upon
   the source of ores and type of solvents. The UDBL was found to be
   inversely correlated with the interfacial tension and bitumen viscosity,
   while the RBL correlated almost linearly with the interfacial
   tension/viscosity ratio, which acted as the balance of the interfacial
   tension driving force/adhesion drag force. These correlations were less
   dependent upon the types of ores and solvents.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research shows that various weather elements have significant
   effects on crash occurrence and risk; however, little is known about how
   these elements affect different crash types. Consequently, this study
   investigates the impact of weather elements and sudden extreme snow or
   rain weather changes on crash type. Multivariate models were used for
   seven crash types using five years of daily weather and crash data
   collected for the entire City of Edmonton. In addition, the yearly trend
   and random variation of parameters across the years were analyzed by
   using four different modeling formulations. The proposed models were
   estimated in a full Bayesian context via Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   simulation. The multivariate Poisson lognormal model with yearly varying
   coefficients provided the best fit for the data according to Deviance
   Information Criteria. Overall, results showed that temperature and
   snowfall were statistically significant with intuitive signs (crashes
   decrease with increasing temperature; crashes increase as snowfall
   intensity increases) for all crash types, while rainfall was mostly
   insignificant. Previous snow showed mixed results, being statistically
   significant and positively related to certain crash types, while
   negatively related or insignificant in other cases. Maximum wind gust
   speed was found mostly insignificant with a few exceptions that were
   positively related to crash type. Major snow or rain events following a
   dry weather condition were highly significant and positively related to
   three crash types: Follow-Too-Close, Stop-Sign-Violation, and
   Ran-Off-Road crashes. The day-of-the-week dummy variables were
   statistically significant, indicating a possible weekly variation in
   exposure. Transportation authorities might use the above results to
   improve road safety by providing drivers with information regarding the
   risk of certain crash types for a particular weather condition. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The combined application of multilateral horizontal drilling and
   multistage hydraulic fracturing has successfully unlocked unconventional
   tight hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, the field data show that only a
   small fraction of the injected water during hydraulic fracturing
   treatments is recovered during flowback operations. The fate of
   nonrecovered water and its impact on hydrocarbon production are poorly
   understood. This paper aims at understanding the relationship between
   water loss and rock petrophysical properties. It also investigates the
   correlation between water loss and soaking time (well shut-in time).
   Extensive spontaneous imbibition experiments are conducted on downhole
   samples from the shale members of the Horn River Basin and from the
   Montney tight gas formation. These samples are characterized by
   measuring porosity, mineralogy and TOC. Further, a simple methodology is
   used to scale up the laboratory data for predicting water imbibition
   volume during the shut-in period after hydraulic fracturing operations.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Two-dimensional maxillary superimposition techniques have
   been routinely used in clinical practice, but a 3-dimensional plane has
   yet to be introduced and validated. The purposes of this study were to
   propose a new plane for regional superimposition of the maxillary
   complex and then to validate it through clinical data. Methods:
   Pretreatment and posttreatment palatal expansion records were used. The
   magnitudes of the transverse expansion at the levels of the first
   premolars and the first molars were assessed using the proposed
   superimposition plane and then were compared with the gold standard
   plaster model measurements. Descriptive statistics and agreement testing
   were performed to compare the methods. Results: When comparing the
   superimposition and plaster measurement methods, the mean errors for
   intermolar and interpremolar distances were 0.57 and 0.59 mm,
   respectively. Both the intraclass correlation coefficient and the
   Bland-Altman plot demonstrated high agreement between the 2 methods
   (intraclass correlation coefficient greater than 0.9). Conclusions: The
   proposed maxillary superimposition plane yields clinically suitable
   results when compared with the gold standard technique, with a mean
   error of less than 0.6 mm for typical intra-arch measurements. This new
   landmark-derived maxillary plane for superimposition is a promising tool
   for evaluating maxillary dentoalveolar changes after treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Oral influenza vaccine provides an efficient means of preventing
   seasonal and pandemic disease. In this work, the stability of
   envelope-type split influenza vaccine particles in acidic environments
   has been investigated. Owing to the fact that hyper-osmotic stress can
   significantly affect lipid assembly of vaccine, osmotic stress-induced
   morphological change of split vaccine particles, in conjunction with
   structural change of antigenic proteins, was investigated by the use of
   stopped-flow light scattering (SFLS), intrinsic fluorescence,
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and hemagglutination assay.
   Split vaccine particles were found to exhibit a step-wise morphological
   change in response to osmotic stress due to double-layered wall
   structure. The presence of hyper-osmotic stress in acidic medium (0.3
   osmolarity, pH 2.0) induced a significant level of membrane perturbation
   as measured by SFLS and TEM, imposing more damage to antigenic proteins
   on vaccine envelope than can be caused by pH-induced conformational
   change at acidic iso-osmotic condition. Further supports were provided
   by the intrinsic fluorescence and hemagglutinin activity measurements.
   Thus, hyper-osmotic stress becomes an important factor for determining
   stability of split vaccine particles in acidic medium. These results are
   useful in better understanding the destabilizing mechanism of split
   influenza vaccine particles in gastric environment and in designing oral
   influenza vaccine formulations.}},

Abstract = {{The linear form of the extended Mohr-Coulomb shear strength equation
   uses a phi(b) parameter to quantify the rate of increase in shear
   strength relative to matric suction. When the phi(b) value is unknown, a
   phi(b) equal to 15 degrees is sometimes used in the slope stability
   study to assess the influence of matric suction on the stability of a
   slope. In many cases, however, a phi(b) value of zero is used,
   signifying that the effect of matric suction is ignored. Experiment
   results have shown that the relationship between the shear strength of
   an unsaturated soil and matric suction is nonlinear. Several
   semi-empirical estimation equations have been proposed relating the
   unsaturated shear strength to the soil-water characteristic curve. In
   this paper, the results of a study using two-dimensional slope stability
   analysis along with an estimated nonlinear shear strength equations is
   presented. The effects of using an estimated nonlinear shear strength
   equation for the unsaturated soils are illustrated using three example
   problems. Several recommendations are made for engineering practice
   based on the results of the example problems. If the air-entry value
   (AEV) of a soil is smaller than 1 kPa, the effect of matric suction on
   the calculated factor of safety is trivial and the phi(b) value can be
   assumed to be zero. If the AEV of a soil is between 1 and 20 kPa, the
   nonlinear equations of unsaturated shear strength should be adopted. For
   soils with an AEV value between 20 and 200 kPa, an assumed phi(b) value
   of 15 degrees provides a reasonable estimation of the effects of
   unsaturated shear strength in most cases. For soils with an AEV greater
   than 200 kPa, phi(b) can generally be assumed to be equal to the
   effective angle of internal friction, phi', in applications where
   geotechnical structures have matric suctions around 100 kPa.}},

Abstract = {{In order to deal with the sequential decision problems with large or
   continuous state spaces, feature representation and function
   approximation have been a major research topic in reinforcement learning
   (RL). In this paper, a clustering-based graph Laplacian framework is
   presented for feature representation and value function approximation
   (VFA) in RL. By making use of clustering-based techniques, that is,
   K-means clustering or fuzzy C-means clustering, a graph Laplacian is
   constructed by subsampling in Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
   continuous state spaces. The basis functions for VFA can be
   automatically generated from spectral analysis of the graph Laplacian.
   The clustering-based graph Laplacian is integrated with a class of
   approximation policy iteration algorithms called representation policy
   iteration (RPI) for RL in MDPs with continuous state spaces. Simulation
   and experimental results show that, compared with previous RPI methods,
   the proposed approach needs fewer sample points to compute an efficient
   set of basis functions and the learning control performance can be
   improved for a variety of parameter settings.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a cluster-oriented development of fuzzy
   models. An overall design process is focused on an efficient usage of
   fuzzy clustering, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), in particular, to form
   information granules-clusters that are used in the construction of the
   fuzzy model. Fuzzy models are regarded as mappings from information
   granules expressed in the input and output spaces. This position
   motivates us to look at the development of the models through the
   perspective of the construction and efficient usage of information
   granules. This study directly associates fuzzy clustering with fuzzy
   modeling both in terms of conceptual and algorithmic linkages. The
   augmented FCM method is formed predominantly for modeling purposes so
   that a balance between the structural content present in the input and
   output spaces is achieved and this way the performance of the resulting
   fuzzy model is optimized. It is shown that the cluster-oriented modeling
   gives rise to the Mamdani-like fuzzy rules and a zero-order
   Takagi-Sugeno model (under a certain decoding scheme). We identify an
   interesting and direct linkage between the developed fuzzy models and a
   fundamental idea of encoding-decoding (or granulation-degranulation)
   encountered in processing fuzzy sets and Granular Computing, in general.
   Furthermore, refinements of zero-order fuzzy models are investigated
   leading to first-order fuzzy models with linear functions standing in
   the conclusions of the rules. A series of experiments is reported where
   we used synthetic and real-world data using which an issue of
   generalization capabilities is elaborated in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Anomaly detection in spatial time series (spatiotemporal data) is a
   challenging problem with numerous potential applications. A
   comprehensive anomaly detection approach not only should be able to
   detect and identify the emerging anomalies but has to characterize the
   essence of these anomalies by visualizing the structures revealed within
   data in a way that is understandable to the end-user as well. In this
   paper, we consider fuzzy c-means (FCM) as a conceptual and algorithmic
   setting to deal with the problem of anomaly detection. Using a sliding
   window, the time series are divided into a number of subsequences, and
   the available spatiotemporal structure within each time window is
   discovered using the FCM method. In the sequel, an anomaly score is
   assigned to each cluster, and using a fuzzy relation formed between
   revealed structures, a propagation of anomalies occurring in consecutive
   time intervals is visualized. To illustrate the proposed method, several
   datasets (synthetic data, a simulated disease outbreak scenario, and
   Alberta temperature data) have been investigated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes age and periodic replacement last models with
   continuous, and discrete policies. That is, an operating unit is
   replaced preventively at time of operation as a strategic policy, or at
   a number of working cycles to satisfy successive job completion,
   whichever occurs last. Such policies are named as replacement last, and
   their expected cost rates and optimal policies are obtained. However,
   the focus of this paper is to compare replacement last with replacement
   first policies, which are formulated under the classical assumption of
   whichever occurs first. From the points of cost and performability,
   different comparative methods for continuous and discrete optimizations
   are demonstrated to determine in what cases we should adopt replacement
   last rather than replacement first. All theoretical discussions in this
   paper are made analytically, and are computed numerically.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a fixed-fixed folded spring as an alternative
   elastic element for beam-based piezoelectric energy harvesting. In order
   to harvest energy from low frequency vibration in an optimal manner, the
   natural/operational frequencies of harvesters must be reduced to match
   low frequency input vibrations. Therefore, natural frequency reduction
   of vibration-based energy harvesters is critical to maximize output
   power at low operational frequency. The mechanical optimization of
   cantilever-based piezoelectric energy harvesters is limited by residual
   stress-based beam curling that produced through microfabrication adding
   additional mechanical stiffness to the system. The fixed-fixed folded
   spring structure presented in this paper allows for increased effective
   beam length and residual stress relaxation, without out of plane beam
   curling to further reducing the natural frequency. Multiple designs of
   folded spring energy harvesters are presented to demonstrate the effect
   of important design parameters. It is shown that the folded spring
   harvesters were capable of harvesting electricity at low natural
   frequencies, ranging from 45 Hz to 3667 Hz. Additionally, the harvesters
   were shown to be insensitive to microfabrication-based residual stress
   beam curling. The maximum power output achieved by the folded spring
   harvesters was 690.5 nW at 226.3 Hz for a single harvesting element of
   an array, with a PZT layer thickness of 0.24 mu m. The work presented in
   this paper demonstrates that the fixed-fixed folded spring can be used
   as a viable structural element for low frequency piezoelectric energy
   harvesting to take advantage of ambient vibrations found in low
   frequency applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present energy coupling (EC) and power coupling (PC) formalisms for
   analyzing optical instability in coupled microring resonators having
   instantaneous intensity dependent nonlinear refractive index. Analysis
   of a chalcogenide double-microring resonator is performed to investigate
   and compare instability phenomena predicted by both formalisms. It is
   shown that the EC formalism fails to predict Ikeda instability in the
   double-microring resonator and generally yields results that drastically
   deviate from those of the more rigorous PC formalism at high input
   powers and large phase detunings. We also show that the input threshold
   powers for reaching self-pulsation and Ikeda instabilities in a
   double-microring resonator can be minimized by proper selection of the
   coupling parameters. In particular, self-pulsation can be reached in a
   chalcogenide double-microring with input powers as low as tens of
   milliwatts, while the threshold power for Ikeda instability can be
   reduced by more than 20\% compared to the value required in a single
   microring. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Surface tension plays an important role in nanosized materials. In this
   paper, the stress field induced by surface tension around an arbitrarily
   shaped nanosized hole is investigated through complex variable-method
   using truncated series, with an emphasis on the relationship between the
   hoop stress and the curvature of the hole's boundary curve. Our
   numerical results for various shapes of holes show that maximum hoop
   stress always appears nearby, but not exactly at the point of maximum
   curvature on the hole's boundary. Surprisingly, for elliptical holes
   with certain aspect ratios and typical non-elliptical holes (such as
   triangular, square and rectangular holes), our results show that hoop
   stress can even attain a local minimum (not a local maximum) or even the
   overall minimum at the point of maximum curvature. In particular,
   surface tension-induced hoop stress can be very large around nanosized
   holes. On the other hand, the surface tension-induced stress field is
   always localized for nanosized holes of arbitrary shapes and fades away
   with increasing distance from the hole.}},

Abstract = {{Trend analysis of climatic variables on different spatial and temporal
   scales has been of great concern during the past century because of the
   attention given to global climate change by the scientific community. In
   this study, trends of the annual and seasonal relative humidity and dew
   point temperature time series have been investigated for 15 stations all
   over Bangladesh during 1961-2010. The magnitude of the climatic trends
   was derived from the slopes of the Sen's estimator. The statistical
   significance of the trends was determined by means of the Mann-Kendall
   test. Pre-whitening was used to eliminate the influence of serial
   correlation on the Mann-Kendall test. The percentage of stations showing
   a significant trend is moderate in the case of relative humidity, but is
   a lot higher in dew point temperature series at the 95 \% confidence
   limit. On average, relative humidity is increasing at 0.53, 0.86, and
   1.18 \% per decade on annual, winter, and pre-monsoon (summer) scales,
   respectively, in the western part of the country. Significant negative
   trends of relative humidity series are apparent in monsoon season. On
   the other hand, there is no significant decreasing trend in both annual
   and seasonal dew point temperature time series at any station. Again, a
   higher magnitude of the significant trends is observed in the western
   part of the country. The majority of the slopes are above zero,
   indicating an increasing nature in annual and seasonal dew point
   temperatures over Bangladesh. This warming of dew point temperature in
   Bangladesh is analogous to the global trend.}},

Abstract = {{In order to better understand the mechanisms that effect spray
   unsteadiness of effervescent atomizers and therefore to efficiently
   eliminate it, the two-phase flow pattern within the nozzle has been
   studied by pressure measurement and flow visualization. We found that
   the speed of sound in the two-phase flow can be predicted by the model
   suggested by Nguyen et al. (Int J Multiphase Flow 7: 311-320, 1981)
   using an averaged void fraction value. Dominant peak frequencies of
   pressure fluctuations both inside and outside the mixing chamber become
   synchronized in the slug flow regime. We show that the slug passage
   frequency is linearly proportional to the speed of sound and almost
   equal to the fundamental frequency of the mixing chamber. At a constant
   liquid flow rate and as the gas flow rate is increased, pressure
   fluctuations reach a maximum value with the appearance of a synchronized
   peak frequency. The amplitude of pressure fluctuation is then
   insensitive to further increases in the gas flow rate. For a constant
   gas flow rate, the pressure fluctuation increases with the increment of
   the liquid flow rate, reaching the maximum value at the moment of
   transition from slug flow to the bubbly flow.}},

Title = {{Column demands in steel plate shear walls with regular perforations
   using performance-based design methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{13-22}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The design force demands on the columns of steel plate shear walls tend
   to be very large. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the
   moments and axial forces on the columns, while still achieving good
   system performance. One such method is to reduce the strength of the
   infill plate by perforating it using a regular pattern of circular
   holes. The diameter of the holes selected and their center-to-center
   spacing control the decrease in lateral shear strength of the system. An
   appropriate performance-based design method is proposed and used to
   study the suitability of the perforated system. The results of a variety
   of finite element models showed that although introducing the
   perforations into the infill plates reduces the lateral strength of the
   system, the net demand on the columns can in some cases actually
   increase. The perforated system behavior is also sensitive to the
   pattern of holes selected; a small change in the arrangement of the
   holes can have a significant effect on the moment demand on the columns.
   Also, the flexibility of the beam-to-column connections influences the
   sensitivity of the column design forces to the pattern of holes selected
   and affects the column demands considerably. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Electrokinetic separation methods have been used extensively in
   microfluidic devices due to their separation power and compatibility
   with miniaturization platform. Electrophoresis (EP) fractionation of DNA
   and proteins in microfluidic devices has been conducted successfully and
   incorporated toward developing diagnostic devices. Porous structures as
   well as microfabricated pillars are often used as separation media for
   separation of biomolecules. The presence of the solid structures can
   create electric field gradients resulting in dielectrophoresis (DEP)
   which most often was neglected during DNA and protein fractionation. In
   this study, we evaluated the effect of induced field gradients by
   calculating the magnitude of the three most occurring phenomena during
   electrophoretic fractionation of biomolecules, i.e., EP, Brownian
   diffusion, and DC DEP in uniformly patterned post arrays. A mathematical
   model of convection-diffusion-migration of these charged entities was
   developed and solved using finite element analysis. Non-dimensional
   parameters were defined as a measure to predict the particles transport
   mechanism within the microfabricated post arrays in the presence of
   field gradients caused by the posts. Based on the properties of
   particles and the medium, our numerical analysis provided criteria to
   predict when the DEP can significantly alter the fate of the charged
   entities through uniform post arrays and therefore cannot be neglected.
   In order to identify these criteria, a generalized approach based on a
   systematic parametric study of particle size and zeta potentials was
   conducted. The criteria obtained have the potential to shed light on
   some of the challenges such as irreversible trapping and large band
   broadening during fractionation of charged macromolecules.}},

Title = {{Potential for Change in US Diagnosis of Hip Dysplasia Solely Caused by
   Changes in Probe Orientation: Patterns of Alpha-angle Variation Revealed
   by Using Three-dimensional US}},
Journal = {{RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{273}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{870-878}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pediatric Imaging Purpose: To use three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography
   (US) to quantify the alpha-angle variability due to changing probe
   orientation during two-dimensional (2D) US of the infant hip and its
   effect on the diagnostic classification of developmental dysplasia of
   the hip (DDH).
   Materials and Methods: In this institutional research ethics
   board-approved prospective study, with parental written informed
   consent, 13-MHz 3D US was added to initial 2D US for 56 hips in 35
   infants (mean age, 41.7 days; range, 4-112 days), 26 of whom were female
   (mean age, 38.7 days; range, 6-112 days) and nine of whom were male
   (mean age, 50.2 days; range, 4-111 days). Findings in 20 hips were
   normal at the initial visit and were initially inconclusive but
   normalized spontaneously at follow-up in 23 hips; 13 hips were treated
   for dysplasia. With the computer algorithm, 3D US data were resectioned
   in planes tilted in 5 degrees increments away from a central plane, as
   if slowly rotating a 2D US probe, until resulting images no longer met
   Graf quality criteria. On each acceptable 2D image, two observers
   measured alpha angles, and descriptive statistics, including mean,
   standard deviation, and limits of agreement, were computed. Results:
   Acceptable 2D images were produced over a range of probe orientations
   averaging 24 degrees (maximum, 45 degrees) from the central plane. Over
   this range, alpha-angle variation was 19 degrees (upper limit of
   agreement), leading to alteration of the diagnostic category of hip
   dysplasia in 54\% of hips scanned.
   Conclusion: Use of 3D US showed that alpha angles measured at routine 2D
   US of the hip can vary substantially between 2D scans solely because of
   changes in probe positioning. Not only could normal hips appear
   dysplastic, but dysplastic hips also could have normal alpha angles.
   Three-dimensional US can display the full acetabular shape, which might
   improve DDH assessment accuracy. (C) RSNA, 2014}},

Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{930-943}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biomass fuels have long been accepted as useful renewable energy
   sources, especially in mitigating greenhouse gases (GHG), nitrogen
   oxides, and sulfur oxide emissions. Biomass fuel is carbon neutral and
   is usually low in both nitrogen and sulfur. For the past decade, various
   forms of biomass fuels have been co-combusted in existing coal-fired
   boilers and gas-fired power plants. Biomass is used as a supplemental
   fuel to substitute for up to 10\% of the base fuel in most full
   commercial operations. There are several successful co-firing projects
   in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe and North America.
   However, despite remarkable commercial success in Europe, most of the
   biomass co-firing in North America is limited to demonstration levels.
   This review takes a detailed look at several aspects of biomass
   co-firing with a direct focus on North America. It also explores the
   benefits, such as the reduction of GHG emissions and its implications.
   This paper shows the results of our studies of the biomass resources
   available in North America that can be used in coal-fired boilers, their
   availability and transportation to the power plant, available co-firing
   levels and technologies, and various technological and environmental
   issues associated with biomass co-firing. Finally, the paper proffers
   solutions to help utility companies explore biomass co-firing as a
   transitional option towards a completely carbon-free power sector in
   North America. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   paper, we propose a criterion to evaluate features effectiveness by
   class separability that is defined on cosine similarity in the kernel

   with sequential backward selection and a feature re-ranking mechanism.
   We then employ the proposed feature selection algorithm to determine
   fault-sensitive features and select them for fault level diagnosis of
   planetary gearboxes. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the feature size and improve
   accuracy of fault level diagnosis simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{This work considers distributed predictive control of large-scale
   nonlinear systems with neighbor-to-neighbor communication. It fulfills
   the gap between the existing centralized Lyapunov-based model predictive
   control (LMPC) and the cooperative distributed LMPC and provides a
   balanced solution in terms of implementation complexity and achievable
   performance. This work focuses on a class of nonlinear systems with
   subsystems interacting with each other via their states. For each
   subsystem, an LMPC is designed based on the subsystem model and the LMPC
   only communicates with its neighbors. At a sampling time, a subsystem
   LMPC optimizes its future control input trajectory assuming that the
   states of its upstream neighbors remain the same as (or close to) their
   predicted state trajectories obtained at the previous sampling time.
   Both noniterative and iterative implementation algorithms are
   considered. The performance of the proposed designs is illustrated via a

Abstract = {{Knowledge of protein flexibility is vital for deciphering the
   corresponding functional mechanisms. This knowledge would help, for
   instance, in improving computational drug design and refinement in
   homology-based modeling. We propose a new predictor of the residue
   flexibility, which is expressed by B-factors, from protein chains that
   use local (in the chain) predicted (or native) relative solvent
   accessibility (RSA) and custom-derived amino acid (AA) alphabets. Our
   predictor is implemented as a two-stage linear regression model that
   uses RSA-based space in a local sequence window in the first stage and a
   reduced AA pair-based space in the second stage as the inputs. This
   method is easy to comprehend explicit linear form in both stages.
   Particle swarm optimization was used to find an optimal reduced AA
   alphabet to simplify the input space and improve the prediction
   performance. The average correlation coefficients between the native and
   predicted B-factors measured on a large benchmark dataset are improved
   from 0.65 to 0.67 when using the native RSA values and from 0.55 to 0.57
   when using the predicted RSA values. Blind tests that were performed on
   two independent datasets show consistent improvements in the average
   correlation coefficients by a modest value of 0.02 for both native and
   predicted RSA-based predictions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the case of transient three-dimensional, incompressible and
   isothermal channel flow of a newtonian fluid past a symmetrically
   confined obstacle of square cross section at zero incidence. The
   blockage ratio (ratio of cylinder diameter to channel width) is fixed at
   1/4. Results from both Laser Doppler (LDV) experiments and direct
   simulations upto Reynolds numbers (Re250) have been reported. Starting
   from the onset of instability (Recr approximate to 58), close
   examination of the apparent region of influence that envelopes the
   cylinder reveals a clear vortex shedding signature which extends up to
   about three diameters upstream. While the fundamental vortex shedding
   frequency displays a fairly steady monotonic increase with Reynolds
   number, the Strouhal number (St) shows an inflexion point around Re
   approximate to 115. No signs of hysteresis were detected around this
   region. Furthermore, incommensurate harmonics observed for Reynolds
   numbers in the range 127Re175 suggest a quasi-periodic transition to
   three-dimensionality. This is shown to be followed by an intermediate
   periodic window starting around Re approximate to 180. Results from
   direct simulations performed using OpenFOAM (the Open Source CFD
   Toolbox) are used not only to enhance confidence in the accuracy of the
   reported LDV measurements, but also to help explain the observed
   phenomena through frequency power spectra and spanwise velocity
   correlations. Finally, it is concluded that only a parametric variation
   of transverse and spanwise blockage ratios can bring closure to the
   subject of bluff-body wake transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Two wheel vehicles (scooters and motorcycles) make up 74\% of the
   vehicle population in India. An experimental study has been conducted to
   assess and compare the particulate emissions from several two wheelers
   and passenger car in a typical Indian fleet. The vehicles, including
   four 4-stroke, two 2-stroke two-wheelers, and one gasoline-LPG bi-fuel
   passenger cars, were tested on a chassis dynamometer using the Indian
   Driving Cycle. A differential mobility spectrometer was employed to
   measure the particle size distribution in real-time in the range of 5 nm
   to 560 nm. Particulate size distributions from the two-wheelers were
   typically bi-modal. The count median diameter with 4-stroke two wheelers
   was observed in the range of 26 nm to 48 nm. The number and mass
   emission factors ranged between 9.5 x 10(12) km(-1) to 1.3 x 10(13)
   km(-1) and 0.80 mg/km to 40 mg/km; respectively. In the case of 2-stroke
   two wheelers, it was observed that not only the count median diameter is
   3 times larger compared to 4-strokes, but also 2-stroke vehicles produce
   5 times more particles in term of number and about 60 times more
   particles in terms of mass. The 2-stroke and 4-stroke two wheelers
   produced particulate emissions (both in terms of number and mass), which
   were higher than a gasoline and a LPG passenger vehicle operating on the
   same driving cycle.}},

Title = {{Identification of Invariant Average Weighted Haul Distance to Simplify
   Earthmoving Simulation Modeling in Planning Site Grading Operations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This research is intended to generate relevant and quantitative decision
   support based on limited data and information available in the context
   of planning earthmoving operations at the site-grading design or early
   project planning stage. The researchers apply and extend the concept of
   haul effort in a two-axis grid. This enables calculation of the average
   weighted haul distance, which is shown to be invariant by conducting
   simulation experiments using a heuristic algorithm and making a
   quantitative comparison to the center of mass for a rigid body. This
   research applies the discrete event simulation approach commonly used to
   model the handling of multiple earthmoving jobs in a grading site, each
   job having a particular haul distance. The significant and unique
   contribution that has been made in this research is to substitute one
   unique average weighted haul distance for multiple haul distances
   between numerous cut and fill cells in the site grid system as
   simulation modeling input. When the same fleet is applied in both
   detailed and simplified simulation models, the question of validation
   concerns whether the simplified model still maintains the accuracy of
   the detailed model. Using a simple test problem and a real-world case,
   the researchers validate the proposed method and demonstrate the
   benefits of applying simulation for construction planning without
   incurring the previously necessary and prohibitively high cost
   associated with constructing detailed simulation models.}},

Title = {{Performance-Based Capacity Design of Steel Plate Shear Walls. I:
   Development Principles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This is Part I of two companion papers on performance-based capacity
   design of steel plate shear walls. Most previous research has been
   conducted with the primary aim of maximizing ductility and robustness
   under severe cyclic loading, without any explicit consideration of the
   costs of achieving this behavior. This has resulted in onerous capacity
   design rules in current codes and standards for achieving highly ductile
   systems, and has effectively discouraged their use in low and moderate
   seismic regions. These companion papers aim to provide a holistic and
   sound basis for capacity design to any of three explicit performance
   levels. In this paper, Part I, two target yield mechanisms associated
   with the two extreme performance levels (ductile and limited-ductility)
   are identified and justified, and the capacity design principles
   applicable to these performance levels are discussed. The
   limited-ductility mechanism departs from conventional treatment and is
   established based on finite element simulations and experimental
   observations. Two complementary new concepts for designing moderately
   ductile walls are also proposed and verified. Because design is an
   iterative process, modeling efficiencies for use with the
   performance-based approach are suggested and validated. Inconsistencies
   between current capacity design methods for evaluating the demands
   imposed by the infill plates on the boundary elements and the true
   infill plate behavior are identified and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interaction between valuable and gangue minerals is of
   both fundamental and practical importance in the field of flotation. In
   this study, we investigated the interactions between valuable (i.e.
   pentlandite) and gangue minerals (i.e. serpentine, olivine, and
   magnesite) in an aqueous solution by directly measuring the zeta
   potential distributions. In addition, interaction force measurements
   using an atomic force microscope (AFM) were performed between a silicon
   nitride tip and gangue mineral surfaces, and the classical
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory was used to fit the
   interaction force between the silicon nitride tip and gangue mineral
   surfaces. In the case of serpentine and pentlandite mixture system at pH
   10.1, only a single zeta potential distribution was obtained, as
   compared to two distinct distributions for the two individual minerals,
   indicating an attractive interaction is present between the two
   minerals. For olivine and pentlandite mixture system, a single
   distribution with two distinct spikes was obtained in the zeta potential
   distribution of the mixture, indicating repulsive interaction between
   the two minerals. Similarly, a single distribution with two distinct
   spikes was also observed in the zeta potential distribution of magnesite
   and pentlandite mixture system, indicating repulsive interaction between
   the two minerals. Repulsive interaction between silicon nitride tip and
   olivine surface, and slight attractive interaction between silicon
   nitride tip and magnesite surface, were observed and consistent with the
   DLVO model. The zeta potential and AFM force measurements show good
   agreement regarding the surface charge properties and interactions of
   the minerals, and provide complementary information and new insights
   into the interaction mechanism of valuable and gangue minerals. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The accuracy of molecular dynamics simulation highly depends on the
   reliability of the empirical potential that it uses. Atomistic
   simulations of ZnS have attracted a lot of attention in the past few
   decades due to the technological importance of this material as a
   semiconductor and the main resource of world zinc production. Although
   multiple empirical potentials have been suggested for ZnS, there is no
   comprehensive study that compares the performance of these potentials.
   In this paper, we have reviewed five of the most used ZnS empirical
   potentials and have tested their performance in predicting different ZnS
   properties. Based on the obtained results, we provide recommendations
   for a proper empirical potential based on the application that the
   molecular mechanic simulation is aiming for.}},

Title = {{Human-centric analysis and interpretation of time series: a perspective

Abstract = {{In spite of the truly remarkable diversity of models of time series,
   there is still an evident need to develop constructs whose accuracy and
   interpretability are carefully identified and reconciled subsequently
   leading to highly interpretable (human-centric) constructs. While a
   great deal of research has been devoted to the design of nonlinear
   numeric models of time series (with an evident objective to achieve high
   accuracy of prediction), an issue of interpretability (transparency) of
   models of time series becomes an evident and ongoing challenge. The
   user-friendliness of models of time series comes with an ability of
   humans to perceive and process abstract constructs rather than dealing
   with plain numeric entities. In perception of time series, information
   granules (which are regarded as realizations of interpretable entities)
   play a pivotal role. This gives rise to a concept of granular models of
   time series or granular time series, in brief. This study revisits
   generic concepts of information granules and elaborates on a fundamental
   way of forming information granules (both sets-intervals as well as
   fuzzy sets) through applying a principle of justifiable granularity
   encountered in granular computing. Information granules are discussed
   with regard to the granulation of time series in a certain predefined
   representation space (viz. a feature space) and granulation carried out
   in time. The granular representation and description of time series is
   then presented. We elaborate on the fundamental hierarchically organized
   layers of processing supporting the development and interpretation of
   granular time series, namely (a) formation of granular descriptors used
   in their visualization, (b) construction of linguistic descriptors used
   afterwards in the generation of (c) linguistic description of time
   series. The layer of the linguistic prediction models of time series
   exploiting the linguistic descriptors is outlined as well. A number of
   examples are offered throughout the entire paper with intent to
   illustrate the main functionalities of the essential layers of the
   granular models of time series.}},

Abstract = {{A facile approach is used to grow sharp folded and wrinkled graphene
   structures by laser ablation process. The laser-graphite target
   interaction mechanism and effect of substrate temperature variation (400
   degrees C and 700 degrees C) on the growth structure of graphene is
   studied. The low solubility of carbon in Cu helps in the deposition of
   graphene flakes by self-limiting process. High resolution transmission
   electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy are utilized to confirm the
   crystalline structure of graphene at higher temperatures. These exotic
   structures are further studied for their electron field emission
   characteristics after transferring over Si/SiO2 substrates. The sharp
   folded graphene structures (turn-on field 1.4 V/mu m) displayed enhanced
   electron field emission properties in comparison to wrinkled graphene
   (turn-on field 2.0 V/mu m). The obtained wrinkled graphene structure is
   extremely suitable for field emission applications. This work presents
   an efficient technique to grow different graphene structures using laser
   ablation process that can act as potential candidates for future field
   emission devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a significant clinical need for long-lasting, injectable
   materials for soft tissue reconstruction. Methylcellulose (MC) is an
   FDA-approved polysaccharide derivative of cellulose that is inexpensive,
   renewable, and biocompatible, and may serve as an alternative to
   existing synthetic and natural fillers. In this study, MC was modified
   with functional methacrylate groups and polymerized using a
   redox-initiation system to produce hydrogels with tunable properties. By
   varying the percent methacrylation and macromer concentration, the
   equilibrium moduli of the hydrogels were found to range between 1.29 +/-
   0.46 and 12.8 +/- 2.94 kPa, on par with human adipose tissue, and also
   displayed an inverse relationship to the swelling properties.
   Rheological analyses determined gelation onset and completion to be in
   accordance with the ISO standard for injectable materials. Cellulase
   enzymatic treatment resulted in complete degradation of the hydrogels by
   48 h, presenting the possibility of minimally invasive removal of the
   materials in the event of malposition or host reaction. In addition,
   co-culture experiments with human dermal fibroblasts showed the gels to
   be cytocompatible based on DNA measurements and Live/Dead staining.
   Taken together, these redox-polymerized MC hydrogels may be of use for a
   wide range of clinical indications requiring soft tissue augmentation.

Abstract = {{Core loss is a significant source of energy loss in electric motor steel
   laminates. Therefore, there is interest in monitoring the quality and
   consistency of laminates at various stages of manufacturing. The purpose
   of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using surface
   magnetic Barkhausen noise for the evaluation of AC core loss, and
   further, to examine potential origins of magnetic loss in non-oriented
   electrical steel. Core loss values were measured by a single sheet
   tester and Barkhausen noise measurements were performed using pole flux
   control on eight laminates with various grain size, texture and
   composition. Magnetocrystalline energy was calculated from X-ray
   diffraction data to quantify texture. Results demonstrated higher
   surface Barkhausen emissions for samples with lower core loss.
   Barkhausen noise analyses were used to examine the interplay among core
   loss, grain size, magnetocrystalline energy and B-H characteristics. The
   inverse correlation between core loss and Barkhausen noise emissions was
   qualitatively explained in terms of the orthogonal vector contribution
   of microscopic eddy currents to losses associated with bulk currents
   arising in the sample during magnetization.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies surface tension-induced stress concentration around a
   nanosized hole of arbitrary shape inside an elastic half-plane. Of
   particular interest is the maximum hoop stress on the hole's boundary
   with relation to the point of maximum curvature and the distance between
   the hole and the free surface of the half-plane. The shape of the hole
   is characterized by a conformal mapping which maps the exterior of the
   hole onto the exterior of the unit circle in the image plane. On using
   the technique of conformal mapping and analytic continuation, the
   complex potentials of the half-plane are expressed in a series form with
   unknown coefficients to be determined by Fourier expansion method.
   Detailed numerical results are shown for elliptical, triangular, square
   and rectangular holes. Two basic conclusions are that the hoop stress
   increases with decreasing hole size and the maximum hoop stress
   generally appears nearby but not exactly at the point of maximum
   curvature. In addition, it is shown that the hoop stress nearby the
   point of maximum curvature on the hole's boundary increases rapidly with
   decreasing distance between the hole and the free surface of the
   half-plane. On the other hand, if the distance between the hole and the
   free surface is more than three times the hole size, the effect of the
   free surface on the stress concentration around the hole is ignorable
   and the elastic half-plane can be treated approximately as an elastic
   whole plane.}},

Abstract = {{Drive-thru Internet has become a popular solution vehicular Internet
   access. However, the quality-of-service provisioning for high-data-rate
   drive-thru Internet services poses significant challenges upon medium
   access control (MAC) in a large-scale and highly dynamic vehicular
   environment. In this paper, to achieve high throughput in drive-thru
   Internet, we exploit the mobility interdependency between neighboring
   vehicles and propose a density-adaptive MAC protocol by predicting the
   vehicle-density dynamics. Specifically, to predict the vehicle-density
   fluctuations in the drive-thru Internet scenario, we leverage
   Navier-Stokes equations to characterize the mobility interdependence and
   the dynamically waving vehicle-density which can be observed from the
   simulated vehicle traces in VISSIM. In tune with the dynamic
   vehicle-density, we propose an enhanced MAC protocol to dynamically
   adjust the contention window (CW) setting in order to improve the
   throughput. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the
   utilized mobility model, and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
   MAC protocol in improving the overall resultant system throughput.}},

Abstract = {{We studied digital stethoscope recordings in children undergoing
   simultaneous catheterization of the pulmonary artery (PA) to determine
   whether time-domain analysis of heart sound intensity would aid in the

   the total number of heart sound samples in the extracted event and k is

   subjects (median age: 6 years {[}range: 0.25-19 years], 13 female), 11
   with PAH (median mPAp: 55 mmHg {[}range: 25-97 mmHg]) and 11 without PAH
   (median mPAp: 15 mmHg {[}range: 8-24 mmHg]). The P2 : A2 (P = .0001) and
   P2 : S2 (P = .0001) intensity ratios were significantly different
   between subjects with and those without PAH. There was a linear
   correlation (r > 0.7) between the P2 : S2 and P2 : A2 intensity ratios
   and mPAp. We found that the P2 : A2 and P2 : S2 intensity ratios
   discriminated between children with and those without PAH. These
   findings may be useful for developing an acoustic device to diagnose
   PAH.}},

Abstract = {{When many variable frequency drives are connected to a common
   switchboard, their aggregated effect on system dynamics can be
   significant. In this paper, the aggregation method for variable
   frequency drives and their motors in industrial facilities is proposed,
   which is suitable for power systems dynamic studies. The proposed method
   can be applied to various types of motor drive systems. There are two
   steps involved for the proposed aggregation method: (1) aggregate motor
   drive systems connected to the same bus, and (2) further combine the
   aggregated model of motor drive systems from Step 1 with upstream series
   impedance and/or transformers. Due to involvement of high-order transfer
   functions in dynamic models of individual motor drive systems, Pade
   approximation is used as a useful tool in the aggregation process. Using
   the proposed aggregation method, an equivalent aggregated dynamic model
   of motor drive systems can be obtained at the substation bus. A case
   study is conducted in the paper, and the proposed aggregation method is
   verified to be effective by the case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new model to classify wastes in IT
   organizations. In the beginning, we discuss the potential reasons behind
   the relatively low success rate of lean initiatives in knowledge-based
   industries in general and in IT organizations in particular. The virtual
   nature of business processes in IT organizations calls into question the
   applicability of Toyota's categorization of physical wastes in IT
   settings. Then, through a real-life project, we develop a new model of
   waste categorization for the operation of a ``medium-sized{''} IT
   department. In addition to the new classifications specific to IT, we
   discuss suitable elimination strategies and how they have improved the
   daily operations of the organization by reducing the lead-time by
   56-60\%, increasing customer satisfactions by 15.7\%, and saving
   hundreds of thousands of the operational cost. Finally, we emphasize the
   need to think lean when developing the waste elimination strategies by
   eliminating the root cause of the waste and not the subsequent wastes.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for tackling classification problems usually maximize prediction

   seems to be a shortage of methods to generate maximum-predictive-value

   classifier optimized by a genetic algorithm. We test its performance
   using 13 publicly available data sets from the life sciences. The method
   generally gives more effective high-predictive-value models than
   standard classification methods optimized for predictive value. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Through the development of management and intelligent control systems,
   we can make useful decision by using incoming data. These systems are
   used commonly in dynamic environments that some of which are been
   rule-based architectures. Event Condition Action (ECA) rule is one of
   the types that are used in dynamic environments. ECA rules have been
   designed for the systems that need automatic response to certain
   conditions or events. Changes of environmental conditions during the
   time are important factors impacting a reduction of the effectiveness of
   these rules which are implied by changing users demands of the systems
   that vary over time. Also, the rate of the changes in the rules are not
   known which means we are faced with the lack of information about rate
   of occurrence of new unknown conditions as a result of dynamics
   environments. Therefore, an intelligent rule learning is required for
   ECA rules to maintain the efficiency of the system. To the best
   knowledge of the authors, ECA rule learning has not been investigated.
   An intelligent rule learning for ECA rules are studied in this paper and
   a method is presented by using a combination of multi flexible fuzzy
   tree (MFlexDT) algorithm and neural network. Hence data loss could be
   avoided by considering the uncertainty aspect. Owing to runtime, speed,
   and also stream data in dynamic environments, a hierarchical learning
   model is proposed. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method
   for resource management in the Grid and e-commerce as case studies by
   modeling and simulating. A case study is presented to show the
   applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The volumetric locking issue is critical in finite element analysis of
   nearly incompressible problems. In this paper, a new five-node
   quadrilateral element (Q5) is proposed by enriching the four-node
   quadrilateral element (Q4) with a centroid node to solve the volumetric
   locking problem in FEM. The cell-based smoothed FEM is employed with Q5
   element (referred as Q5-CS-SC4) to soften the stiffness in order to
   obtain a better solution. To eliminate pressure oscillation in
   near-incompressible problems, an edge-based area-weighted smoothing
   scheme incorporated with the cell-wise divergence-free Q5 element is
   carried out (referred as Q5-EAW), and an adjustable area-weighted strain
   smoothing scheme using a parameter p is proposed to improve the
   performance of the Q5 element in dealing with incompressible media
   (referred as Q5-pEAW). The formulation of Q5-pEAW is a simple
   combination of Q5-CS-SC4 and Q5-EAW by an adjustable area weight. It can
   search the exact strain energy of the problem in near-incompressible
   cases. We also introduce another node-based strain smoothing technique
   (Q5-NAW) into the domain-based selective scheme to obtain a Q5-pEAW/NAW
   model to solve the pressure oscillation, which gives a much smoother
   pressure solution than Q5-EAW. Finally, the Q5 element is extended into
   hexahedral element to develop a nine-node hexahedral (H9) element shape
   function by enriching the eight-node hexahedral element (Q8) with a
   centroid node. An H9-Gi/NAW model similar to Q5-pEAW/NAW is proposed by
   using H9 element to solve the 3D volumetric locking. A series of
   benchmark problems are provided to demonstrate that the proposed
   Q5-pEAW/NAW for 2D plane strain problems, and H9-Gi/NAW model for 3D
   cases are locking-free for nearly incompressible problems. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{The problem of achieving high light extraction efficiency in Al-rich
   AlxGa1-xN is of paramount importance for the realization of AlGaN-based
   deep ultraviolet (DUV) optoelectronic devices. To solve this problem, we
   investigate the microscopic mechanism of valence band inversion and
   light polarization, a crucial factor for enhancing light extraction
   efficiency, in Al-rich AlxGa1-xN alloy using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof
   hybrid functional, local-density approximation with 1/2 occupation, and
   the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional, in which the spin-orbit coupling
   effect is included. We find that the microscopic Ga-atom distribution
   can effectively modulate the valence band structure of Al-rich
   AlxGa1-xN. Moreover, we prove that the valence band arrangement in the
   decreasing order of heavy hole, light hole, and crystal-field split-off
   hole can be realized by using nanoscale (AlN)(m)/(GaN)(n) (m>n)
   super-lattice (SL) substituting for Al-rich AlxGa1-xN disorder alloy as
   the active layer of optoelectronic devices due to the ultra-thin GaN
   layer modulation. The valence band maximum, i.e., the heavy hole band,
   has p(x)- and p(y)-like characteristics and is highly localized in the
   SL structure, which leads to the desired transverse electric (TE)
   polarized (E perpendicular to c) light emission with improved light
   extraction efficiency in the DUV spectral region. Some important
   band-structure parameters and electron/hole effective masses are also
   given. The physical origin for the valence band inversion and TE
   polarization in (AlN)(m)/(GaN)(n) SL is analyzed in depth.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel dissimilarity-analysis-based method is proposed
   to monitor the control performance of multi-input-multi-output systems.
   The proposed approach detects changes in the orientation and volume of
   hyper-ellipsoids formed by the covariance matrices via analyzing the
   eigenvalues of transformed covariance matrices. Furthermore, a new
   performance index is used to quantify performance change of control
   systems. Simulation results from a numerical example, the Wood Berry
   distillation column example, and pilot-scale experiment results all
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of coatings on polymer-based substrates by using the thermal
   spraying process is a challenging task due to the thermal sensitivity of
   polymer materials and the high temperatures that are typical of thermal
   spraying processes. Thus, prediction of the temperature distribution in
   the substrate during spraying is considered a key factor in the
   selection of appropriate coating materials and control of process
   parameters. In this study, a mathematical model, based on a Green
   function approach, has been developed to predict the temperature
   distribution within polymeric substrates during flame spraying. Good
   agreement was obtained between the experimental measurements and the
   computed results. The model was further utilized to study the effect of
   air pressure and the stand-off distance of the flame spray torch on the
   temperature distribution in the substrate. In addition to validating the
   model with experimental results, it was also validated through
   comparison of its predictions with those of an established model. (C)

Abstract = {{A set of surfaces featuring pillars with overhanging cap structures,
   exhibiting superoleophobic behavior, were fabricated using a new method.
   While such structures have been previously reported, in contrast with
   previous literature this new method allows for the control of pillar
   cross-sectional diameter, pillar separation, and Cassie fraction
   independent from the pillar radius-to-height ratio. Once fabricated the
   contact angles of the surfaces were examined using water, ethylene
   glycol, and hexadecane. These surfaces were capable of maintaining a
   stable Cassie state with hexadecane where surfaces with similar Cassie
   fraction but vertical sidewalls we had examined previously collapsed
   into the Wenzel state. The overall behavior of the liquids conforms to
   prior experience with vertical sidewall structures, with the advancing
   contact angles tending to remain high and insensitive to changing Cassie
   fraction while the receding contact angles follow the trends predicted
   by the Cassie equation much more closely. All experimental evidence
   taken together, this seems to indicate that the cap structures increase
   the stability of the Cassie state, but at the expense of increasing drop
   pinning, over and above what such surface texturing already does.}},

Abstract = {{A non-isothermal, single phase membrane electrode assembly (MEA)
   mathematical model accounting for most applicable heat sources, viz.,
   reversible, irreversible, ohmic heating, phase change, heat of
   sorption/desorption, is presented. The mathematical model fully couples
   a thermal transport equation with an MEA model and allows the study of
   non-isothermal effects, such as thermal osmosis through the membrane,
   local relative humidity variations in the catalyst layers and water
   sorption into the membrane. A detailed breakdown of various heat sources
   in the MEA at different current densities is provided and the impact of
   various thermal effects previously neglected in the literature such as
   thermal-osmosis, reversible heat distribution, and heat of sorption are
   studied. Results show that sorption heat cannot be neglected as it
   contributes up to 10\% of the total heat under normal operating
   conditions. Reversible heat distribution can significantly affect the
   temperature distribution shifting the hottest location of the cell from
   anode and cathode. Analyzing the water transport across the membrane,
   results show that thermal-osmosis contributes up to 25\% of the water
   flux inside the membrane at moderate and high current densities.}},

Title = {{Formation and post-formation dynamics of bacterial biofilm streamers as
   highly viscous liquid jets}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{It has been recently reported that in presence of low Reynolds number
   (Re << 1) transport, preformed bacterial biofilms, several hours after
   their formation, may degenerate in form of filamentous structures, known
   as streamers. In this work, we explain that such streamers form as the
   highly viscous liquid states of the intrinsically viscoelastic biofilms.
   Such ``viscous liquid{''} state can be hypothesized by noting that the
   time of appearance of the streamers is substantially larger than the
   viscoelastic relaxation time scale of the biofilms, and this appearance
   is explained by the inability of a viscous liquid to withstand external
   shear. Further, by identifying the post formation dynamics of the
   streamers as that of a viscous liquid jet in a surrounding flow field,
   we can interpret several unexplained issues associated with the
   post-formation dynamics of streamers, such as the clogging of the flow
   passage or the exponential time growth of streamer dimensions. Overall
   our manuscript provides a biophysical basis for understanding the
   evolution of biofilm streamers in creeping flows.}},

   a passive operator is reproduced and then extended to the m-user case
   while allowing each or all of the operators to behave passively or

Abstract = {{An increase in stirring speed is generally considered to be an a priori
   means of reducing external mass-transfer limitations in fast three-phase
   hydrogenations that are performed in a stirred tank. We provide
   experimental evidence for a 300-mL stirred reactor that, above a certain
   impeller speed, the efficiency of gas-liquid mass-transfer decreases,
   resulting in the decreased reaction rate. The phenomenon is attributed
   to the high degree of gas recirculation with large cavities behind the
   blades. The recirculation may decrease hydrogen concentration in the
   remainder of the tank, thus decreasing the concentration gradient that
   controls mass transfer. The model reaction in this work was
   2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol semihydrogenation with Lindlar catalyst
   Pd-Pb/CaCO3. The test impellers were a Rushton turbine, a down-pumping
   pitched blade turbine, and up-pumping A340 impellers. The kinetic
   experiments were combined with the measurement of volumetric gas-liquid
   mass-transfer coefficient, flow pattern analysis and impeller power
   demand calculations. Although the study does not include kinetic
   analysis, it provides guidance to the three-phase reaction system
   analysis that the highest stirring speed may enhance mass-transfer
   limitations and should not be used without caution.}},

   affirming process, in which the group members usually modify their
   choices until a high level of agreement within the group is achieved.
   Given the importance of forming an accepted decision by the entire
   group, the consensus problem has attained a great attention as it is a
   major goal in group decision making. In this study, we propose the
   concept of the information granularity being regarded as an important
   and useful asset supporting the goal to reach consensus in group
   decision making. By using fuzzy preference relations to represent the
   opinions of the decision makers, we develop a concept of a granular
   fuzzy preference relation where each pairwise comparison is formed as a
   certain information granule (say, an interval, fuzzy set, rough set, and
   alike) instead of a single numeric value. As being more abstract, the
   granular format of the preference model offers the required flexibility
   to increase the level of agreement within the group using the fact that
   we select the most suitable numeric representative of the fuzzy
   preference relation. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive underlay amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay links require
   signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) balancing and maximizing
   strategies. And both secondary-to-primary and primary-to-secondary
   interference must be taken into consideration. To achieve these goals,
   we develop several joint distributed beamforming and power allocation
   algorithms. The development is based on the assumption of the
   availability of channel state information (CSI) of the relay-transceiver
   channels and the second-order-statistics (SOS) of all channels. For
   single-relay and multi-relay systems, a closed-form solution and an
   exhaustive-search optimal algorithm, respectively, are developed. This
   optimal algorithm, despite its high computational complexity, serves as
   a useful benchmark. Moreover, two low-complexity suboptimal algorithms
   are proposed, both of which compute sub-optimal power allocations and
   beamformers. A 10-dB SINR improvement by the optimal algorithm and
   similar gains by both proposed suboptimal algorithms are achievable.}},

Abstract = {{Natural zeolite membranes, directly sectioned from mineral deposits,
   have been previously reported to show molecular sieve characteristics in
   selective separation of water and hydrated cations. Although a high
   removal of cations was observed, the low water flux was a limitation for
   any potential industrial applications. In this study novel
   clinoptilolite-based phosphate composite membranes were prepared by dry
   pressing of mixed powder materials followed by high temperature
   autoclave steaming and characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX. Their performance
   for pervaporative water desalination was examined using different levels
   of salinity in a temperature range of 25-95 degrees C and feed side
   pressure of 1 atm. At 1400 ppm Na feed salinity and 95 degrees C, a
   water flux of 15 kg/m(2) h and over 95\% removal of Na+ were obtained.
   The water flux achieved was about 10 times higher than the flux obtained
   using natural zeolite rock membranes. Introducing phosphate into the
   composite membranes appears to provide not only mechanical strength,
   through the possible chemical bonding between zeolite particles and the
   in-situ phosphate cement, but also to create a chemically favorable
   interface between zeolite crystals. Such interface might facilitate the
   desalination process bypassing the technical difficulties of ion
   leakage/diffusion through the inter-crystal spaces commonly associated
   with synthetic zeolite membranes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary algorithm known for
   its simplicity and effectiveness in solving various optimization
   problems. PSO should have strong yet balanced exploration and
   exploitation capabilities to enhance its performance. A superior
   solution guided PSO (SSG-PSO) framework integrated with an individual
   level based mutation operator and different local search techniques is
   proposed in this study. In SSG-PSO, a collection of superior solutions
   is maintained and updated with the evolutionary process, such that each
   particle can comprehensively learn from the recorded superior solutions.
   In addition, to maintain the diversity of the particle swarm, SSG-PSO is
   combined with an individual level based mutation operator, which will be
   invoked when a particle is trapped in a local optimum (determined by the
   fitness and position states of the particle), thereby improving the
   adaptation and flexibility of each individual particle. Moreover, two
   gradient-based local search techniques, namely, the
   Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and Davidon-Fletcher-Powell
   (DFP) Quasi-Newton methods, and two derivative-free local search
   techniques, namely, pattern search and Nelder-Mead simplex search, are
   incorporated into SSG-PSO. The performances of SSG-PSO and that of its
   local search enhanced variants are extensively and comparatively studied
   on a suit of benchmark optimization functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Hot solution infiltration was investigated as a flexible and rapid
   method to incorporate anode and cathode components into fully sintered,
   porous ceramic tubular templates for use as solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFC). Composed of either a porous 8 mol\% yttria-stabilized zirconia
   (YSZ) or 5 wt\% NiO-YSZ support structure, a thin Ni-YSZ anode
   functional layer and an outer ca. 10 gm dense YSZ electrolyte, closed
   end tubes were first hot solution (ca. 100 degrees C) infiltrated on the
   inside with NiO-SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) to serve as the anode. Cathodes
   were either LSM (nominally La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+delta) infiltrated into a thin
   porous YSZ layer on the outer electrolyte surface, or an LSCF-GDC
   composite (Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95-La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta) on a thin GDC
   buffer layer. Although hot solution infiltration of the Ni, Ce and Sm
   salts into the anode support structure did not result in complete
   penetration (with the Ni contents in the tube wall ranging between 4 and
   10 vol.\%), well-sealed full cells produced power densities as high as
   275, 196 and 153 mW cm(-2) at 800, 750 and 700 degrees C, respectively.
   Hot solution infiltration of active SOFC electrode materials is thus
   shown to be a very flexible approach for the evaluation of their

   NavierStokes, continuum, and heat transport equations are formulated in
   a mixed finite-element universal integration scheme to simulate the
   multiphase problem using the finite-element method. The highly resolved
   time-varying accurate numerical solution of the velocity field is
   utilized to identify the transport barriers in terms of finite time
   Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) ridges whose movements govern the mixing in the
   melt flow. The ridge structures are dynamically driven materials
   surfaces which provide the insight into the efficiency of mixing in two
   distinct operating regimes of the Bridgman crystal growth process.}},

Title = {{Magnetization Transfer Prepared Gradient Echo MRI for CEST Imaging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) is an emerging MRI contrast
   mechanism that is capable of noninvasively imaging dilute CEST agents
   and local properties such as pH and temperature, augmenting the routine
   MRI methods. However, the routine CEST MRI includes a long RF saturation
   pulse followed by fast image readout, which is associated with high
   specific absorption rate and limited spatial resolution. In addition,
   echo planar imaging (EPI)-based fast image readout is prone to image
   distortion, particularly severe at high field. To address these
   limitations, we evaluated magnetization (MT) prepared gradient echo
   (GRE) MRI for CEST imaging. We proved the feasibility using numerical
   simulations and experiments in vitro and in vivo. Then we optimized the
   sequence by serially evaluating the effects of the number of saturation

   endogenous amide proton CEST imaging in rats brains (n = 5) that

Abstract = {{Pounding between adjacent buildings is a significant challenge in
   metropolitan areas because buildings of different heights collide during
   earthquake excitations due to varying dynamic properties and narrow
   separation gaps. The seismic responses of adjacent buildings of varying
   height, coupled through soil subjected to earthquake-induced pounding,
   are evaluated in this paper. The lumped mass model is used to simulate
   the buildings and soil, while the linear visco-elastic contact force
   model is used to simulate pounding forces. The results indicate while
   the taller building is almost unaffected when the shorter building is
   very short, it suffers more from pounding with increasing height of the
   shorter building. The shorter building suffers more from the pounding
   with decreasing height and when its height differs substantially from
   that of the taller building. The minimum required separation gap to
   prevent pounding is increased with increasing height of the shorter
   building until the buildings become almost in-phase. Considering the
   soil effect; pounding forces are reduced, displacements and story shears
   are increased after pounding, and also, minimum separation gap required
   to prevent pounding is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of metallic materials are intrinsically determined by their
   electron behavior. However, relevant theoretical treatment involving
   quantum mechanics is complicated and difficult to be applied in
   materials design. Electron work function (EWF) has been demonstrated to
   be a simple but fundamental parameter which well correlates properties
   of materials with their electron behavior and could thus be used to
   predict material properties from the aspect of electron activities in a
   relatively easy manner. In this article, we propose a method to extract
   the electron work functions of binary solid solutions or alloys from
   their phase diagrams and use this simple approach to predict their
   mechanical strength and surface properties, such as adhesion. Two
   alloys, Fe-Ni and Cu-Zn, are used as samples for the study. EWFs
   extracted from phase diagrams show same trends as experimentally
   observed ones, based on which hardness and surface adhesive force of the
   alloys are predicted. This new methodology provides an alternative
   approach to predict material properties based on the work function,
   which is extractable from the phase diagram. This work may also help
   maximize the power of phase diagram for materials design and
   development. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the
   self-assembly of polyaromatic (PA) compounds in n-heptane. These
   compounds possess the same PA core but systematically varied side-chain
   lengths. Regardless of the side-chain lengths, the simulations revealed
   the formation of one-dimensional (1D) self-assemblies resulting mainly
   from parallel stacked PA cores. The length over which the parallel
   stacking persists was found to be 3-5.6 nm. The 1D self-assembly was not
   observed for the same PA compounds in water or toluene, suggesting the
   importance of solvent properties in its formation. In particular,
   n-heptane can prevent the side chains from interfering with PA core
   stacking while having limited attraction with the cores, which
   facilitates the 1D self-assembling. These findings, revealed at the
   molecular level, provide insights into controlling the self-assembling
   process in the design of optical and electronic nanodevices.}},

Abstract = {{Realistic decision making involves consideration of uncertainty in
   various parameters. While large number of scenarios brings significant
   challenge to computations, the scenario reduction aims at selecting a
   small number of representative scenarios that can capture the wide range
   of possible scenarios. A novel scenario reduction algorithm is proposed
   in this paper to incorporate the consideration of both input data and
   output performance of decision making. The proposed optimal scenario
   reduction algorithm, OSCAR, is formulated as a mixed integer linear
   optimization problem. It minimizes not only the probabilistic distance
   between the original and reduced input scenario distribution, but also
   minimizes the differences between the best, worst and expected
   performances of the output measure of the original and the reduced
   scenario distributions. The proposed method leads to reduced
   distribution not only closer to the original distribution in terms of
   the transportation distance, but also captures the performance of the
   output. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11, SI}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In order to elucidate design principles for peptide-based materials, we
   investigate (RADA)4 oligopeptides that self-assemble to form beta-sheet
   rich nanofibers that further develop into a viscoelastic 3D matrix in
   aqueous solution. Despite the fact that these materials can form
   hydrogels that are up to 99.5\% (w/v) water, there is a limited
   understanding of water structure within these matrices. (RADA)4
   nanofibers were formed in solutions at various temperatures (25 to 80
   degrees C, and cooled to 25 degrees C) and peptide concentrations
   (0.5-3.0\% (w/v)), and characterized using Circular Dichroism (CD),
   Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC). CD and TEM results showed some contradictions, where
   CD data suggested no nanofiber had formed but TEM images clearly showed
   nanofibers present. These results call into question previously
   published results where CD has been used solely for proving nanofiber
   formation. It was found that secondary structure of assembled peptides
   was affected by peptide concentration. Of significant interest was the
   structure of the water within the self-assembled structures. Where it
   was observed using DSC that the bound water structure was dramatically
   affected by peptide concentration. The unexpected results showed that at
   3.0\% (w/v) of peptide the amount of non-frozen water approached 80\%,
   perhaps reflecting the synergy between closely packed nanofiber surfaces
   in interacting with water. However, it could be that the bound water
   content may also play a role in the structural transition from a-helices
   to beta-sheets that may occur as nanofibers developed. Further
   understanding how to control this water structure could lead to novel
   ways of drug delivery through tuning the molecular mobility of water
   within the 3-D matrix itself.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate statistics based damage detection algorithms employed in

   by Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors as part of a bridge health
   monitoring study. The most common and critical bridge damage scenarios
   were simulated on the representative bridge model equipped with FBG
   sensors. A high speed FBG interrogator system is developed by the
   authors to collect the strain responses under moving vehicle loads using
   FBG sensors. Two data driven methods, Moving Principal Component

   efficiency of the SHM system with FBG sensors, MPCA and MCCA methods for
   detecting and localizing damage is explored with several experiments.
   Based on the findings presented in this paper, the MPCA and MCCA coupled

Abstract = {{Improper management of labor resources is one of the main causes of
   schedule delays and budget overruns in industrial construction projects.
   During management of these projects, a vast amount of data is collected
   and discarded without being analyzed to extract useful knowledge. To
   address this issue, an integrated proposed methodology is developed
   based on a five-step knowledge discovery in data (KDD) model. First, a
   synthesis of previous research is presented. Second, an inclusive
   analysis of the industrial construction domain and labor resources data
   is performed. Third, the concept of predefined progressable work
   packages is introduced for consistent data collection. Fourth, a
   prototype data warehouse is built using the snowflake schema to
   centrally store the collected data and produce dynamic online analytical
   processing (OLAP) reports and graphs. Fifth, data mining techniques are
   applied to extract useful knowledge from large sets of real projects'
   data. Results show that the developed methodology is capable of
   gathering valuable knowledge from previously unanalyzed data that
   significantly improves current resource management practices. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{As projects become more complex and project management more integrated,
   project-performance measurements must expand. Project-oriented
   contractors need a unified performance-measurement system that
   integrates project attributes. A unified system framework is presented
   that formalizes contractors' project evaluations and assists in
   controlling projects during the execution phase. It measures performance
   of all critical objectives of a project separately, assigns a priority
   to each using the analytical hierarchy process, then integrates the
   measurements into a single metric for overall performance. The overall
   index is based on eight objective project-performance measurements. A
   case study assessment of an airport rehabilitation project's performance
   is presented. This research attempted to expand performance measures to
   include aspects other than just quantitative (e.g., cost, schedule)
   information. Soft performance measures (e.g., safety, customer
   satisfaction) were integrated into the overall project performance and
   an integrated project-performance index was developed. This approach was
   applied to a case study in which the researchers worked directly with
   the company, and the study results showed that the key performance index
   was easy to implement and achieved practical results. (C) 2014 American

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new H-infinity filter design approach is proposed for

   a linear filter for the modified model of the plant, and then extracts
   the original states of the system. The designed filter estimates both
   the system states and the unknown input simultaneously and does not have
   many of the restrictive assumptions and restrictions that the existing
   unknown input filters do. In the end, simulation results are used to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{AIM: To describe how pegylated glucose-coated gold nanoparticles
   (PEG-Glu-GNPs) can help improve computed tomography (CT) imaging.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: PEG-Glu-GNPs were designed for use as an imaging
   nanoprobe to act an effective contrast agent for both CT and PET scans.
   Twelve BALB/c mice were divided into two groups: mice with injected with
   PEG-Glu-GNPs and control mice. The mice were examined using
   high-resolution micro-CT at different time intervals (24 h, 7 days, and
   15 days) after the injection of the particles. Greyscale density and CT
   attenuation values were determined to trace the excretion of the
   particles over time.
   RESULTS: Tumour contours were easily distinguished from surrounding
   tissue in mice injected with PEG-Glu-GNPs but not controls. This
   distinction was still visible at 7 days, but not at 15 days
   post-injection.
   CONCLUSION: Molecular imaging technology has enabled the development of
   a new generation of imaging probes. These sophisticated probes can
   visualize biological processes or enable early diagnosis of diseases in
   vivo. Compared to conventional CT images and PET scans, PEG-Glu-GNPs
   significantly improved image quality at the cellular and molecular
   level, which can significantly aid the early detection of cancer or
   cancer metastases. (C) 2014 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published

Abstract = {{The demulsification mechanism of asphaltene-stabilized water-in-toluene
   emulsions by an ethylene-oxidepropylene oxide (EOPO) based polymeric
   demulsifier was studied. Demulsification efficiency was determined by
   bottle tests and correlated to the physicochemical properties of
   asphaltene interfacial films after demulsifier addition. From bottle
   tests and droplet coalescence experiments, the demulsifier showed an
   optimal performance at 2.3 ppm (mass basis) in toluene. At high
   concentrations, the demulsification performance deteriorated due to the
   intrinsic stabilizing capacity of the demulsifier, which was attributed
   to steric repulsion between water droplets. Addition of demulsifier was
   shown to soften the asphaltene film (i.e., reduce the viscoelastic
   moduli of asphaltene films) under both shear and compressional
   interfacial deformations. Study of the macrostructures and the chemical
   composition of asphaltene film at the toluenewater interface after
   demulsifier addition demonstrated gradual penetration of the demulsifier
   into the asphaltene film. Demulsifier penetration in the asphaltene film
   changed the asphaltene interfacial mobility and morphology, as probed
   with Brewster angle and atomic force microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Low-temperature oxidation of bitumen with air in the temperature range
   of 130160 degrees C was investigated. Of particular interest were the
   addition reactions taking place during oxidation, which contributed to
   the observed increase in viscosity of oxidized bitumen. During the
   autoxidation of bitumen, the relative aliphatic to aromatic loss-ratio
   of hydrogen increased from 18:1 to 30:1 when the temperature was
   increased from 140 degrees C to 150 degrees C and then remained almost
   the same at 160 degrees C. It coincided with a bitumen oxidation
   selectivity change reported in the literature. The hydrocarbon class
   responsible for most addition reactions during bitumen oxidation is the
   naphthenic-aromatic class. A model compound oxidation study at 130
   degrees C found no addition products during paraffin oxidation, low
   addition product selectivity for naphthenic and alkylaromatic compounds,
   and no measurable oxidation of aromatics without alkyl groups. It was
   proposed that the dominant pathway for addition reactions of
   hydrocarbons is hydrogen disproportionation of free radicals to produce
   olefins. Free-radical addition to olefins through the formation of CC
   bonds explained all of the oxidation selectivity observations from the
   model compound studies, as well as the addition products identified from
   their mass spectra. It could also be applied to explain the bitumen
   oxidation results in these and other studies.}},

Abstract = {{The asphaltene fraction of crude oil is commonly considered to be
   responsible for the formation of highly undesirable, stable
   water-in-crude oil emulsions and rag layers. We developed a new
   procedure for subfractionation of asphaltenes based on their interfacial
   activity. The most interfacially active asphaltene (IAA) subfraction was
   extracted as an interfacial material from emulsified water droplets in
   asphaltene solution. The IAA subfraction represents less than 2 wt \% of
   whole asphaltenes (WA), but its removal had a profound effect on
   interfacial and thin emulsion film properties. It was found that the IAA
   subfraction is a main contributor to emulsion stabilization and
   formation of rigid oil-water interfaces. IAA adsorbed irreversibly at
   the oil-water interface and formed interfacial layers of low
   compressibility. Thin emulsion films of toluene stabilized by IAA were
   thicker and exhibited severe aging effects in contrast to the films
   stabilized with remaining asphaltene fractions, which were thin and less
   rigid, without any noticeable aging effects.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) multilateral haptic systems involve
   teleoperation of several robots in physical environments by several
   human operators or collaborative interaction of several human operators
   in a virtual environment. An m-DOF n-lateral haptic system can be
   modeled as an n-port network where each port (terminal) connects to a
   termination defined by m inputs and m outputs. The stability analysis of
   such systems is not trivial due to dynamic coupling across the different
   DOFs of the robots, the human operators, and the physical/virtual
   environments, and unknown dynamics of the human operators and the
   environments exacerbate the problem. Llewellyn's criterion only allows
   for absolute stability analysis of 1-DOF bilateral haptic systems (m = 1
   and n = 2), which can be modeled as two-port networks. The absolute
   stability of a general m-DOF bilateral haptic system where m > 1 cannot
   be obtained from m applications of Llewellyn's criterion to each DOF of
   the bilateral system. In addition, if we were to use Llewellyn's
   criterion for absolute stability analysis of a general 1-DOF n-lateral
   haptic system where n > 2, we would need to couple n - 2 terminations of
   the n-port network to (an infinite number of) known impedances to reduce
   it to an equivalent two-port network; this is a cumbersome process that
   involves an infinite number of applications of Llewellyn's criterion. In
   this brief, we present a straightforward and convenient criterion for
   absolute stability analysis of a class of m-DOF n-lateral haptic systems
   for any m >= 1 and n >= 2. As case studies, a 1-DOF trilateral and a
   2-DOF bilateral haptic system are studied for absolute stability with
   simulations and experiments confirming the theoretical stability
   conditions.}},

   hardware emulation of device-level models for the insulated gate bipolar

Abstract = {{Compared with daily recorded process variables that can be easily
   obtained through the distributed control system, acquirements of key
   quality variables are much more difficult. As a result, for soft sensor
   development, we may only have a small number of output data samples and
   have much more input data samples. In this case, it is important to
   incorporate more input data samples to improve the modeling performance
   of the soft sensor. On the basis of the semisupervised modeling method,
   this paper aims to extend the linear semisupervised soft sensor to the
   nonlinear one, with incorporation of the kernel learning algorithm.
   Under the probabilistic modeling framework, a mixture form of the
   nonlinear semisupervised soft sensor is developed in the present work.
   To evaluate the performance of the developed nonlinear semisupervised
   soft sensor, an industrial case study is provided. Copyright (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Following continuing trends in nanofabrication, the near future may see
   the requirement to integrate and assemble devices and integrated
   circuits that are below the scale that conventional robotic
   pick-and-place systems can successfully accommodate. Presented here is a
   protein-ligand based approach to self-assembling micronscale components
   onto specific patterned locations on a substrate. Other than the
   benefits in scale, this integration method may be advantageous for its
   parallel nature, 3D capabilities, and the ability to integrate devices
   made from incompatible processing technologies into a single platform
   (heterogeneous integration). Five micrometer square silicon microtiles
   were fabricated as model devices for microscale integrated circuits.
   They were fabricated from a silicon-on-insulator substrate and released
   into solution by bath ultrasonication after the buried oxide layer
   underneath them was underetched. A silicon target substrate was also
   patterned with gold pads for the microtiles to assemble onto.
   Self-assembled monolayers were employed to functionalize both the
   microtiles and the gold pads with biotin and avidin, respectively. Due
   to the very strong protein-ligand binding between avidin and biotin, the
   functionalized microtiles in solution were able to attach onto the
   target gold pads with a high selectivity. In this demonstration, for 5
   mu m square microtiles assembling onto square gold pads of the same
   size, 2.0\% of the gold pads were covered by the microtiles and a
   selectivity (microtiles assembling onto the gold pads as opposed to the
   silicon substrate) of 7.3:1 was achieved. (C) 2014 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Returning the streets to safe driving conditions during wintertime is a
   priority in cold regions. Using Real-Time Traction Tool (RT3)-Curve's
   lateral friction measurements, the effectiveness of plowing and three
   rates of sanding on different road conditions was investigated. Even a
   low amount of sand caused a significant reduction in friction on bare
   dry surfaces. Plowing did not provide significant benefits on ice;
   though it was a critical operation for snow conditions. While low
   sanding did not necessarily improve friction over plowed ice and snow,
   medium and high sanding considerably increased friction over plowed ice
   and snow. Regression analysis on the collected data revealed that
   abrasive mixtures can quickly scatter off the road due to high-speed
   traffic; it also showed that the salt portion of the mixture was not
   able to melt the ice before it was scattered from the road; however, it
   was immediately effective for snow at -8 degrees C.}},

   exhibit frequency independent bandwidths of 7.8 and 5.2 GHz,

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development of model predictive control
   algorithm which accounts for the input and state constraints applied to
   the parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) system describing
   the axial dispersion chemical reactor. Spatially varying terms arising
   from the nonlinear PDEs model are accounted for in model development.
   Finite-dimensional modal representation capturing the dominant dynamics
   of the PDEs system is derived for controller design through Galerkin's
   method and modal decomposition technique. Tustin's discretization and
   Cayley transform are used to obtain infinite-dimensional discrete-time
   dynamic modal representations which are used in subsequent constrained
   controller design. The proposed discrete-time constrained model
   predictive control synthesis is constructed in a way that the objective
   function is only based on the low-order modal representation of the PDEs
   system, while higher-order modes are utilized only in the constraints of
   the PDEs state. Finally, the MPC formulations are successfully applied,
   via simulation results, to the PDEs system with input and state
   constraints. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   addresses a soft sensor development problem for linear systems with two

   fusion technique, avoiding running the full augmented state Kalman
   filter, and leading to a considerably lower implementation cost.
   Although it is suboptimal, the loss in performance is minor compared to
   the optimal filter. Two simulation examples demonstrate the advantages

Abstract = {{Valve stiction is often a common problem in control loops and stiction
   induced oscillation is the main cause of poor performance in control
   systems. Cascade control is extensively applied in process industry as
   an effective strategy to restrain disturbances and compensate process
   nonlinearities. In recent years many studies have been performed on the
   detection and quantification of valve stiction in single feedback
   control loops. However, there is a lack in developing a mechanism which
   can analyze stiction induced oscillation in cascade control loops. This
   work focuses on the frequency analysis of stiction induced oscillations
   in cascade control loops and proposes a mechanism of oscillation
   compensation through outer and inner controller tuning. The effect of
   oscillation compensation by changing control strategies is also
   discussed. The theoretical analysis is evaluated through simulation
   examples and a pilot-scale flow-level cascade control experiment. (C)

Abstract = {{Solvent injection into heavy-oil reservoirs is quite complex because of
   the asphaltene destabilization that occurs because of the changes in
   temperature, pressure, and solvent type dissolved in oil. As a result of
   this destabilization, the asphaltene flocculates, agglomerates, and
   eventually plugs the pores in the reservoir because of the formation of
   asphaltene clusters. In solvent applications, light-molecular-weight
   hydrocarbon solvents are preferred because of their high diffusion
   coefficient; however, as the carbon number of n-alkane solvents
   decreases, asphaltene precipitation increases. Therefore, the selection
   of the solvent and application condition is highly critical in cold and
   thermally aided solvent applications.
   In this research, low-carbon-number n-alkane (propane, n-hexane, and
   n-decane) and a distillate-hydrocarbon (obtained from a
   heavy-oil-upgrading facility) injection into glass-bead-pack systems
   saturated with heavy oil (87,651 and 20,918 cp at 25 degrees C) were
   evaluated at different pressure conditions that are applicable to
   typical Canadian oil-sand reservoirs (698-2068 kPa) and temperatures
   (25-120 degrees C). First, the asphaltene behavior of different solvents
   at different pressures and temperatures was studied through deasphalting
   work in a pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) cell in previous work
   {[}Moreno and Babadagli (2013)]. By use of quantitative (amount of
   asphaltene precipitated) and qualitative (microscopic images of
   asphaltene clusters) observations, asphaltenes were classified in terms
   of their shape, size, and quantity for different oil/solvent types,
   pressure, and temperature.
   Continually, the same n-alkane, distillate-hydrocarbon solvents, and
   heavy oil were used in gravity-stable-displacement glass-beadpack
   experiments. 3-D (cylindrical) glass-bead-pack experiments were carried
   out at the same temperature and pressure conditions used for the PVT
   experiments. The operational conditions, oil composition, and solvent
   type showed significant effects on oil-recovery factor. Asphaltene
   deposition and residual oil saturation (ROS) in the glass-bead pack and
   the amount of asphaltene in the produced oil were measured, and the
   standard saturate, aromatic, resin, and asphaltene (SARA) analysis was
   applied to determine the optimal operating conditions yielding the
   highest recoveries with minimal pore plugging. Moreover, the
   pore-plugging process was analyzed through a visual scanning electron
   microscope (SEM) and optical microscope to find the different organic
   deposition formation and agglomeration. Oil production was evaluated by
   use of microscope visualization, viscosity reduction, and
   refractive-index values. Eventually, optimal application conditions for
   solvent and thermally aided solvent injection were listed for a wide
   range of heavy-oil and solvent types.}},

Abstract = {{Pipeline hydrotransport of agricultural residue in a carrier liquid
   could be an economically viable alternative to replace truck delivery of
   biomass materials, as well as encouraging the increase in scale of
   bio-refineries. The feasibility of this concept, together with friction
   loss behaviour and corresponding mechanisms of biomass slurry flows
   through pipelines, was previously studied by the authors. A 50 mm
   diameter, 25 m long pipeline facility was used to measure the
   longitudinal pressure gradient of wheat straw and corn stover slurries
   over mange of particle dimensions, slurry solid mass fractions, and
   slurry velocities. Econometric software and a nonlinear least square
   regression model were used to analyse the measured pressure gradients
   and an empirical correlation was proposed to predict slurry pressure
   gradients as a function of slurry specifications and operating
   conditions. The correlation was then modified using scale-up methods to
   account for the effects of pipe diameter. The pressure gradient was
   found to be proportional to the pipe diameter to the power of -1.2. The
   final correlation was able to predict the longitudinal pressure gradient
   of the flow of agricultural residues (i.e., non-wood fibres) as biomass
   slurries in pipes and, with a small uncertainty (<10\%), could be
   applied to design commercial pipelines to hydraulically transport
   various agricultural residue biomass slurries. This knowledge of the
   slurry flow pressure gradient is essential to specify slurry pumps,
   determine the number of booster stations, and estimate the capital and
   operational costs of a slurry pipeline. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by

Abstract = {{The smart grid vision has resulted in many demand side innovations such
   as nonintrusive load monitoring techniques, residential micro-grids, and

   Monte Carlo (SMC) simulation platform for modeling and simulating low
   voltage residential networks. This platform targets the simulation of
   the quasi-steady-state network condition over an extended period such as
   24 h. It consists of two main components. The first is a multiphase
   network model with power flow, harmonic, and motor starting study
   capabilities. The second is a load/generation behavior model that
   establishes the operating characteristics of various loads and
   generators based on time-of-use probability curves. These two components
   are combined together through an SMC simulation scheme. Four case
   studies are presented to demonstrate the applications of the proposed

Abstract = {{The adhesion receptor CD44 plays an important role in the survival and
   retention of leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSPC) within the bone
   marrow (BM) niche, as well as in the high relapse rates of acute myeloid
   leukemia (AML). Down-regulating CD44 could be clinically relevant not
   only for suppression of the deregulated function of LSPC but also in
   LSPC response to chemotherapeutic agents. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
   delivery is a promising approach for AML treatment, and we recently
   reported effective siRNA delivery into difficult-to-transfect AML cell
   lines using lipid-substituted polyethylenimine/siRNA complexes
   (polymeric nanoparticles). In this study, we investigated polymeric
   nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 in CD34(+) LSPC cell models
   (leukemic KG-1 and KG-1a cell lines) as well as primary AML cells.
   Polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing decreased surface CD44 levels
   in KG-1, KG-1a and primary AML cells by up to 27\%, 30\% and 20\% at day
   3, respectively. Moreover, CD44 silencing resulted in induction of
   apoptosis in KG-1 cells, reduced adhesion of KG-1 and KG-1a cells to
   hyaluronic acid-coated cell culture plates and BM-MSC, and decreased
   adhesion of primary AML cells to BM-MSC. Our results suggest that
   polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 might be a useful
   technique for inhibiting LSPC interactions with their microenvironment,
   thereby prohibiting leukemia progression or sensitizing LSPC to
   chemotherapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Linkage between reactor performance and microbial community dynamics was
   investigated during mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion of restaurant
   grease waste (GTW) with municipal wastewater sludge (MWS) using 10 L
   completely mixed reactors and a 20 day SRT. Test reactors received a
   mixture of GTW and MWS while control reactors received only MWS.
   Addition of GTW to the test reactors enhanced the biogas production and
   methane yield by up to 65\% and 120\%, respectively. Pyrosequencing
   revealed that Methanosaeta and Methanomicrobium were the dominant
   acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen genera, respectively,
   during stable reactor operation. The number of Methanosarcina and
   Methanomicrobium sequences increased and that of Methanosaeta declined
   when the proportion of GTW in the feed was increased to cause an
   overload condition. Under this overload condition, the pH, alkalinity
   and methane production decreased and VFA concentrations increased
   dramatically. Candidatus cloacamonas, affiliated within phylum
   Spirochaetes, were the dominant bacterial genus at all reactor loadings.

Abstract = {{BackgroundFibular free flap (FFF) bone has thick cortical bone
   surrounding a fatty marrow. The cortex has sufficient density for dental
   implantation, but the marrow limits bone stock. A novel technique was
   devised to increase bone density: the bone-impacted fibular free flap
   (BIFFF). The purpose of this study was to: (1) describe the BIFFF
   technique; (2) evaluate the bone density of BIFFF; and (3) evaluate the
   stability/success of implants placed in BIFFFs.
   MethodsPatients undergoing maxillary/mandibular reconstruction with FFFs
   were prospectively enrolled from 1998 to 2008. Two cohorts were
   compared: BIFFF and nonmodified FFF. The main outcome was bone density
   as seen on CT scans. Primary dental implant stability was determined via
   Periotest.
   ResultsThirty-eight patients were included in this study. BIFFFs
   achieved higher bone density versus unmodified FFFs (p < .05). Greater
   primary dental implant stability occurred in BIFFFs (p < .05). One
   hundred percent of BIFFF and 59\% of nonmodified FFF implants were
   successful at 1 year.
   ConclusionBIFFF increases reconstructed bone density, initial dental
   implant stability, and 1-year implant success. (c) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{The potential of plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles (PHEVs) to
   participate in power system control, via the vehicle-to-grid program, is
   increasing rapidly. In several recent studies, PHEVs are employed to
   participate in system frequency regulation; however, no attention has
   been paid to the impact of single-phase connection of these distributed
   energy sources. This paper addressed the use of PHEVs to stabilize the
   frequency in microgrids and/or weak grids which lack enough inertia
   considering the single-phase nature and communication delays.
   Small-signal analysis is used to evaluate the performance of both droop
   and virtual inertia control methods, and show how time delay of a
   centralized control could impact system stability. Advantages and
   disadvantages of distributed control are studied, and a new method based
   on a combination of both centralized and distributed control is proposed
   to mitigate the impact of asymmetrical virtual inertia while it allows
   the utilization of all available PHEVs for active power however
   asymmetric they are. Time-domain simulations are used to verify the
   analytical studies.}},

Title = {{Seismic Design of Rocking Shallow Foundations: Displacement-Based
   Methodology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a direct displacement-based design (DDBD)
   methodology for seismic design of rocking shallow foundations for
   ordinary bridges under earthquake loads. A multilinear model is
   developed to represent the backbone curve of the nonlinear
   moment-rotation behavior. In addition, a new empirical relationship is
   proposed that correlates the initial rotational stiffness to the moment
   capacity of a rocking foundation; this correlation is proposed as an
   alternative to calculation of stiffness based upon elasticity theory. In
   the proposed design procedure, a bridge system consisting of a deck
   mass, a rocking foundation, and a damped elastic column is integrated
   into a single element from which the equivalent linear damping and
   period can be determined. The DDBD methodology uses the equivalent
   system damping and period along with a design displacement response
   spectrum to determine the seismic displacement demand. The approach is
   checked by comparing displacements predicted by this method to those
   computed using nonlinear time-history analyses. The methodology also
   includes provisions to determine footing dimensions to obtain acceptable
   performance in terms of foundation settlement and lateral sliding. The
   DDBD methodology is further illustrated with a design example. (C) 2014

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The buildings provide a significant contribution to total energy
   consumption and CO 2 emissions. Integrated monitoring, analysis, and
   control methodologies can reduce this by up to 30\%. However, the
   adoption of monitoring and control systems for building management and
   control applications is hampered by the unavailability of appropriate
   tool environments. In this paper a model-driven holistic system
   architecture integrating IT systems at design, construction, and
   operation stages of buildings is presented to provide optimized building
   operations. The main aim is to create a holistic environment for
   wireless embedded monitoring and control systems to increase the
   efficiency of the overall system development process and to exploit
   their potential for reduction of building energy consumption. To reach
   this objective, new methods, tools, and hardware covering integrated
   design, energy simulation models, and data warehouse technologies are
   introduced. The developed system, which is explained in this work, is
   applied in a residential building of the Turkish Prime Ministry Housing
   Development Administration in Istanbul, Turkey, and the results are
   elaborated to improve current building conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Bubble characteristics in free hydraulic jumps for inflow Froude numbers
   ranging from 2.0 to 6.7 were measured using a single-tip optical probe,
   with a focus on mean and turbulent bubble velocities. It was found that
   the mean bubble velocity ub, to a large extent, is able to reflect the
   water-phase flow structure in a jump. In the boundary layer of the
   channel bed, ub follows the 1= 7th power law in the vertical direction,
   and it follows a Gaussian distribution beyond that up to the water
   surface. Dimensionless maximum bubble velocity was found to be smaller
   than that for the classical wall jet up to a characteristic distance in
   the longitudinal direction; beyond that, however, they agree well with
   each other. Turbulence intensity of bubble velocity was found to first
   increase and then decrease with the vertical distance from the bed. The
   maximum value of turbulence intensity is 33\% of the inflow velocity,
   which is comparable to that of the water-phase. Exponential relations
   are proposed to describe the variation of the maximum bubble velocity
   and maximum turbulence intensity of bubbles, in the longitudinal

Title = {{Investigation of Uncertainty Changes in Model Outputs for Finite-Element
   Model Updating Using Structural Health Monitoring Data}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to investigate the effect of uncertainties on the
   predicted response of structures using updated finite-element models
   (FEMs). Modeling uncertainties are quantified by fuzzy numbers and are
   incorporated into the fuzzy FEM updating procedure. The impact of the
   amount and types of data used on the performance of the updated model is
   investigated. In order to perform the complex FEM updating calculations,
   which generally take too much time for complex models, a Gaussian
   process (GP) is used as a surrogate model. The central composite design
   (CCD) method is used to sample the input parameter space for more
   accurate GP models. Genetic algorithms (GA) are employed to solve the
   inverse fuzzy model updating problem. Additional constraints are
   presented to capture the variation space of the uncertain response
   parameters. The University of Central Florida benchmark test structure,
   which is designed to represent short-span to medium-span bridges, is
   used in the scope of uncertainty quantification study. Static and
   dynamic experimental test data obtained from the benchmark structure
   under different loadings and conditions are used for the demonstration.
   A damage case, in which the stiffness reduction in boundaries is
   simulated by using flexible pads, is considered. The results show that
   appropriate data sets, which contain the least uncertainty, should be
   generated instead of involving the entire set of measurements obtained
   from different tests. Nevertheless, uncertainty quantification should be
   employed to find the variation range of uncertain responses predicted by
   simplified FEM models. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{The modeling and prediction of time series based on synergy of

Abstract = {{The time series prediction models based on fuzzy set theory have been
   widely applied to diverse fields such as enrollments, stocks, weather
   and etc., as they can handle prediction problem under uncertain
   circumstances in which data are incomplete or vague. Researchers have
   presented diverse approaches to support the development of fuzzy time
   series prediction models. While the existing approaches exhibit two
   evident shortcomings: one is that they have low efficiency of
   development, which is hardly applicable in the prediction problem
   involving large-scale time series, and the other is that fuzzy logical
   relationships mined in an ad hoc way cannot uncover the global
   characteristics of time series, which reduces accuracy of the resulting
   model. In this paper, a novel modeling and prediction approach of time
   series based on synergy of high-order fuzzy cognitive map (HFCM) and
   fuzzy c-means clustering is proposed, in which fuzzy c-means clustering
   algorithm is used to construct information granules, transform original
   time series into granular time series and generate a structure of HFCM
   prediction model in an automatic fashion. Subsequently depending on
   historical data of time series, the HFCM prediction model of time series
   is completely formed by exploiting PSO algorithm to learn all parameters
   of one. Finally, the developed HFCM prediction model can realize numeric
   prediction by performing inference in the granular space. Four benchmark
   time series data sets with different statistical characteristics coming
   from different areas are applied to validate the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach. The obtained results
   clearly show the effectiveness of the approach. The developed HFCM
   prediction models depend on historical data of time series and is
   emerged in the form of map, which is simpler, legible and have
   high-level interpretability. Additionally, the proposed approach also
   exhibits a clear ability to handle the prediction problem of large-scale
   time series. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The ablation threshold was determined by measuring the ablation crater
   diameters as a function of incident laser pulse energy. Absorption of
   266 nm light on the chromium film was also measured under our
   experimental conditions, and the absorbed energy single-shot ablation
   threshold fluence was 46 +/- 5 mJ/cm(2). The experimental ablation
   threshold fluence value was compared to time-dependent heat flow
   calculations based on the two temperature model for ultrafast laser
   pulses. The model predicts a value of 31.6 mJ/cm(2) which is
   qualitatively consistent with the experimentally obtained value, given

Abstract = {{Purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) technique that can characterize white matter (WM) architecture and
   microstructure. DTI has demonstrated extensive WM changes in patients
   with several epileptic syndromes, but few studies have focused on
   patients with malformations of cortical development (MCD). Our aim was
   to investigate the quantitative diffusion properties of the corpus
   callosum (CC), a major commissural bundle critical in inter-hemispheric
   connectivity, in a large group of patients with MCD.
   Methods: Thirty-two MCD patients and 32 age and sex-matched control
   subjects were evaluated with DTI at 3.0 T. We analyzed the three major
   subdivisions of the CC (genu, body, and splenium) with deterministic
   tractography to yield fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD),
   parallel diffusivity (lambda parallel to) and perpendicular diffusivity
   (lambda perpendicular to). We further assessed the CC with region of
   interest (ROI)-based analyses and evaluated different subgroups of MCD
   (polymicrogyria/schizencephaly, heterotopia, and cortical dysplasia).
   Partial correlations between diffusion changes and clinical parameters
   (epilepsy duration and age at disease onset) were also queried.
   Results: There were significant reductions of FA, accompanied by
   increases in MD and lambda perpendicular to in all segments of the CC in
   the patients group with both analytical methods. The absolute
   differences in FA were greater on ROI-analyses. There were no
   significant differences between the MCD subgroups, and no correlations
   between clinical parameters of epilepsy and FA.
   Conclusions: Our study indicates DTI abnormalities consistent with
   microstructural changes in the corpus callosum of MCD patients. The
   findings support the idea that patients with epilepsy secondary to
   cortical malformations present widespread WM changes that extend beyond
   the macroscopic MRI-visible lesions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Multichannel analysis of dispersive ultrasonic energy requires a
   reliable mapping of the data from the time-distance (t-x) domain to the
   frequency-wavenumber (f-k) or frequency-phase velocity (f-c) domain. The
   mapping is usually performed with the classic 2-D Fourier transform (FT)
   with a subsequent substitution and interpolation via c = 2 pi f/k. The
   extracted dispersion trajectories of the guided modes lack the
   resolution in the transformed plane to discriminate wave modes. The
   resolving power associated with the FT is closely linked to the aperture
   of the recorded data. Here, we present a linear Radon transform (RT) to
   image the dispersive energies of the recorded ultrasound wave fields.
   The RT is posed as an inverse problem, which allows implementation of
   the regularization strategy to enhance the focusing power. We choose a
   Cauchy regularization for the high-resolution RT. Three forms of Radon
   transform: adjoint, damped least-squares, and high-resolution are
   described, and are compared with respect to robustness using simulated
   and cervine bone data. The RT also depends on the data aperture, but not
   as severely as does the FT. With the RT, the resolution of the
   dispersion panel could be improved up to around 300\% over that of the
   FT. Among the Radon solutions, the high-resolution RT delineated the
   guided wave energy with much better imaging resolution (at least 110\%)
   than the other two forms. The Radon operator can also accommodate
   unevenly spaced records. The results of the study suggest that the
   high-resolution RT is a valuable imaging tool to extract dispersive
   guided wave energies under limited aperture. (C) 2014 World Federation

Abstract = {{The activities and vertical spatial distribution of sulfate reducing

   were investigated using microsensor (O-2 and H2S) measurements and
   molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis {[} PCR-DGGE] and fluorescence in situ hybridization
   {[}FISH]). The O-2 concentration profile revealed that O-2 penetrated
   from the bottom (substratum) of the gas permeable membrane, and was
   gradually consumed within the biofilm until it was completely depleted
   near the biofilm/bulk liquid interface, indicating oxic and anoxic zone
   in the MAB. The H2S concentration profile showed that H2S production was
   found in the upper 285 mu m of the biofilm, indicating a high activity
   of SRB in this region. The results from DGGE of the PCR-amplified
   dissimilatory sulfite reductase subunit B (dsrB) gene and FISH showed an
   uneven spatial distribution of SRB. The maximum SRB biomass was located
   in the upper biofilm. The information from the molecular analysis can be
   supplemented with that from microsensor measurements to better
   understand the microbial community and activity of SRB in the MAB. (C)

Title = {{Solid velocity and concentration fluctuations in highly concentrated
   liquid-solid (slurry) pipe flows}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{46-61}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Solid velocity and concentration fluctuations were measured for
   concentrated sand-water mixtures (20-35\% solid by volume) in horizontal
   pipe flow using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). Narrowly sized
   sand (d(50) = 100 mu m) was used to prepare each slurry tested in a 52
   mm (i.d.) horizontal pipe loop at mixture velocities (2-5 m/s) that were
   significantly above the deposition velocity. The EIT measurements were
   used to obtain solid velocity and concentration fluctuation maps.
   Results show that the magnitude of the local solid concentration
   fluctuations is greater near the pipe wall and increases as the mixture
   velocity increases. Additionally, the concentration fluctuations are
   greater near the pipe invert, particularly at lower mixture velocities
   and/or concentrations where the solid concentration profiles are
   asymmetric. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method was employed to
   study the power spectral density of these fluctuations. This analysis
   indicates that concentration fluctuations are produced almost entirely
   by particle-fluid turbulence interactions, rather than through
   particle-particle or particle-wall interactions. Comparison of the
   particle diameter with the characteristic turbulent length scales shows
   that the particles interact with turbulent eddies in the dissipative
   range, which is in accordance with the power spectral density analysis.
   The findings presented here are consistent with previous studies of
   fluidized beds and gravity-driven flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Coped (notched) steel beams are widely used in steel frame structures. A
   state-of-the-art review on local failures of coped steel beams is
   presented with the main aim of providing a clear insight into the
   up-to-date research outcomes and design approaches on the issues of
   local web buckling, block shear, and fatigue. With a comprehensive
   review of the available research database, the rationale behind the
   current design treatments for these failure modes is evaluated. For the
   design of local web budding for coped beams with bolted end connections,
   adopting the lowest value of the resistances governed by elastic local
   web buckling, flexural yielding, and shear yielding can be safe. A
   reduction factor of 0.9 on the design local web buckling resistance may
   be applied for the case of welded connections due to the possible
   interactive effect of block shear. Use of the AISC-LRFD equations is
   suggested for the block shear design of coped beams with single-line
   bolted connections, and both the AISC-LRFD and the CSA-S16-09 equations
   are suitable for the case of double-line bolted connections. For coped
   beams with welded connections, the use of a reduced Ut of 0.7 in the
   CSA-S16-09 equations is recommended. For fatigue design, use of a new
   category curve modified from the relevant equations in AISC-LRFD is
   proposed in this paper to ensure a safe and consistent design.
   Illustrative design examples are presented based on the recommended
   design methods. The expected future work is also outlined. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Friction stir processing (FSP) of Al 5059 is studied in which subsequent
   heat treatment is conducted to investigate its effects on grain size and
   hardness. It was found that mainly elongated and rhomboidal morphologies
   of Al-6(Mn,Fe) particles are present in the alloy both before and after
   FSP, where the rhomboidal particles are more effective in pinning grain
   boundaries during heat treatment. The stir zone reached a temperature of
   705 K (432 A degrees C), and ThermoCalc modeling confirmed that the
   Al-6(Mn,Fe) particles will remain stable at this temperature. Negligible
   grain growth was observed during FSP of the Al 5059 due to low grain
   boundary mobility resulting from slow diffusion associated with a high
   Mg content in the alloy. During heat treatment at 448 K (175 A degrees
   C) grain growth could be correlated with time using a
   particle-controlled grain growth model. Microhardness values indicate
   that Hall-Petch behavior occurs in the processed alloy, while
   dislocation density and particle dispersion play a minor role in
   strengthening.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) using
   biodegradation has the potential to be an environmentally sound approach
   for tailings water reclamation. This process is both economical and
   efficient, however, the recalcitrance of some OSPW constituents, such as
   naphthenic acids (NAs), require the pre-treatment of raw OSPW to improve
   its biodegradability. This study evaluated the treatment of OSPW using
   ozonation followed by fluidized bed biofilm reactor (FBBR) using
   granular activated carbon (GAC). Different organic and hydraulic loading
   rates were applied to investigate the performance of the bioreactor over
   120 days. It was shown that ozonation improved the adsorption capacity
   of GAC for OSPW and improved biodegradation by reducing NAs cyclicity.
   Bioreactor treatment efficiencies were dependent on the organic loading
   rate (OLR), and to a lesser degree, the hydraulic loading rate (HLR).
   The combined ozonation, GAC adsorption, and biodegradation process
   removed 62 \% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 88 \% of acid-extractable
   fraction (AEF) and 99.9 \% of NAs under optimized operational
   conditions. Compared with a planktonic bacterial community in raw and
   ozonated OSPW, more diverse microbial communities were found in biofilms
   colonized on the surface of GAC after 120 days, with various carbon
   degraders found in the bioreactor including Burkholderia multivorans,
   Polaromonas jejuensis and Roseomonas sp.}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) arise from specific molecular
   aberrations that lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. RNA
   interference (RNAi) with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is a feasible
   approach to interrupt aberrant signal processing in CTCL cells, but
   functional biomaterial carriers are needed to effectively deliver siRNAs
   intracellularly. Towards this goal, we explored the utility of
   lipid-substituted polyethylenimines (PEI) carriers in a cell model of
   CTCL. Using caprylic and linoleic acid substituted 2 kDa PEI (PEI-CA and
   PEI-LA, respectively), we showed effective delivery of siRNA to
   T-lymphocyte Hut78 and Jurkat cells, but silencing of a model protein
   (Green Fluorescent Protein, GFP) was possible only in the Hut78 cells.
   To enhance siRNA delivery to Hut78 cells, a high siRNA: carrier ratio
   used to assemble the complexes and centrifugation of cells in the
   presence of complexes were found effective. The toxicities of PEI-CA and
   PEI-LA were significantly lower than other commercial carriers, 25 kDa
   PEI and Lipofectamine (R) RNAiMAX. This might have contributed to
   reduced siRNA delivery efficiency of the latter carriers. Screening
   several endogenous targets led us to identify
   phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and
   cyclin-dependent kinase 18 (CDK18) as viable targets to induce
   siRNA-mediated cell growth inhibition. The results of this study
   identified promising polymeric carriers and molecular targets that could
   control proliferation of CTCL cells based on RNAi therapy. (C) 2014

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{255}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In past decades, secondary water supply (SWS) systems in high-rise
   residential buildings have seen a rapid development in China, and
   ultraviolet (UV) treatment has been selected as a principal disinfection
   technology. However, several special problems of the SWS systems, such
   as large daily fluctuations in water flow rate (Q) and seasonal
   variations in water temperature, may strongly impact the disinfection
   efficiency, but these issues have never been addressed before. In this
   study, the practical application of UV technology in an SWS system was
   investigated in detail. A tri-parameter monitoring system, which had
   earlier been developed based on three micro-fluorescent silica
   detectors, was installed in a UV disinfection reactor for the SWS system
   in a high-rise residential building. Combined with an initial fluence
   validation by biodosimetry, the lamp output attenuation coefficient (N),
   sleeve fouling coefficient (F), water transmittance (T), Q, and output
   fluence (U) were monitored online for about 6 months. During the
   long-term test period, the daily average N increased by ca. 50\% due to
   the seasonal variation in water temperature; the F decreased by ca. 70\%
   due to the sleeve scaling; and a large daily fluctuation of Q induced an
   obvious fluctuation of U. The average U over the whole operation period
   was as high as 169 mJ/cm(2), alerting an enormous loss of energy.
   Through online monitoring of the N, T, F, Q and U, this study revealed
   the current serious problems for UV disinfection of SWS systems, and
   proposed potential solutions accordingly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A fatigue life prediction method for coke drum base, weld, and HAZ
   materials from tensile properties}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},

Abstract = {{The importance of material fatigue information in design has been well
   recognized. There are a few existing fatigue life prediction methods
   based on materials tensile properties. Some of these fatigue life
   prediction methods can be successfully applied for non-heat affected
   materials. However, industrial components, such as pressure vessel and
   pipelines are commonly constructed by welding parts together. The
   fatigue lives of welded section and its surrounding material could be
   greatly affected by the welding process. Therefore, it is beneficial to
   develop a fatigue life prediction model for the weld and surrounding
   heat affected zone (HAZ) materials based on their tensile testing data.
   In this paper, fatigue lives of base material and its weld and HAZ
   materials for constructing coke drums are studied. Mechanical properties
   are first obtained from the tensile tests. Then, fully-reversed
   strain-controlled fatigue tests were performed. It is found that the
   fatigue life of pure base material is roughly twice of the weld and four
   time of the HAZ at the same strain amplitude. Four-point correlation
   (FPC) method by Manson can reasonably predict the life of base material.
   However, it over-predicts the lives of weld and HAZ. By introducing two
   reduction factors R-plastic and R-elastic for the weld and HAZ material
   respectively into the FPC method, the over-prediction can be rectified.
   Therefore, the proposed modified FPC method could be applied in
   predicting fatigue lives of weld and HAZ materials. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new design methodology of granular fuzzy
   classifiers based on a concept of information granularity and
   information granules. The classifier uses the mechanism of information
   granulation with the aid of which the entire input space is split into a
   collection of subspaces. When designing the proposed fuzzy classifier,
   these information granules are constructed in a way they are made
   reflective of the geometry of patterns belonging to individual classes.
   Although the elements involved in the generated information granules
   (clusters) seem to be homogeneous with respect to the distribution of
   patterns in the input (feature) space, they still could exhibit a
   significant level of heterogeneity when it comes to the class
   distribution within the individual clusters. To build an efficient
   classifier, we improve the class homogeneity of the originally
   constructed information granules (by adjusting the prototypes of the
   clusters) and use a weighting scheme as an aggregation mechanism. (C)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{DC-bus voltage control is an important task in the operation of a dc or
   a hybrid ac/dc microgrid system. To improve the dc-bus voltage control
   dynamics, traditional approaches attempt to measure and feedforward the
   load or source power in the dc-bus control scheme. However, in a
   microgrid system with distributed dc sources and loads, the traditional
   feedforward-based methods need remote measurement with communications.
   In this paper, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) based dc-bus
   voltage control is proposed, which does not need the remote measurement
   and enables the important ``plug-and-play{''} feature. Based on this
   observer, a novel dc-bus voltage control scheme is developed to suppress
   the transient fluctuations of dc-bus voltage and improve the power
   quality in such a microgrid system. Details on the design of the
   observer, the dc-bus controller and the pulsewidth-modulation (PWM)
   dead-time compensation are provided in this paper. The effects of
   possible dc-bus capacitance variation are also considered. The
   performance of the proposed control strategy has been successfully
   verified in a 30 kVA hybrid microgrid including ac/dc buses, battery
   energy storage system, and photovoltaic (PV) power generation system.}},

Abstract = {{DC-energy-pool-based multiterminal grids are gaining widespread
   acceptance under the super-and smart-grid vision. DC-link voltage
   control via a master voltage-source converter (VSC) is essential to
   ensure stable and reliable operation of the overall multiterminal
   system. In such a demanding application, conventional dc-link voltage
   controllers, however, suffer from stability and performance issues,
   mainly attributed to the small-signal-based control design approach and
   the use of a cascaded control structure based on the power-balance
   framework which yields unmodeled nonlinear dynamics. To overcome these
   issues, this paper presents a natural-frame variable-structure-based
   nonlinear control system for the master VSC applied in dc-energy pool
   multiterminal grids. The proposed controller accounts for the complete
   nonlinear dynamics of the master VSC without any cascaded control
   structure and globally stabilizes the nonlinear dynamics via a
   passivity-based design approach. Analysis and comparative simulation as
   well as experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of
   the proposed controller.}},

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{70-79}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A new reweighted l(1)-norm penalized least mean square (LMS) algorithm
   for sparse channel estimation is proposed and studied in this paper.
   Since standard LMS algorithm does not take into account the sparsity
   information about the channel impulse response (CIR), sparsity-aware
   modifications of the LMS algorithm aim at outperforming the standard LMS
   by introducing a penalty term to the standard LMS cost function which
   forces the solution to be sparse. Our reweighted l(1)-norm penalized LMS
   algorithm introduces in addition a reweighting of the CIR coefficient
   estimates to promote a sparse solution even more and approximate
   l(0)-pseudo-norm closer. We provide in depth quantitative analysis of
   the reweighted l(1)-norm penalized LMS algorithm. An expression for the
   excess mean square error (MSE) of the algorithm is also derived which
   suggests that under the right conditions, the reweighted l(1)-norm
   penalized LMS algorithm outperforms the standard LMS, which is expected.
   However, our quantitative analysis also answers the question of what is
   the maximum sparsity level in the channel for which the reweighted
   l(1)-norm penalized LMS algorithm is better than the standard LMS.
   Simulation results showing the better performance of the reweighted
   l(1)-norm penalized LMS algorithm compared to other existing LMS-type
   algorithms are given. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive power planning has always been a key research area in power
   distribution engineering; technically and economically. However, the
   problem needs to be revisited to consider several aspects of modern
   distribution systems, such as a high penetration level of renewable
   resources with intermittent nature; the microgrid concept and the
   possibility of system operation in grid-connected or isolated single
   microgrid mode, or isolated multiple microgrids; and probabilistic or
   hourly load profile. Motivated by these needs and considering all these
   aspects, this paper presents a generalized approach for probabilistic
   optimal reactive power planning in modern distribution systems. A new
   index is defined to probabilistically assess the success of microgrids
   in terms of real and reactive power adequacy and voltage limit
   constraints. Afterward, the reactive power planning is performed to
   reduce the annual energy losses of the grid-connected system and
   increase the defined microgrid success index. The problem formulation
   and solution algorithms are presented in this paper. The well-known
   PG\&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as a test case, and through
   several sensitivity studies, the effect of optimization coefficients on
   the design and the robustness of the algorithm are investigated. A
   cost-benefit case study is also presented to determine the optimum total
   size of distributed reactive sources for the system under study.}},

Abstract = {{Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infections
   have recently been found in rural regions of Zhejiang. A severe fever
   with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) surveillance and
   sero-epidemiological investigation was conducted in the districts with
   outbreaks. During the study period of 2011-2014, a total of 51 SFTSV
   infection cases were identified and the case fatality rate was 12\%
   (6/51). Ninety two percent of the patients (47/51) were over 50 years of
   age, and 63\% (32/51) of laboratory confirmed cases occurred from May to
   July. Nine percent (11/120) of the serum samples from local healthy
   people without symptoms were found to be positive for antibodies to the
   SFTS virus. SFTSV strains were isolated by culture using Vero, and the
   whole genomic sequences of two SFTSV strains (01 and Zhao) were
   sequenced and submitted to the GenBank. Homology analysis showed that
   the similarity of the target nucleocapsid gene from the SFTSV strains
   from different geographic areas was 94.2-100\%. From the constructed
   phylogenetic tree, it was found that all the SFTSV strains diverged into
   two main clusters. Only the SFTSV strains from the Zhejiang (Daishan)
   region of China and the Yamaguchi, Miyazakj regions of Japan, were
   clustered into lineage II, consistent with both of these regions being
   isolated areas with similar geographic features. Two out of eight
   predicted linear B cell epitopes from the nucleocapsid protein showed
   mutations between the SFTSV strains of different clusters, but did not
   contribute to the binding ability of the specific SFTSV antibodies. This
   study confirmed that SFTSV has been circulating naturally and can cause
   a seasonal prevalence in Daishan, China. The results also suggest that
   the molecular characteristics of SFTSV are associated with the
   geographic region and all SFTSV strains can be divided into two
   genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrophobic interaction plays an essential role in various natural
   phenomena and industrial processes. Previous studies on the hydrophobic
   interaction focused mainly on the interaction between hydrophobic solid
   surfaces for which the effective range of hydrophobic attraction was
   reported to vary from similar to 10 nm to >1 mu m. Here, we report
   studies of the interaction between an air bubble in water used as a
   probe attached to the cantilever of an atomic force microscope and
   partially hydrophobized mica surfaces. No bubble attachment was observed
   for bare hydrophilic mica, but attachment behaviors and attraction with
   an exponential decay length of 0.81.0 nm were observed between the air
   bubble and partially hydrophobized mica as characterized by a water
   contact angle on the mica surface that varied from 45 degrees to 85
   degrees. Our results demonstrate the important roles of the additional
   attraction at partially hydrophobized surfaces and hydrodynamic
   conditions in bubble attachment to substrate surfaces and provide new
   insights into the basic understanding of this interaction mechanism in
   various applications such as mineral flotation.}},

Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{7243-7250}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments have shown that hydrogels with enhanced toughness can
   be synthesized by incorporating self-healing physical cross-links in a
   chemically cross-linked gel network. These gels exhibit rate dependent
   mechanical behavior, suggesting that improved mechanical properties are
   closely tied to the breaking and reattaching of temporary cross-links in
   the gel network. In this work, the connection between rate dependent
   mechanical behavior and kinetics of breaking and reattachment of
   temporary cross-links is quantified using a three-dimensional finite
   strain constitutive model. The parameters of the model are fitted using
   relaxation and constant strain rate tests in uniaxial tension of a model
   dual-cross-link gel. The stress versus time curves of more complex
   strain histories, involving loading followed by unloading at different
   rates, is successfully and quantitatively predicted by our model. Such
   modeling strategy combining physically based kinetics and
   three-dimensional large strain mechanics shows great promise for
   quantitative modeling of soft biological tissues and synthetic
   counterparts containing dynamic bonds.}},

Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{380}},
Pages = {{28-38}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{The phase behavior of Safaniya vacuum residue (Saudi Arabia) from (200
   to 520) Kat atmospheric pressure was investigated and the phase states
   were determined from nanofiltered samples with pentane-asphaltene mass
   fractions W-A between 0.048 and 0.555 based on joint treatment of heat
   capacity data from differential scanning calorimetry and phase angle
   data from rheological measurements. SARA and elemental composition data
   of the oil are also considered and some assumptions on more detailed oil
   chemistry have been made based on a predictive heat capacity
   correlation. A pseudo binary phase diagram is constructed based on the
   behavior of retentate free permeate and permeate free retentate.
   Compositionally, these materials comprise pentane maltenes and
   asphaltenes respectively to a first approximation. These
   pseudo-components, partitioned at 473 K, are shown to behave
   independently. A broad phase transition arising in Safaniya vacuum
   residue phase behavior is shown to comprise overlapping but independent
   transitions in these two pseudo components. The temperature range of the
   combined glass + melting transition depends on sample thermal history
   (both long-term and short-term). Based on this representation, Safaniya
   vacuum residue comprises four phases drawn from crystalline and liquid
   maltene-rich phases as well as crystalline and liquid asphaltene-rich
   phases from 265 K to 360-370 K. It is also shown that the phase behavior
   of chemically separated pentane asphaltenes differs significantly from
   that of the nanofiltered asphaltene-rich material. The phase diagram of
   Safaniya vacuum residue is compared with that of Maya crude oil {[}M.
   Fulem, et al. Fluid Phase Equilib. 272 (2008) 32-41] and Athabasca
   bitumen {[}A. Bazyleva, et al. J. Chem. Eng. Data 56 (2011) 3242-3253].
   The differences in the phase behavior of these oils are traced to
   differences in their composition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The conformation and dynamics of precisely branched polyethylene, i.e.,
   polyethylene molecules containing regularly spaced, short chain branches
   along its linear backbone, were studied using molecular dynamics
   simulation. Models with branch content varying from 0 to 47.6 branches
   per 1000 backbone carbons were studied over a temperature range of
   273-550 K and under a constant pressure of 1 bar. Two types of models
   were built, one of which contained ethyl branches while the other
   contained hexyl branches. The results indicated that at a given
   temperature, the global orientation order parameter decreased almost
   linearly with increasing branch content up to a value of approximately
   38.5 and increased considerably and unexpectedly at a branch content of
   47.6. The order parameter was insensitive to the branch length except at
   high branch contents. The computed packing lengths and activation energy
   for diffusion are consistent with the above observations. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper takes a system-wide perspective of electrokinetic energy
   conversion devices based on an array of microchannels to help
   understanding their operation. The approach taken was a combination of
   developing an electrical analogy and conducting experiments. The
   electrical analogy included current sources for the convection current,
   resistors for the conduction current, a capacitor for accumulating the
   partitioned ions, resistors for ion transport in the reservoirs, diodes
   and capacitors for the electrochemistry and polarization at the
   electrodes, and a simple external resistive load. The number of parallel
   channels profoundly affected the summative resistive and capacitive
   characteristics of the array, and highlights the differences between a
   single channel and an array of channels, especially in the transient
   responses and the role of the electrodes. The electrical analogy was
   solved by Laplace Transforms to demonstrate a rich and varied response
   that such a system exhibits to a step change in flow in relation to
   relative magnitudes of the various resistors and capacitors. Experiments
   were conducted on a structured glass microchannel array with
   approximately three million channels (10 mu m diameter pore size) with
   aqueous KCl as the working fluid and tested a variety of electrodes.
   Besides providing data for in situ resistances and capacitances, in
   particular for the electrodes, keys aspects of the experimental results
   were interpreted using the electrical analogy. Results include the
   potential challenges in interpretation of externally measured potentials
   and currents as streaming potentials and streaming currents,
   respectively, measuring the resistances and capacitances of electrodes
   by novel methodologies, and using the electrical analogy quantitatively
   to explore maximizing electrokinetic energy conversion in the steady
   state.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific literature shows a substantial study-to-study variation in
   the electrochemical lithiation performance of ``1-D{''} nanomaterials
   such as Si and Ge nanowires or nanotubes. In this study we varied the
   vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth temperature and time, resulting in
   nanowire arrays with distinct mass loadings, mean diameters and lengths,
   and thicknesses of the parasitic Ge films that are formed at the base of
   the array during growth. When all the results were compared, a key
   empirical trend to emerge was that increasing active material mass
   loading drastically degraded the electrochemical performance. For
   instance, GeNWs grown for 2 minutes at 320 degrees C (0.12 mg cm(-2)
   mass loading, 34 nm mean nanowire diameter, 170 nm parasitic film
   thickness) had a reversible capacity of 1405 mA h g(-1) a cycle 50
   coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9\%, a cycle 100 capacity retention of
   98\%, and delivered similar to 1200 mA h g(-1) at 5 C. In contrast,
   electrodes grown for 10 minutes at 360 degrees C (0.86 mg cm(-2), 115
   nm, 1410 nm) retained merely 5.6\% of their initial capacity after 100
   cycles, had a CE of 96\%, and delivered similar to 400 mA h g(-1) at 5
   C. Using TOF-SIMS we are the first to demonstrate marked segregation of
   Li to the current collector interface in planar Ge films that are 300
   and 500 nm thick, but not in the 150 nm specimens. FIB analysis shows
   that the cycled higher mass loaded electrodes develop more SEI and
   interfacial cracks near the current collector. A comparison with the
   state-of-the-art scientific literature for a range of Ge-based
   nanostructures shows that our low mass loaded GeNWs are highly favorable
   in terms of the reversible capacity at cycle 1 and cycle 100,
   steady-state cycling CE and high-rate capability.}},

   bioassays. Various manipulation capabilities, such as micro/nanoparticle
   aggregation, translation, sorting and patterning, were developed. The
   technique allows for versatile multi-parameter (voltage, light intensity
   and frequency) based modulation and dynamically addressable manipulation
   with simple device fabrication. Signal enhancement of a bead-based
   bioassay was demonstrated using dilute biotin-fluorescein isothiocyanate
   (FITC) solutions mixed with streptavidin-conjugated particles and
   rapidly concentrated with the technique. As compared with a conventional
   ELISA reader, the REP-enabled detection achieved a minimal readout of
   3.87 nM, which was a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity. The
   multi-functional platform provides an effective measure to enhance
   detection levels in more bead-based bioassays.}},

Abstract = {{Resonators fold the path of light by reflections leading to a phase
   balance and thus constructive addition of propagating waves. However,
   amplitude decrease of these waves due to incomplete reflection or
   material absorption leads to a finite quality factor of all resonances.
   Here we report on our discovery that evanescent waves can lead to a
   perfect phase and amplitude balance causing an ideal Fabry-Perot
   resonance condition in spite of material absorption and non-ideal
   reflectivities. This counterintuitive resonance occurs if and only if
   the metallic Fabry-Perot plates are in relative motion to each other
   separated by a critical distance. We show that the energy needed to
   approach the resonance arises from the conversion of the mechanical
   energy of motion to electromagnetic energy. The phenomenon is similar to
   lasing where the losses in the cavity resonance are exactly compensated
   by optical gain media instead of mechanical motion. Nonlinearities and
   non-localities in material response will inevitably curtail any
   singularities however we show the giant enhancement in nonequilibrium
   phenomena due to such resonances in moving media. (C) 2014 Optical

   reflection off a grazing incidence mirror (ROGIM). This technique relies
   on the reflectivity change of a high-Z-coated mirror with the grazing
   angle of incidence for the betatron X-rays. The average Ec measured with
   this approach is in agreement with the one measured with a

Abstract = {{We present a method of DPD simulation based on a coarse-grained
   effective pair potential obtained from the DRISM-KH molecular theory of
   solvation. The theory is first used to calculate the radial distribution
   functions of all-atom solute monomers in all-atom solvent and then to
   invert them into an effective pair potential between coarse-grained
   beads such that their fluid without solvent accounts for molecular
   specificities and solvation effects in the all-atom system. Bonded
   interactions are sampled in relatively short MD of the all-atom system
   and modeled with best multi-Gaussian fit. Replacing the heuristically
   defined conservative force potential in DPD, the coarse-grained
   effective pair potential is free from the artificial restrictions on
   potential range and shape and on equal volume of solute and solvent
   blobs inherent in standard DPD. The procedure is flexible in specifying
   coarse-grained mapping and enormously increases computational efficiency
   by eliminating solvent. The method is validated on polystyrene chains of
   various length in toluene at finite concentrations for room and
   polystyrene glass transition temperature. It yields the chain elastic
   properties and diffusion coefficient in good agreement with experiment
   and all-atom MD simulations. DPD with coarse-grained effective pair
   potential is capable of predicting both structural and dynamic
   properties of polymer solutions and soft matter with high accuracy and
   computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{There exist textured surfaces that demonstrate large advancing contact
   angles when the expected behavior is complete wetting due to high Wenzel
   roughness. The roughness can represent an impediment to the motion of
   the contact line, leading to the possibility of contact line pinning and
   thus increased advancing contact angle. A set of fabricated textured
   surfaces with varying pillar diameters and pillar spacing were tested
   using hexadecane. Because of the low surface tension of hexadecane, the
   majority of the surfaces exhibited penetration of the liquid into the
   roughness, also known as the Wenzel state. Because of this penetration,
   the empirical pinning force framework we previously developed for
   wetting behavior on smooth surfaces and surfaces with texture where
   liquid does not penetrate the roughness was expanded to include the
   Wenzel state. For the surfaces that had Wenzel wetting, the receding
   contact angle tended to follow the predictions of the Wenzel equation,
   while the advancing contact angle tended to increase with increasing
   roughness when according to the Wenzel equation it would be expected to
   decrease. For surfaces where nonpenetrated Cassie wetting was observed,
   a constant high advancing contact angle and a receding contact angle
   that follows the trend predicted by the Cassie equation were observed.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular recognition interactions between kaolinite and a series of
   heterocyclic aromatic compounds (HAC) representative of the N- and
   S-containing moieties in petroleum asphaltene macromolecules are
   investigated using the three-dimensional reference interaction site
   model with the KovalenkoHirata closure approximation (3D-RISM-KH) theory
   of solvation and experimental techniques in toluene solvent. The
   statistical-mechanical 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation predicts
   the adsorption configuration and thermodynamics from the 3D site density
   distribution functions and total solvation free energy, respectively,
   for adsorption of HAC and toluene on kaolinite. Spectrophotometric
   measurements show that, among the HAC studied, only acridine and
   phenanthridine adsorb quantitatively on kaolinite. For these pyridinic
   HAC, the adsorption results fitted to the Langmuir isotherm in the
   monolayer domain suggest a uniform monolayer of HAC molecules. The
   3D-RISM-KH studies predict that the aluminum hydroxide surface of
   kaolinite is preferred for HAC adsorption due to strong hydrogen bonding
   with the pyridinic N atoms, while the rest of the HAC adsorb weaker.
   Adsorption on the silicon oxide side is weak and delocalized, as evident
   from the 3D solvation free energy density. Toluene sites effectively
   compete with non-hydrogen bonding HAC, such as fused thiophenes, for the
   kaolinite surface. The adsorption enthalpy and phenanthridine-acridine
   loading ratio are calculated and correlated with the experimentally
   determined Langmuir constant and adsorption loading. This combined
   experimental and computational modeling approach is aimed to provide
   insight into the specific interactions among clays, bitumen, and
   solvents so as to help accelerate the development of environmentally
   friendly and efficient desorption systems for nonaqueous extraction of
   bitumen from Oil Sands, an important unconventional petroleum reserve.}},

Title = {{Filling of charged cylindrical capillaries}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{We provide an analytical model to describe the filling dynamics of
   horizontal cylindrical capillaries having charged walls. The presence of
   surface charge leads to two distinct effects: It leads to a retarding
   electrical force on the liquid column and also causes a reduced viscous
   drag force because of decreased velocity gradients at the wall. Both
   these effects essentially stem from the spontaneous formation of an
   electric double layer (EDL) and the resulting streaming potential caused
   by the net capillary-flow-driven advection of ionic species within the
   EDL. Our results demonstrate that filling of charged capillaries also
   exhibits the well-known linear and Washburn regimes witnessed for
   uncharged capillaries, although the filling rate is always lower than
   that of the uncharged capillary. We attribute this to a competitive
   success of the lowering of the driving forces (because of electroviscous
   effects), in comparison to the effect of weaker drag forces. We further
   reveal that the time at which the transition between the linear and the
   Washburn regime occurs may become significantly altered with the
   introduction of surface charges, thereby altering the resultant
   capillary dynamics in a rather intricate manner.}},

Title = {{A robust algorithm for isenthalpic flash of narrow-boiling fluids}},
Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{379}},
Pages = {{26-51}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Numerical solution of many non-isothermal reservoir flow problems
   requires robust isenthalpic flash. However, isenthalpic flash is
   challenging when the total enthalpy is sensitive to temperature, which
   is referred to as narrow-boiling behavior. The direct substitution (DS)
   algorithms proposed in the literature have convergence difficulties for
   narrow-boiling fluids.
   This research presents a detailed analysis of the narrow-boiling
   behavior and its effects on the robustness of the DS algorithms. A new
   DS algorithm is developed that addresses the direct reason for the
   convergence issues associated with narrow-boiling behavior. The main
   focus of the research is on robust isenthalpic flash for two hydrocarbon
   phases, although mathematical derivations are given for a general
   multicomponent multiphase system. The thermodynamic model used is the
   Peng-Robinson equation of state.
   The new DS algorithm is tested for various isenthalpic flash problems,
   which include the cases for which the prior DS algorithms exhibit
   non-convergence. Results show that the narrow-boiling behavior causes
   the system of equations solved in the DS algorithms to be degenerate.
   The degenerate equations can be robustly handled by the bisection
   algorithm developed in this research. Case studies demonstrate that the
   new DS algorithm exhibits significantly improved robustness for
   isenthalpic flash of narrow-boiling fluids. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{On correlating water solubility in ill-defined hydrocarbons}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{644-658}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Saturated water solubility values in hydrocarbon liquids span more than
   four orders of magnitude and are characterized by high relative error.
   Development of reliable correlations is particularly challenging for
   ill-defined and asymmetric hydrocarbon mixtures where fluid
   characterization and pseudo binary phase behavior type are uncertain. In
   this work, predictive correlations targeting this application, below the
   critical temperature of water, are explored and two promising models are
   compared with computation methods available in the literature. The model
   inputs include easily measurable properties (hydrogen mass fraction,
   fluid density at ambient conditions) as well as K-Watson, mean molar
   mass and the average boiling point of the hydrocarbon mixture. These
   latter three inputs are complex and frequently difficult to define
   parameters encountered in refinery characterization of ill-defined
   organic mixtures. Models comprising one or two input variables were fit
   using a training data set comprising pure hydrocarbons and Athabasca
   bitumen. The average deviation of the models from these reference
   experimental data was found to be comparable to the uncertainty of the
   reference data in most cases. However most of the models exhibited high
   deviation and bias relative to the test data set comprising ill-defined
   hydrocarbon mixtures. Two models are shown to be robust numerically,
   insensitive to the uncertainty of input variables, and applicable
   irrespective of the pseudo binary phase behavior type with water (Type
   II, Type IIIa, or Type IIb) up to their upper critical end point (UCEP).
   At temperatures above the UCEP, a hydrocarbon rich liquid phase only
   arises for Type IIb pseudo binary mixtures. In this region, above 647 K,
   correlation extrapolation options beyond the range of experimental data
   are discussed, and only fluid-specific Henry-like constant models are
   proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{We consider the role of interfacial slippage in the deformation and
   stress fields near the tip of a plane interface crack occurring between
   a compressible hyperelastic material and a rigid substrate.
   Specifically, we draw comparisons between the two limiting cases of
   `no-slip' (infinitely high friction) and `frictionless' (zero friction)
   surfaces by performing corresponding asymptotic analyses in the
   crack-tip region. Our results indicate that for the no-slip case, when
   the body is subjected to far-field loading, the crack deforms to a
   wedge-like shape consistent with experimental observations reported in
   the literature. Moreover, in this case, the wedge angle is shown to be
   directly related to ratios of various Cauchy stress components on the
   bonded surface in the near-tip region. Finite-element simulations reveal
   that the wedge angle also depends on material compressibility and the
   far-field loading conditions. By contrast, the analysis of the
   frictionless case reveals that the crack consistently opens into a
   smooth parabolic shape with a right wedge angle and near-tip stress
   field dominated by the normal stress at the surface. The results
   established here can be used as a basis for the understanding of the
   role of varying degrees of slippage on interfacial cracks.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an elegant and concise general method for the solution of a
   problem involving the interaction of a screw dislocation and a
   nano-sized, arbitrarily shaped, elastic inhomogeneity in which the
   contribution of interface/surface elasticity is incorporated using a
   version of the Gurtin-Murdoch model. The analytic function inside the
   arbitrarily shaped inhomogeneity is represented in the form of a Faber
   series. The real periodic function arising from the contribution of the
   surface mechanics is then expanded as a Fourier series. The resulting
   system of linear algebraic equations is solved through the use of simple
   matrix algebra. When the elastic inhomogeneity represents a hole, our
   solution method simplifies considerably. Furthermore, we undertake an
   analytical investigation of the challenging problem of a screw
   dislocation interacting with two closely spaced nano-sized holes of
   arbitrary shape in the presence of surface stresses. Our solutions quite
   clearly demonstrate that the induced elastic fields and image force
   acting on the dislocation are indeed size-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) is a toxic and poorly
   biodegradable mixture of sand, silt, heavy metals, and organics. In this
   study, qualitative and quantitative comparisons of naphthenic acids
   (NAs) were done using ultraperformance liquid chromatography
   time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC TOF-MS), Fourier transform ion
   cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS, and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS).
   The unique combination of these analyses allowed for the determination
   and correlation of NAs, oxidized NAs, and heteroatom (sulfur or
   nitrogen) NAs. Despite its lower resolution, UPLC-TOF MS was shown to
   offer a comparable level of reliability and precision as the high
   resolution FT-ICR MS. Additionally, the impacts of ozonation (35 mg/L
   utilized ozone dose) and subsequent NAs degradation on OSPW toxicity
   were assessed via a collection of organisms and toxicity end points
   using Vibrio fischeri (nonspecific), specific fish macrophage
   antimicrobial responses, and fish olfactory responses. Fish macrophages
   exposed to ozonated OSPW for 1 week showed higher production of reactive
   oxygen and nitrogen intermediates; however, after 12 weeks the responses
   were reduced significantly. Fish olfactory tests suggested that OSPW
   interfered with their perception of odorants. Current results indicate
   that the quantification of NAs species, using novel analytical methods,
   can be combined with various toxicity methods to assess the efficiency
   of OSPW treatment processes.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber reinforcements with an excellent mechanical performance to
   weight ratio are primarily preferred for advanced composite
   applications. The poor interfacial adhesion between carbon fiber
   surfaces and polymer molecules caused intrinsically by hydrophobicity
   and chemical inertness of carbon is a long existing issue to overcome.
   The article intends to review the research work carried out over the
   past couple of years in the area of carbon fiber surface modifications
   and carbon fiber/polymer interfacial adhesion. This paper provides a
   systematic and up-to-date account of various `wet', `dry' and
   `multi-scale' fiber surface modification techniques, i.e., sizing,
   plasma, chemical treatments and carbon nano-tubes/nanoparticles coating,
   for increasing the wettability and interfacial adhesion with polymeric
   matrices. The review highlights strategies for retaining the carbon
   fiber mechanical strength after surface modification and stresses its
   significance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Knolker's iron complex is a ``green{''} catalyst that exhibits low
   toxicity and is abundant in nature. Density functional theory (DFT) was
   used to explore the highly chemoselective nature of the catalytic
   hydrogenation of CH2=CHCH2CHO. An outer-sphere concerted hydrogen
   transfer was found to be the most reasonable kinetic route for the
   hydrogenation of the olefin. However, the C=C hydrogenation reaction has
   a high free energy barrier of 28.1 kcal/mol, requiring a high
   temperature to overcome. By comparison, the CH-O bond concerted
   hydrogen-transfer reaction catalyzed using Knolker's iron catalyst has
   an energy barrier of only 14.0 kcal/mol. Therefore, only the CH-O of
   CH2-CHCH2CHO can be hydrogenated in the presence of Knolker's catalyst
   at room temperature, due to kinetic domination. All computational
   results were in good agreement with experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid actuators combining brakes and motors have emerged as an

   this paper, an actuation approach using two unidirectional brakes and a

   control laws, that are independent of the virtual environment model,
   calculate the control gains in real time in order limit the energy and
   the stiffness delivered by the motor to ensure stability. The reference
   torque is respected using the combination of the motor and the brake.
   Finally, an user experiment has been performed to evaluate the influence
   of passive and active torque differences in the perception of
   elasticity. The proposed actuator has a torque range of 0.03 Nm to 5.5
   Nm with a 17.75 kNm(-2) torque density.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies show that chabazite can catalyze cracking reactions and
   remove nitrogen and heavy metals from bitumen derived from oil sands. In
   this study, it was found that, after reaction at 400 degrees C for 1 h,
   indole concentration was reduced by 43\% and nitrogen removals up to
   17\% were obtained. Pyridinic nitrogen containing compounds were also
   found to react in the presence of natural zeolites although the reaction
   rates are much slower. Experimental evidence suggests that indole is
   converted into aniline and the nitrogen removed remains on the surface
   of the catalyst as aniline or aniline derivatives. Two possible reaction
   paths for the conversion of indole into aniline are presented.
   Experimental evidence suggests that the water affects the nitrogen
   adsorption but not the reaction pathway. A better understanding of the
   reaction path and adsorption phenomena of this system may lead to an
   improved process for heavy oils.}},

   mechanisms in interfacial force microscopes, by exploring the lower

   dimensions of their spring beams were chosen with the intention of
   giving them stiffnesses of three different orders of magnitude. During
   fabrication it was found that etching the tops of some of the teeth down
   to create the vertical offset between the combs can be done using only
   photoresist to mask the rest of the teeth. The stiffnesses of the
   fabricated springs were estimated by applying loads to them and
   measuring their resulting deflections. Weights were applied to the two
   comb drives with the stiffest springs. Voltages were also applied to
   them so as to determine the force-voltage relationship for their comb
   design. Since the other four comb drives had the same comb design, the
   stiffnesses of their springs could be estimated from the displacements
   of their movable combs when voltages were applied to them.}},

Abstract = {{The colloidal gas aphron (CGA) based drilling fluids are designed to
   minimize filtration loss by blocking the pores of the rock with
   microbubbles. Aphrons behave like a flexible bridging material and form
   an internal seal in a pore-structure, which can later be removed easily
   when the well is open for production.
   A non-aqueous CGA fluid was formulated by mixing 0.4\% W/W oil soluble
   surfactant (sorbitan fatty acid ester) and a 1.5\% W/W linear polymer
   (styrene-ethylene-propylene) with mineral oil at a very high shear rate.
   The CGA fluid was used in a series of core flooding experiments to see
   the effects of the fluid injection rate, the type of saturating fluid,
   and wettability of the porous media on the pressure drop across the
   porous media and return permeability.
   Effective pore blocking ability of CGA fluid was confirmed by ever
   increasing resistance to the injection of CGA fluid through the porous
   media (i.e., continuous increase of pressure drop across the porous
   media). Results confirmed that microbubble buildup has occurred in the
   porous media, which limits the fluid invasion. The permeability
   alteration, measured as an indication of the formation damage due to CGA
   fluid flow, was found to be variable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{While compositional simulators are available for modeling the recovery
   performance of Vapex process, computational constraints often preclude
   detailed numerical solution of the flow and transport differential
   equations, as implemented in traditional flow simulators, using an
   entire suite of geostatistical realizations that represent the
   uncertainty due to reservoir heterogeneity occurring at different
   scales. Proxy models that are based on analytical formulations provide
   efficient alternatives to expensive detailed flow simulations.
   A novel semi-analytical proxy has been developed to model solvent
   transport in Vapex at isothermal conditions. Detailed analytical
   formulations were derived and implemented in a calculation procedure to
   advance the solvent-oil interface and estimate producing oil rate with
   time. A mass penetration parameter was formulated, and its change with
   time was tracked. Results obtained from the proxy were validated against
   experimental data available in the literatures as well as detailed
   compositional simulation studies (Shi and Leung, 2014a, 2014b). Later, a
   suite of geostatistical realizations are ranked based on their
   cumulative oil production using this proxy, and the results demonstrate
   good agreement with those based on detailed compositional simulations
   but with significant savings in computational costs. Finally, this proxy
   is employed to assess impacts of uncertainty in subscale heterogeneity.
   An important contribution from this work is that process physics are
   built directly into this proxy; it represents an advantage over other
   alternative modeling approaches (i.e., regression) that are driven only
   by data. This proposed proxy can be easily integrated in existing
   reservoir management workflows to optimize production scenarios in a
   quick and robust manner. It can be applied to rank numerous
   geostatistical realizations and quickly identify a smaller, more
   manageable subset of realizations for further simulation analysis. It
   presents an important tool for assessing the uncertainty in reservoir
   properties on effective mass transfer and the ensuing recovery
   performance, as well as assisting decisions-making for future pilot and
   field development planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy oil reserves are considered to be the upcoming hydrocarbon
   resource. Yet, more efficient methods are needed as there are
   substantial economic and environmental drawbacks to the sole injection
   of steam and solvents. A combined application of these methods yielded
   promising results in the laboratory experiments. But optimal application
   conditions and cost lowering options need to be determined.
   Steam-over-solvent injection in fractured reservoirs (SOS-FR) is a
   recently proposed method, which consists of an alternate injection of
   steam and hydrocarbon solvents to improve oil recovery over steam
   injection and to accelerate the solvent retrieval rate. This method was
   suggested to take advantages of sole thermal and solvent recovery
   methods in a staged technique and also to reduce the drawbacks of such
   methods using a hybrid one. For simplicity, the initial tests were done
   for hot-water conditions instead of steam and liquid solvents
   (Al-Bahlani and Babadagli, 2008, 2009a, 2009b, 2011b). In our
   modification to this method, we introduced CO2 as an alternative to
   hydrocarbon solvents for only one pressure and temperature condition
   (Naderi and Babadagli, 2012a, 2012b). The initial results of this study
   showed a moderate recovery of 50\% OOIP on average for unfavorable
   matrix conditions (oil wet).
   In the present study, the SOS-FR applications with CO2 were tested at
   various conditions numerically and with different timings to improve
   recovery. First, the effect of different parameters was studied to
   obtain the best match between the simulation and experimental results.
   This exercise not only provided data for field scale simulations
   (relative permeability and diffusion coefficients) but also clarified
   the impact of different rock and fluid properties on the mechanics of
   the proposed EOR technique.
   Finally, an optimization scheme was suggested for field scale
   applications. In this exercise, a field scale numerical model of
   experiments was performed based on an experimentally validated core
   scale model and the optimal conditions (solvent type, application
   pressure and temperature and duration of cycles) were determined to
   maximize the recovery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Efficient Displacement of Heavy Oil by Use of Three Hydrocarbon Phases}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{956-973}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mixtures of oil with solvent gas can exhibit three-hydrocarbon-phase
   behavior at reservoir conditions, where the solvent-rich liquid (L-2)
   phase coexists with the gaseous (V) and oleic (L-1) phases.
   Three-hydrocarbon-phase behavior has been studied in the literature for
   carbon dioxide (CO2) floods and enriched-gas floods at relatively low
   temperatures. Prior research on heavy-oil displacement with enriched gas
   presented that displacement efficiency at a given throughput can be
   nonmonotonic with respect to gas enrichment. Slimtube experiments for
   such displacements showed that oil recovery increased first, then
   decreased, and increased again with increasing gas enrichment. An
   optimum displacement with a high efficiency of more than 90\% was
   observed when three-hydrocarbon- phase flow was present. However,
   detailed mechanisms for such an optimum displacement with three phases
   have not been explained in the literature.
   In this research, we investigate mass transfer on multiphase transitions
   between two and three phases for three-hydrocarbon-phase displacements.
   Simple conditions are derived for the multiphase transitions that yield
   high local displacement efficiency by three hydrocarbon phases. The
   derivation is based on the generalized mass conservation for a
   multiphase transition in 1D gas injection. The conditions derived are
   applied to explain nonmonotonic oil recovery in quaternary displacements
   and the West Sak oil displacements.
   Oil recovery at a given throughput can be nonmonotonic with respect to
   pressure or gas enrichment. Such a nonmonotonic trend can occur when
   local oil displacement by three hydrocarbon phases becomes more
   efficient, but slower, with decreasing pressure or decreasing gas
   enrichment. An optimum pressure or enrichment can occur as a consequence
   of the balance between the local displacement efficiency and the
   propagation rate of three hydrocarbon phases. The West Sak oil
   displacement with enriched gas studied in this research yields a high
   displacement efficiency of more than 90\% at 1.5 hydrocarbon pore
   volumes (PV) injected at 53\% methane (C-1) dilution.}},

Abstract = {{Parameters (factors and practices) influencing construction labour

   building and industrial. Analysis revealed the top parameters
   influencing labour productivity on building and industrial projects.
   Consensus between project management and trade level respondents
   regarding parameters' effects within and between contexts was evaluated
   using statistical analysis; results indicated some differences in
   perception. The methodology and findings from this paper are useful for
   identifying enablers of and barriers to better productivity, developing

Abstract = {{A high effective electron mobility of 33 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) was achieved in
   solution-processed undoped zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films. The introduction
   of silicon nitride (Si3N4) as growth substrate resulted in a mobility
   improvement by a factor of 2.5 with respect to the commonly used silicon
   oxide (SiO2). The solution-processed ZnO thin films grown on Si3N4,
   prepared by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition, revealed bigger
   grain sizes, lower strain and better crystalline quality in comparison
   to the films grown on thermal SiO2. These results show that the
   nucleation and growth mechanisms of solution-processed films are
   substrate dependent and affect the final film structure accordingly. The
   substantial difference in electron mobilities suggests that, in addition
   to the grain morphology and crystalline structure effects, defect
   chemistry is a contributing factor that also depends on the particular
   substrate. In this respect, interface trap densities measured in high-
   HfO2/ZnO MOSCAPs were about ten times lower in those fabricated on Si3N4
   substrates. ((c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&Co. KGaA, Weinheim)}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 30\% of energy use in Canada is consumed in buildings,
   specifically space heating, which can be reduced by constructing
   thermally-resistant building envelopes. This study evaluates potential
   innovative energy-efficient wall systems for mid-rise (four to six
   storeys) wood-frame buildings in terms of thermal and structural
   performances. Regarding the thermal resistance performance, four wall
   systems are developed, installed in a full-scale test house, and
   examined, along with a baseline wall system, using the field data
   collected. The selection of the wall systems is based on current
   practice, structural analysis, pre-fabricability, and energy-efficiency.
   Several sensors are installed on each wall system to measure
   temperature, heat flow, and relative humidity. In addition, structural
   tests are conducted to determine the compressive loading capacity of the
   tested wall systems for both concentric and eccentric loads, where
   full-scale panels are constructed and tested in laboratory. As a general
   finding, all the tested wall systems achieved ASHRAE's minimum assembly
   R-value recommendation of RSI 3.45, where the I-joist wall system had
   the highest R-value, while the conventional wall system had the highest
   load-bearing capacity. This paper recommends Hoist wall systems for
   their higher energy efficiency suggesting more future research on
   efficient end connections to achieve consistent structural performance.

   Solvent Effects and Selectivity}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{6242-6248}},

Abstract = {{The low-temperature oxidation of oilsands bitumen was investigated to
   determine how viscosity was affected by oxidation and whether oxidative
   hardening could be suppressed by solvent dilution. This work was
   performed to support the development of an oxidative desulfurization
   process, but it could also find application in processes for bitumen
   recovery by in situ low-temperature oxidation. The experimental
   investigation was conducted at 140200 degrees C and near atmospheric
   pressure with oilsands-derived bitumen, air, and mesitylene as the
   solvent. Solvent dilution decreased the bitumen viscosity through
   diluent action, but it did not suppress oxidative hardening of the
   bitumen. In fact, with the presence of a solvent, the bitumen viscosity
   increased more than by oxidation of bitumen on its own. This could be
   explained in terms of easier hydrogen abstraction from bitumen relative
   to the solvent, which increased the probability of addition reactions.
   The increase in viscosity with oxidation extent was also investigated,
   and apparently conflicting reports in the literature were reconciled. At
   a constant temperature, different periods of near constant viscosity
   increase with the increase in the oxygen consumption were identified. It
   was also found that, during the first free radical
   chain-propagation-dominated oxidation period, the extent of viscosity
   increase was different at different oxidation temperatures for the same
   level of O-2 consumption. Oxidative hardening is not just related to
   oxidation extent, but it is also affected by changes in oxidation
   selectivity because of the conditions at which the oxidation was
   performed.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of complex geological features and patterns remains one
   of the most challenging tasks in geostatistics. Multiple point
   statistics (MPS) simulation offers an alternative to accomplish this aim
   by going beyond classical two-point statistics. Reproduction of features
   in the final realizations is achieved by borrowing high-order spatial
   statistics from a training image. Most MPS algorithms use one training
   image at a time chosen by the geomodeler. This paper proposes the use of
   multiple training images simultaneously for spatial modeling through a
   scheme of data integration for conditional probabilities known as a
   linear opinion pool. The training images (TIs) are based on the
   available information and not on conceptual geological models; one image
   comes from modeling the categories by a deterministic approach and
   another comes from the application of conventional sequential indicator
   simulation. The first is too continuous and the second too random. The
   mixing of TIs requires weights for each of them. A methodology for
   calibrating the weights based on the available drillholes is proposed. A
   measure of multipoint entropy along the drillholes is matched by the
   combination of the two TIs. The proposed methodology reproduces geologic
   features from both TIs with the correct amount of continuity and
   variability. There is no need for a conceptual training image from
   another modeling technique; the data-driven TIs permit a robust
   inference of spatial structure from reasonably spaced drillhole data.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5873-5882}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Germanium is a promising sodium ion battery (NIB, NAB, SIB) anode
   material that is held back by its extremely sluggish kinetics and poor
   cyclability. We are the first to demonstrate that activation by a single
   lithiationdelithiation cycle leads to a dramatic improvement in the
   practically achievable capacity, in rate capability, and in cycling
   stability of Ge nanowires (GeNWs) and Ge thin film (GeTF). TEM and
   TOF-SIMS analysis shows that without activation, the initially single
   crystal GeNWs are effectively Na inactive, while the 100 nm amorphous
   GeTF sodiates only partially and inhomogeneously. Activation with Li
   induces amorphization in GeNWs reducing the barrier for nucleation of
   the NaxGe phase(s) and accelerates solid-state diffusion that aids the
   performance of both GeNWs and GeTF. Low rate (0.1C) Li activation also
   introduces a dense distribution of nanopores that lead to further
   improvements in the rate capability, which is ascribed to the lowered
   solid-state diffusion distances caused by the effective thinning of the
   Ge walls and by an additional Na diffusion path via the pore surfaces.
   The resultant kinetics are promising. Tested at 0.15C (1C = 369 mA/g,
   i.e. Na/Ge 1:1) for 50 cycles the GeNWs and GeTF maintain a reversible
   (desodiation) capacity of 346 and 418 mAh/g, respectively. They also
   demonstrate a capacity of 355 and 360 mAh/g at 1C and 284 and 310 mAh/g
   at 4C. Even at a very high rate of 10C the GeTF delivers 169 mAh/g.
   Preliminary results demonstrate that Li activation is also effective in
   promoting cycling stability of Sb blanket films.}},

Abstract = {{Living systems produce ordered structures and nanomachines that inspire
   the development of biomimetic nanodevices such as chips, MEMS,
   actuators, sensors, sorters, and apparatuses for single-pore DNA
   sequencing, disease diagnosis, drug or therapeutic RNA delivery.
   Determination of the copy numbers of subunits that build these machines
   is challenging due to small size. Here we report a simple mathematical
   method to determine the stoichiometry, using phi29 DNA-packaging
   nanomotor as a model to elucidate the application of a formula
   Sigma(Z)(M=0) ((Z)(M)) p(Z-M) q(M), where p and q are the percentage of
   wild-type and inactive mutant in the empirical assay; M is the copy
   numbers of mutant and Z is the stoichiometry in question. Variable
   ratios of mutants and wild-type were mixed to inhibit motor function.
   Empirical data were plotted over the theoretical curves to determine the
   stoichiometry and the value of K, which is the number of mutant needed
   in each machine to block the function, all based on the condition that
   wild-type and mutant are equal in binding affinity. Both Z and K from
   1-12 were investigated. The data precisely confirmed that phi29 motor
   contains six copies (Z) of the motor ATPase gp16, and K = 1.
   From the Clinical Editor: To determine copy numbers of subunits that
   form nanomachines in living organisms is a daunting task due to the
   complexities and the inherently small sizes associated with such
   systems. In this paper, a simple mathematical method is described how to
   determine the stoichiometry of copies in biomimetic nanodevices, using
   phi29 DNA-packaging nanomotor as a model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objective: We sought to develop a comprehensive scoring system for
   evaluation of pre-clinical models of osteoarthritis (OA) progression,
   and use this to evaluate two different classes of drugs for management
   of OA.
   Methods: Post-traumatic OA (PTOA) was surgically induced in skeletally
   mature rats. Rats were randomly divided in three groups receiving either
   glucosamine (high dose of 192 mg/kg) or celecoxib (clinical dose) or no
   treatment. Disease progression was monitored utilizing micro-magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed tomography (CT) and histology.
   Pertinent features such as osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, joint
   effusion, bone marrow lesion (BML), cysts, loose bodies and cartilage
   abnormalities were included in designing a sensitive multi-modality
   based scoring system, termed the rat arthritis knee scoring system
   (RAKSS).
   Results: Overall, an inter-observer correlation coefficient (ICC) of
   greater than 0.750 was achieved for each scored feature. None of the
   treatments prevented cartilage loss, synovitis, joint effusion, or
   sclerosis. However, celecoxib significantly reduced osteophyte
   development compared to placebo. Although signs of inflammation such as
   synovitis and joint effusion were readily identified at 4 weeks
   post-operation, we did not detect any BML.
   Conclusion: We report the development of a sensitive and reliable
   multi-modality scoring system, the RAKSS, for evaluation of OA severity
   in pre-clinical animal models. Using this scoring system, we found that
   celecoxib prevented enlargement of osteophytes in this animal model of
   PTOA, and thus it may be useful in preventing OA progression. However,
   it did not show any chondroprotective effect using the recommended dose.
   In contrast, high dose glucosamine had no measurable effects. (C) 2014

Title = {{Laboratory measurements of the rise velocity of frazil ice particles}},
Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{120-130}},
Month = {{OCT-NOV}},
Abstract = {{The rise velocity of frazil ice particles has proven difficult to
   measure with any accuracy. As a result the physics of rising frazil ice
   particles are poorly understood, making it difficult to determine
   whether skim ice, frazil ice, or both will be present during the early
   stages of river freeze-up. Past experimental studies have observed
   particles rising at a wide range of velocities, but without precise
   measurements of the particle diameter no definitive relationships could
   be determined. In this study, high-resolution digital images were taken
   of rising frazil ice particles as they passed between two
   cross-polarising filters. An image processing algorithm was used to
   accurately calculate the diameter of each rising particle and the
   movement of its centroid was then tracked through a series of images to
   determine the rise velocity based on the total vertical displacement.
   Rise velocities ranging from 0.40 to 13.47 mm/s for particles with
   diameters in the range of 0.24 to 3.35 mm were observed. Existing
   theoretical solutions for the rise of a horizontal disc were compared to
   the measured data and a new function relating the rise velocity to the
   diameter of a vertically oriented rising disc was derived. It was found
   that all of the data could be enveloped by curves corresponding to a
   vertical disc with an aspect ratio of 10 and a horizontal disc with an
   aspect ratio of 80. In some cases, the thickness of a particle could
   also be estimated from the images and thicknesses ranging from 0.03 to
   0.12 mm with a mean of 0.07 mm were observed with aspect ratios in the
   range of 11 to 71. Based on this information it is suggested that the
   assumption of discs having a constant aspect ratio is inaccurate. (C)

   Analytical Studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An analysis model for the nonlinear response behavior of RC shear walls
   repaired and strengthened in flexure with externally bonded
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets using the FEM is presented. A
   novel component of the research reported in this paper is the
   implementation of a computationally simple procedure to account for the
   debonding between the FRP and concrete substrate due to the opening of
   flexural cracks in the shear walls, also termed the intermediate crack
   (IC) debonding mechanism or IC debonding. In previous analytical
   research of shear walls reinforced with FRP tow sheets, IC debonding has
   not been taken into account. The analysis model developed in the
   research reported in this paper has been validated using experimental
   results of shear walls repaired/strengthened with FRP sheets available
   in the literature. Neglecting the influence of IC debonding produces
   significant overestimations of the load-carrying capacity of the walls
   and an overall poor correlation between the analytical and experimental
   hysteretic nonlinear response behavior. Including IC debonding effects,
   a close agreement between calculated and measured results for key
   structural response parameters is obtained. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic solution theories allow the prediction of chemical
   potentials in solutions of known composition. In cryobiology, such
   models are a critical component of many mathematical models that are
   used to simulate the biophysical processes occurring in cells and
   tissues during cryopreservation. A number of solution theories, both
   thermodynamically ideal and non-ideal, have been proposed for use with
   cryobiological solutions. In this work, we have evaluated two non-ideal
   solution theories for predicting water chemical potential (i.e.
   osmolality) in multi-solute solutions relevant to cryobiology: the
   Elliott et al. form of the multi-solute osmotic virial equation, and the
   Kleinhans and Mazur freezing point summation model. These two solution
   theories require fitting to only single-solute data, although they can
   make predictions in multi-solute solutions. The predictions of these
   non-ideal solution theories were compared to predictions made using
   ideal dilute assumptions and to available literature multi-solute
   experimental osmometric data. A single, consistent set of literature
   single-solute solution data was used to fit for the required
   solute-specific coefficients for each of the non-ideal models. Our
   results indicate that the two non-ideal solution theories have similar
   overall performance, and both give more accurate predictions than ideal
   models. These results can be used to select between the non-ideal models
   for a specific multi-solute solution, and the updated coefficients
   provided in this work can be used to make the desired predictions. (C)

   Furthermore, the samples were scanned at various depths, and the peaks

Abstract = {{A laboratory-scale closed-circuit pipeline facility was modified to
   experimentally investigate the effects of pumping slurries of wheat
   straw and corn stover particles on the performance characteristics of a
   centrifugal slurry pumps. The effects of particle size and slurry solid
   mass content (concentration) on head, efficiency, and power consumption
   of a centrifugal slurry pumps were studied. In a clear contrast to the
   general performance of centrifugal slurry pumps in conventional
   solid-liquid systems, the total head height increased with an increase
   in slurry solid mass content due to several reasons including unique
   friction loss behavior (i.e., drag reducing feature) of fibrous
   particles slurries in pipelines. In addition, small size fibrous
   particles increased the pump efficiency more than the efficiency of the
   same pump handling pure water only. A correlation was finally proposed
   to predict the reduction in head while centrifugally pumping fibrous
   agricultural residue biomass (wheat straw, corn stover) slurries,
   compared to the head produced while handling pure water only. The
   results could be used in the design and operation of centrifugal slurry
   pumps to transport fibrous agricultural residue biomass materials.
   However, the effects of other parameters like air in the system and
   anaerobic problems should be taken into account too. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   measured at various ages. Further, the ISO approved transient plane
   source (TPS) technique was employed to measure the thermal properties at
   28 days. The results illustrate that shotcrete mixes with EPA have
   similar UCS and superior STS compared to cast concrete. Adding EPA led
   to a drop in thermal conductivity and diffusivity. When compared with
   cast concrete, shotcrete had lower specific heat capacity. This study
   found dry-mix shotcrete incorporating EPA at up to 75\% sand
   substitution as a mechanically viable and thermally resistant
   alternative to cast concrete containing regular aggregates. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Logical models have widely been used to gain insights into the
   biological behavior of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Most logical
   models assume a synchronous update of the genes' states in a GRN.
   However, this may not be appropriate, because each gene may require a
   different period of time for changing its state. In this article,
   asynchronous stochastic Boolean networks (ASBNs) are proposed for
   investigating various asynchronous state-updating strategies in a GRN.
   As in stochastic computation, ASBNs use randomly permutated stochastic
   sequences to encode probability. Investigated by several stochasticity
   models, a GRN is considered to be subject to noise and external
   perturbation. Hence, both stochasticity and asynchronicity are
   considered in the state evolution of a GRN. As a case study, ASBNs are
   utilized to investigate the dynamic behavior of a T helper network. It
   is shown that ASBNs are efficient in evaluating the steady-state
   distributions (SSDs) of the network with random gene perturbation. The
   SSDs found by using ASBNs show the robustness of the attractors of the T
   helper network, when various stochasticity and asynchronicity models are
   considered to investigate its dynamic behavior.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{91-103}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Unique Input-Output sequences (UIOs) are quite commonly used in
   conformance testing. Unfortunately finding UIOs of minimal length is an
   NP hard problem. This study presents a hybrid approach to generate UIOs
   automatically on a basis of the finite state machine (FSM)
   specification. The proposed hybrid approach harnesses the benefits of
   hill climbing (Greedy search) and heuristic algorithm. Hill climbing,
   which exploits domain knowledge, is capable of quickly generating good
   result however it may get stuck in local minimum. To overcome the
   problem we used a set of parameters called the seed, which allows the
   algorithm to generate different results for a different seed. The hill
   climbing generates solutions implied by the seed while the Genetic
   Algorithm is used as the seed generator. We compared the hybrid approach
   with Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Greedy Algorithm, and
   Random Search. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed
   hybrid approach outperforms other methods. More specifically, we showed
   that Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing exhibit similar
   performance while both of them outperform Greedy Algorithm. Finally, we
   generalize the proposed hybrid approach to seed-driven hybrid
   architectures and elaborate on how it can be adopted to a broad range of
   optimization problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work is devoted to the numerical study of the impact of the
   Reynolds number and the ambient gas temperature on the partial oxidation
   of a single moving coal particle. The model includes six gaseous
   chemical species, three semi-global heterogeneous surface reactions, and
   three homogeneous gas reactions. The Navier-Stokes equations coupled
   with the energy and species conservation equations were used to solve
   the problem. The diameter of the particles considered was set up as 2 mm
   and 200 mu m. An analysis of the simulations related to the influence of
   particle Reynolds numbers on integral characteristics such as
   surface-averaged carbon consumption rates revealed that the oxidation
   rate increases with increasing gas velocity, which is logical. However,
   the increase in the particle Reynolds number leads to the prolongation
   of the kinetically controlled regime from lower to higher temperatures,
   which is explained by the enhancement of the mass transfer between the
   particle and the surrounding gas. Using visualization of the temperature
   and species mass fraction distributions around the reacting particles
   predicted numerically, the three well-known basic oxidation regimes,
   namely the diffusion-controlled, transitional, and kinetically
   controlled regimes are described, taking into account the impact of the
   particle Reynolds number on the dynamics of oxidation. The influence of
   radiation in the gas phase on oxidation rates was studied numerically
   using P1 radiation model. Additionally the behaviour of heterogeneous
   Damkohler numbers, Thiele modulus and effectiveness factors depending on
   the ambient temperature and particle Reynolds number was analyzed and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of robust optimization with information granules for
   distributional parameters, this paper investigates a two-stage
   waste-to-energy feedstock flow planning problem with uncertain capacity
   expansion costs. The objective is to minimize the worst-case overall
   loss in a mean-risk criterion where the risk is measured by a
   conditional value-at-risk operator. As a salient feature, an integrated
   uncertainty is considered which consists of not only the uncertainty in
   distribution shapes of the uncertain variables, but also the manifold
   uncertainties of the mean parameters. To tackle the robust optimization
   under such integrated uncertainty, we first discuss a distributional
   robust two-stage feedstock flow planning model with precise mean
   parameters that handles the uncertainty in distribution shape, and the
   model can be equivalently transformed into a linear program (LP).
   Furthermore, the precise-mean-based robust model is extended into the
   case of multifaceted uncertainty for mean-parameters that are allowed to
   assume intervals, historical-data-based probabilistic estimates, and/or
   human-knowledge-centric fuzzy set estimates, under different
   circumstances. These multifaceted uncertain mean-parameters are
   uniformly represented by using information granules, and a granular
   robust optimization model is then developed which maximizes the
   robustness of the solution within a shortfall tolerance, and realizes a
   tradeoff between the solution conservativeness and robustness. It is
   showed that the granular robust model is equivalent to solving a series
   of LPs and can be efficiently handled by a nested binary search
   algorithm. Finally, the computational study illustrates the model
   performance, solution analysis, and underlines a much higher scalability
   of the developed robust model compared to the stochastic programming
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Petroleum coke (PC) is a waste by-product generated during the oil
   upgrading processes by the petroleum industry. The continuing
   accumulation of large quantities of PC requires the development of
   innovative strategies for the effective utilization of this carbon-rich
   material. In this study, PC was used for the removal of naphthenic acids
   (NAs) and acid-extractable fraction (AEF) from oil sands
   process-affected water (OSPW), generated during the oil refining
   process. A systematic study on the adsorption of organic fractions,
   vanadium leaching from PC, adsorption mechanisms, and the effect of
   physico-chemical characteristics of the PC on adsorption process was
   performed. Physico-chemical properties of PC were determined by Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron
   microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis. AEF and
   NAs removals of 60 and 75 \%, respectively, were achieved at PC dose of
   200 g/L after 16 h of contact. FT-IR and TGA analysis of PC suggested
   the physisorption of organic compounds onto the surface of PC. The
   calculated mean free energy of adsorption (E < 8 kJ/mol) also indicated
   the physisorption of organics to the PC surface. The hydrophobic
   interactions between the NAs and the PC were suggested as the dominant
   adsorption mechanisms. The vanadium release occurred when PC was mixed
   with OSPW and vanadium concentration increased with an increase in the
   PC dose. Speciation analysis indicated that the vanadium leached was
   predominantly vanadium (V) and insignificant amount of vanadium (IV) was
   also detected.}},

Abstract = {{Capillary forces are known to deform microstructures. In this work, we
   consider the deformation of a microstructure idealized as a double
   cantilever beam (DCB) caused by a liquid droplet at the free end. When
   the volume of the liquid is small, a discontinuity may appear in the
   deflection of the DCB. As the volume of the small droplet is gradually
   decreased in a quasi-static fashion, a discontinuous decrease in the
   beam deflection is observed, accompanied by an abrupt movement of one of
   the menisci. For small droplets, a discontinuity from low to high
   deflection may be observed when the ratio of the capillary force to the
   elastic restoring force increases. The discontinuity, attributed to the
   nonlinear nature of the equations governing the beam deformation, is
   important for determining whether the DCB will collapse as the capillary
   loading increases. An analysis using energy and branching diagrams is
   performed to help understand the occurrence of the discontinuity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for robust volumetric texture
   classification. It also proposes 2D and 3D gradient calculation methods
   designed to be robust to imaging effects and artifacts. Using the
   proposed 2D method, the gradient information is extracted on the XYZ
   orthogonal planes at each voxel and used to form a local coordinate
   system. The local coordinate system and the local 3D gradient computed
   by the proposed 3D gradient calculator are then used to define
   volumetric texture features. It is shown that the presented gradient
   calculation methods can be efficiently implemented by convolving with 2D
   and 3D kernels. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   gradient operators and the texture features are robust to imaging
   effects and artifacts, such as blurriness and noise in 2D and 3D images.
   The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art volumetric
   texture classification methods the 3D gray level cooccurance matrix, 3D
   local binary patterns, and second orientation pyramid on magnetic
   resonance imaging data of the brain. The experimental results show the
   superiority of the proposed method in accuracy, robustness, and speed.}},

Abstract = {{Buildings are major consumers of the world's energy. Optimizing energy
   consumption of buildings during operation can significantly reduce their
   impact on the global environment. Monitoring the energy usage and
   performance is expected to aid in reducing the energy consumption of
   occupants. In this regard, this paper describes a framework for
   sensor-based monitoring of energy performance of buildings under
   occupancy. Different types of sensors are installed at different
   locations in 12 apartment units in a building in Fort McMurray, Alberta,
   Canada to assess occupant energy usage, thermal performance of the
   building envelope, and indoor air quality (IAQ). The relationship
   between heating energy consumption and the thermal performance of
   building envelope and occupant comfort level is investigated by
   analyzing the monitoring data. The results show that the extent of heat
   loss, occupant comfort level, and appliance usage patterns have
   significant impacts on heating energy and electricity consumption. This
   study also identifies the factors influencing the poor IAQ observed in
   some case-study units. In the long term, it is expected that the
   extracted information acquired from the monitoring system can be used to
   support intelligent decisions to save energy, and can be implemented by
   the building management system to achieve financial, environmental, and
   health benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), a product of bitumen isolation
   in the oil sands industry, is a source of pollution if not properly
   treated. In present study, OSPW treatment and voltage generation were
   examined in a single chamber air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC) under
   the effect of inoculated carbon source and temperature. OSPW treatment
   with an anaerobic sludge-inoculated MFC (AS-MFC) generated 0.55 +/-
   0.025 V, whereas an MFC inoculated with mature-fine tailings (MFT-MFC)
   generated 0.41 +/- 0.01 V. An additional carbon source (acetate)
   significantly improved generated voltage. The voltage detected increased
   to 20-23\% in MFCs when the condition was switched from ambient to
   mesophilic. The mesophilic condition increased OSPW treatment efficiency
   in terms of lowering the chemical oxygen demand and acid-extractable
   organics. Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial consortia revealed that
   Proteobacteria were the most abundant in MFCs and microbial communities
   in the AS-MFC were more diverse than those in the MFT-MFC. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Selenium ions are toxic at concentrations of >40 ppb (40 mu g L-1) which
   has been a very challenging environmental issue. Compared to Se (IV), Se
   (VI) is more bioavailable and much more difficult to remove from water.
   Conventional adsorbent materials only show well defined removal capacity
   for Se (IV) while performing poorly for Se (VI) (typical removal
   percentage <50\%). In this report, functionalized water-dispersible
   magnetic nanoparticle-graphene oxide (MGO) composites were synthesized,
   characterized and applied to remove selenium ions (both Se (IV) and Se
   (VI)) in aqueous system. MGO (dosage 1 g L-1) shows removal percentage
   of >99.9\% for Se (IV) and similar to 80\% for Se (VI) from water (pH
   6-7) within 10 s. Effect of pH ranging from 2 to 11 was investigated,
   and the results show that acidic pH enhances the adsorption of selenium
   ions on MGO resulting in an increased removal percentage of Se (VI) to
   >95\% at pH similar to 2. MGO can be separated effectively under an
   external magnetic field and recycled for reuse in water treatment. Our
   results show that MGO composites have favorable removal capability of
   both selenite and selenate in water with important potential practical
   applications in removing selenium from wastewater. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Controlling and manipulating liquid jets are of great interest in
   practical and scientific aspects. In the present work effects of
   transverse uniform electric field on behaviour of liquid jet, streaming
   downward due to the gravity, is experimentally investigated in details
   by performing a precise image processing of the extracted high speed
   video frames. In the experiments, by altering liquid flow rate and
   applied electric field strength, authors have tried to study the
   interplay of electrical and hydrodynamic forces which are indeed the
   main factors acting on the jet behaviour e.g. deflection, rhythmic
   motion, breakup mechanism and satellite droplets formation. Major aim of
   this study is to manipulate liquid jet so as to attain uniformly sized
   droplets by removing satellite droplets which has potential applications
   in various industrial and laboratorial units. This procedure was
   performed by applying dielectrophoretic force to the water jet as a
   polar liquid. Furthermore the droplets and also satellites behaviour,
   influenced by transverse electric field, have been investigated
   thoroughly. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Crack growth behavior of X65 pipeline steel at free corrosion potential
   in near-neutral pH soil environment under a CO2 concentration gradient
   inside a disbonded coating was studied. Growth rates were found to be
   highest at the open mouth of the simulated disbondment where CO2
   concentrations, hence local hydrogen concentration in the local
   environment, was highest. Careful analysis of growth rate data using a
   corrosion-fatigue model of the form Delta K (alpha) /K (max) (beta) /f
   (gamma) , where (1/f (gamma) ) models environmental contribution to
   growth, revealed that environmental contribution could vary by up to a
   factor of three. Such intense environmental contribution at the open
   mouth kept the crack tip atomically sharp despite the simultaneous
   occurrence of low-temperature creep and crack tip dissolution, which are
   the factors that blunt the crack tip. At other locations where

Abstract = {{In this study, the solid-particle erosion behavior of carbidic
   austempered ductile iron (CADI) containing different amounts of ceria
   nanoparticles was investigated. Attempt was made to correlate the
   erosion resistance of the material to its microstructure and mechanical
   properties. It was demonstrated that the erosion resistance of CADI was
   improved by adding ceria nanoparticles. The maximum erosion rate of
   unmodified CADI occurred at the impact angle of 60-75 degrees , which
   slightly shifted to lower angles when ceria nanoparticles were added,
   corresponding to more ductile characteristic. During erosion tests, the
   retained austenite in CADI partially transformed to martensite although
   the transformation was suppressed by the addition of ceria
   nanoparticles. The ceria-modified CADI showed a considerably increased
   erosion resistance at various impact angles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{109-119}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The ligands catechol, citrate, EDTA, oxalate and tiron were investigated
   for their ability to improve the dissolution of serpentine in ultramafic
   nickel ores at neutral to alkaline pH to enhance mineral carbon
   sequestration. It is desirable to leach magnesium from serpentine in
   ores at neutral to alkaline pH so that leaching and carbonation can be
   conducted at the same pH value, and ultimately so that the reagent
   requirements of mineral carbon sequestration can be reduced. Both
   solution modeling and experimental work were conducted. The solution
   modeling revealed that each of the ligands studied is able to enhance
   the solubility of magnesium at the desired pH, with the order of
   effectiveness being EDTA > tiron > citrate > catechol > oxalate.
   Experimentally it was shown that the ligands studied could improve both
   the total amount and rate of magnesium leaching from ultramafic nickel
   ores. The order of ligand effectiveness based on the experimental work
   for the Pipe ore was EDTA >= tiron > catechol > oxalate >= citrate. For
   the OK ore, the order was tiron > EDTA = catechol > oxalate > citrate.
   Overall, the ligands studied in this work, particularly EDTA, tiron, and
   catechol, appear promising for enhancing the dissolution of serpentine
   in ultramafic nickel ores at neutral to alkaline pH. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{139-145}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Reactive oily bubble, defined as air bubbles covered with a thin layer
   of kerosene containing collectors, was used to float a major rare earth
   mineral, bastnaesite from rare earth ores. Both fatty acid and
   hydroxamic acid were used to generate reactive oily bubbles. The
   flotation of bastnaesite with reactive oily bubble was investigated by
   zeta potential, zeta potential distribution and induction time
   measurement and micro-flotation tests. The results showed a quicker
   attachment to bastnaesite and a stronger collecting power of reactive
   oily bubbles containing 100 ppm fatty acid than conventional air
   bubbles, resulting in an enhanced bastnaesite recovery. The flotation
   recovery of bastnaesite by reactive oily bubbles containing hydroxamic
   acid is lower than that by conventional air bubble flotation where the
   bastnaesite was pre-conditioned by hydroxamic acid in aqueous phase.
   During induction time measurement, no attachment is observed between
   bastnaesite particles and reactive oily bubbles containing hydroxamic
   acid, illustrating the importance of collector type in reactive oily
   bubble flotation technology. These findings suggest the superior
   performance of reactive oily bubble technique than conventional
   bastnaesite flotation method only when proper collector is used to
   generate the reactive oily bubbles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a microfluidic system enabling continuous
   characterization of instantaneous Young's modulus (E-instautaneuus) of
   single cells in suspension. In this study, cells were aspirated
   continuously through a constriction channel while cellular entry
   processes were monitored using a high-speed camera. Numerical
   simulations were conducted to model cellular entry process into the
   constriction channel where a visco-hyperelastic solid was used to model
   biological cells and the cellular friction with the constriction channel
   wall (f(c)) was properly addressed. Both experimental observations and
   numerical simulations confirmed the two-stage cellular entry process
   into the constriction channel: an instantaneous jump into the channel
   quantified by instantaneous aspiration length (L-instantaneous) followed
   by a creeping increase in aspiration length terminated by transitional
   aspiration length (L-transitional){''} Numerical simulations reveal that
   Linstantaneous and L-transitional are reversely proportional to E
   affected by fc regardless of other cellular viscoelastic parameters. By
   combining measured Linstantaneous and L-transitional with these obtained
   from numerical simulations, Einstantaneous and f instantaneous, which
   are c were quantified as 3.48 +/- 0.86 kPa and 0.39 +/- 0.11 for A549
   cells (n(cell) = 199) and 2.99 +/- 0.38 kPa and 0.37 +/- 0.02 for 95C
   cells (ncell = 164). As a platform technology, this method can be used
   to characterize E-instautaneuus of various cell types in a continuous
   manner for cellular biophysical property characterization. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In this study, we conducted the diffusion bonding of Mg and Al alloys
   using a 30-mu m-thick pure silver foil interlayer at median temperatures
   between 390 and 490 A degrees C. We obtained a multilayered structure
   across the Mg-Ag-Al joint: Mg/Mg(ss, Ag)/Mg3Ag/MgAg/Ag/Ag(ss,
   Al)/Ag2Al/Al. The silver diffusion barrier prevented the formation of
   brittle intermetallics between Mg and Al. Intermetallics identified at
   the joint interface include the more ductile types between Mg and Ag,
   epsilon-Mg3Ag and beta'-MgAg, and Ag and Al, delta-Ag2Al. As the bonding
   temperature increased, Ag2Al, followed by MgAg, favored the growth of
   Mg3Ag IMC layer. The shear strength of the joints increased with the
   rising bonding temperature to a maximum value of 11.8 MPa at 470 A
   degrees C. Fracture failure in the joints mainly occurred in the Ag2Al
   layer. The formation mechanism for interfacial layers in the joints is
   believed to consist of four stages: (1) solid-solution formation, (2)
   Mg-Ag IMC formation, (3) Ag-Al IMC formation, and (4) growth of Mg-Ag
   and Ag-Al IMCs.}},

Abstract = {{The common-mode voltage (CMV) in the motor drive system could damage the
   motor insulation and induce destructive bearing current. Various reduced
   CMV space vector modulation (RCMV SVM) methods have been proposed in
   both voltage source converter (VSC) and current source converter
   systems. Most of them reduce the CMV by avoiding the use of zero-state
   vectors. Recently, a zero-state vector selection strategy for CMV
   reduction in CSCs has been proposed, which allows the use of zero-state
   vectors and achieves reduced CMV without affecting the modulation index
   range and the harmonics performance of converters. This paper further
   investigates three possible zero-state vector selection strategies in
   RCMV SVM for current source drives where the PWM CSR and CSI are
   connected back to back. Among the three methods, Method 1 and Method 2
   are suitable for CMV peak value minimization, while Method 3 is proposed
   for the average CMV reduction. These methods can then be considered for
   different types of drives (with or without isolation transformer) to
   reduce the insulation stress or to limit the resonance in the common
   mode circuit. Details of the three zero-state vectors selection methods
   are presented. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to
   verify their effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a robust direct single-loop current control scheme
   based on structured singular value (mu) minimization approach for
   induced-capacitor-inductor (LCL)-filtered distributed generation
   converters in grid-connected and isolated microgrid modes. Unlike the
   conventional H-infinity-based approach, the proposed interface maintains
   perturbed system stability, under wide range of grid (or microgrid)
   impedance variation, without the application of any additional damping
   loops. Moreover, the performance of the perturbed system in terms of
   grid-voltage and harmonic disturbance rejection can be improved
   significantly by the adopted method. This is due to the less
   conservative nature of the mu-synthesis-based solution as it takes
   advantage of the additional structure introduced to the uncertainty
   block by the performance criteria. The salient features of the proposed
   controller are 1) single-loop direct current control of LCL-filtered
   converters with inherent damping of the LCL filter resonance without any
   need for additional damping loops; 2) robust stability and active
   damping performances by mitigating the LCL resonance under wide range of
   grid (or microgrid) impedance variation; 3) improving the performance of
   the current controller by removing its dependency on the grid-voltage
   feed-forward loop by providing high disturbance rejection feature
   against fundamental and harmonic voltage disturbances; 4)
   computationally efficient fixed-order structure with minimum sensor
   requirements (only grid-side currents are needed for feedback control).
   A comparative theoretical analysis, time-domain simulation results, and
   experimental test results are presented to show the effectiveness of the
   proposed control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper conducts a Bayesian analysis of inverse Gaussian process
   models for degradation modeling and inference. Novel features of the
   Bayesian analysis are the natural manners for incorporating subjective
   information, pooling of random effects information among product
   population, and a straightforward way of coping with evolving data sets
   for on-line prediction. A general Bayesian framework is proposed for
   degradation analysis with inverse Gaussian process models. A simple
   inverse Gaussian process model and three inverse Gaussian process models
   with random effects are investigated using Bayesian method. In addition,
   a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of prior distributions and sample
   sizes is carried out through simulation. Finally, a classic example is
   presented to demonstrate the applicability of the Bayesian method for
   degradation analysis with the inverse Gaussian process models. (C) 2014

Title = {{Elucidation of structural information achievable for asphaltenes via
   collision-activated dissociation of their molecular ions in MSn
   experiments: A model compound study}},

Abstract = {{Despite extensive studies of the asphaltene fraction of petroleum, the
   molecular structures of asphaltenes remain a highly debated topic.
   Tandem mass spectrometry is the only technique that allows the
   examination of the structures of individual asphaltene molecules due to
   the extreme complexity of asphaltenes. Recently, atmospheric pressure
   chemical ionization (APCI) using CS2 as the reagent was demonstrated to
   produce abundant and stable molecular ions for polyaromatic hydrocarbons
   with long alkyl chains. Hence, coupling APCI/CS2 with tandem mass
   spectrometry appears to be a promising method for the examination of the
   structures of molecules in asphaltenes. However, the fragmentation
   pathways of the molecular ions of large alkyl aromatic compounds are not
   well understood. In order to address this issue, a detailed examination
   of the collision-activated dissociation reactions of the molecular ions
   and several of their fragment ions (MSn experiments) was carried out for
   several model compounds of asphaltenes. The results show that
   information on various structural aspects of asphaltenes can be obtained
   from these experiments, such as alkyl chain lengths and sizes of
   aromatic cores. Based on these results, MS2 experiments may provide
   enough information to determine approximate core sizes for molecules
   with archipelago structures. However, the number of ion isolation and
   collision-activated dissociation (CAD) experiments needed to elucidate
   maximum structural information for molecules with island structures
   depends on the number of carbon chains on the aromatic core. (C) 2014
