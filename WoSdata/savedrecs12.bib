Abstract = {{In this paper, channel training and coherent decodings under channel
   estimation error are investigated for relay networks with one
   single-antenna transmitter, R single-antenna relays, and one R-antenna
   receiver. A two-stage training scheme is proposed to estimate both the
   relay-receiver and the transmitter-relay channels at the receiver, which
   are commonly required in amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks. We use
   distributed space-time coding (DSTC) for data transmission and
   investigate the effect of channel estimation errors on network
   performance. Two coherent decodings are considered: mismatched decoding
   in which channel estimations are treated as if perfect, and matched
   decoding in which estimation error is taken into consideration. We show
   that for full diversity, with mismatched decoding, at least 3R symbol
   intervals are required for training; while with matched decoding, R+2
   symbol intervals for training are enough. The complexities of the
   decoding schemes are investigated. To achieve a balance between
   performance and complexity, an adaptive decoding scheme is proposed.
   Simulated error rates are shown to justify the analytical results.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling complex transport processes in naturally fractured reservoirs
   (NFRs) using classical continuum models may not be practically possible
   because the algorithms used in this type of modeling approach for the
   detailed structure of fracture/matrix systems require unreasonable
   computational time. Also, fractured reservoirs are highly irregular, and
   finite-difference calculations for such models often cause convergence
   problems. In addition, an exact representation of a complex fracture
   network in classical continuum modeling algorithms is highly difficult.
   An alternative is to use a nonclassical technique known as the
   random-walk particle-tracking (RWPT) algorithm.
   We showed earlier (Stalgorova and Babadagli 2012) that the random-walk
   (RW) technique can be adapted to model miscible flooding in a fractured
   porous medium at the laboratory scale. The unknown parameters used to
   match the model results were only the diffusion coefficients for oil and
   solvent, as the diffusive/dispersive transport (effective in fracture
   and matrix) was coupled with viscous (effective in fracture) and gravity
   (effective in fracture and matrix) displacement. Advantages of this
   method over classical simulation include a shorter computational time,
   which allows avoidance of simplifications; the ability to model the
   matrix/fracture diffusion process without any transfer function; and the
   representation of a complex and irregular fracture network system.
   In this paper, we modified this laboratory-scale RW model for
   field-scale applications. A series of tracer-test results from the
   Midale field in Canada was used to test the model. A fracture-network
   model was constructed on the basis of geological data, and then we used
   the RWPT model to calibrate the fracture network against tracer-test
   results. The results were compared to those obtained using continuum
   (dual-porosity) models, and it was observed that the connectivity and
   breakthrough times can be captured more correctly with the RWPT model.
   We performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the importance of
   different parameters for the simulation results. The new model and
   observations can be used to validate and calibrate stochastically
   generated fracture-network models and to estimate the
   enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) performance of NFRs.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},

Abstract = {{A microreactor equipped with a view window and a stirrer was used to
   observe mesophase formation in Athabasca vacuum residue with and without
   catalyst. The effect of stirring on mesophase formation and its growth
   and coalescence was studied during the cracking of vacuum residue under
   hydrogen at 4.8 MPa and 440 degrees C. Stirring can result in a bimodal
   distribution of size of mesophase domains. The forced coalescence of
   mesophase droplets by the stirrer led to the formation of very large
   mesophase regions (bulk mesophase), which coexisted with a large number
   of small micrometer-sized mesophase domains. The addition of catalyst
   likely had both chemical and physical effects on the formation and
   growth of mesophase. The catalyst gave a delay in the onset of mesophase
   formation as a chemical effect and a decrease in the amount of bulk
   mesophase regions by suppressing the coalescence of smaller mesophase
   domains as a physical effect. The analysis of the resulting cokes by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that catalyst particles
   agglomerated and stuck to the outer surface of the mesophase domains and
   suppressed their coalescence. The agglomeration of catalyst particles
   likely decreased their ability to suppress the formation of small
   mesophase domains, in the range of a few micrometers in size. However,
   catalyst was effective in suppressing the formation of bulk mesophase
   domains with areas over 2000 mu m(2). The results showed that the onset
   of observable mesophase initially increased with the addition of
   catalyst, but then decreased at higher catalyst concentrations. SEM
   observation confirmed that the significant agglomeration of catalyst
   particles at higher concentrations was likely responsible for the
   decreased effectiveness of the catalyst in suppressing mesophase
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{Six asphaltene model compounds incorporating the biomarker structure of

   bearing a pyrenyl substituent, forming the largest amount of residue.
   Analysis of the products formed from thermal cracking of three such

   dehydrogenation of the saturated hydrocarbon rings, along with some
   peripheral demethylation, and steroid side-chain fragmentation, with no
   significant ring opening or release of cyclic substructures from the
   steroid moiety. Some loss of the aromatic substituents appended to the

Abstract = {{A cellular multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) downlink system is
   studied, in which each base station (BS) transmits to some of the users
   so that each user receives its intended signal from a subset of the BSs.
   This scenario is referred to as network MIMO with partial cooperation
   since only a subset of the BSs is able to coordinate their transmission
   toward any user. The focus of this paper is on the optimization of
   linear beamforming strategies at the BSs and at the users for network
   MIMO with partial cooperation. Individual power constraints at the BSs
   are enforced, along with constraints on the number of streams per user.
   It is first shown that the system is equivalent to a MIMO interference
   channel with generalized linear constraints (MIMO-IFC-GC). The problems
   of maximizing the sum rate (SR) and minimizing the weighted sum mean
   square error (WSMSE) of the data estimates are nonconvex, and suboptimal
   solutions with reasonable complexity need to be devised. Based on this,
   suboptimal techniques that aim at maximizing the SR for the MIMO-IFC-GC
   are reviewed from recent literature and extended to the MIMO-IFC-GC
   where necessary. Novel designs that aim at minimizing the WSMSE are then
   proposed. Extensive numerical simulations are provided to compare the
   performance of the considered schemes for realistic cellular systems.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering optical properties using artificial nanostructured media
   known as metamaterials has led to breakthrough devices with capabilities
   from super-resolution imaging to invisibility. In this paper, we review
   metamaterials for quantum nanophotonic applications, a recent
   development in the field. This seeks to address many challenges in the
   field of quantum optics using advances in nanophotonics and
   nanofabrication. We focus on the class of nanostructured media with
   hyperbolic dispersion that have emerged as one of the most promising
   metamaterials with a multitude of practical applications from
   subwavelength imaging, nanoscale waveguiding, biosensing to nonlinear
   switching. We present the various design and characterization principles
   of hyperbolic metamaterials and explain the most important property of
   such media: a broadband enhancement in the electromagnetic density of
   states. We review several recent experiments that have explored this
   phenomenon using spontaneous emission from dye molecules and quantum
   dots. We finally point to future applications of hyperbolic
   metamaterials, using the broadband enhancement in the spontaneous
   emission to construct single-photon sources.}},

Abstract = {{The recently proposed generalized multi-state k-out-of-n system model
   provides more flexibility in describing practical systems. In this
   model, there are n components in the system where each component and the
   system can be in one of M + 1 possible states: 0, 1, 2, ... , M. The
   system is in below state j if there exists an integer value l, (1 <= i
   <= j) such that at least k(l) components are in states below l. Although
   the model has several practical applications, existing methods for
   computing either the exact or approximate reliability of these systems
   are computationally inefficient and limited to very small systems. This
   paper proposes an efficient method and a detailed algorithm to compute
   the exact reliability of multi-state k-out-of-n systems with independent
   and identically distributed components. The method is based on
   conditional probabilities and is applicable for all cases of multi-state
   k-out-of-n systems with respect to the recent definitions of this
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Ice jam floods can present an annual threat to communities adjacent to
   rivers, especially those situated at river confluences, island or

   such multi-channel systems. The Hay River delta was selected as the
   demonstration site for this study, and 2-D modeling was employed to
   calculate ice jam flood levels expected for varying inflow discharge
   conditions. The River2D model was calibrated for historical ice jam
   profiles covering a range of discharges from 268 to 1000 m(3)/s and a
   relationship was developed to predict the flow split down the East and
   West Channels based on the inflow discharge to the delta. Also, ice jam
   rating curves were developed at 0.5 km intervals along each channel
   facilitating the development of an ice jam profile prediction tool for
   use by the Town of Hay River.}},

Journal = {{CRYOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{185-191}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vitrification is a method of cryopreservation by which cells
   and tissues can be preserved at low temperatures using cryoprotective
   agents (CPAs) at high concentrations (typically >= 6.0 M) to limit the
   harmful effects of ice crystals that can form during cooling processes.
   However, at these concentrations CPAs are significantly cytotoxic and an
   understanding of their toxicity characteristics and interactions is
   important. Therefore, single-CPA and multiple-CPA solutions were
   evaluated for their direct and indirect toxicities on chondrocytes.
   Methods: Chondrocytes were isolated from human articular cartilage
   samples and exposed to various single-CPA and multiple-CPA solutions of
   five common CPAs (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethylene glycol (EG),
   propylene glycol (PG), glycerol (Gy) and formamide (Fm)) at both 6.0 and
   8.1 M concentrations at 0 degrees C for 30 min. Chondrocyte survival was
   determined using a fluorescent cell membrane integrity assay. The data
   obtained was statistically analyzed and regression coefficients were
   used to represent the indirect toxicity effect which a specific
   combination of CPAs exerted on the final solution's toxicity.
   Results: Multiple-CPA solutions were significantly less toxic than
   single-CPA solutions (P < 0.01). The indirect toxicity effects between
   CPAs were quantifiable using regression analysis. Cell survival rates of
   approximately 40\% were obtained with the four-CPA combination solution
   DMSO-EG-Gy-Fm. In the multiple-CPA combinations, PG demonstrated the
   greatest degree of toxicity and its presence within a combination
   solution negated any benefits of using multiple lower concentration
   CPAs.
   Conclusions: Multiple-CPA solutions are less cytotoxic than single-CPA
   solutions of the same total concentration. PG was the most toxic CPA
   when used in combinations. The highest chondrocyte survival rates were
   obtained with the 6.0 M DMSO-EG-Gy-Fm combination solution. (C) 2012

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Despite myriad potential advantages over piezoelectric ultrasound
   transducers, capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs)
   have not yet seen widespread commercial implementation. The possible
   reasons for this may include key issues of the following: 1) long-term
   device reliability and 2) electrical safety issues associated with
   relatively high voltage electrodes on device surfaces which could
   present an electrical safety hazard to patients. A CMUT design presented
   here may mitigate some of these problems. Dielectric charging is one
   phenomenon which can lead to unpredictable performance and device
   failure. Using a previously published 1-D model of dielectric charging,
   we link minimal dielectric surface roughness with minimal dielectric
   charging. Previous studies of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling suggest that
   minimal-surface-roughness electrodes could lead to minimal
   transdielectric currents (and, hence, slower dielectric charging rates).
   These principles guided our device architecture, leading us to engineer
   near atomically smooth electrodes and dielectric surfaces to minimize
   dielectric charging. To provide maximum electrical safety to future
   patients, CMUT devices were engineered with the top membrane serving as
   a ground electrode. While multiple CMUT elements have not been
   individually addressable in most such designs to our knowledge, we
   introduce a fabrication method involving two silicon-on-insulator wafers
   with a step to define individually addressable electrodes. Our devices
   are modeled using a finite-element package. Measured deflections show
   excellent agreement with modeled performance. We test for charge effects
   by studying deflection hysteresis during snapdown and snapback cycles in
   the limit of long snapdown durations to simulate
   maximal-dielectric-charging conditions. Devices were also tested in
   long-term actuation tests and subjected to more than 3 x 10(10) cycles
   without failure. {[}2011-0150]}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale magnetoelectric (ME) coupling has been observed in
   multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) nanowires (NWs) synthesized by sol-gel based
   electrospinning technique. Under externally imposed electric fields
   these NWs exhibit the systematic evolution of a magnetic domain pattern
   as established by magnetic force microscopy (MFM), confirming the
   presence of ME coupling. Interestingly, the effect persists even after
   the electric field is removed, thereby implying an
   electric-field-induced magnetic hysteresis phenomenon in BFO NWs. The
   estimated ME coupling coefficient from tip-sample interactions is
   alpha(33) = 2.2 x 10(-10) sm(-1), and the equivalent ME voltage
   coefficient is 0.49 V cm(-1) Oe(-1). The obtained values of the ME
   coupling coefficient are higher than the reported values for BFO bulk
   and thin films. These results promise one-dimensional (1D) multiferroic
   BFO NWs as potential candidate for manipulating magnetism through
   electric field at the nanoscale and provide great opportunities towards
   magnetoelectrically tunable multiferroic devices. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a broad range of alicyclic and aliphatic
   compounds that are persistent and contribute to the toxicity of oil
   sands process affected water (OSPW). In this investigation,
   cyclohexanoic acid (CHA) was selected as a model naphthenic acid, and
   its oxidation was investigated using advanced oxidation employing a
   low-pressure ultraviolet light in the presence of hydrogen peroxide
   (UV/H2O2 process). The effects of two pHs and common OSPW constituents,
   such as chloride (Cl-) and carbonate (CO32-) were investigated in
   ultrapure water. The optimal molar ratio of H2O2 to CHA in the treatment
   process was also investigated. The pH had no significant effect on the
   degradation, nor on the formation and degradation of byproducts in
   ultrapure water. The presence of CO32- or Cl- a significantly decreased
   the CHA degradation rate. The presence of 700 mg/L CO32- or 500 mg/L
   Cl-, typical concentrations in OSPW, caused a 55\% and 23\% decrease in
   the pseudo-first order degradation rate constants for CHA, respectively.
   However, no change in byproducts or in the degradation trend of
   byproducts, in the presence of scavengers was observed. A real OSPW
   matrix also had a significant impact by decreasing the CHA degradation
   rate, such that by spiking CHA into the OSPW, the degradation rate
   decreased up to 82\% relative to that in ultrapure water. The results of
   this study show that UV/H2O2 AOP is capable of degrading CHA as a model
   NA in ultrapure water. However, in the real applications, the effect of
   radical scavengers should be taken into consideration for the
   achievement of best performance of the process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have applied machine learning to the software defect
   prediction problem, i.e. predicting which modules will experience a
   failure during operation based on software metrics. However, skewness in
   defect-prediction datasets can mean that the resulting classifiers often
   predict the faulty (minority) class less accurately. This problem is
   well known in machine learning, and is often referred to as ``learning
   from imbalanced datasets.{''} One common approach for mitigating
   skewness is to use stratification to homogenize class distributions;
   however, it is unclear what stratification techniques are most
   effective, both generally and specifically in software defect
   prediction. In this article, we investigate two major stratification
   alternatives (under-, and over-sampling) for software defect prediction
   using Analysis of Variance. Our analysis covers several modern software
   defect prediction datasets using a factorial design. We find that the
   main effect of under-sampling is significant at alpha = 0.05, as is the
   interaction between under-and over-sampling. However, the main effect of
   over-sampling is not significant.}},

Abstract = {{Recent researches have shown that the surface energy of some real
   elastic solids is unlikely to be positive semi-definite. Motivated by
   this, the present work studies counter-examples for uniqueness of the
   solution of surface elasticity theory in simple three-dimensional
   spherically symmetric and two-dimensional axi-symmetrical deformations.
   Simple sufficient conditions are derived for non-uniqueness of the
   solution in terms of bulk elastic modulus, surface elastic modulus and
   geometrical parameters of the elastic body. Unlike the non-uniqueness
   conditions for classical linear elasticity, which are given in terms of
   elastic constants alone, the geometrical dimensions of the elastic body
   play a key role in the non-uniqueness of the solution of surface
   elasticity theory. Roughly speaking, the solution of surface elasticity
   models can be non-unique if the smallest characteristic dimension of the
   body (such as thickness of a thin body, or diameter of a small body or a
   small hole in an elastic body) is below a certain critical value so that
   the magnitude of negative surface energy can compete with the positive
   bulk strain energy of the elastic body. For example, using the available
   data for the negative surface modulus suggested in the literature, our
   results predict that the solution could be non-unique for softer
   materials (such as rubbers) when the smallest characteristic dimension
   of the elastic body is below typically 1 mu m. This result could predict
   self-buckling of softer elastic thin films in the presence of
   significant surface stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Users in multimedia social networks actively interact with each other.
   It is crucial to study the complex user dynamics and analyze its impact
   on the performance of multimedia social networks. This paper uses
   multimedia fingerprinting as an example and studies user dynamics in
   colluder social networks. During collusion, a group of attackers
   collectively attack multimedia fingerprinting system and use multimedia
   content illegally. This paper analyzes the incentives of cooperation
   among attackers and investigates how colluders form their coalitions to
   maximize their payoffs. We present a game-theoretic framework to model
   the complex dynamics among colluders, analyze when attackers cooperate
   with each other, and investigate how a colluder selects his/her fellow
   attackers to maximize his/her own payoff. We analyze multiuser collusion
   in two scenarios: when all attackers receive fingerprinted copies of the
   same resolution, and when they have copies of different resolutions. The
   proposed framework considers both the colluders' risk of being detected
   by the digital rights enforcer and the reward received from illegal
   usage of multimedia content. Our analysis shows that in both scenarios,
   colluding with more attackers does not always increase an attacker's
   utility, and attackers may not always want to cooperate with each other.
   We first examine the necessary conditions for attackers to collude
   together, and study how they select the collusion parameters such that
   cooperation benefits all colluders. We then study how the number of
   colluders affects each attacker's utility, and investigate the optimum
   strategy that an attacker should use to select fellow attackers and to
   form a coalition in order to maximize his or her own payoff.}},

Abstract = {{A general notion of robustness for robust adaptive beamforming (RAB)
   problem and a unified principle for minimum variance distortionless
   response (MVDR) RAB techniques design are formulated. This principle is
   to use standard MVDR beamformer in tandem with an estimate of the
   desired signal steering vector found based on some imprecise prior
   information. Differences between various MVDR RAB techniques occur only
   because of the differences in the assumed prior information and the
   corresponding signal steering vector estimation techniques. A new MVDR
   RAB technique, which uses as little as possible and easy to obtain
   imprecise prior information, is developed. The objective for estimating
   the steering vector is the maximization of the beamformer output power,
   while the constraints are the normalization condition and the
   requirement that the estimate does not converge to any of the
   interference steering vectors and their linear combinations. The prior
   information used is only the imprecise knowledge of the antenna array
   geometry and angular sector in which the actual steering vector lies.
   Mathematically, the proposed MVDR RAB is expressed as the well known
   non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem with
   two constraints, which can be efficiently and exactly solved. Some new
   results for the corresponding optimization problem such as a new
   algebraic way of finding the rank-one solution from the general-rank
   solution of the relaxed problem and the condition under which the
   solution of the relaxed problem is guaranteed to be rank-one are
   derived. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
   proposed method over other previously developed RAB techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering forms one of the most visible conceptual and algorithmic
   framework of developing information granules. In spite of the algorithm
   being used, the representation of information granules-clusters is
   predominantly numeric (coming in the form of prototypes, partition
   matrices, dendrograms, etc.). In this paper, we consider a concept of
   granular prototypes that generalizes the numeric representation of the
   clusters and, in this way, helps capture more details about the data
   structure. By invoking the granulation-degranulation scheme, we design
   granular prototypes being reflective of the structure of data to a
   higher extent than the representation that is provided by their numeric
   counterparts (prototypes). The design is formulated as an optimization
   problem, which is guided by the coverage criterion, meaning that we
   maximize the number of data for which their granular realization
   includes the original data. The granularity of the prototypes themselves
   is treated as an important design asset; hence, its allocation to the
   individual prototypes is optimized so that the coverage criterion
   becomes maximized. With this regard, several schemes of optimal
   allocation of information granularity are investigated, where
   interval-valued prototypes are formed around the already produced
   numeric representatives. Experimental studies are provided in which the
   design of granular prototypes of interval format is discussed and

Abstract = {{Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are convenient and widely used architectures
   for modeling dynamic systems, which are characterized by a great deal of
   flexibility and adaptability. Several recent works in this area concern
   strategies for the development of FCMs. Although a few fully automated
   algorithms to learn these models from data have been introduced, the
   resulting FCMs are structurally considerably different than those
   developed by human experts. In particular, maps that were learned from
   data are much denser (with the density over 90\% versus about 40\%
   density of maps developed by humans). The sparseness of the maps is
   associated with their interpretability: the smaller the number of
   connections is, the higher is the transparency of the map. To this end,
   a novel learning approach, sparse real-coded genetic algorithms
   (SRCGAs), to learn FCMs is proposed. The method utilizes a density
   parameter to guide the learning toward a formation of maps of a certain
   predefined density. Comparative tests carried out for both synthetic and
   real-world data demonstrate that, given a suitable density estimate, the
   SRCGA method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art learning
   methods. When the density estimate is unknown, the new method can be
   used in an automated fashion using a default value, and it is still able
   to produce models whose performance exceeds or is equal to the
   performance of the models generated by other methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of near-wall turbulence on selective
   removal of small-size particulate matter from sand beds deposited in
   pipelines. In an effort to develop effective strategies for in-line
   fines separation, experimental data on selective particle removal by
   burst-sweep turbulent structures have been gathered. A 3 3/4 `' (0.095
   m) diameter-15 m long flow loop together with a particle image
   velocimetry (PIV) system has been commissioned and used for observations
   of turbulent burst activities. The flow loop was also equipped with
   bottom extractors to allow real time sampling of deposited particles
   which are then analyzed for determining particle size distribution
   changes with time. In this work, the alteration of size-composition
   during turbulent transportation of moving (sand) bed was assumed to be
   the effect of burst-sweep activity (coherent structures). The frequency
   of coherent burst structures was measured at various distances from the
   pipe wall, during the radial dissipation, and results were compared with
   existing literature. The experimental results indicated that when a bed
   of particles with 0.1-50 mu m size range is exposed to burst-sweep
   activities during turbulent pipe flow, the concentration of fine
   particles within the bed increases with time (i.e., coarser particles
   are preferentially removed). {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006041]}},

Abstract = {{The limited signal-to-noise ratio of triple-quantum-filtered MRI of
   sodium is a major hurdle for its application clinically. Although it has
   been shown that short 90 degrees radiofrequency pulses in combination
   with sufficiently long repetition time for full T1 recovery (labelled
   standard parameters) produce the maximum signal through the
   triple-quantum-filter, and in this work, simulation and images of agar
   phantoms and human brain demonstrate that the use of longer
   radiofrequency pulses and reduced repetition time (optimized parameters
   to accommodate more averages for a constant specific absorption rate,
   reducing noise variance for a given scan length) results in
   signal-to-noise ratio improvement (22 +/- 5\% in brain tissue of five
   healthy volunteersimages created in 11 min with nominal resolution of
   8.4 mm isotropic). However, residual intensity was observed in the
   ventricular space on triple-quantum-filtered images acquired with either
   optimized or standard parameters, contrary to the expectation of
   complete single-quantum signal suppression. Further simulation and
   experimentation suggest that this is likely due to the combination of
   triple-quantum-passed signal from surrounding brain tissue being
   spatially smeared into the ventricular space and single-quantum-signal
   breakthrough from sodium nuclei in the fluid space. It is shown that the
   latter can be eliminated with judicious first flip angle selection. Magn

Abstract = {{An expression for Sherwood number is developed from first principles for
   combined pressure-driven and electroosmotic flow in a porous rectangular

   within the mass transfer boundary layer utilizing similarity method.
   From the simulations, it is observed that the Sherwood number increases
   as the electric double layer near the channel wall becomes more compact
   (as manifested through a decrease in the Debye length), and it reaches a
   constant value around the scaled Debye length of 40. The Sherwood number
   becomes constant at higher Debye lengths as electrokinetic effects
   become negligible. A detailed analysis of dependence of Reynolds number,

Abstract = {{A grounding grid of a substation is essential for reducing the ground
   potential rises inside and outside the substation during a short-circuit
   event. The performance of a grounding grid is affected by a number of
   factors, such as the soil conductivity and grounding rod corrosion.
   Industry always has a strong desire for a reliable and cost-effective
   method to monitor the condition of a grounding grid to ensure personnel
   safety and prevent equipments damage. In view of the increased adoption
   of telecom and sensor technologies in power industry through the smart
   grid initiative, this paper proposes an online condition monitoring
   scheme for grounding grids. The scheme monitors touch and step voltages
   in a substation through a sensor network. The voltages are created by a
   continuously-injected, controllable test current. The results are
   transmitted to a database through wireless telecommunication. The
   database evaluates the grid performance continuously by comparing the
   newly measured results with the historical data. Many of the limitations
   of the offline measurement techniques are overcome. Computer simulation
   studies have shown that the proposed scheme is highly feasible and
   technically attractive.}},

Abstract = {{The data collected by smart meters contain a lot of useful information.
   One potential use of the data is to track the energy consumptions and
   operating statuses of major home appliances. The results will enable
   homeowners to make sound decisions on how to save energy and how to
   participate in demand response programs. This paper presents a new
   method to breakdown the total power demand measured by a smart meter to
   those used by individual appliances. A unique feature of the proposed
   method is that it utilizes diverse signatures associated with the entire
   operating window of an appliance for identification. As a result,
   appliances with complicated middle process can be tracked. A novel
   appliance registration device and scheme is also proposed to automate
   the creation of appliance signature database and to eliminate the need
   of massive training before identification. The software and system have
   been developed and deployed to real houses in order to verify the
   proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and spatio-temporal scan statistics proposed by Kulldorff
   have been applied to a number of geographical disease cluster detection
   problems. As the shape of the scanning window used in these methods is
   circular or elliptic, they cannot find irregularly shaped clusters, say
   clusters occurring along river valleys or in cases where disease
   transmission is linked to the road network. In this study, we propose a
   more flexible geometric structure to be used as a spatial or
   spatio-temporal scanning window. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) is
   used to optimize the scanning window to determine disease clusters. We
   evaluated the proposed method over a number of spatial and
   spatio-temporal datasets (Breast cancer mortality in Northeastern US
   1988-1992 and different types of cancer in New Mexico 1982-2007).
   Experimental results demonstrate that the introduced approach surpasses
   the results produced by the circular and elliptic scan statistics in
   terms of efficiency, especially when dealing with irregularly shaped

Abstract = {{A theoretical solution is developed for calculating the consolidation of

   degenerating the present solution to this special case and compared it
   with existing solutions. The comparisons show that, as underestimating
   the volumetric strains of the column and the surrounding soil, the
   average degree of consolidation calculated by the previous studies are
   greater than the present model and the differences are noted. Finally,
   the influence of geosynthetics on the consolidation of composite

Abstract = {{Photometric stereo is a well-established method to estimate surface
   normals of an object. When coupled with depth-map estimation, it can be
   used to reconstruct an object's height field. Typically, photometric
   stereo requires an image sequence of an object under the same viewpoint
   but with differing illumination directions. One crucial assumption of
   this configuration is perfect pixel correspondence across images in the
   sequence. While this assumption is often satisfied, certain setups are
   susceptible to translational errors or misalignments across images.
   Current methods to align image sequences were not designed specifically
   for single-view photometric stereo. Thus, they either struggle to
   account for changing illumination across images, require training sets,
   or are overly complex for these conditions. However, the unique nature
   of single-view photometric stereo allows one to model misaligned image
   sequences using the underlying image formation model and a set of
   translational shifts. This paper introduces such a technique, entitled
   translational photometric alignment, that employs the Lambertian model
   of image formation. This reduces the alignment problem to minimizing a
   nonlinear sum-squared error function in order to best reconcile the
   observed images with the generative model. Thus, the end goal of
   translational photometric alignment is not only to align image
   sequences, but also to produce the best surface-normal estimates given
   the observed images. Controlled experiments on the Yale Face Database B
   demonstrate the high accuracy of translational photometric alignment.
   The utility and benefits of the technique are further illustrated by
   additional experiments on image sequences suffering from uncontrolled
   real-world misalignments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel bilateral control design scheme for
   pneumatic master-slave teleoperation systems that are actuated by
   low-cost solenoid valves. The motivation for using pneumatic actuators
   in lieu of electrical actuators is that the former has higher force to
   mass ratio than the latter and is inert to magnetic fields, which is
   crucial in certain teleoperation applications such as MRI-guided,
   robotassisted surgery. A sliding mode approach, called the three-mode
   control scheme, is incorporated into a two-channel bilateral
   teleoperation architecture, which can implement a position-position,
   force-force, or force-position scheme. An analysis of stability and
   transparency of the closed-loop teleoperation system is carried out. The
   proposed control design performance is experimentally verified on a
   single-degree-of-freedom pneumatic teleoperation system actuated by
   on/off valves. Experimental results show high accuracies in terms of
   position and force tracking under free-space motion and hard-contact
   motion in the teleoperation system. Another purpose of this paper is to
   demonstrate the possibility to improve the valve lifetime by increasing
   the number of control levels. To do this, a new control design, called
   the five-mode control scheme, is developed and compared with the
   three-mode scheme in time domain as well as in frequency domain. (C)

Abstract = {{Centralised laboratories routinely determine blood types by serological
   and molecular methods. Current practices have limitations in terms of
   cost, time and accessibility. Miniaturised microfluidic platforms offer
   an alternative to conventional genotyping methods, since they consume
   fewer reagents, provide faster analysis and allow for complete
   integration and automation. As these `lab-on-a-chip' devices have been
   used for bacterial and viral detection, the authors investigated blood
   group genotyping as a novel application of microfluidic technology. To
   demonstrate the feasibility of microfluidic chip-based genotyping, the
   authors compared human platelet antigen 1 (HPA-1) genotype results from
   conventional and chip-based analysis for 19 blood donor specimens. DNA
   purification was performed with ChargeSwitch (TM) magnetic beads, DNA
   amplification (PCR), restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) and
   capillary electrophoresis (CE) for identification of the DNA on
   microfluidic chips. It was found that nine donors were HPA-1a/1a and ten
   were HPA-1a/1b. Concordance between the conventional and on-chip methods
   was achieved for all but one sample. All the steps were demonstrated for
   complete blood group genotyping analysis of patient whole blood
   specimens on separate microfluidic chips. Future work will focus on
   integration of all the genotyping protocols on a single microfluidic
   chip.}},

Abstract = {{The calibration and comparison to experimental data of a parallel
   computing multi-zone combustion model for simulating operational
   characteristics of an n-butanol/n-heptane fuelled Homogeneous Charge
   Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine utilizing the negative valve overlap
   (NVO) technology is described. The model is calibrated using one
   experimentally characterized operating point and by taking into account
   the major features of NVO. The model simulations at other four operating
   points closely match the cylinder pressure trace and heat release rates
   of the experiments. The unburned hydrocarbon emission is predicted to a
   reasonable level while NOx (nitric oxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO2)
   formation is under-predicted. The difficulty in mapping the NOx emission
   is attributed to the fact that the combustion model operates within the
   closed cycle period of engines and therefore does not capture the
   complexity of the charge stratification within the NVO equipped engine.
   Nevertheless, the trend of increasing NOx levels with the increasing
   fraction of butanol in the fuel mixture is captured and the model is
   able to predict the pressure, heat release rates, and combustion phasing
   for the three fuel blends tested. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   environmental factors for siting biomass-based facilities are analyzed
   to derive a land suitability model. Based on location-allocation model,
   13 plants could be built in the Province of Alberta with transportation
   costs in the range of \$21-33 per tonne. The locally determined unit

   stagnation point increased. It was found further that for small values

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to provide a methodology for the selection
   of appropriate biomass feedstocks for gasification purposes based on the
   final syngas applications. To achieve this objective, a numerical
   algorithm is developed to simulate the gasification process of biomass
   materials. The model is first validated by a close agreement found
   between the numerical results and those of the experiments available in
   the literature for fixed-bed downdraft gasifiers. Subsequently, a list
   of 80 diverse biomass materials of distinctive families, together with
   their proximate and ultimate analysis is utilized to extract the extreme
   limits of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen contents. The gasification
   process is then simulated in numerous cases covering a comprehensive
   range of biomass oxygen content and carbon:hydrogen ratio, while
   operational conditions are kept constant. The obtained results,
   comprising syngas key characteristics are plotted at last in a
   generalized format. The approach novelty rests on providing a set of
   figures that can be used to select a type of biomass to achieve certain
   syngas specifications in a moving/fixed bed gasifier at the atmospheric
   pressure. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we delineate the consequences of field-dependent solvent
   polarization in the electric double layer (EDL) electrostatic potential
   distribution, and the effective EDL thickness in narrow nanofluidic
   confinements with thick (or overlapping) EDLs. The EDL, formed at the
   interface between a charged substrate and an electrolyte solution,
   induces a large electric field spanning across few nanometer distances
   from the interface. As a result, a polar solvent like water gets
   polarized, making its relative permittivity a function of the EDL
   electric field. This affects the overall EDL electrostatic potential
   distribution and most importantly, leads to a significant reduction of
   the effective EDL thickness, with the extent of the reduction being
   dictated by the value of field independent EDL thickness, strength of
   the solvent polarization, and the substrate-liquid interfacial
   electrostatic potential. Such a finding will necessitate redefining the
   classical EDL thickness, which will be of overwhelming significance in

Abstract = {{We present a comprehensive study of nanoelectromechanical systems in
   pressurized fluids. Resonant responses and quality factors are monitored
   in five different gases and one liquid, in pressures ranging from vacuum
   to 20 MPa, in order to evaluate theoretical models of device-fluid
   interactions at the nanoscale. The traditional Newell picture of
   microresonator damping in different pressure regimes is found to be
   inadequate in describing nanoresonators in general. Damping at
   intermediate pressure ranges is better physically characterized by a
   Weissenberg number (which compares oscillation frequencies with fluid
   relaxation rates) than a Knudsen number (which compares mean free paths
   with device widths) and most adequately described by the Yakhot and
   Colosqui model. At high-pressure ranges, two models are found to give
   good agreement with data: the phenomenological model of vibrating
   spheres and the Sader and Bhiladvala model for the viscous regime. The
   latter is also successful in explicitly predicting pressure-dependent
   behavior of the viscous mass load and damping. We observe significant
   increases in damping due to the squeezed film (SF) of gas between the
   device and substrate as well as due to undercut (an unavoidable artifact
   of the standard fabrication technique); correcting the shape of the
   devices with a focused ion beam allows us to differentiate these two
   factors. Application of the SF model accounts well for additional
   damping at high pressures while only qualitatively agreeing at lower
   pressures. The extensive data collected allow additional insight into
   fundamental processes underlying fluid damping at the nanoscale,
   particularly in the intermediate-and high-pressure regimes.}},

   non-classical simulation method (random walk, RW) for simulation of
   fully miscible displacement in fractured porous media, and to validate
   this method using production and visual data obtained from an
   experimental work.
   First, the limitations of a classical (continuum models) modeling
   approach in the simulation of miscible displacement in fractured media
   were identified by matching the numerical and experimental results
   obtained earlier. Classical simulation yielded reasonable matches for
   low viscosity oil but failed to capture the flow patterns of heavy oil
   displacement, especially in the cases of vertical displacement. This was
   attributed to two reasons: (1) numerical dispersion and grid size
   limitations and (2) the random nature of the phenomenon (mainly the
   viscous fingering process). Beyond that, the classical modeling scheme
   required the intensive use of ``pseudo parameters{''} to account for the
   diffusive and dispersive transfer between matrix and fracture during
   experimental matching.
   To overcome these problems, a non-classical modeling approach, the
   Random Walk (RW) model was adapted. This technique deals with particles
   (walkers), each of which moves randomly, but the probability of the
   movement is defined considering the physics of the process. By tracing a
   large number of particles, one can model the process and have an idea
   about the transport of injected and displaced fluid in complex systems.
   The RW technique allows capturing micro heterogeneities, the random
   nature of the diffusion process and viscous fingering. It also requires
   less computational time compared to classical simulation methods.
   The RW model introduced was validated using experimental-visual-data for
   different oil types, displacement directions (horizontal and vertical),
   and injection rates. This exercise showed that the model presented here
   captures the physics of the process and hence, can be extended and used
   for larger (field) scale processes of miscible displacement in complex
   fracture networks, which would not be possible with classical finite
   difference models. Eventually, diffusion coefficient correlations (both
   oil and solvent), which are the only unknowns required in the proposed
   RW model, as a function of oil viscosity were defined for the horizontal
   displacement cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) loaded poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)
   (Pluronic F-108) and poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL) nanoparticles were
   successfully prepared by a modified film hydration method and
   characterized by scanning electric microscopy (SEM), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic
   light scattering (DLS). Satisfactory drug loading of 20.73 +/- 0.66\%
   and a high encapsulation efficiency of 83.83 +/- 1.32\% were achieved.
   The SN-38 nanoparticles (SN-38 NPs) can completely disperse into a
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS) medium to produce a clear aqueous
   suspension that remains stable for up to three days. Total drug releases
   were 67.91\% and 91.09\% after 24 h in a PBS or fetal bovine serum (FBS)
   medium. Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) tests of SN-38 and
   SN-38 NPs on A549 lung cells produced results of 200.0 +/- 14.9 ng
   ml(-1) and 80.0 +/- 4.6 ng ml(-1), respectively. Similarly, IC50 tests
   of SN-38 and SN-38 NPs on MCF-7 breast cells yielded results of 16.0 +/-
   0.7 ng ml(-1) and 8.0 +/- 0.5 ng ml(-1), respectively. These in vitro
   IC50 studies show significant (p < 0.01) enhancement of the SN-38 NP
   drug efficiency in killing cancer cells in comparison to the free drug
   SN-38 control. All the materials used for this nanoformulation are
   approved by the US FDA, with the virtue of extremely low toxicity to

Title = {{Statistics of surface divergence and their relation to air-water gas
   transfer velocity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Air-sea gas fluxes are generally defined in terms of the air/water
   concentration difference of the gas and the gas transfer velocity, k(L).
   Because it is difficult to measure k(L) in the ocean, it is often
   parameterized using more easily measured physical properties. Surface
   divergence theory suggests that infrared (IR) images of the water
   surface, which contain information concerning the movement of water very
   near the air-water interface, might be used to estimate k(L). Therefore,
   a series of experiments testing whether IR imagery could provide a
   convenient means for estimating the surface divergence applicable to
   air-sea exchange were conducted in a synthetic jet array tank embedded
   in a wind tunnel. Gas transfer velocities were measured as a function of
   wind stress and mechanically generated turbulence; laser-induced
   fluorescence was used to measure the concentration of carbon dioxide in
   the top 300 mu m of the water surface; IR imagery was used to measure
   the spatial and temporal distribution of the aqueous skin temperature;
   and particle image velocimetry was used to measure turbulence at a depth
   of 1 cm below the air-water interface. It is shown that an estimate of
   the surface divergence for both wind-shear driven turbulence and
   mechanically generated turbulence can be derived from the surface skin
   temperature. The estimates derived from the IR images are compared to
   velocity field divergences measured by the PIV and to independent
   estimates of the divergence made using the laser-induced fluorescence
   data. Divergence is shown to scale with k(L) values measured using
   gaseous tracers as predicted by conceptual models for both wind-driven
   and mechanically generated turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{Four synthetic perylene bisimide-based polyaromatic (PA) surfactants
   with a structural or functional group difference in their attached
   hydrophilic/hydrophobic substituent side chains were used to probe
   structure-nanoaggregation relations in organic media by molecular
   dynamics simulations and dynamic light scattering. The results from the
   simulated radial distribution functions and light scattering experiments
   indicate that variation in the structure of side chains and polarity of
   functional groups leads to significant variations in molecular
   association, dynamics of molecular nanoaggregation and structure of
   nanoaggregates. The aggregates of PA surfactant molecules grow to much
   larger sizes in heptane than in toluene. The aromatic solvent is shown
   to hinder molecular association by weakening pi-pi stacking,
   demonstrating the control of molecular aggregation by tuning solvent
   properties. In aliphatic solvent, the aggregates formed from PA
   surfactants of aliphatic alkyl groups and phenylalanine derivatives as a
   side chain usually have a higher solvent accessible surface area to
   accessible volume ratio (SASA:AV) than that of tryptophan derivatives in
   their side chains. PA surfactants with an aliphatic functional group in
   both side chains does not form polyaromatic pi-pi stacking (T-stacking)
   due to its strong steric hindrance in both solvents. Depending on the
   nature of the side chains attached, various stacking distributions,
   aggregation sizes, and SASA:AV ratios were obtained. In PA surfactant
   nanoaggregates, all of the solvent molecules were found to be excluded
   from the interstices of the stacked polyaromatic cores, regardless of
   whether the solvent molecules are aliphatic or aromatic. Although the
   change in the structure of side chain substituent in polyaromatic
   surfactants has a negligible impact on their self-diffusivity, it can
   strongly influence their intermolecular interactions, leading to
   different aggregate diffusion coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of column preconditioning temperature (T-cp) on the measured
   heats of adsorption of selected aliphatic and aromatic compounds for
   kaolinite and illite, two clay minerals commonly encountered in the oil
   sands industry, was studied using the technique of inverse gas
   chromatography (IGC). T-cp was varied from 100 to 340 degrees C. Our
   results showed that, as T-cp was increased from 100 to 170 degrees C,
   the heats of adsorption (affinities) of the selected aliphatic solutes
   for kaolinite increased slightly, but those for illite stayed nearly the
   same. At higher T-cp values (170-230 degrees C), solute adsorption
   exhibited essentially no dependence on T-cp for both kaolinite and
   illite. This observation is attributed to the decreasing hydrophilicity
   for kaolinite from 100 to 170 degrees C, but not for kaolinite from 170
   to 230 degrees C or for illite from 100 to 230 degrees C. Higher T-cp
   values (230-340 degrees C) were used for the two aromatic solutes
   (benzene and toluene), and it was found that their heats of adsorption
   for illite were significantly reduced (50\%) whereas those for kaolinite
   were insensitive to T-cp. It is believed that this observation can be
   attributed to the loss of surface water as a result of increasing
   temperature. Here, departure of surface water would decrease the number
   of Lewis acid sites on the tetrahedral surfaces, thereby reducing the
   attractive interaction between the surfaces and the pi bonds of the
   aromatic solutes at elevated T-cp. Because illite contains only
   tetrahedral surfaces, the measured heats of adsorption of benzene and
   toluene decreased with increasing temperature. However, in the case of
   kaolinite, which contains 1:1 tetrahedral and octahedral surfaces, this
   effect was offset by the increasing attractive interaction between the
   exposed hydroxyl moieties on the octahedral surfaces and the pi bonds of
   the aromatic probes. As demonstrated in this work, the measured heat of
   adsorption depends on T-cp. Therefore, care must be taken when comparing
   solute affinity for various types of minerals based on IGC measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Chitosan, a natural polymer extracted from crustacean shells, was found
   to selectively depress chalcopyrite while galena was floated by
   xanthate. At pH 4, the recovery of galena was up to 95\% while that of
   chalcopyrite was 30\% when flotation tests were carried out on mixtures
   of chalcopyrite and galena. However, in single mineral flotation and
   adsorption tests, it was found that both chalcopyrite and galena were
   depressed and chitosan adsorbed on both minerals. The observed
   selectivity seemed to have originated from competitive adsorption.
   ToF-SIMS measurements indicated that when chalcopyrite and galena were
   present together in the suspension, chitosan barely adsorbed on galena
   but adsorbed heavily on chalcopyrite. Chitosan-metal ions adsorption
   test, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as well as ToF-SIMS were
   employed to study the interaction of chitosan with chalcopyrite and

Abstract = {{This paper highlights the changes in micro-structural and field emission
   properties of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) via oxygen
   plasma treatment. We find that exposure of very low power oxygen plasma
   (6 W) at 13.56 MHz for 15-20 min, opens the tip of vertically aligned
   CNTs. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy
   images were used to identify the quality and microstructural changes of
   the nanotube morphology and surfaces. Raman spectra showed that the
   numbers of defects were increased throughout the oxygen plasma treatment
   process. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of the VACNTs is altered
   significantly and the contact angle decreases drastically from 110
   degrees to 40 degrees. It was observed that the electron field emission
   (EFE) characteristics are significantly enhanced. The turn-on electric
   field (ETOE) of CNTs decreased from similar to 0.80 V mu m(-1)
   (untreated) to similar to 0.60 V mu m(-1) (oxygen treated). We believe
   that the open ended VACNTs would be immensely valuable for applications
   such as micro/nanofluidic based filtering elements and display devices.

Title = {{Modeling bacteriophage attachment using adsorption efficiency}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{22-29}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Typically, models of bacteriophage adsorption consider the process in
   two steps: reversible and irreversible attachment. In this study, a
   recently introduced one-step adsorption model, the adsorption efficiency
   model, is used to describe the adsorption of T-series bacteriophages to
   Escherichia coli. The adsorption efficiency model simplifies phage
   attachment to a single step: irreversible binding.The adsorption
   efficiency (epsilon) is used to account for unadsorbed phages. The model
   accurately describes T-series phage adsorption (T2, T4, T5, T6, and T7)
   under a variety of conditions. In addition, the model is compared to a
   commonly used two-step adsorption model, the sequential model.
   Experimental data support the assumptions of the adsorption efficiency
   model and suggest that the reversible first step of T-series phage
   adsorption is equivalent to irreversible attachment under the conditions
   tested. The adsorption efficiency model was not appropriate for a phage
   lambda strain lacking side tail fibers. However, the model did agree
   with data previously published for a strain of phage lambda possessing
   side tail fibers, as is the case of all T-series strains tested. This
   suggests that the adsorption efficiency model applies to phages
   containing side tail fibers (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach for predicting absolute permeability and effective
   Knudsen diffusivity values in gas-diffusion-layers/microporous layers
   (GDLs/MPLs) is proposed. A conventional diffusion bridge setup with
   modifications is used to obtain the pressure drop across the GDL at
   several mass flow rates. The experimental results are then fitted to
   both the Darcy's model and the binary friction model (BFM). Experimental
   data obtained using different working gases, e.g. O-2. N-2, He and Ar,
   are used to validate the two model predictions. Experimental results
   show that the traditionally used Darcy's law is not able to predict the
   pressure drop across the GDL, especially in a GDL with an MPL, due to
   Knudsen effects. The BFM accounts for both viscous and Knudsen transport
   and it is thereby shown to provide more accurate predictions for any
   working fluid tested. Permeability and effective Knudsen diffusivities
   obtained using both Darcy's model and BFM for a SGL (Weisbaden, Germany)

Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a parametric energy conversion method of thermoacoustic
   (TA) vibrations into electrical oscillations of a LC circuit. The
   inductance modulation necessary to excite the parametric oscillations is
   achieved by varying the air gap between two halves of a ferrite E-core
   coil. As a proof-of-concept, the parametric converter was attached to a
   Sondhauss tube that converts the heat into acoustic vibrations. The
   maximum total acoustic power output of this thermoacoustic engine was
   similar to 5.3 mW. A flexible metallic membrane capping the Sondhauss
   tube connected to the moving half E-core served as a mechanical
   oscillator. The resonance frequency of the membrane was matched with the
   operating frequency (130 Hz) of the Sondhauss tube for resonant energy
   extraction. We have characterized the power output of the complete
   system as a function of electrical load. The maximum electrical power of
   2.3 mW produced by the system corresponds to an acoustic-to-electric
   conversion efficiency of 44\%. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{As both onshore and offshore pipeline constructions push further into
   higher risk terrains, such as geologically unstable terrain and the
   Arctic region, the risk of local buckling failure (wrinkling) for these
   buried pipelines has been increasing gradually. However, current methods
   used to prevent buried pipelines from buckling failure are expensive,
   time consuming, and unreliable. Therefore, to overcome these problems, a
   reliable method of predicting pipeline wrinkling is proposed. The method
   can provide active warning for pipeline wrinkling through a
   decision-making system (DMS). The DMS has been designed to identify
   strain distribution patterns and their development on critical pipe
   segments and detect the onset of pipe wrinkling. To create a reliable
   DMS, studies of the strain distribution patterns of line-pipes during
   pipe buckling are very important. In this paper, the strain distribution
   patterns of various line-pipes are presented. These line-pipes have
   different material and geometric properties, loading conditions, and
   manufacturing conditions. A total of 32 sets of experimental results and
   72 sets of finite element analyses (FEA) along with parametric studies
   were included in the study. The study revealed significant behavioral
   characteristics of the strain distribution patterns during pipe buckling
   and important parameters affecting these strain patterns. For practical
   application, three thresholds of the strain distribution patterns are
   proposed. Furthermore, the optimal positions and spacing of the strain
   measurements for early detecting pipelines wrinkling are discussed as
   well. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004522]}},

Abstract = {{Grids used for flow simulation are often at a much coarser scale than
   that of grids for geological modelling due to computational demand.
   Unstructured grids offer increased flexibility for the flow grid design;
   however, solving the flow equations and upscaling from high resolution
   geological grids to the coarse flow grid is more complex than using
   coarse regular grids. The multipoint flux approximation (MPFA) is one
   technique applied to discretize the flow equations on unstructured
   grids. This paper develops an upscaling technique that uses the MPFA
   method to solve the flow equations on the fine- and coarse-scale grids.
   Unlike most cases where the fine- scale grid is regular or structured,
   this work utilizes a high resolution triangular grid that conforms to
   the coarse-scale grid. The triangular grid is generated using the
   coarse-scale interaction regions as constraints. Upscaling leads to
   transmissibility matrices of the coarse-scale interaction regions. Two
   different types of local boundary conditions for the MPFA upscaling
   approach are developed, including linear varying pressures and pressures
   computed by solving the flow equations around the element boundary. The
   method is tested using flow simulation on several cases. Results are
   comparable with flow using a high resolution regular grid.}},

Abstract = {{BioDiesel as Additive in High Pressure and Temperature Steam Recovery of
   Heavy Oil and Bitumen Use of additives to improve the efficiency of
   thermal heavy oil and bitumen recovery processes has been studied
   extensively over the decades. Two common types of additives used in
   thermal applications, mainly steam assisted recovery, are solvents and
   surfactants. Commercial use of solvents has setbacks due to their high
   costs and retrieval difficulties. Cost and stability of the surfactants
   under reservoir operating temperature and pressure are the major
   concerns. We propose the use of bioDiesel such as fatty acids methyl
   ester as a surfactant additive reducing heavy oil/bitumen-water
   interfacial tension in steam assisted recovery processes. Advantages of
   using bioDiesel as a surfactant additive are that bioDiesel is
   chemically stable under the operating pressure and temperature of the
   reservoir, it causes no harm on bitumen fuel quality and on release
   water chemistry and its use is economically feasible.
   We conducted a series of steam assisted bitumen recovery experiments to
   clarify the additional recovery potential and efficiency improvement
   capacity of bioDiesel. High pressure steam at 1.8 MPa pressure, 205
   degrees C was used in these tests at a 900 g/h feed rate. The porous
   media used was a normal grade oil sands ore obtained from a surface mine
   operation in Northern Alberta, Canada. Oil sands ore was packed in a
   basket and placed in a high pressure cell. Bitumen recovery experiments
   were performed by spraying canola oil fatty acid methyl ester on oil
   sands ore at a 2 g/kg-bitumen dosage. These tests show that bitumen
   recovery efficiency increases over 40\%. In another series of tests,
   tall oil fatty acids methyl ester was injected into a high pressure
   steam line at a 83 g-bioDiesel/kg-steam dosage. Because of the
   solubility of bioDiesel in bitumen, the effect of bioDiesel on bitumen
   recovery could not be accurately concluded. Vapor pressure measurements
   performed on canola oil and tall oil derived bioDiesel samples suggest
   that saturation compositions of bioDiesel in steam at 1.8 MPa pressure
   and 205 degrees C are at least one order of magnitude higher than the
   requested bioDiesel dosages. Further tests are planned by reducing
   bioDiesel dosages to about 0.5 to 1.0 g-bioDiesel/kilogram-steam and by
   monitoring the solubility of bioDiesel in bitumen.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of quantum mechanics and molecular simulation were
   performed to investigate the adsorption capacity of pure hydrogen and
   helium and their mixture in silicon nanotubes (SiNTs). In the
   simulation, the gas-gas interactions were modelled as Lenard-Jones
   potential sphere. The binding energies between hydrogen and helium with
   the surface of SiNTs were obtained from ab initio calculations and
   fitted to Morse potential equation. The calculated binding energies were
   provided as an input in the MC simulation. First, ab initio calculations
   revealed stronger binding energy of SiNTs with H-2 compared with He.
   This is attributed to the different physicochemical properties and lower
   polarizability of He compared to H-2. Second, Monte Carlo simulation
   results were representative of higher magnitude of H-2 adsorption in all
   SiNTs than He in both pure and mixture systems. Most importantly, Our
   simulation results indicate that the gravimetric adsorption capacity of
   hydrogen in an equimolar mixture of H-2/He represent distinct
   improvement of 13.6\%, 10.0\%, and 8.5\% in (5, 5), (7,7) and (9,9) SiNT
   at T = 50 K and P = 2 MPa compare to pure system. This suggests that
   with addition of helium to hydrogen system more efficient hydrogen
   adsorption can be achieved. Furthermore, MC calculations at the same
   theoretical level were performed for isodiameter CNT. By comparison of
   hydrogen adsorption increase in the mixture in SiNT and CNT, it is found
   that the percentage of hydrogen adsorption increase in the presence of
   helium as compared to pure system in (5, 5) SiNT is greater than that in
   isodiameter (8,8) CNT.}},

Abstract = {{Reservoir heterogeneities occur over a wide range of length scales, and
   transport process modeling at large-scales requires proper scale-up of
   heterogeneity and its interaction with underlying transport mechanisms.
   This paper demonstrates a new technique to systematically quantify the
   scaling characteristics of mass transfer in heterogeneous reservoirs
   based on the volume averaging approach. Although treatment of transport
   problems with the volume averaging technique has been published in the
   past, application of those methods to geological systems exhibiting
   realistic spatial variability is lacking due to various restrictive
   assumptions in the conventional formulation. We propose a new procedure
   where results from a fine-scale numerical flow simulation reflecting the
   full physics of the transport process albeit over a small sub-volume of
   the reservoir are integrated with the volume averaging technique to
   provide effective description of transport properties and to derive
   scaling relationships of mass transfer coefficient (K-eff) in reservoirs
   exhibiting anisotropic spatial variability. Our results present
   promising potential for application to other complex geologic medium.
   The method is further extended to describe transport in systems
   involving inter-phase transport between multiple flowing phases.
   In particular, the scaling characteristics of K-eff for a tracer
   injection process corresponding to different reservoir heterogeneity
   correlation lengths as well as different transport mechanisms were
   studied. Our results show that scaling of recovery responses (e.g.,
   variances in tracer breakthrough time and recovery) can be described by
   the scaling of K-eff; in particular, mean and variance of K-eff decrease
   with length scale, similar in the fashion of recovery statistics. (C)

Abstract = {{A versatile optical setup for all-terahertz (THz) time resolved
   pump-probe spectroscopy was designed and tested. By utilizing a dual THz
   pulse generator emitter module, independent and synchronized THz
   radiation pump and probe pulses were produced, thus eliminating the need
   for THz beam splitters and the limitations associated with their
   implementation. The current THz setup allows for precise control of the
   electric fields splitting ratio between the THz radiation pump and probe
   pulses, as well as in-phase, out-of-phase, and polarization dependent
   pump-probe spectroscopy. Since the present THz pump-probe setup does not
   require specialized THz radiation optical components, such as phase
   shifters, polarization rotators, or wide bandwidth beam splitters, it
   can be easily implemented with minimal alterations to a conventional THz
   time domain spectroscopy system. The present setup is valuable for
   studying the time dynamics of THz coherent phenomena in solid-state,

Abstract = {{Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP, ABCG2) is an efflux protein
   whose aberrant activity has been linked to multidrug resistance in
   cancer. Although siRNA delivery to down-regulate BCRP expression is
   promising to sensitize tumor cells against drugs, therapeutic use of
   siRNA requires effective carriers that can deliver siRNA intracellularly
   with minimal toxicity on target cells. This study explored the
   feasibility of special class of cationic polymers, namely
   lipid-substituted low molecular weight (2 kDa) polyethyleneimine (PEI),
   as a carrier for siRNA-mediated BCRP down-regulation. Structure-function
   studies methodically evaluated the effect of a range of lipophilic
   substitutions for siRNA delivery and BCRP down-regulation. Our results
   showed a significant increase in siRNA delivery as a function of lipid
   substitution for a range of lipids ranging from C8 to C18. The BCRP
   silencing was correlated to siRNA delivery efficiency of the polymers,
   and effectively lasted for similar to 5 days after a single treatment of
   siRNA. BCRP down-regulation sensitized the drug-resistant cells to
   cytotoxic effect of mitoxantrone by a similar to 14-fold decrease in the
   IC50 value, whose effect was evident even after 14 days. This study
   demonstrated the possibility of functional siRNA delivery by
   lipid-modified low molecular weight PEI and highlighted the importance
   of the extent and nature of lipid substitution in effective siRNA
   delivery. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   through their encapsulation in polymeric micelles. Cyclosporine A or
   valspodar was physically encapsulated in methoxypoly(ethylene
   oxide)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) micelles using
   co-solvent evaporation method. The commercially available DOX was
   administered as a single dose of 5 mg/kg intravenously to Sprague-Dawley
   rats either alone or 30 min following a single intravenous dose (10
   mg/kg) of either CyA or valspodar as part of conventional or polymeric
   micellar formulation. Co-administration of DOX with either Sandimmune
   (R) or valspodar in the conventional Cremophor EL-based formulation was
   associated with greater than 50\% reduction in DOX clearance (CL).
   Although there was nearly 40\% reduction in the CL of DOX with the
   polymeric micellar formulation of CyA, there was only 6\% reduction in
   CL of DOX upon co-administration with the polymeric micellar formulation
   of valspodar. In conclusion, encapsulation of cyclosporines,
   particularly valspodar, in polymeric micelles was shown to reduce their
   effects on the pharmacokinetics of DOX in rat. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The nature of the construction industry is characterized by many risks
   and uncertainty inherent in every phase of the project life cycle. Risk
   management, therefore, is essential for a construction project to
   succeed in fulfilling its project objectives. In conventional event-tree
   analysis, the probability of the risk event, the probability of
   failure/success of different mitigation strategies, and the consequences
   of different paths must be assessed to allow for quantitative event-tree
   analysis. However, conducting quantitative event-tree analysis,
   especially in construction projects, entails several difficulties
   attributed to the lack of sufficient data. To overcome this challenge,
   this paper presents a comprehensive framework in which experts can use
   linguistic terms rather than numerical values to conduct event-tree
   analysis and calculate the expected monetary value (EMV) of risk events.
   The proposed framework is based on combining failure mode and effect
   analysis (FMEA), fault trees, event trees, and fuzzy logic. This paper
   allows experts to express themselves linguistically to calculate the EMV
   of risk events, which is more appropriate for the construction domain.
   In addition, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework for risk
   management that combines three well-known techniques in reliability
   engineering in a novel way that considers the often subjective quality
   of risk-related data. The application of fuzzy logic provides an
   effective tool to handle subjectivity in the construction domain. The
   proposed framework is implemented in the form of two software tools
   entitled Risk Criticality Analyzer and Fuzzy Reliability Analyzer. To
   validate the framework, a case study is presented and the EMV is
   calculated using the proposed approach. The result of the proposed
   approach is then compared to the result obtained using Monte Carlo
   simulation, demonstrating that the proposed framework gives similar
   results to Monte Carlo simulation but provides the advantage of allowing
   experts to express themselves linguistically, making the proposed
   framework more practical and easier to apply in the construction domain.

Abstract = {{A temperature increase coupled with other geochemical perturbations is
   expected to occur during the heat phase of the geological repository due
   to the presence of heat-emitting radioactive waste and engineered
   barrier system. To study the impact of a temperature increase on the
   geochemistry of some candidate clay host rocks considered in Europe, we
   tried to simulate such conditions by means of batch tests followed by
   detailed mineralogy analysis and geochemical modelling. The batch tests
   were performed on whole rock Boom Clay (WRBC) and whole rock Opalinus
   Clay (WROPA) samples in contact with some representative pore waters at
   90 degrees C, the maximum temperature expected as a result of
   heat-emitting waste. The same experimental settings were applied to run
   parallel tests on the separated clay fractions (CFBC and CFOPA). The aim
   was to assess the impact of coupled heat and chemical processes on their
   mineral stability in the presence and absence of the organic matter and
   carbonates. At specific time intervals, the solids were separated from
   solutions and subject to (Q)XRD, FTIR, UV-VIS, TSA and CEC
   determinations. The whole rock samples were found stable irrespectively
   of the solution composition with no negative impact on their
   physico-chemical properties. In line with the experimental observations,
   the geochemical modelling suggests that minerals are able to
   reequilibrate relatively fast with the ambient solutions. The clay
   mineralogy was modified only in the case of Boom Clay deprived of
   carbonates and organic matter. The clay mineralogical alterations are
   associated with the increase of the layer charge. TSA and CEC. The
   experimental and modelling results indicate that coupled heat and
   perturbed geochemical conditions did not jeopardise the stability of the
   constituent minerals in the studied clays. Altogether, the presented
   work highlights very good buffer capacity of both candidate host rocks
   towards geochemical perturbations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We report on spectroscopic measurements of acrolein and acrylonitrile at
   atmospheric pressure using a pulsed distributed feedback quantum-cascade
   laser in combination with intra- and inter-pulse techniques and compare
   the results. The measurements were done in the frequency region around
   957 cm(-1). In the inter-pulse technique, the laser is excited with
   short current pulses (5-10 ns), and the pulse amplitude is modulated
   with an external current ramp resulting in a similar to 2.3 cm(-1)
   frequency scan. In the intra-pulse technique, a linear frequency
   down-chirp during the pulse is used for sweeping across the absorption
   line. Long current pulses up to 500 ns were used for these measurements
   which resulted in a spectral window of similar to 2.2 cm(-1) during the
   down-chirp. These comparatively wide spectral windows facilitated the
   measurements of the relatively broad absorption lines (similar to 1
   cm(-1)) of acrolein and acrylonitrile. The use of a room-temperature
   mercury-cadmium-telluride detector resulted in a completely cryogen-free
   spectrometer. We demonstrate ppb level detection limits within a data
   acquisition time of similar to 10 s with these methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Carbohydrate-based drug and gene delivery carriers are becoming
   extremely popular for in vitro and in vivo applications. These carriers
   are found to be nontoxic and can play a significant role in targeted
   delivery. However, the interactions of these carriers with blood cells
   and plasma components are not well explored. To the best of our
   knowledge, there are currently no reports that explore the role of
   carbohydrate based carriers for blood biocompatibility. Hyperbranched
   glycopolymers of varying molecular weights are synthesized by reversible
   addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) and are
   studied in detail for their biocompatibility, including
   hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity against different cell lines in
   vitro. The hemocompatibility studies (such as hemolysis and platelet
   activation) indicate that hyperbranched glycopolymers of varying
   molecular weights produced are highly hemocompatible and do not induce
   clot formation, red blood cell aggregation, and immune response. Hence,
   it can be concluded that glycopolymers functionalized carriers can serve
   as an excellent candidate for various biomedical applications. In
   addition, cytotoxicity of these hyperbranched polymers is studied in
   primary and malignant cell lines at varying concentrations using cell
   viability assay.}},

Abstract = {{Monocyte-based gene therapies in cancer have been hampered by either the
   resistance of these cells to non-viral molecular delivery methods or
   their poor trafficking to the tumor site after their ex vivo
   manipulations. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP)-loaded genetically
   engineered monocytes can efficiently delivered to tumor site by external
   magnetic field, but they are not ideal delivery tools due to their
   spherical shape. Hence, we have investigated the cellular uptake
   efficiency and cytotoxicity of fluorescein isothiocyanate
   (FITC)-labelled magnetic carbon nanotubes (FITC-mCNT) in human monocytic
   leukemia cell line THP-1 for application in cell-based gene therapy
   against cancer. Uptake of FITC-mCNT into THP-1 cells reached 100\% only
   1 h after the delivery. Confocal imaging confirmed that FITC-mCNT
   entered the cell cytoplasm and even into the nucleus. FITC-mCNT uptake
   did not compromise cell viability. This delivery system might therefore
   enhance cell-based cancer gene therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the molecular interaction mechanisms of asphaltenes in
   organic solvent have not reached a widely accepted conclusion, mainly
   because of a poor definition of asphaltene molecules and lack of
   accurate information on the molecular structure. In this study,
   N-(1-hexylhept-yl)-N'-(5-carboxylicpentyl)
   perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic bisimide (C5Pe) of the polyaromatic
   core with a proper molecular weight and heteroatoms in its structure was
   used as a model compound of asphaltenes in an attempt to understand
   interaction mechanisms of molecular aggregation in organic solvents. A
   surface forces apparatus (SFA) was used to directly measure the
   molecular interactions of CSPe in toluene and heptane. For the
   interactions between two model clay (mica) surfaces across a
   C5Pe-in-toluene solution, the repulsion observed between the adsorbed
   C5Pe molecules was shown to be of a steric origin. The force-distance
   profiles at short separation distances under high compression force
   during approaching were well-fitted with the Alexander-de Gennes (AdG)
   scaling theory, while the weaker repulsive forces at lower compression
   force regime over longer separation distances can also be fitted with
   the AdG model using an independent set of fitting parameters, indicating
   the presence of possible secondary brush structures of the C5Pe
   molecules in toluene. For interactions of pre-adsorbed C5Pe films (C5Pe
   versus mica and C5Pe versus C5Pe), no significant adhesion was detected
   in toluene, while strong adhesion was measured in heptane. The
   comparison of the results obtained with the model compound C5Pe and
   native asphaltenes shows that CSPe behaves quantitatively different from
   the real asphaltenes in the context of contact angle and interaction
   force profiles. However, there are qualitative similarities in terms of
   intermolecular forces, indicating that the polar components in real
   asphaltene molecules play an important role in determining their
   interfacial activities.}},

Abstract = {{Physical separation of heavy oils and bitumen is of particular interest
   because it improves the description of the chemical and structural
   organization in these industrial and challenging fluids (Zhao, B.; Shaw,
   J. M. Composition and size distribution of coherent nanostructures in
   Athabasca bitumen and Maya crude oil. Energy Fuels 2007, 21, 2795-2804).
   In this study, permeates and retentates, differing in aggregate
   concentrations and sizes, were obtained from nanofiltration of a vacuum
   residue at 200 degrees C with membranes of varying pore size. Elemental
   composition and density extrapolations show that aggregates are best
   represented as n-pentane asphaltenes, while the dispersing phase
   corresponds to n-pentane maltenes. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
   measurements are processed, on this basis, to calculate the size and
   mass of the aggregates. Aggregates in the vacuum residue are similar in
   size and mass to asphaltenes in toluene, and temperature elevation
   decreases the size of the aggregates. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)
   highlights a coherent domain observed for fluids containing aggregates,
   corresponding to aromatic stacking described for dry asphaltenes. The
   scattered signal in this region, not observed in maltenes, grows as
   aggregate content increases, and the signal persists up to 300 degrees
   C. A generic behavior of aggregation in the vacuum residue is depicted,
   from nanoaggregates to large fractal clusters with high aggregation
   numbers, that is similar to the organization in toluene.}},

Abstract = {{The production of conventional crude oil and bitumen often faces the
   challenges in removing residual water from stable water-in-oil
   emulsions. The chemical demulsifier is commonly employed to enhance
   water removal because of its high efficiency and simplicity in
   operation. In this study, a novel magnetic demulsifier with a
   surface-active ethyl cellulose (EC) grafted on magnetic nanoparticle
   surfaces, called M-EC, was investigated for water removal from
   water-in-diluted bitumen emulsions. The M-EC was demonstrated to be
   interfacially active and magnetically responsive. The interfacial
   activity of EC on the surface of novel M-EC nanoparticles allowed them
   to be effectively attached to otherwise stable emulsified water droplets
   in diluted bitumen emulsions. The M-EC tagged water droplets were
   readily removed by an external magnetic field. When a simple magnetic
   separation was combined with tagging of emulsified water droplets by
   M-EC nanoparticles, our experimental results showed a more than 90\%
   removal of the original water from the diluted bitumen. Such a
   combination led to a separation time about 10 times faster than
   corresponding demulsification by chemical EC. The external magnetic
   field was found to enhance the coalescence of magnetically tagged water
   droplets in emulsion, producing a much smaller volume of sludge and
   hence leading to a minimal hydrocarbon loss to waste aqueous phase. The
   chemical bonding of interfacially active EC on the surface of magnetic
   nanoparticles and the magnetic property of M-EC allowed the spent M-EC
   nanoparticles to be readily recovered by magnetic separation and
   regenerated by solvent washing. The regenerated M-EC was found to retain
   its interfacial activity and be effective in breaking the diluted
   bitumen emulsions after reuse for 10 cycles. Application of M-EC
   nanoparticles to an industrial bitumen froth showed a minimal water
   removal of greater than 80\%, demonstrating their promising applications
   to industry demulsification. The current study demonstrated that
   magnetic demulsification with tailor-designed magnetic demulsifiers
   represents a new direction of removing emulsified water from heavy oil
   and diluted bitumen emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the
   WB97Xd functional with a dispersion correction term and the 6-31G(d,p)
   basis set to study the contributions of pi-pi stacking and
   hydrogen-bonding interactions to the aggregation of asphaltene model
   compounds containing a 2,2'-bipyridine moiety covalently bonded to one
   (monosubstituted) and two (disubstituted) aromatic hydrocarbon moieties
   (phenyl, naphthyl, anthracyl, phenanthryl, and pyrenyl) through ethylene
   tethers. In these compounds, the N atoms of the 2,2'-bipyridine moiety
   provide lone pairs for hydrogen bonding to water molecules present in
   solution. The aggregation strength of the homodimers of these model
   compounds is evaluated in terms of the aggregation energies, enthalpies,
   and Delta G(298), as well as the pi-pi interaction distances. Geometry
   optimization and thermochemistry analysis results show that the
   homodimers of both mono- and disubstituted compounds are stable and have
   a negative Delta G(298) of aggregation because of pi-pi stacking
   interactions. Two water bridges containing one, two, or three water
   molecules per bridge span between two monomers and provide additional
   stabilization of the homodimers because of hydrogen bonding. The
   stabilization of the monosubstituted homodimers is the largest with two
   water molecules per bridge, whereas the stabilization of the
   disubstituted homodimers is the largest with three water molecules per
   bridge. The calculated H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts
   for the monomers and dimers of the three model compounds of this series
   synthesized to date are in excellent agreement with experimental results
   for dilute and concentrated solutions in chloroform, respectively (Tan,
   X.; Fenniri, H.; Gray, M. R. Water enhances the aggregation of model
   asphaltenes in solution via hydrogen bonding. Energy Fuels 2009, 23,
   3687). The Delta H and Delta G(298) results show that hydrogen bonding
   is as important as pi-pi interactions for asphaltene aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{A novel visualization cell was designed to study the kinetics of bitumen
   liberation from oil sands. This novel visualization cell allows for
   direct observation of bitumen recession from sand grains in real time
   under various experimental conditions, thereby providing a better
   understanding of bitumen liberation and the critical role of process
   conditions in bitumen extraction from oil sands ores. Although direct
   recession of bitumen from sand grains is found to be the primary
   mechanism of bitumen liberation, the presence of entrained air in oil
   sands ores greatly enhances bitumen liberation via bitumen spreading
   over air bubbles. Imaging analysis of the recorded real-time bitumen
   liberation process allowed for quantitative analysis of bitumen
   liberation kinetics. A rapid bitumen recession and, consequently, high
   bitumen recovery were observed for a good processing ore, in contrast to
   a slower bitumen liberation and lower bitumen recovery for a high-fines
   ore, which was considered to be a poor processing ore. The weathering
   (aging) of good processing ore was found to significantly reduce bitumen
   liberation kinetics, leading to a lower bitumen recovery, even though
   the bitumen content and solids composition of the ore remained the same.
   These findings confirmed the critical role of bitumen liberation in
   bitumen extraction. Increasing the process water temperature was found
   to increase significantly bitumen liberation kinetics and led to a
   higher degree of bitumen liberation. While high pH facilitated bitumen
   liberation, the presence of excessive salts (16 000 ppm sodium) was
   found to be detrimental to bitumen liberation, in particular at high pH.
   The bitumen liberation study using this novel visualization cell was
   extremely valuable for identifying and understanding critical operating
   parameters that control bitumen liberation and, hence, ore
   processability, providing a scientific basis for designing breakthrough
   technology to improve processability of oil sands ores and reducing the
   environmental impact of oil sands development.}},

Abstract = {{Mining and processing of Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada, is a
   great success story of government industry collaboration, fulfilling
   increased domestic and worldwide demands for oil. However, economic and
   environmental incentives still exist in the oil sands industry to
   enhance oil recovery and reduce energy consumption and water use, while
   minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and tailings ponds. The current
   industrial bitumen extraction processes, after surface mining, are
   exclusively water-based and operate at elevated temperatures, typically
   between 45 and 50 degrees C. Robust low-temperature processes, with
   reduced in-take of feedwater, that are less sensitive to ore
   characteristics are in a strong demand from both environmental and
   economical point of views. In response to this demand, we propose a
   robust aqueous-nonaqueous hybrid bitumen extraction process, in which
   diluent such as kerosene and naphtha is added to the oil sands prior to
   oil sands slurry preparation to decrease bitumen viscosity and enhance
   bitumen liberation. With the proposed hybrid bitumen extraction process,
   the oil sand processing temperature can be reduced to ambient
   temperature. To prove this concept, bitumen recovery tests were carried
   out on four Athabasca oil sand ores of good to poor processability,
   using a Denver flotation cell operated at ambient temperature. Adding
   kerosene or naphtha to oil sands at 4-11 wt \% of the bitumen content
   was found to significantly enhance flotation recovery of bitumen and
   bitumen froth quality, especially for poor processing ores. It was found
   that kerosene addition not only increased bitumen liberation kinetics
   determined using our novel in situ bitumen liberation visualization flow
   cell (BLVFC) but also improved bitumen aeration measured by induction
   time apparatus.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a generalized robust nonlinear H-infinity filtering

   H-infinity filter guarantees asymptotic stability of the estimation
   error dynamics with prespecified disturbance attenuation level and is
   robust against time-varying parametric uncertainties as well as
   Lipschitz nonlinear additive uncertainty. Explicit bound on the
   tolerable nonlinear uncertainty is derived based on a norm-wise

Abstract = {{By virtue of its ease of operation compared with its conventional manual
   counterpart, automatic transmissions are commonly used as automotive
   power transmission control system in today's passenger cars. In
   accordance with this trend, research efforts on closed-loop automatic
   transmission controls have been extensively carried out to improve ride
   quality and fuel economy. State-of-the-art power transmission control
   algorithms may have limitations in performance because they rely on the
   steady-state characteristics of the hydraulic actuator rather than fully
   exploit its dynamic characteristics. Since the ultimate viability of
   closed-loop power transmission control is dominated by precise pressure
   control at the level of hydraulic actuator, closed-loop control can
   potentially attain superior efficacy in case the hydraulic actuator can
   be easily incorporated into model-based observer/controller design. In
   this paper, we propose to use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to
   establish a nonlinear empirical model of a cascade hydraulic actuator in

Abstract = {{The architectures of gene delivery vectors, in addition to their
   molecular weights and compositions, can play a critical role in DNA
   condensation and hence on their gene expression. In general, branched
   polymers are superior gene delivery vectors as compared to their linear
   analogs. This study reports the efficacy of cationic hyperbranched
   glycopolymers for DNA condensation and gene expression. Hyperbranched
   glycopolymers of varying molecular weights and compositions are
   synthesized via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)
   process and are further explored for their gene expression in vitro.
   Galactose-based hyperbranched polymers are compared to glucose-derived
   hyperbranched polymers for their cellular uptake, toxicity and gene
   expression. It is found that molecular weight of hyperbranched polymers,
   and carbohydrate content of copolymers are critical factors in
   determining the gene expression as well as in imparting the specificity
   to these novel gene delivery vectors. The galactose-based hyperbranched
   glycopolymer of similar to 30 kDa or lower show improved gene expression
   at varying polymer/plasmid ratios. The incubation of hyperbranched
   polyplexes in the presence of serum protein show the presence of stable
   particles and gene expression of these hyperbranched polyplexes is
   unaffected in the presence of serum proteins. Furthermore, the cellular
   uptake and gene expression are studied in two different cell lines in
   the presence of lectins. It is found that polyplexes-lectin conjugates
   show enhanced cellular uptake in vitro, however their gene expression is
   cell line and lectin type dependent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To evaluate the unitary integrals, such as the well-known
   Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integral, character expansions were
   developed by Balantekin, where the matrix integrand is a group member;
   i.e., a square matrix with a nonzero determinant. Recently, this method
   has been exploited to derive the joint eigenvalue distributions of the
   Wishart matrices; i.e., where is the complex Gaussian random channel
   matrix of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The joint
   eigenvalue distributions are used to calculate the moment generating
   function of the mutual information (ergodic capacity) of a MIMO channel.
   In this paper, we show that the previous integration framework presented
   in the literature is not correct, and results in incorrect joint
   eigenvalue distributions for the Ricean and full-correlated Rayleigh
   MIMO channels. We develop a new framework to apply the character
   expansions for integrations over the unitary group, involving general
   rectangular complex matrices in the integrand. We derive the correct
   distribution functions and use them to obtain the capacity of the Ricean
   and correlated Rayleigh MIMO systems in a unified and straightforward
   approach. The integration technique proposed in this paper is general
   enough to be used for other unitary integrals in engineering,
   mathematics, and physics.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that most construction materials behave
   differently under static and dynamic loading. However, the literature on
   the time-dependent response of masonry joints is scarce, particularly
   with regard to the bond behaviour in historical stone masonry. This
   paper describes the dynamic response of sandstone masonry units bound
   with hydraulic lime mortars (HLMs). A drop weight impact machine was
   used to generate stress rates up to 10 7 kPa/s. The dynamic impact
   factor and stress rate sensitivity were evaluated for the flexural
   strength of the sandstone, mortar and for the bond strength of the unit
   and further, the pattern of failure was noted in the units for each
   mortar mix and loading rate. Based on a related study on the fracture
   toughness of HLM, polypropylene micro-fibres were incorporated at 0,
   0.25 and 0.5\% volume fraction into the mortar. Results show that the
   flexural bond strength was more sensitive to stress rate than the
   flexural strength of the mortar, at similar rates of loading. Further,
   the stress rate sensitivity of the bond strength decreased with an
   increase in the fibre content. Also, whereas the mode of failure in the
   masonry units under quasi-static loading was through fracture at the
   mortar-block interface, the failure plane transferred to within the
   mortar under dynamic loading, particularly in the presence of fibre
   reinforcement.}},

Abstract = {{The potential hydrologic impact of climatic change on three sub-basins
   of the South Saskatchewan River Basin (SSRB) within Alberta, namely,
   Oldman, Bow and Red Deer River basins was investigated using the
   Modified Interactions Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere (MISBA) land surface
   scheme of Kerkhoven and Gan (Advances in Water Resources 29:808-826
   2006). The European Centre for Mid-range Weather Forecasts global
   re-analysis (ERA-40) climate data, Digital Elevation Model of the
   National Water Research Institute, land cover data and a priori soil
   parameters from the Ecoclimap global data set were used to drive MISBA
   to simulate the runoff of SSRB. Four SRES scenarios (A21, A1FI, B21 and
   B11) of four General Circulation Models (CCSRNIES, CGCM2, ECHAM4 and
   HadCM3) of IPCC were used to adjust climate data of the 1961-1990 base
   period (climate normal) to study the effect of climate change on SSRB
   over three 30-year time periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2099). The
   model results of MISBA forced under various climate change projections
   of the four GCMs with respect to the 1961-1990 normal show that SSRB is
   expected to experience a decrease in future streamflow and snow water
   equivalent, and an earlier onset of spring runoff despite of projected
   increasing trends in precipitation over the 21st century. Apparently the
   projected increase in evaporation loss due to a warmer climate over the
   21st century will offset the projected precipitation increase, leading
   to an overall decreasing trend in the basin runoff of SSRB. Finally, a
   Gamma probability distribution function was fitted to the mean annual
   maximum flow and mean annual mean flow data simulated for the Oldman,
   Bow and Red Deer River Basins by MISBA to statistically quantify the
   possible range of uncertainties associated with SRES climate scenarios
   projected by the four GCMs selected for this study.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of estimating the parameters of a moving target in
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is considered and a new
   approach for estimating the moving target parameters by making use of
   the phase information associated with each transmit-receive path is
   introduced. It is required for this technique that different receive
   antennas have the same time reference, but no synchronization of initial
   phases of the receive antennas is needed and, therefore, the estimation
   process is noncoherent. We model the target motion within a certain
   processing interval as a polynomial of general order. The first three
   coefficients of such a polynomial correspond to the initial location,
   velocity, and acceleration of the target, respectively. A new maximum
   likelihood (ML) technique for estimating the target motion coefficients
   is developed. It is shown that the considered ML problem can be
   interpreted as the classic ``overdetermined{''} nonlinear least-squares
   problem. The proposed ML estimator requires multidimensional search over
   the unknown polynomial coefficients. The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the
   proposed parameter estimation problem is derived. The performance of the
   proposed estimator is validated by simulation results and is shown to
   achieve the CRB.}},

Title = {{Fault detection of planetary gearboxes using new diagnostic parameters}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Planetary gearboxes are commonly used in modern industry because of
   their large transmission ratio and strong load-bearing capacity. They
   generally work under heavy load and tough working environment and
   therefore their key components including sun gear, planet gears, ring
   gear, etc are subject to severe pitting and fatigue crack. Planetary
   gearboxes significantly differ from fixed-axis gearboxes and exhibit
   unique behavior, which invalidates the use of the diagnostic parameters
   developed and suitable for fixed-axis gearboxes. Therefore, there is a
   need to develop parameters specifically for detecting and diagnosing
   faults of planetary gearboxes. In this study, two diagnostic parameters
   are proposed based on the examination of the vibration characteristics
   of planetary gearboxes in both time and frequency domains. One is the
   root mean square of the filtered signal (FRMS) and the other is the
   normalized summation of positive amplitudes of the difference spectrum
   between the unknown signal and the healthy signal (NSDS). To test the
   proposed diagnostic parameters, we conducted experiments on a planetary
   gearbox test rig with sun gear faults including a cracked tooth and a
   pitted tooth. The vibration signals were measured under different motor
   speeds. The proposed parameters are compared with the existing
   parameters reported in the literature. The comparison results show the
   proposed diagnostic parameters perform better than others.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of a gasliquid stirred reactor including bubble breakage and
   coalescence were performed. The filtered conservation equations for the

   Lagrangian approach with a bubble parcel concept was used for the

   stochastic events. Additional assumptions for bubble breakup modeling in
   an EulerLagrange framework were proposed. The action of the reactor
   components on the liquid flow field was described using an immersed
   boundary condition. The predicted number-based mean diameter and
   long-term averaged liquid velocity components agree qualitatively and
   quantitatively well with experimental data for a laboratory-scale
   gasliquid stirred reactor with dilute dispersion. Effects of the
   presence of bubbles, as well as the increase in the gas flow rate, on
   the hydrodynamics were numerically studied. The modeling technique
   offers an alternative engineering tool to gain detailed insights into

Abstract = {{An electromagnetic valvetrain for an internal combustion engine can
   improve the engine thermal efficiency but requires soft landing control
   to avoid excessive wear and acoustic noise. To simplify the soft landing
   problem, the valve control algorithm is partitioned into approach and
   landing controllers. The landing control is responsible for the last
   part of the 8 mm valve travel while the approach control is responsible
   for the rest. This paper focuses on the approach control. The goal of
   the approach control is to achieve an end state that sets constant
   initial conditions for the landing control. In addition to an identified
   system model, information based on previous valve events is utilized to
   take advantage of the repetitive nature of the valve opening/closing.
   Nonlinear iterative learning, terminal iterative learning, and Nelder
   Mead direct search algorithms are three cyclic adaptive feedforward
   approach controllers that are tested in simulation for automotive
   electromagnetic valves. These results are compared but the emphasis of
   this paper is on the Nelder Mead approach which works well both in
   simulation and experiment for disturbances that are slow compared to the
   valve travel time.}},

Abstract = {{Linz Donawitz converter gas (LDG) is one of the most important sources
   of fuel energy in steel industry, whose reasonable use plays a crucial
   role in energy saving and environment protection. In practice, online
   prediction of variation of gas holder level and gas demand by users is

   a least square support vector machine-based prediction model combined
   with the parallel strategies is proposed, in which parameter
   optimization is realized online by a parallel particle swarm
   optimization and a parallelized validation method, both being
   implemented with the use of a graphic processing unit. The experiments
   demonstrate that the online parameter optimization based model greatly
   improves the prediction quality compared to the version with the fixed
   modeling parameters. Furthermore, the parallelized strategies largely
   reduce the computational cost thus guaranteeing the real-time
   effectiveness of the practical application.}},

Abstract = {{Using cylindrical specimens with short gauge length, bulk cavitation is
   successfully generated in high-density polyethylene copolymers (HDPE)
   under tensile loading. The bulk cavitation is generated without the
   presence of sharp notch, and therefore, crack growth is not involved in
   the rupture process. The bulk cavitation is investigated in two types of
   HDPE that have different molecular characteristics. Test results
   indicate that bulk cavitation can be introduced in both the types of
   HDPE, for which the loading level is most easily identified using plots
   of true axial stress versus stroke. The main difference in the rupture
   process occurs during the postcavitation stretch. Using specimens of
   sufficiently long gauge length, constitutive equations for the HDPEs are
   determined and applied to finite element modeling of specimens with
   short gauge length. The results show that the hydrostatic stress level
   in specimens of short gauge length is about twice as high as that in
   specimens of long gauge length, supporting the conclusion on bulk
   cavitation from rubber testing. For HDPE, this study shows that the rise
   of hydrostatic stress level leads to the suppression of necking, to
   allow the bulk cavitation to dominate the deformation process. POLYM.

   acrylic are proven to be the most efficient coatings, which cause a
   reduction the chloride penetration and enhance the service life of
   concrete structures. However, performance of surface coatings is
   time-dependent and coated concretes must be recoated with distinct

Abstract = {{Phthalate plasticizers are used in the plastics industry to aid in
   processing and impart flexibility to plastics. Due to the broad use of
   plastics, and the tendency of plasticizers to leach out of polymers,
   plasticizers have become ubiquitous in the environment. Concerns about
   the testicular toxicity of phthalate plasticizers, in particular
   di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), have arisen due to their ability to
   cause male reproductive tract abnormalities in animal models. It has
   been assumed that the DEHP metabolite, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
   (MEHP), is the active compound, however, metabolites such as
   2-ethylhexanol, 2-ethylhexanal and 2-ethylhexanoic acid, have not been
   thoroughly investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   anti-androgenic potential of these metabolites in vitro with a mouse
   Leydig tumor cell line, MA-10 cells. DEHP, MEHP and 2-ethylhexanal were
   found to decrease cell viability, as well as steroidogenic potential.
   The latter was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) to quantify steroid production and quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to assess gene expression analysis
   of key steroidogenic enzymes. 2-Ethylhexanal proved to be the most
   potent steroidogenic disruptor, offering intriguing implications in the
   search for the mechanism of phthalate testicular toxicity. Overall, the
   study suggests the involvement of multiple active metabolites in the
   testicular toxicity of DEHP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The delivery of nucleic acid molecules into cells to alter physiological
   functions at the genetic level is a powerful approach to treat a wide
   range of inherited and acquired disorders. Biocompatible materials such
   as cationic polymers, lipids, and peptides are being explored as safer
   alternatives to viral gene carriers. However, the comparatively low
   efficiency of nonviral carriers currently hampers their translation into
   clinical settings. Controlling the size and stability of carrier/nucleic
   acid complexes is one of the primary hurdles as the physicochemical
   properties of the complexes can define the uptake pathways, which
   dictate intracellular routing, endosomal processing, and
   nucleocytoplasmic transport. In addition to nuclear import, subnuclear
   trafficking, posttranscriptional events, and immune responses can
   further limit transfection efficiency. Chemical moieties, reactive
   linkers or signal peptide have been conjugated to carriers to prevent
   aggregation, induce membrane destabilization and localize to subcellular
   compartments. Genetic elements can be inserted into the expression
   cassette to facilitate nuclear targeting, delimit expression to targeted
   tissue, and modulate transgene expression. The modular option afforded
   by both gene carriers and expression cassettes provides a two-tier
   multicomponent delivery system that can be optimized for targeted gene
   delivery in a variety of settings.}},

   (alistaple). Mica was used as the background substrate to act as an
   internal standard. This study's findings suggest that adhesion is not
   the same for all CNCs. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force
   microscopy were used to determine the size and shape of each CNC. The
   experimental quantitative data showed that adhesion between CNCs and the
   Si tip has a close correlation with the diameter of the CNCs. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of sulfate groups on
   the surface of the CNCs and a correlation between adhesion and surface

Abstract = {{Effect of artificial weathering on the wood surface color modifications
   of three North American species (jack pine, aspen, and birch)
   heat-treated under different temperatures was studied by
   spectrocolorimetric colormeter (datacolor, CHECK TM). Data was analyzed
   using the reflectance spectra (400-700 nm) as well as the
   CIE-L{*}a{*}b{*} system and Delta E. Kubelka-Munk (K-M) spectra of
   samples were recorded as a function of artificial weathering time to
   obtain the absorption maxima of the chromophore woods formed during
   artificial weathering. The results were compared with those of the
   respective untreated (Kiln-dried) species. Analysis of chemical
   components shows that the lignin percent of jack pine, aspen, and birch
   increased after heat treatment (28.66-35.9\%, 20.27-26.41\%, and
   19.04-22.71\% respectively) which might be due to smaller influence of
   heat treatment on lignin content than hemicelluloses. This improves the
   resistance of heat-treated wood to photo-degradation. This is also
   supported by the smaller change observed in K-M spectra and total color
   parameters in CIE-L{*}a{*}b{*} system of heat-treated wood samples
   compared to those of untreated wood when weathered for72 h. However, the
   lignin percent of heat-treated woods reduce to maximum 2.5\% after
   artificial weathering of 1512 h. This suggests that the weathering
   degrades most lignin matrix; consequently, both the colors of
   heat-treated woods and untreated woods are lighter and very similar
   after a long period of artificial weathering. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Abstract = {{We study the neutrality of circular inclusions with single or multiple

   which the stress field in the surrounding matrix is the same as for a
   matrix containing no inclusions. For a three-phase structure, in which
   the asymptotic behavior of the harmonic materials obeys a constitutive
   restriction proposed by Knowles and Sternberg (1975) and the material
   parameter beta is constant, we identify a critical value of the coating
   thickness parameter, above which the coated inclusion is neutral with
   respect to four different hydrostatic loading states, and at or below
   which the coated inclusion is neutral to only two different hydrostatic

Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands coke can be a suitable precursor for activated carbon based on
   its high carbonaceous content. This paper presents the results of a
   novel method that uses microwave heating, KOH, and humidified nitrogen
   to activate oil sands coke in a short duration. Compared to the raw
   coke, both delayed and fluid cokes had larger surface areas and higher
   adsorption capacities after 10 min of microwave-assisted activation.
   Compared to activated fluid coke, activated delayed coke had a higher
   iodine number (1129 mg/g vs. 517 mg/g), specific surface area (1131
   m(2)/g vs. 440 m(2)/g), and larger total pore volume (0.4795 cm(3)/g vs.
   0.2247 cm(3)/g) and micropore volume (0.4224 cm(3)/g vs. 0.1405 cm(3)/g)
   because of the structural difference between the two cokes. The
   activated coke was able to effectively adsorb water vapor and acetone.
   The short activation time and simplicity of the activation process
   demonstrate that microwave-assisted activation is a promising method to
   convert the oil sands coke into a useful adsorbent with high adsorption
   capacity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An early determination of toxicant compounds of water contaminations can
   gain critical time to protect citizens' health and save substantial
   amounts of medical costs. To determine toxins in real time, a multi-dose
   classification algorithm using cellular state variable identification
   (CSVID) is developed in this paper. First, the dynamic cytotoxicity
   response profiles of living cells are measured using a real-time cell
   electronic sensing (RT-CES) system. Changes in cell number expressed as
   cell index (Cl) are recorded on-line as time series. Then CSVID, which
   reflects the cell killing, cell lysis and certain cellular pathological
   changes, is extracted from those dynamic cellular responses. Finally, a
   support vector machine (SVM) algorithm based on CSVID is employed to
   classify chemical compounds and determine their analogous cellular
   response pathway. In order to increase the classification accuracy, a
   majority vote of the class labels is also proposed. Several validation
   studies demonstrate that CSVID-based classification algorithm has great
   potential in distinguishing the cytotoxicity response of the cells in
   the presence of toxins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel interfacially active and magnetically responsive nanoparticle is
   designed and prepared by direct grafting of bromoesterified ethyl
   cellulose (EC-Br) onto the surface of amino-functionalized magnetite
   (Fe3O4) nanoparticles. Due to its strong interfacial activity, ethyl
   cellulose (EC) on the magnetic nanoparticles enables the EC-grafted
   Fe3O4 (M-EC) nanoparticles to be interfacially active. The grafting of
   interfacially active polymer EC on magnetic nanoparticles is confirmed
   by zeta-potential measurements, diffuse reflectance infrared
   Fourier-transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) characterization, and
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
   images show a negligible increase in particle size, confirming the thin
   silica coating and grafted EC layer. The magnetization measurements show
   a marginal reduction in saturation magnetization by silica coating and
   EC grafting of original magnetic nanoparticles, confirming the presence
   of coatings. The M-EC nanoparticles prepared in this study show
   excellent interfacial activity and highly ordered features at the
   oil/water interface, as confirmed using the LangmuirBlodgett technique
   and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The magnetic properties of M-EC
   nanoparticles at the oil/water interface make the interfacial properties
   tunable by or responsive to an external magnetic field. The occupancy of
   M-EC at the oil/water interface allows rapid separation of the water
   droplets from emulsions by an external magnetic field, demonstrating
   enhanced coalescence of magnetically tagged stable water droplets and a
   reduced overall volume fraction of the sludge.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we delineate the consequences of electrokinetic

   interface on the dynamics of particles suspended inside the drop. We
   show that the simultaneous considerations of streaming potential and
   flow-actuation-mechanism-independent description of the evaporation flux
   and the depth average velocities result in an enhanced induced radial
   pressure gradient. As a result, the deposition speed of the particles in
   the disordered packing regime, occurring at the end of the lifetime of
   the drop {[}Marin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 085502 (2011)], is
   greatly enhanced. This, in turn, is likely to signify an augmented

Abstract = {{Tungsten carbide-based electrodes under mixed hydrogen-methane and
   methane fuels have been investigated as potential anode materials for
   solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) application. Firstly, it was shown that
   hydrogen is not a suitable fuel for the carbide-based materials. A
   conventional WC-YSZ composite and a carbide infiltrated porous YSZ
   support were then studied. Ac impedance spectroscopy revealed that the
   ohmic resistance and the charge-transfer polarization of these cells
   were reasonably low. The chemical reaction polarization, however, was
   relatively large, particularly under methane fuel. The carbide-based
   electrodes were then modified by incorporation of ceria and/or
   ruthenium. Not only did the co-existence of CeO2 and Ru synergically
   enhance the cell performance, more importantly it also greatly improved
   the stability of the polarized cell. Although bulk phase analysis
   confirmed the presence of a minor amount of tungsten oxide, surface
   analysis showed that the oxide phase remained superficial. It was then
   proposed that surface oxidation of the carbide phase was essentially a
   part of the fuel oxidation process and, as long as the rate of carbide
   oxidation and that of oxide recarburization remained comparable, the
   cell performance was stable. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of exposure to oil sands process-affected water from

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1662-1672}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Effective detoxification of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) is
   one issue associated with bitumen extraction in the Alberta oil sands.
   It has been suggested that reclamation ponds can be used to passively
   treat OSPW, potentially allowing for its safe return to the environment.
   In this study, OSPW was sampled in two batches (A and B) from the
   Syncrude Canada Ltd. West In-Pit (WIP) settling pond and from three
   experimental reclamation ponds - Big Pit, FE5, and TPW. Acute (10 d) and
   chronic (until adult emergence) exposures of Chironomus dilutus larvae
   to OSPW were conducted and survival, growth, development, and behavior
   were assessed. Masses of larvae exposed to WIP-OSPW were 64-77\% less
   than the freshwater control (p < 0.001). Similarly, chronic exposure to
   WIP-OSPW resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) less pupation than in the
   freshwater control, with 31\% (A) and 71\% (B) less pupation of larvae
   exposed to WIP-OSPW. Rates of emergence were significantly less for
   larvae exposed to WIP-OSPW, with only 13\% (A) and 8\% (B) of larvae
   emerging as adults when exposed to WIP-OSPW, compared to 81\% in the
   freshwater control (p < 0.0001). Pupation and emergence rates were
   significantly less in TPW than freshwater control (p < 0.05), but there
   were no differences observed in Big Pit or FE5. Lesser toxicity was
   observed in reclaimed OSPW compared to fresh OSPW and this coincided
   with lesser concentrations of NAs. The results presented are consistent
   with the hypothesis that an organic fraction is the cause of the
   toxicity of OSPW toward C. dilutus and that OSPW aged in reclamation
   ponds retains toxicity and therefore, more aggressive, targeted
   treatment of OSPW is required to accelerate decreases. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{258}},
Number = {{13}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that there is an increased
   sensitivity for detecting and measuring disease biomarkers (such as
   human cardiac troponin I, cTnI) by a decrease of nonspecific adsorption
   in diluted self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on planar sputtered gold
   films. Combining grazing angle Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR) and antibody-antigen-antibody (sandwich) fluorescence-based
   immunoassay, we examined the relationship of sensitivity, specificity of
   detection of cTnI and the level of nonspecific protein adsorption in the
   following SAMs: pure MHA (16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid, 1 mM, with head
   COO-, x = 1.0), a mixed SAM comprising MHA (0.1 mM) and UDT (1-undecane
   thiol, 0.9 mM, with hydrophobic head CH3, x = 0.1(UDT)), and a mixed SAM
   comprising MHA (0.1 mM) and MUD (11-mercapto-1-undecanol, 0.9 mM, with
   hydrophilic head OH, x = 0.1(MUD)). Our data revealed that nonspecific
   binding to SAMs is favored in the following order: CH3 > COO- > OH,
   consistent with previous studies. Compared with pure SAMs, diluting MHA
   SAMs with MUD increases the sensitivity of cTnI, whereas diluted MHA
   SAMs with UDT has the same sensitivity of detection of cTnI, suggesting
   it is the nature of the second diluting thiol that plays an important
   role on the amount of adsorbed protein on the surface. We obtained a
   10-fold increase in the limit of detection of cTnI to 10 ng/ml using x =
   0.1(MUD) due to a decrease of nonspecific binding. Further, specific
   binding between the antigen cTnI and its antibody is unaltered on pure
   and diluted SAMs. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fuzzy logic-based generalized decision theory with imperfect information}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{18-42}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The existing decision models have been successfully applied to solving
   many decision problems in management, business, economics and other
   fields, but nowadays arises a need to develop more realistic decision
   models. The main drawback of the existing utility theories starting from
   von Neumann-Moregnstern expected utility to the advanced non-expected
   models is that they are designed for laboratory examples with simple,
   well-defined gambles which do not adequately enough reflect real
   decision situations. In real-life decision making problems preferences
   are vague and decision-relevant information is imperfect as described in
   natural language (NL). Vagueness of preferences and imperfect decision
   relevant information require using suitable utility model which would be
   fundamentally different to the existing precise utility models. Precise
   utility models cannot reflect vagueness of preferences, vagueness of
   objective conditions and outcomes, imprecise beliefs, etc. The time has
   come for a new generation of decision theories. In this study, we
   propose a decision theory, which is capable to deal with vague
   preferences and imperfect information. The theory discussed here is
   based on a fuzzy-valued non-expected utility model representing
   linguistic preference relations and imprecise beliefs. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The steady-state shear and linear viscoelastic deformations of
   semidilute suspensions of rod-shaped nanocrystalline cellulose (NOG)
   particles in 1.0\% hydroxyethyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose
   solutions were investigated. Addition of NCC at the onset of semidilute
   suspension concentration significantly altered the rheological and
   linear viscoelastic properties of semidilute polymer solutions. The
   low-shear viscosity values of polymers solutions were increased 20-490
   times (depending on polymer molecular weight and functional groups) by
   the presence of NCC. NCC suspensions in polymer solutions exhibited
   yield stresses up to 7.12 Pa. Viscoelasticity measurements also showed
   that NCC suspended polymer solutions had higher linear elastic moduli
   than the loss moduli. All of those results revealed the gel formation of
   NCC particles and presence of internal structures. The formation of a
   weak gel structure was due to the nonadsorbing macromolecules which
   caused the depletion-induced interaction among NCC particles. A simple
   interaction energy model was used to show successfully the flocculation
   of NCC particles in the presence of nonadsorbing polymers. The model is
   based on the incorporation of the depletion interaction term between two
   parallel plates into the DLVO theory for cubic prismatic rod shaped NCC
   particles.}},

Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{The counter diffusive reactor containing a catalyst supported on a fibre
   pad is often used as a radiant heater. Fuel fed from the inlet of the
   pad is combusted by oxygen diffusing from the reactor exit. This paper
   describes the development of a two dimensional model of this heater with
   methane as the fuel. The detailed transport equations are solved using
   the finite element method. The correct implementation of the boundary
   conditions is emphasized. The effects of external mass transfer,
   reaction rate and feed flow rate on the reactor performance are studied.
   Comparisons are made to experimental results obtained in an earlier
   investigation. It is shown that the primary limiting step that controls
   the conversion of fuel is the rate of mass transfer of oxygen through
   the boundary layer that develops in front of the reactor. Combustion
   efficiencies approaching 100\% can be achieved at sufficiently high
   rates of reaction. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effect of adsorption and regeneration
   temperature on the irreversible adsorption of a mixture of organic
   compounds typically emitted from automobile painting operations.
   Adsorption of the organic vapors mixture onto microporous beaded
   activated carbon (BAC) and regeneration of the saturated BAC were
   completed under different conditions. Results indicated that increasing
   the adsorption temperature from 25 to 35 or 45 degrees C increased heel
   buildup on BAC by about 30\% irrespective of the regeneration
   temperature due to chemisorption. The adsorption capacity (for the first
   cycle) of the mixture onto the BAC at these three temperatures remained
   almost unchanged indicating chemisorption of some of these compounds
   onto the BAC. Increasing the regeneration temperature from 288 to 400
   degrees C resulted in 61\% reduction in the heel at all adsorption
   temperatures, possibly due to desorption of chemicals from narrow
   micropores. BET area and pore volumes of the BAC decreased
   proportionally to the cumulative heel. Pore size distribution and pore
   volume reduction confirmed that the heel was mainly built up in narrow
   micropores which can be occupied or blocked by some of the adsorbates.}},

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with parameter estimation of a special class of
   switched linear systems (SLSs), namely, periodically switched linear

   output (I/O) data sequences and then establish the connection between
   the periodicity and I/O data sequence. This allows us to obtain an
   accurate estimation of the switching sequence period p(0). We prove that
   the correctness of data classification is almost surely guaranteed. In
   implementation, we propose two efficient strategies, namely, the reverse
   order search and finite data selection, to improve the computational
   efficiency. Moreover, we provide both offline and online methods to
   estimate p(0) and the parameters. The effectiveness of these methods are
   demonstrated in simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Rotary comb-drive electrostatic actuators with smooth vertical sidewalls
   were designed and fabricated for photonic applications. Silicon on
   insulator wafers with device layer thicknesses of up to 100 mu m and
   oxide layers of 1 to 2 mu m were used. Structures were fabricated
   through bulk micromachining of the handle layer, followed by removal of
   the buried oxide. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of the device layer
   defined the comb structure with simultaneous release of the movable arm.
   Thick photoresist and oxide masking layers were used for the high aspect
   ratio deep etches. Notching effects or depth variations of device layers
   were not observed. Etch/passivation cycles in DRIE were optimized to
   obtain smooth sidewalls of less than 5 nm roughness. Traces of etch
   scallops were confined only to the first few microns of the top and
   bottom edges of the reflecting sidewall. A movable arm length of 2 mm
   with a maximum rotation of 2.8 deg was achieved. The edge deflection was
   over 100 mu m at 100 V. The fabricated structure provides a long
   reflecting sidewall, that is accessible for hybrid integration, in three
   dimensional space. The fabricated structures can be reliably operated in
   the kilohertz range. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{To make realistic maintenance decisions, it is important that
   maintenance managers make their preventive replacement decisions based
   on observations of the condition of their equipment. This study
   addresses a condition- and age-based replacement decision problem using
   the complete history of measured condition observations to minimize
   long-run average cost, maximize long-run average availability, or both.
   A stochastic filtering process (SFP) is used to estimate the residual
   lifetime distribution conditional on the history of observed condition
   information. A long-run average cost model and a long-run average
   availability model are analysed in order to determine the theorems
   necessary for calculating the optimum replacement time. To minimize the
   cost and maximize availability, a multiobjective decision frontier is
   proposed that will help maintenance managers deal with trade-offs
   between the two objectives. Finally, numerical examples are presented
   for each scenario to show the effectiveness of the methods proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a univariate alarm system can be assessed in many
   cases by three indices, namely, the false alarm rate (FAR), missed alarm
   rate (MAR), and averaged alarm delay (AAD). First, this paper studies
   the definition and computation of the FAR, MAR, and AAD for the basic
   mechanism of alarm generation solely based on a trip point, and for the
   advanced mechanism of alarm generation by exploiting alarm on/off
   delays. Second, a systematic design of alarm systems is investigated
   based on the three performance indices and the tradeoffs among them. The
   computation of FAR, MAR, and AAD and the design of alarm systems require
   the probability density functions (PDFs) of the univariate process
   variable in the normal and abnormal conditions. Thus, a new method based
   on mean change detection is proposed to estimate the two PDFs. Numerical
   examples and an industrial case study are provided to validate the
   obtained theoretical results on the FAR, MAR and AAD, and to illustrate
   the proposed performance assessment and alarm system design procedures.
   Note to Practitioners-Alarm systems are critically important to the
   safety and efficient operation of modern industrial plants, whose
   operations are monitored by continuous measurements of various signals.
   However, industrial surveys have shown that operators of industrial
   plants receive far more alarms, many of which belong to nuisance alarms,
   than they can handle. Relieving this problem is based upon a
   satisfactory performance of the alarm system for each univariate signal
   involved in the operation of industrial plants. This paper studies the
   performance assessment and design of univariate alarm systems for basic
   mechanism of alarm generation and for advanced one exploiting alarm
   on/off delays. The obtained results are applicable to various industrial
   plants including power, chemical, and petrochemical plants.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Concrete produced using a magnesium phosphate binder can exhibit faster
   strength gain and result in lower overall environmental impacts than
   concretes produced with Portland cement binders. This paper reports a
   study to develop and characterize the rheological and mechanical
   properties of lightweight ceramic concretes (LWCC) that use a magnesium
   potassium phosphate binder. The aggregate type and the overall mix
   composition were primary variables in the study. Aggregate types
   included expanded clay, expanded slate, and expanded shale. Crushed
   bottom ash aggregate from a local coal-fired thermal generating station
   was also used. The aggregates of a given material varied by size
   fraction and by surface characteristics in some cases. The test results
   showed that increases in the water/binder ratio increased the slump flow
   but had negligible influence on the setting time. The compressive
   strength and density of the LWCCs both decreased with increases in the
   aggregate/binder mass ratio and the water/binder ratio, regardless of
   the type of lightweight aggregate. The 28 day compressive strength and
   density ranged from 17 to 36 MPa and 1600 to 1870 kg/m(3) respectively.
   Regardless of the aggregate type, increasing the water/binder ratio also
   reduced the elastic modulus, modulus of rupture and direct shear
   strengths. Relationships were developed to directly relate these
   mechanical properties to the corresponding compressive strengths. The
   results indicate that LWCCs using a magnesium phosphate binder and
   lightweight aggregates can be formulated with rheological and mechanical
   properties suitable for structural applications.}},

Abstract = {{This protocol outlines steps for optimizing the transfection of adherent
   primary mammalian cells using the readily available off-the-shelf
   cationic polymer, 25-kDa branched polyethylenimine (bPEI25).
   Transfection efficiency of cationic polymers varies among cell lines and
   is highly dependent on the conditions and environment in which complexes
   are formed. Factors requiring optimization include the salt
   concentration, volume, incubation time, mixing order and ratio of
   polymer to DNA. In this transfection protocol, complexes are prepared in
   30 min, with analysis 24 h later; thus, experiments can be completed in
   2 d. In this protocol, as an example, we describe the parameters we have
   optimized for the transfection of bone marrow stromal cells and normal
   human foreskin fibroblasts. By using this protocol, we have obtained
   transfection efficiencies comparable to lipofection. An appropriately
   optimized protocol enhances the utility of cationic polymers in
   transfecting mammalian cells, thereby providing an effective alternative
   to expensive commercial reagents.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a design for the specific class of transverse electromagnetic
   (TEM) horn that can effectively radiate the electromagnetic signals into
   soil or concrete. The designed horn antenna has the same aperture height
   and width, resulting in a square-shaped horn aperture. A design
   guideline for the horn that considers return loss and radiation
   performance is described in this paper. The proposed TEM horn is
   constructed and measured to validate the design. The constructed horn
   has a maximum dimension (including the balun) of 42.9 x 26.8 x 20 cm.
   Simulated and measured results suggest that the proposed horn is more
   effective in radiating electromagnetic energy into concrete, compared
   with existing TEM horn designs. For free space radiation, measured
   operating bandwidth of the horn is 0.75-12.0 GHz, with a gain of 3-13
   dBi. When radiated into a concrete block, measured operating bandwidth

Abstract = {{Interest in biomass as a renewable energy source has increased recently
   in response to a need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The
   objective of this study is to develop a multi-criteria assessment model
   and rank different biomass feedstock-based pellets, in terms of their
   suitability for use in large heat and power generation plants and show
   the importance of environmental, economical and technical factors in
   making decision about different pellets. Five pellet alternatives, each
   produced from a different sustainable biomass feedstock i.e., wood,
   straw, switchgrass, alfalfa and poultry litter, are ranked according to
   eleven criteria, using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for
   Enrichment and Evaluation (PROMETHEE). Both quantitative and qualitative
   criteria are considered, including environmental, technical and economic
   factors. Three scenarios, namely base case, environmental and economic,
   are developed by changing the weight assigned to different criteria. In
   the base case scenario, equal weights are assigned to each criterion. In
   the economic and environmental scenarios, more weight is given to the
   economic and environmental factors, respectively. Based on the PROMETHEE
   rankings, wood pellets are the best source of energy for all scenarios
   followed by switchgrass, straw, poultry litter and alfalfa pellets
   except economic scenario, where straw pellets held higher position than
   switchgrass pellets. Sensitivity analysis on weights, threshold values,
   preference function and production cost indicate that the ranking was
   stable. The ranking in all scenarios remained same when qualitative
   criteria were omitted from the model; this indicates the stronger
   influence of quantitative criteria. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The interharmonic group concept adopted by the IEC 61000-4-7 is very
   useful for addressing the need to monitor interharmonics in power
   systems. This paper shows that grouping spectral bins into
   interharmonics and harmonic components of 5 Hz resolution could yield
   misleading information for cases where an interharmonic component's
   frequency is very close to a harmonic frequency. Since interharmonics in
   such cases can cause more severe waveform modulation, the interharmonic
   grouping scheme needs to be improved. A signal-processing method that
   can separate interharmonic and harmonic components in close proximity
   is, therefore, proposed in this paper to address this need. The method

Title = {{Mechanics of Heavy-Oil and Bitumen Recovery by Hot Solvent Injection}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{182-194}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In earlier work (Pathak et al. 2010, 2011), we presented the initial
   results for heavy-oil and bitumen recovery using heated solvent vapors.
   The heavy-oil- and bitumen-saturated sandpack samples of different
   heights were exposed to heated vapors of butane or propane at a constant
   temperature and pressure for an extended duration of time. The produced
   oil was analyzed for recovery, asphaltene content, viscosity,
   composition, and refractive index. Recovery was found to be very
   sensitive to temperature and pressure.
   The current work was undertaken to better understand the physics of the
   process and to explain the observations of the earlier experiments using
   additional experiments on tighter samples of different sizes, numerical
   simulation, and visualization experiments. The effects of temperature
   and pressure on the recovery were studied using a commercial reservoir
   simulator. Propane and butane were used as solvents. Asphaltene
   precipitation was also modeled. A qualitative history match with the
   experiments on different porous-media types was achieved by mainly
   considering the permeability reduction caused by asphaltene
   precipitation; pore plugging; the extent of interaction between the
   solvent and oil phases; and parameters such as model height, vertical
   permeability, and gravity. The effect of asphaltene deposition on models
   of varying permeabilities was also studied.
   To investigate the phenomenon further, visualization experiments were
   performed. 2D He le-Shaw models of different dimensions were constructed
   by joining two Plexiglass sheets from three sides, or in some
   experiments, from all sides. The models were saturated with heavy oil
   and left open on one side (or all sides) and were exposed to different
   types of solvents. The setup was monitored continuously to observe fluid
   fronts and asphaltene precipitation.
   By use of this analysis, the mechanics of the process was clarified from
   the effect of solvent type on the recovery process. The optimum
   operating temperature for the hot-solvent process and the dominant
   mechanisms were identified. The dynamics of the asphaltene deposition
   and its effect on oil recovery were clarified through visual and
   numerical models.}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{When an ultrasonic angle-beam pulse-echo setup is used, two kinds of
   noise are present in the received signal: (1) wedge noise, and (2)
   random noise. In this study, we propose a method for removing both
   random and wedge noises using a two-dimensional stationary wavelet
   transform (2D SWT). To improve the performance of the 2D SWT, we employ
   analytic wavelet thresholding. This requires calculating the analytic
   signal for a 2D signal and extracting the envelope of the signal, but no
   regular generalization of analytic signals to multi dimensions is
   available. We prove that under some certain conditions, the envelope of
   the ultrasonic B-scan can be extracted exactly by introducing a
   reference vector. The performance of the proposed denoising method is
   assessed using simulated and experimental data. The experimental results
   show that our proposed denoising method is able to reveal the echoes
   from a surface breaking crack as small as 0.1 mm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{403-415}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a laboratory testing program
   involving consolidated undrained triaxial tests and direct shear tests
   on remoulded peat, remoulded peat fibre, and Shelby specimens of peat
   obtained from a field site located in the Edson subdivision of the
   Canadian National railway in Alberta, Canada. These results were
   analyzed within the frameworks of elastic behaviour of cross-anisotropic
   materials and shear strength of fibre-reinforced soil. Shelby specimens
   were found to be inherently cross-anisotropic, whereas the remoulded
   peat and peat fibre specimens showed a transition from isotropic to
   cross-anisotropic with increasing vertical strain and effective
   confining pressure. The horizontal stiffness of Shelby specimens was
   found to be 2.6 to 2.9 times their vertical stiffness. The shear
   strength of intact peat is made up of interparticle friction as well as
   tension in the peat fibres. A novel procedure for estimating the
   interparticle frictional strength of fibrous peat from CU triaxial test
   results is proposed. It involves extrapolating the linear
   strain-hardening portion of the stress-strain curve to obtain the
   deviatoric stress at zero axial strain and plotting the deviatoric
   stress values thus obtained against initial mean effective confining
   pressure to obtain the frictional strength. Using this procedure, a
   value of 31 was obtained for the interparticle friction, which compares
   favourably with a value of 31 obtained from direct shear tests. It is
   recommended that further studies be undertaken to assess if
   interparticle frictional strength is an appropriate strength parameter
   for evaluation of the stability of structures founded on fibrous peat.}},

Abstract = {{This article provides a concise review of the use of magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) for measurement of regional aerosol deposition in the

   discussed. The addition of contrast agents to aerosol particles in order
   to allow measurement of regional aerosol deposition is considered.
   Existing in vitro human and in vivo animal model measurements of
   regional aerosol deposition in the respiratory tract demonstrate the
   capability of MRI in this regard. However, as a tool for human
   deposition studies, current approaches require contrast agent doses that
   are too high to be considered competitive with traditional radionuclide

Title = {{Feed forward and feedback control for over-ground locomotion in
   anaesthetized cats}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{The biological central pattern generator (CPG) integrates open and
   closed loop control to produce over-ground walking. The goal of this
   study was to develop a physiologically based algorithm capable of
   mimicking the biological system to control multiple joints in the lower
   extremities for producing over-ground walking. The algorithm used
   state-based models of the step cycle each of which produced different
   stimulation patterns. Two configurations were implemented to restore
   over-ground walking in five adult anaesthetized cats using intramuscular
   stimulation (IMS) of the main hip, knee and ankle flexor and extensor
   muscles in the hind limbs. An open loop controller relied only on
   intrinsic timing while a hybrid-CPG controller added sensory feedback
   from force plates (representing limb loading), and accelerometers and
   gyroscopes (representing limb position). Stimulation applied to hind
   limb muscles caused extension or flexion in the hips, knees and ankles.
   A total of 113 walking trials were obtained across all experiments. Of
   these, 74 were successful in which the cats traversed 75\% of the 3.5 m
   over-ground walkway. In these trials, the average peak step length
   decreased from 24.9 +/- 8.4 to 21.8 +/- 7.5 (normalized units) and the
   median number of steps per trial increased from 7 (Q1 = 6, Q3 = 9) to 9
   (8, 11) with the hybrid-CPG controller. Moreover, within these trials,
   the hybrid-CPG controller produced more successful steps (step length <=
   20 cm; ground reaction force >= 12.5\% body weight) than the open loop
   controller: 372 of 544 steps (68\%) versus 65 of 134 steps (49\%),
   respectively. This supports our previous preliminary findings, and
   affirms that physiologically based hybrid-CPG approaches produce more
   successful stepping than open loop controllers. The algorithm provides
   the foundation for a neural prosthetic controller and a framework to
   implement more detailed control of locomotion in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a tamper detection and correction technique using
   semi-fragile data hiding that aims to achieve high perceptual quality of
   images at the user-end even after malicious modifications. A binary
   signature and an image digest are embedded by modulating integer wavelet
   coefficients using dither modulation based quantization index
   modulation. Half-toning technique is used to obtain image digest from
   the low-resolution version of the host image itself. Decoder extracts
   the binary signature from the watermarked image for tamper detection,
   while the extracted image digest is used to correct the tamper region.
   Unlike previously proposed techniques, this novel approach distinguishes
   malicious changes from various common image processing operations more
   efficiently and also correct tapered regions effectively. Experimental
   results show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance
   in terms of probability of miss and false alarm as well as in tamper
   correction, compared to several existing semi-fragile watermarking
   techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Background: In addition to neuronal injury, inflammatory, and
   demyelinating processes, evidence suggests multiple sclerosis (MS) is
   also associated with increased iron deposition in the basal ganglia.
   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly at very high field
   strengths, is sensitive to iron accumulation and may enable
   visualization and quantification of iron associated with MS.
   Objectives: To investigate the sub-cortical gray matter in patients with
   early-stage relapsing-remitting MS using multiple, and novel,
   quantitative MRI measures at very high field.
   Methods: In total, 22 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 22
   control subjects were imaged at 4.7 Tesla. Transverse relaxation rates
   (R-2 and R-2{*}) and susceptibility phase were quantified in four basal
   ganglia nuclei, the thalamus, and the red nuclei. Parameters in patients
   with MS were compared with those in healthy subjects and correlated with
   clinical scores.
   Results: Significant abnormalities were observed in most structures,
   most notably in the pulvinar sub-nucleus. Significant correlations with
   disability were observed in the pulvinar; marginally significant
   correlations were also observed in the thalamus and red nucleus. No
   significant correlations were observed with duration since index
   relapse.
   Conclusions: Widespread abnormalities are present in the deep gray
   matter nuclei of patients recently diagnosed with MS; these
   abnormalities can be detected via multi-modal high-field MRI. Imaging
   metrics, particularly R-2{*}, relate to disease severity in the pulvinar
   and other gray matter regions.}},

   Part 2. Characterization of clay minerals}},

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{183-194}},

Abstract = {{Although not used commercially, a nonaqueous extraction process is of
   great interest to extract bitumen from the Alberta oil sands due to its
   potential advantages, such as high bitumen recovery even from low grade
   oil sands ores and the elimination of slow settling, sludge tailings
   ponds with stable suspensions. While clay minerals have been
   characterized in water-based bitumen extraction from the oil sands to
   some extent, the gap of knowledge in the characterization of clay
   minerals in a nonaqueous bitumen extraction process has led to the
   current research. Two Syncrude oil sands ores, a high grade, low fines,
   good processing ore and a mid grade, high fines, poor processing ore,
   were used in the nonaqueous bitumen extraction. The raw oil sands ores,
   products of the extraction (supernatant) and the tailings generated from
   the extraction were investigated by low-pressure scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). These observations showed some important differences
   between the two ore samples in terms of the settling behavior of the
   solids after nonaqueous extraction. In addition, the clay size fractions
   (<2 mu m) of the oil sands ores and supernatants were analyzed by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). high resolution transmission
   electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) after removing
   the organic matter. Kaolinite and illite were found to be the dominant
   clay minerals based on XRD analysis. Quantitative XRD analysis revealed
   an enrichment of kaolinite in the supernatant when compared with the
   ore. HRTEM studies showed the presence of monolayer smectitic clay
   minerals in clay fraction of ore and supernatant while these Monolayers
   were not detectable by XRD. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Parameters that vary monotonically with damage propagation are useful in
   condition monitoring. However, it is not easy to find such parameters
   especially for complex systems like pumps. A method using half and full
   spectra, fuzzy preference-based rough sets and principal component
   analysis (PCA) is proposed to generate such an indicator for tracking
   impeller damage in a centrifugal slurry pump. Half and full spectra are
   used for extracting features related to pump health status. A fuzzy
   preference-based rough set model is employed in the process of selecting
   features reflecting the damage propagation monotonically. PCA is used to
   condense the features and generate an indicator which represents the
   damage propagation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested
   using laboratory experimental data. Results show that the indicator
   generated by the proposed method can clearly and monotonically
   distinguish the health status of the pump impeller.}},

Journal = {{COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{41-49}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Periods of rapid frazil production followed by sudden warming can
   instigate the consolidation of a developing river ice cover. Although
   empirical evidence suggests that hydro-peaking operations can also
   precipitate or exacerbate such events, little is actually known about
   the specific implications of hydro-peaking during ice cover development
   because, until recently, numerical ice process models could not simulate
   such events reliably. Nevertheless, given that fluctuating water levels
   can destabilize a fragile developing ice cover, resulting in a severe
   freeze-up ice jam and associated flooding, winter is typically a time of
   severely constrained flow-peaking operations for hydro-power facilities.
   The Peace River in northern Alberta presents just such a case; the river
   has been regulated for hydro-power production since 1972 and numerous
   consolidation events have been documented along the river over the past
   few decades, including a particularly extreme event in January 1982. As
   a consequence of that event, voluntary flow controls have since been
   implemented each winter during the ice cover development period. In this
   study, recently developed hydrodynamic ice process modeling tools are
   used to diagnose such events in order to explore the relative importance
   of the causative factors and to facilitate a more comprehensive
   understanding of this phenomenon. Based on this analysis, it appears
   that meteorological factors may play an equally important role as
   hydro-peaking in precipitating ice cover consolidation events. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this study, we discuss a design of an optimized cascade fuzzy
   controller for the rotary inverted pendulum system and ball \& beam
   system by using an optimization vehicle of differential evolution (DE).
   The structure of the differential evolution optimization environment is
   simple and a convergence to optimal values realized here is very good in
   comparison to the convergence reported for other optimization
   algorithms. DE is easy to use given its mathematical operators. It also
   requires a limited computing overhead. The rotary inverted pendulum
   system and ball \& beam system are nonlinear systems, which exhibit
   unstable motion. The performance of the proposed fuzzy controller is
   evaluated from the viewpoint of several performance criteria such as
   overshoot, steady-state error, and settling time. Their values are
   obtained through simulation studies and practical, real-world
   experiments. We evaluate and analyze the performance of the proposed
   optimal fuzzy controller optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA), and DE. In
   this setting, we show the superiority of DE versus other methods being
   used here as well as highlight the characteristics of this optimization

Abstract = {{Ice accretion on power transmission and distribution lines is one of the
   major causes of power grid outages in northern regions. While such icing
   events are rare, they are very costly. Thus, it would be useful to
   predict how much ice will accumulate. Many current ice accretion
   forecasting systems use precipitation-type prediction and physical ice
   accretion models. These systems are based on expert knowledge and
   experimentations. An alternative strategy is to learn the patterns of
   ice accretion based on observations of previous events. This paper
   presents two different forecasting systems that are obtained by applying
   the learning algorithm of Support Vector Machines to the outputs of a
   Numerical Weather Prediction model. The first forecasting system relies
   on an icing model, just as the previous algorithms do. The second system
   learns an effective forecasting model directly from meteorological
   features. We use a rich data set of eight different icing events (from
   2002 to 2008) to empirically compare the performance of the various ice
   accretion forecasting systems. Several experiments are conducted to
   investigate the effectiveness of the forecasting algorithms. Results
   indicate that the proposed forecasting system is significantly more
   accurate than other state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Model-based gear dynamic analysis and simulation has been a promising
   way for developing effective gearbox vibration monitoring approaches. In
   this paper, based on the dynamic model of a one-stage gearbox with spur
   gears and one tooth crack, statistical indicators and the discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) technique are investigated to identify effective
   and sensitive health indicators for reflecting the crack propagation
   level. The results suggest that the root mean square (RMS) indicator is
   a better statistical indicator than the Kurtosis indicator to reflect
   the crack propagation in the early stage; the RMS indicator based on the
   residual signal segments that are strongly affected by the crack is more
   sensitive; the proposed DWT approach can improve the sensitivity of the
   RMS indicator, and the RMS indicator becomes more sensitive with the
   increase of the DWT level up to a best DWT level, beyond which either
   the monotonicity is lost or the sensitivity decreases; the proposed
   approach is effective with the presence of noise; with the increase of
   the noise level, the DWT level at which the best performance is
   achieved, and thus the sensitivity, decreases. Gearbox systems with
   different sizes and different input shaft frequencies are also
   investigated, and it is found that the observations presented above hold
   for different gearbox system settings.}},

Abstract = {{Non-viral delivery of genes involved in stimulation of bone formation
   has been pursued for clinical bone repair, but no effort has been made
   to assess protein expression levels after in vivo delivery. This is
   critical to better understand gene delivery efficiencies and to compare
   different modes of non-viral delivery. This study investigated
   expression levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and bone
   morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) after delivering expression vectors
   (plasmid DNA) with polymeric carriers in a rat subcutaneous implant
   model. The polymers used were a 2 kDa molecular weight polyethylenimine
   modified with linoleic acid (PEI-LA) and the 25 kDa PEI (PEI25) used for
   non-viral gene delivery in animal models. The PEI-LA mediated delivery
   of the plasmid DNAs in 2931 cells led to similar to 3.5 and similar to
   13 ng/10(6) cells/day secretion of bFGF and BMP-2 in vitro,
   respectively. Using the reporter protein, Green Fluorescence Protein
   (GFP), transfection in implants was readily detected by the presence of
   GFP-positive cells and a polymeric carrier was needed for this GFP
   expression. No bFGF and BMP-2 were detected in the scaffolds due to high
   background in detection assays and/or rapid diffusion of the secreted
   proteins from the implant site. However, using an ex vivo culture
   system, significant levels of BMP-2, but not bFGF, secretion were
   observed from the scaffolds. The BMP-2 secretion from PEI-LA delivered
   expression vector was equivalent and/or superior to PEI25 depending on
   the plasmid DNA implant dose. Gelatin scaffolds were able to sustain
   similar to 0.3 ng/sponge/day BMP-2 secretion as compared to collagen
   scaffolds (similar to 0.1 ng/sponge/day). These values were equivalent
   to secretion rates reported with some viral delivery systems from
   independent studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of tensile stress on the non-linear electrodissolution
   behaviour of carbon steel were investigated in an aqueous solution of 5M
   phosphoric acid. The frequency of the current oscillations within the
   transpassive potential region increases slightly when the elastic
   deformation was introduced to the electrode by applying tensile stress,
   but the oscillatory mode is essentially unchanged. The elastic
   deformation could induce the current oscillations in the passive
   potential region that was not observed on stress free state. This fact
   suggests that the tensile stress can reduce the stability of passive
   film. Immediately after the tensile stress exceeds the yield strength,
   the oscillatory mode changes into a chaotic one with high frequency and
   recovers the original state gradually. This phenomenon resembles the
   consequence due to the injection chloride to the electrode/electrolyte
   interface and implies that the plastic deformation may result in the
   formation of more defective passive films.}},

Abstract = {{Online machine condition prognostics are useful for condition based
   maintenance decision making in order to prevent unexpected machine
   breakdown, human injuries, and costs due to loss of productivity. Noise
   present in measured condition indicators which can represent machine
   conditions may, however, adversely affect prognostic results. In
   literature, machine condition prognostics considering noisy observations
   of condition indicators are rarely reported. In this work, we propose an
   algorithm to predict true values of condition indicators based on noisy
   observations. The proposed algorithm jointly uses least square support
   vector regression (LSSVR), genetic-algorithm-based optimization, and
   cumulative sum (CUSUM) technique. LSSVR is used to predict true values
   of condition indicators. To handle noise effects in observations,
   parameters of LSSVR are selected using an optimization process of which
   model is specially developed. Genetic algorithms (GA) are used to solve
   the optimization problem. To accommodate changes of indicator values and
   noise effects. CUSUM is employed to trigger re-determination of LSSVR
   parameters when current predictions are not acceptable. The proposed
   algorithm is compared with five reported methods using two simulation
   datasets and two experimental datasets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This investigation involves the corrosion behavior of two Fe-Ni-Cr
   alloys containing different Si content at 1050 degrees C in
   carburizing-oxidizing environments (typical of ethylene pyrolysis) with
   varied concentration of H2S. High-Si containing alloy could form thinner
   but less uniform oxide scale than low-Si alloy after pre-oxidation due
   to the barrier effect of continuous SiO2 at interface of
   scale/substrate. Pre-oxidized alloy showed a better resistance to
   carburization/sulfidation attacks than the bare alloy in absence of
   pre-oxidation. It was found that carburization and sulfidation of the
   Fe-Ni-Cr alloys could be prevented in the environment with a ratio of
   P-H2S/P-H2 at 1.7 x 10(-5). When the sulfur partial pressure was lower
   than this value, oxides were found to be converted to porous and
   non-protective carbides. When the sulfur potentials were increased,
   manganese or chromium sulfide on outer layer and internal sulfide
   stringers mixed with silicon oxide in substrate could be formed. Under
   high sulfur partial pressures, spallation of outer sulfide or oxide

Abstract = {{This paper presents an interactive distributed generation (DG) interface
   for flexible micro-grid operation in the smart distribution system
   environment. Under the smart grid environment, DG units should be
   included in the system operational control framework, where they can be
   used to enhance system reliability by providing backup generation in
   isolated mode, and to provide ancillary services (e. g. voltage support
   and reactive power control) in the grid-connected mode. To meet these
   requirements, the proposed flexible interface utilizes a fixed
   power-voltage-current cascaded control structure to minimize control
   function switching and is equipped with robust internal model control
   structure to maximize the disturbance rejection performance within the
   DG interface. The proposed control system facilitates flexible and
   robust DG operational characteristics such as 1) active/reactive power
   (PQ) or active power/voltage (PV) bus operation in the grid-connected
   mode, 2) regulated power control in autonomous micro-grid mode, 3)
   smooth transition between autonomous mode and PV or PQ grid connected
   modes and vice versa, 4) reduced voltage distortion under heavily

   multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relay networks
   (TWRNs). Specifically, two sources employ transmit and receive ZF during
   two consecutive time-slots for transmission and reception, respectively,
   while the relay performs analog network coding. Each source then
   requires only the instantaneous respective source-to-relay channel
   knowledge, and hence, the complexity of practical implementation is
   significantly reduced. The performance of this system set-up is studied
   by deriving the upper and lower bounds of the overall outage
   probability, their high signal-to-noise ratio approximations and
   diversity order. To obtain valuable insights into practical MIMO TWRN
   implementation, the diversity-multiplexing trade-off is also quantified.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic channel sensing and access problem of a secondary user
   with multiple potential primary channels is investigated. The secondary
   user can sense a limited number of channels, and channel sensing is

   is proved that the secondary user should sense the channels with the
   largest rewards, where the reward of a channel is the reward that the
   secondary user can acquire if it senses the channel and accesses the
   channel if the channel is sensed free. If the secondary user can access
   only a limited number of sensed-free channels, in general it may not be
   optimal to sense the channels with the largest rewards. However and
   interestingly, for some special cases (for example, when all the
   channels have the same detection probability), simple rules are given

Abstract = {{Inexpensive natural zeolites such as chabazites and clinoptilolites,
   found in abundance in multiple global deposits, can offer an effective,
   economical and environmentally friendly alternative to current methods
   of oilsands bitumen upgrading. This study shows that water added
   (similar to 3 wt.\% of feed) natural zeolite catalysts, can effectively
   convert up to similar to 81\% of the residue within oilsands bitumen in
   a stirred batch system under relatively low severity conditions. The
   reactions produce very high total liquid yields (up to similar to 96\%),
   significant amounts of which are residue-free (up to similar to 71\%).
   The resulting liquids have lower viscosity, boiling point distribution
   and average molecular weight than the bitumen from both raw samples and
   uncatalyzed oilsands treated thermally under the same conditions. These
   reactions, particularly when conducted under low severity conditions,
   produce little gas and result in minimal coking. In addition, the,
   natural zeolite-processed bitumen is less aromatic than thermally
   processed bitumen and contains much lower concentrations of heteroatoms
   (nitrogen, sulfur) and heavy metals (vanadium) compared to raw and
   untreated bitumen. Based on our results, we envision an alternative,
   more effective and environmentally friendly, low temperature, integrated
   extraction and upgrading process for oilsands bitumen that uses
   water-enhanced natural zeolites, requires fewer steps and improves
   pipeline transportation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent traffic safety research has advocated the use of the Full Bayes
   (FB) approach to conduct controlled before-after safety evaluations. The
   FB approach was shown to offer both methodological and data advantages.
   However, there is still a lack of complete understanding of the role
   that the model parameters play in the formulation of treatment
   effectiveness. This paper offers a novel approach to compute components
   related to direct and indirect treatment effects under a linear
   intervention model for the Safety Performance Function (SPF). The
   isolation of a component corresponding to the direct treatment effects
   enables the analyst to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasures
   apart from local (site-related) environmental factors. Two case studies
   are used to demonstrate the approach. The first case study is based on
   the results published from a previous safety evaluation in Iowa and the
   second uses a new data set from British Columbia based on the Insurance
   Corporation of British Columbia Road Improvement Program. The various
   direct and indirect components have yielded valuable insight into the
   effects of the model parameters on treatment impacts. Moreover, the
   calculation of the treatment effectiveness indices have been simplified
   by providing straightforward equations in terms of model parameters for
   the computation of their components without resorting to additional
   algorithms. More importantly, the results can have a significant impact
   on the economic evaluation of safety programs and countermeasures by
   allowing the calculation of collision modification factors (CMFs) that
   vary with time. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Pages = {{19-37}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to examine the behaviour of a sand
   jet front in water and its associated fluid motions with different sand
   particle sizes and initial sand jet diameters. The shape of sand jet
   front was found to be directly related to the particle Reynolds number
   of sand particles. The frontal velocity along the centreline of the jet
   axis was measured and compared to that of single-phase buoyant jets and
   particle thermals. The jet front settling velocity of small particles
   was found to be as large as 5 times that of the individual particle
   settling velocity. The presence of particles and the additional momentum
   generated by particles were found to reduce the growth rate of the jet
   front width, compared with those of the single-phase buoyant jets and
   particle thermals. Evolution of vortices and their structure were
   extracted from velocity fields by employing Galilean velocity
   decomposition and a local vortex identification technique. It was shown
   that, radial convection velocity can change the shape of the vortices.
   Large radial convection velocity transformed the vortex from
   semi-circular shape to elongated ellipsoid vortex. Effect of particles
   on turbulence of the carrier phase was studied. It was found that
   smaller particles increase turbulence attenuation of the carrier phase.
   Effect of particles on the modulation of turbulence can be described by
   the Stokes number along the jet axis. A classification was made for
   solid-liquid and solid-gas turbulent jets and new formulations were
   proposed to show the correlation between Stokes number and the
   turbulence attenuation of particle-laden turbulent jets. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In this study, experiments were conducted to explore some properties of
   the bubble plumes of two inclined circular plunging water jets on a
   water surface in a cubic aeration tank. A particle image velocimetry
   (PIV) system was used to measure the two-phase jet velocities in both
   the lateral and axial positions. Other parameters of interest, such as
   gas holdup (epsilon(G)) penetration depths (z(p), m) and the height and
   width of the two-phase mixture due to the air entrainment, were also
   monitored. The value of bubble mean diameter (d(b), m) under each
   operating condition was determined by using images captured by the PIV
   system. The results of the normalized axial velocity for the gas and
   water jets showed a good mixing effect in the aeration tank. The results
   obtained under different plunging angles (alpha) showed that as d(o)
   increases, z(p) also increases. Furthermore, under the same d(o), z(p)
   at alpha = 75 degrees was found to be higher than the ones obtained
   under other cases. The combination of two inclined jets yielded a higher
   z(p) compared to that yielded by one inclined jet. The value of
   epsilon(G) was found to decrease as d(o) increased for the same liquid
   flow rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a generalized closed-loop control (GCC) scheme is
   proposed for voltage source converters (VSCs) with LC or LCL output
   filters. The proposed GCC scheme has a single-loop control of inverter
   output (voltage or current) and two parallel virtual impedance terms
   using additional measurements. The virtual impedance can be the
   equivalent internal impedance or external impedance (or both), depending
   on their control term and feedback variable selection. The internal
   impedance term is mainly responsible for providing desired damping to
   the filter circuit, and the external virtual impedance term can
   effectively adjust the converter system closed-loop output impedance. As
   each term in the GCC scheme can be controlled independently, the
   proposed GCC scheme has great flexibility and can easily realize and
   explain the performances of the traditional single-and multiloop control
   schemes and their different variations. Moreover, the GCC scheme
   provides a distinct physical meaning of each control term, which makes
   the control parameter tuning more straightforward and robust.
   Additionally, as shown in this paper, the proposed GCC scheme can tackle
   some traditionally challenging control objectives by avoiding the
   harmonics filtering or derivative terms. Experimental results from
   laboratory VSC prototypes are obtained to validate the proposed GCC
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is gaining momentum as a means for
   combating climate change. It is viewed as an important bridging
   technology, allowing emission targets to be met during fossil fuel
   dependence while sufficient renewable energy generation is installed.
   Mineral carbon sequestration is the only known form of permanent carbon
   storage and has the potential to capture and store CO2 in a single step.
   It is based on the geologic process of natural rock weathering where CO2
   dissolved in rain water reacts with alkaline rocks to form carbonate
   minerals. While the reactions are thermodynamically favourable, in
   nature the process occurs over thousands of years. The challenge of
   mineral carbon sequestration is to accelerate carbonation and exploit
   the heat of reaction with minimal energy and material losses. Minerals
   commonly selected for carbonation include calcium and magnesium
   silicates. These minerals require energy-intensive pre-treatments, such
   as fine grinding, heat treatment, and chemical activation with strong
   acids, to provide adequate conversions and reaction kinetics. Industrial
   waste residues present alternative sources of mineral alkalinity that
   are more reactive than primary minerals and are readily and cheaply
   available close to CO2 sources. In addition, the carbonation of waste
   residues often improves their environmental stability. This paper
   provides an overview of the types of industrials wastes that can be used
   for mineral carbon sequestration and the process routes available. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel method to mine association rules for
   classification problems namely AFSRC (AFS association rules for
   classification) realized in the framework of the axiomatic fuzzy set
   (AFS) theory. This model provides a simple and efficient rule generation
   mechanism. It can also retain meaningful rules for imbalanced classes by
   fuzzifying the concept of the class support of a rule. In addition,
   AFSRC can handle different data types occurring simultaneously.
   Furthermore, the new model can produce membership functions
   automatically by processing available data. An extensive suite of
   experiments are reported which offer a comprehensive comparison of the
   performance of the method with the performance of some other methods
   available in the literature. The experimental result shows that AFSRC
   outperforms most of other methods when being quantified in terms of
   accuracy and interpretability. AFSRC forms a classifier with high
   accuracy and more interpretable rule base of smaller size while
   retaining a sound balance between these two characteristics. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Rosette nanotubes (RNTs) are discrete nanostructures self-assembled from
   a guanine-cytosine hybrid motif (G Lambda C) under aqueous conditions.
   These materials have substantial design flexibility and a range of
   applications, which are partly attributed to their diverse surface
   functionalization. Given the potential for interesting properties
   resulting from a metal-RNT construct, here we describe an
   oxorhenium-functionalized RNT. More specifically, we present the
   synthesis of a twin G Lambda C motif expressing the mercaptoacetyl
   triglycine (MAG(3)) ligand. We then examine the chelation reaction of
   the MAG(3) with ReOCl3(PPh3)(2) and self-assemble the resulting
   ReO-MAG(3)-G Lambda C conjugate into RNTs under DMSO and aqueous
   conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The accurate simulation of wireless channels is important since it
   permits the realistic and repeatable performance measurement of wireless
   systems. A new technique is proposed for simulating Rayleigh fading
   channels with isotropic or non-isotropic scattering and with arbitrary
   temporal correlation. Fading samples are generated by passing Gaussian
   samples through a spectrum shaping filter. A new iterative algorithm is
   then presented for designing stable complex infinite impulse response
   (IIR) filters with quantised coefficients. The algorithm utilises a
   least-squares cost function augmented with a barrier function to ensure
   filter stability and to reduce quantisation noise. The performance of
   the proposed filter design algorithm is verified with 18-bit fixed-point
   simulations of different fading channel scenarios including isotropic
   and non-isotropic scattering and the IEEE 802.11n model F fading
   spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Natural zeolite-based membranes have shown promise in the separation of
   H-2 from CO2 and hydrocarbons. However, these highly dense, naturally
   monolithic materials can suffer defects, which disrupt the continuity of
   the zeolite micropores and create leak paths through the membrane.
   Cement materials were explored as a component to generate natural
   zeolite-based cement composite membranes because of their ability to
   intergrow between the zeolite particles. The influence of operating
   pressures and temperatures on the performance of the natural
   zeolite-based cement composite membranes was examined. Gas permeation
   tests indicated that permeation through the membrane (thickness of
   1.8-2.2 mm) was an activated diffusion process and the experiments
   measured a hydrogen permeance of 4.1 x 10(-8) mol m(-2) s(-1) pa(-1) and
   a H-2/CO2 single gas selectivity of 25 at 25 degrees C and 100 kPa. (C)

Journal = {{BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Influenza A H1N1 virus can be transmitted via direct,
   indirect, and airborne route to non-infected subjects when an infected
   patient coughs, which expels a number of different sized droplets to the
   surrounding environment as an aerosol. The objective of the current
   study was to characterize the human cough aerosol pattern with the aim
   of developing a standard human cough bioaerosol model for Influenza
   Pandemic control.
   Method: 45 healthy non-smokers participated in the open bench study by
   giving their best effort cough. A laser diffraction system was used to
   obtain accurate, time-dependent, quantitative measurements of the size
   and number of droplets expelled by the cough aerosol.
   Results: Voluntary coughs generated droplets ranging from 0.1 - 900
   microns in size. Droplets of less than one-micron size represent 97\% of
   the total number of measured droplets contained in the cough aerosol.
   Age, sex, weight, height and corporal mass have no statistically
   significant effect on the aerosol composition in terms of size and
   number of droplets.
   Conclusions: We have developed a standard human cough aerosol model. We
   have quantitatively characterized the pattern, size, and number of
   droplets present in the most important mode of person-to-person
   transmission of IRD: the cough bioaerosol. Small size droplets (< 1 mu
   m) predominated the total number of droplets expelled when coughing. The
   cough aerosol is the single source of direct, indirect and/or airborne
   transmission of respiratory infections like the Influenza A H1N1 virus.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of cryoprotective
   agent (CPA) is necessary for the cryopreservation of articular
   cartilage. Cartilage dehydration and shrinkage, as well as the change in
   extracellular osmolality, may have a significant impact on chondrocyte
   survival during and after CPA loading, freezing, and thawing, and during
   CPA unloading. In the literature, Fick's law of diffusion is commonly
   used to predict the spatial distribution and overall concentration of
   the CPA in the cartilage matrix, and the shrinkage and stress-strain in
   the cartilage matrix during CPA loading are neglected. In this study, we
   used a previously described biomechanical model to predict the spatial
   and temporal distributions of CPA during loading. We measured the
   intrinsic inhomogeneities in initial water and fixed charge densities in
   the cartilage using magnetic resonance imaging and introduced them into
   the model as initial conditions. We then compared the prediction results
   with the results obtained using uniform initial conditions. The
   simulation results in this study demonstrate the presence of a
   significant mechanical strain in the matrix of the cartilage, within all
   layers, during CPA loading. The osmotic response of the chondrocytes to
   the cartilage dehydration during CPA loading was also simulated. The
   results reveal that a transient shrinking occurs to different levels,
   and the chondrocytes experience a significant decrease in volume,
   particularly in the middle and deep zones of articular cartilage, during
   CPA loading.}},

Abstract = {{When dispersed in aqueous solution, droplets of bitumen (extra heavy
   oil) are known to acquire negative surface charges. The resulting
   electrostatic repulsion, according to traditional DLVO theory, is far
   too strong for any droplet coalescence to occur. However, from
   experience it is known that bitumen droplets do coalesce in aqueous
   suspensions. Furthermore, the process appears to be random, with the
   probability of coalescence increasing sharply with the drop size. To
   explain these facts, we modeled the bitumen-water interface as a
   heterogeneous surface comprising charged ``patches{''}; the zeta
   potentials of the patches constitute a random variable that is assumed
   to be Gaussian. The traditional DLVO theory, according to this model,
   remains sound on the local scale (i.e., for patches interacting across
   an intervening water layer). Such a theory can predict the probabilities
   of coalescence in remarkable detail. A parameter central to this theory
   is the lateral extent of the charged patches, which was estimated to be
   in the neighborhood of 0.6 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{A new growth technique for indium tin oxide nanowhiskers with increased
   control over feature size and spacing is reported. The technique is
   based on a unique combination of self-catalysed vapour-liquid-solid
   (VLS) growth and glancing angle deposition (GLAD). This VLS-GLAD
   technique provides enhanced control over nanowhisker morphology as the
   effect of typical VLS growth parameters (e. g. flux rate, temperature)
   is amplified at large deposition angles characteristic of GLAD. Spatial
   modulation of the collimated growth flux controls trunk width, number
   and orientation of branches, and overall nanowhisker density. Here we
   report the influence of growth conditions (including deposition angle,
   flux rate, nominal pitch and substrate temperature) on nanowhisker
   morphology, with specific focus on the effect of large deposition
   angles. Sheet resistance and transmission of the films were measured to
   characterize their performance as transparent conductive oxides. Hybrid
   nanostructured films grown in this study include high surface area
   nanowhiskers protruding from a conductive film, ideal for transparent
   conductive electrode applications.}},

Title = {{Compressed microtubules: Splitting or buckling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Microtubule (MT) is the mechanically strongest cytoskeletal element in
   eukaryotic cells and plays a key role in maintaining cell's geometrical
   shape by bearing compressive forces. MTs are highly dynamic, and
   ``dynamic instability{''} is referred to the switch between
   polymerization and depolymerization phases (the latter is characterized
   by splitting of protofilaments at the plus end). A micromechanics model
   is proposed here to study whether an axially compressed microtubule,
   protected by a ``cap{''} consisted of a few layers of strongly bonded
   GTP dimers at the plus end, can split prior to overall buckling. Our
   basic conclusion is that compression-driven splitting of a capped
   microtubule can happen prior to overall buckling when the microtubule is
   very short (typically shorter than few hundreds of nanometers). For
   example, compression-driven splitting from middle of a capped
   microtubule can happen prior to buckling when the length of microtubule
   is shorter than a few hundreds of nanometers. In addition, for capped
   microtubules shorter than 125-180 nm (depending on specific values of
   axial Young's modulus and adhesion energy between protofilaments),
   mechanical compression will cause splitting of the microtubule at its
   plus end prior to overall buckling. On the other hand, however, for
   microtubules of length longer than 0.3-0.75 micron (depending on
   specific values of axial Young's modulus and adhesion energy between
   protofilaments), the present model shows that a cap composed of even one
   single layer of GTP dimers is sufficient to prevent compression-driven
   splitting prior to buckling, in agreement with the known observations
   that dynamic instability or splitting of moderately long microtubules
   could happen only when the cap is completely lost at the plus end. (C)

Title = {{Square spiral photonic crystal with visible bandgap}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Nanoimprint lithography was combined with glancing angle deposition
   (GLAD) of titanium dioxide to fabricate a square spiral columnar film
   with a bandgap in the visible spectral range. Nanoimprint stamps were
   fabricated with seed spacing ranging from 80 to 400 nm, and four periods
   of square spiral film were deposited on top of the 320 nm array of
   seeds. The ratio of lattice spacing, vertical pitch and spiral arm swing
   was chosen as a : P : A 1 : 1.35 : 0.7 and the deposition angle was
   fixed at 86 degrees to maximize the square spiral film's bandgap.
   Reflectivity measurements show that the fabricated structure exhibit a
   pseudo-gap centered at around 600 nm wavelength, in good agreement with
   finite difference electromagnetic simulations. The absence of a full 3D
   bandgap is due the deviation of GLAD columns' cross-section from the
   optimal one, which has to be highly elongated in the deposition plane.
   However, simulations show that a geometry close to the fabricated one
   will produce a full 3D bandgap, if the structure is inverted. The
   material refractive index in such an inverted photonic crystal can be as
   low as n = 2.15. {[}http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3695388]}},

Volume = {{394}},

Abstract = {{A new type of thin-film nanocomposite (n-TFN) membrane was synthesized
   by the interfacial polymerization of a support layer containing acid
   modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and a thin-film layer
   containing nanosilver (nAg) particles. Microscopic characterization
   confirmed that MWNTs and nAg particles were distributed in the support
   layer and the thin-film layer, respectively. Spectroscopic
   characterization revealed the surface functionalities of the MWNT
   support layer, and nAg crystallinity and bonding components of the
   thin-film layer. MWNTs at 5.0 wt.\% in the support layer and nAg
   particles at 10 wt.\% in the thin-film layer enhanced the pure water
   permeability of the n-TFN membrane by 23\% and 20\%, respectively,
   compared to 0 wt.\% of these components in their respective layers.
   Increases in pure water permeability and hydrophilicity of the n-TFN
   membrane were attributed to the diffusive effect of nanopores in the
   MWNTs. Salt (NaCl, Na2SO4) rejections of the n-TFN membrane were similar
   to thin-film composite membranes without nAg particles. Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa PAO1 batch tests indicated greater anti-adhesive and
   antibacterial properties of the n-TFN membrane compared to similar
   membranes without nAg particles. This study demonstrated that the acid
   modified MWNTs and nAg particles enhance the permeability and
   anti-biofouling properties of thin-film nanocomposite membranes. (C)

Abstract = {{The transport of stabilized zerovalent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) has
   recently been the topic of extensive research due to its proven
   potential as an in situ remediation tool. However, these studies have
   ignored the effects of biofilms-complex aggregations of bacterial cells
   and excreted extracellular polymeric substances present in nearly all
   aquatic systems on the transport of these particles. This study examines
   the effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) biofilm, at a cell
   concentration similar to that reported for saturated aquifers, on the
   transport of commercially available, poly (acrylic acid) stabilized nZVI
   (pnZVI) in 14 cm long columns packed with saturated glass beads at salt
   concentrations of 1 and 25 mM NaCl. Compared to retention on uncoated
   columns, in the presence of biofilm the retention of pnZVI increased at
   higher ionic strength, while ionic strength played no role in retention
   of these nanoparticles in the absence of biofilm. The Tufenkji-Elimelech
   correlation equation predicts lower retention of pnZVI on biofilm coated
   columns compared to uncoated columns due to a lower Hamaker constant,
   and DLVO energy considerations predict the most favorable attachment to
   uncoated porous media at higher ionic strength. A steric
   (polymer-mediated) model that considers the combined influence of steric
   effects of polymers and DLVO interactions is shown to adequately
   describe particle retention in columns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Membrane filtration is an effective reclamation option for oil sands
   process-affected water (OSPW). However, fresh OSPWs contain suspended
   solids and inorganic constituents in suspended and dissolved forms that
   can severely foul membranes. Pretreatment of OSPW with
   coagulation-flocculation (CF) was investigated to determine the effects
   of different coagulant aids (anionic, cationic, and nonionic polymers)
   on membrane surface properties and fouling. Our results showed that CF
   pretreatment effectively enhanced nanofiltration (NF) and reverse
   osmosis (RO) membrane permeate flux and salt rejection ratio through
   reducing membrane fouling. It was shown that coagulants and coagulant
   aids applied to OSPW feedwater can affect membrane physicochemical
   properties (surface hydrophilicity, zeta potential, and morphology),
   membrane performance, and the fouling indexes. Membrane rejection of
   ionic species increased significantly with the inclusion of an anionic
   coagulant aid and slightly with a cationic coagulant aid. Among three
   coagulant aids tested, anionic coagulant aids led to the most enhanced
   membrane performance through increasing membrane surface negativity and
   decreasing the formation of a fouling layer. Conversely, although
   cationic coagulant aids were the most effective in reducing OSPW
   turbidity, the application of cationic coagulant aids promoted the
   adsorption of foulants on membrane surfaces.}},

   study silver reduction in silver-exchanged chabazite under various
   thermal conditions. The solid-state NMR results for both Al-27 and Si-29
   show that there are no major changes in the chabazite during silver
   reduction in an argon stream; however a progressive structural change
   does take place in the hydrogen stream. The structural change likely
   involves breaking the silicon oxygen bond of the Si-O-Al fragment of
   chabazite, leading to the formation of extra-framework aluminum oxide.
   The TGA results at temperatures up to 600 degrees C indicate that silver
   reduction is less complete in an argon stream than in a hydrogen stream.
   In this paper we propose that silver reduction occurs via the following
   reactions: 2(Ag+ + ZO(-))+ H2O --> 1/2O(2) + 2Ag(0) + 2ZOH and nAg(+) +
   mAg = Ag-m+n(n+) (in an argon stream); and Ag+ + ZO(-) + 1/2H(2) = Ag-0
   + ZOH and 2ZOH = ZO(-) + Z(+) + H2O (in a hydrogen stream).}},

   microgrids are essential requirements to facilitate powerful and
   flexible control infrastructure in future smart power grids. Motivated
   by this objective, this paper presents a control structure for microgrid
   converters based on direct-voltage control and optimized dynamic power
   sharing. The salient features of the proposed scheme are 1) minimum
   switching actions between grid-connected and isolated microgrids systems
   to minimize internal microgrid formation disturbances; 2) active damping
   control performance in the converter control voltage vector to
   effectively reject both voltage magnitude disturbances and power angle
   swings associated with mode transition and load disturbances; and 3)
   high bandwidth direct voltage control loop in both grid-connected and
   isolated microgrid modes to improve the dynamic response and disturbance
   rejection performance. Theoretical analysis and comparative experimental
   results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
   control scheme.}},

Title = {{Subject-Specific Estimation of Central Aortic Blood Pressure Using an

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to the estimation of unknown central
   aortic blood pressure waveform from a directly measured peripheral blood
   pressure waveform, in which a physics-based model is employed to solve
   for a subject-and state-specific individualized transfer function (ITF).
   The ITF provides the means to estimate the unknown central aortic blood
   pressure from the peripheral blood pressure. Initial proof-of-principle
   for the ITF is demonstrated experimentally through an in vivo protocol.
   In swine subjects taken through wide range of physiologic conditions,
   the ITF was on average able to provide central aortic blood pressure
   waveforms more accurately than a nonindividualized transfer function.
   Its usefulness was most evident when the subject's pulse transit time
   deviated from normative values. In these circumstances, the ITF yielded
   statistically significant reductions over a nonindividualized transfer
   function in the following three parameters: 1) 30\% reduction in the
   root-mean-squared error between estimated versus actual central aortic
   blood pressure waveform (p < 10(-4)), 2) >50\% reduction in the error
   between estimated versus actual systolic and pulse pressures (p <
   10(-4)), and 3) a reduction in the overall breakdown rate (i.e., the
   frequency of estimation errors >3 mmHg, p < 10(-4)). In conclusion, the
   ITF may offer an attractive alternative to existing methods that
   estimates the central aortic blood pressure waveform, and may be
   particularly useful in nonnormative physiologic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{There is an extensive literature on decision making under uncertainty.
   Unfortunately, up to date there are no valid decision principles.
   Experimental evidence has repeatedly shown that widely used principle of
   maximization of expected utility has serious shortcomings. Utility
   function and nonadditive measures used in nonexpected utility models are
   mainly considered as real-valued functions whereas in reality
   decision-relevant information is imprecise and therefore is described in
   natural language. This applies, in particular, to imprecise
   probabilities expressed by terms such as likely, unlikely, probable,
   etc. The principal objective of the paper is the development of
   computationally effective methods of decision making with imprecise
   probabilities. We present representation theorems for a nonexpected
   fuzzy utility function under imprecise probabilities. We develop an
   effective decision theory when the environment of fuzzy events, fuzzy
   states, fuzzy relations and fuzzy constraints are characterized by
   imprecise probabilities. The suggested methodology is applied for a
   real-life decision-making problem.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic rate of oxygen consumption, an important indicator of
   tissue metabolism, can be expressed as the change of net blood oxygen
   flux into and out of a tissue region per 100 g of tissue. In this work,
   we propose a photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound method for imaging
   local blood oxygen flux of a single vessel. An imaging system for
   combined photoacoustic and high-frequency ultrasound microscopy is
   presented. This system uses a swept-scan 25-MHz ultrasound transducer
   with confocal dark-field laser illumination optics. A pulse-sequencer
   enables ultrasonic and laser pulses to be interlaced so that
   photoacoustic and Doppler ultrasound images are co-registered. Since the
   mean flow speed can be measured by color Doppler ultrasound, the vessel
   cross-sectional area can be measured by power Doppler or structural
   photoacoustic imaging, and multi-wavelength photoacoustic methods can be
   used to estimate oxygen saturation (sO(2)) and total concentration of
   haemoglobin (C-Hb), all of the parameters necessary for oxygen flux
   estimation can be provided. The accuracy of the flow speed and sO(2)
   estimation has been investigated. In vitro sheep blood phantom
   experiments have been performed at different sO(2) levels and mean flow
   speeds. Blood oxygen flux has been estimated, and the uncertainty of the
   measurement has been quantified. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{The draining crucible (DC) technique was used for measurements on AZ91D
   under Ar and SF6. The DC technique is a new method developed to
   simultaneously measure the physical properties of fluids, the density,
   surface tension, and viscosity. Based on the relationship between the
   height of a metal in a crucible and the outgoing flow rate, a
   multi-variable regression is used to calculate the values of these fluid
   properties. Experiments performed with AZ91D at temperatures from 923 K
   to 1173 K indicate that under argon, the surface tension (N . m(-1)) and
   density (kg . m(-3)) are {[}0.63 - 2.13 x 10(-4)(T - T-L)] and {[}1656 -
   0.158(T - T-L)], respectively. The viscosity (Pa . s) has been
   determined to be {[}1.455 x 10(-3) - 1.209 x 10(-5)(T - T-L)] over the
   temperature range from 921 K to 967 K superheat. Above 967 K, the

Abstract = {{Construction simulation provides a way to experiment with various
   scenarios of large-scale complicated construction projects, which can
   help meet project goals while taking into consideration uncertainties,
   resource constraints, space limitation, and so forth. However,
   simulation output in the form of statistics tables, bar charts, pie
   charts, etc., is not the best, most intuitive way to represent data to
   engineers, supervisors, and stakeholders. This research proposes a
   distributed simulation visualization framework (DSVF) to integrate
   computer visualization and geographic information technologies with
   discrete-event simulation (DES) under the High Level Architecture (HLA)
   framework; the visualization components (federates) will thus be readily
   reusable. To demonstrate the feasibility of DSVF, three federates, the
   two-dimensional animation federate, the three-dimensional animation
   federate, and the Map federate, are developed in the Construction
   Synthetic Environment (COSYE) at the University of Alberta. These
   federates can be reused and work with other federates harmoniously. A
   real-life tunnel project presented in the paper shows that the
   visualization federates can greatly facilitate the understanding of
   simulation results in a collaborative environment. DOI:

   measurement systems. What impact do these factors have on the control of
   wide-area closed-loop power systems? This study aims at developing
   methods in order to take these factors into account in control of
   wide-area power systems. First, a networked control system model is
   constructed for wide-area closed-loop power systems; in this model,
   network-induced delays, data packet dropout, and disordering are
   captured by time-varying delays in wide-area measurement systems. Then,
   linear matrix inequality based methods are applied to design a
   controller for better power system performance using wide-area
   information as feedback signals. The controller can tolerate
   network-induced delays, data packet dropout, and disordering in the
   communication of wide-area measurement systems. Finally, we give some
   simulation results showing the effectiveness of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{An energy system is the one of most important parts of the steel
   industry, and its reasonable operation exhibits a critical impact on
   manufacturing cost, energy security, and natural environment. With
   respect to the operation optimization problem for coke oven gas, a
   two-phase data-driven based forecasting and optimized adjusting method
   is proposed, where a Gaussian process-based echo states network is
   established to predict the gas real-time flow and the gasholder level in
   the prediction phase. Then, using the predicted gas flow and gasholder
   level, we develop a certain heuristic to quantify the user's optimal gas
   adjustment. The proposed operation measure has been verified to be
   effective by experimenting with the real-world on-line energy data sets
   coming from Shanghai Baosteel Corporation, Ltd., China. At present, the
   scheduling software developed with the proposed model and ensuing
   algorithms have been applied to the production practice of Baosteel. The
   application effects indicate that the software system can largely
   improve the real-time prediction accuracy of the gas units and provide
   with the optimized gas balance direction for the energy optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Bitumen extraction from oil sands is carried out in large separation
   cells using a water-based extraction process. Controlling the
   Bitumen-froth and Middlings interface in these cells at an optimum level
   provides significant economical and environmental benefits. Traditional
   sensors are not reliable in estimating this interface level and novel
   vision-based sensors have been developed previously to overcome this
   problem. These sensors estimate the interface level and its confidence
   for separation cells with a single sight glass. The confidence value
   only represents the turbidity of the interface and hence cannot be used
   for control decision making in all process conditions. The current work
   describes an image differencing algorithm for interface level detection
   which also facilitates the computation of a confidence estimate that is
   accurate in most process situations. The confidence value is computed
   based on noise statistics, an appropriately chosen edge detection method
   and a change detection algorithm. Another significant advantage of the
   algorithm is that both the interface level and the confidence estimation
   procedures can be extended in a straight-forward manner to handle the
   presence of multiple sight glasses. Offline results show that the
   algorithm accurately detects the interface level in normal process
   conditions (with high confidence values) and outputs correct confidence
   values in other situations, with very low false-positive and
   false-negative error rates. On-line industrial implementation results
   show that the vision sensor tracks the interface level very closely and
   results in significant automation of plant.}},

Journal = {{MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{391-401}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is sensitive to the
   translation/shift of input signals, its effectiveness could be lessened
   for face recognition, particularly when the face images are translated.
   To alleviate drawbacks resulted from this translation effect, we propose
   a decimated redundant DWT (DRDWT)-based face recognition method, where
   the decimation-based DWTs are performed on the original signal and its
   1-stepshift, respectively. Even though the DRDWT realizes the
   decimation, it enables us to explore the translation invariant DWT
   representation for the periodic shifts of the probe image that is the
   most similar to the gallery images. Therefore, it can solve the problem
   of translation sensitivity of the original DWT and address the
   translation effect occurring between the probe image and the gallery
   image. To further improve the recognition performance, we combine the
   global wavelet features obtained from the entire face and the local
   wavelet features obtained from face patches to represent both holistic
   and detail facial features, apply separate classifiers to global and
   local features and combine the resulted global and local classifiers to
   form an ensemble classifier. Experimental results reported for the FERET
   and FRGCv2.0 databases show the effectiveness of the DRDWT method and
   quantify its performance.}},

Abstract = {{Solution-processed ZnO thin films are attractive as active materials in
   thin film transistors (TFTs) for low-cost electronic device
   applications. However, the lack of true enhancement mode operation, low
   mobility, and unreliability in transistor characteristics due to the
   high density of traps and other defects present challenges in using such
   TFTs in circuits. We demonstrate in this report that the electrical
   characteristics of such TFTs can be improved by source injection
   barriers. Asymmetrical Schottky source metal oxide semiconductor
   field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) have been fabricated by utilizing
   heavily doped solution-processed ZnO as the active layer. n(+)-ZnO was
   obtained by using triethylamine as the stabilizer in the solution
   process instead of the more commonly used monoethanolamine. Au was
   chosen for source metallization to create a Schottky contact to the ZnO
   and an Al ohmic contact was chosen as the drain. Voltage applied to the
   gate induced field emission through the Schottky barrier and allowed
   modulation of the drain current by varying the width of the barrier. By
   operating the asymmetrical MOSFET when the Schottky contact is reverse
   biased, effective control over the transistor characteristics was
   obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable oil from canola and camelina can be converted to renewable
   diesel via hydroprocessing. In this study, a techno-economic model was
   developed to estimate the cost of vegetable oil production and the
   production plant economic optimum size using canola or camelina as
   feedstock. Minimum, average, and maximum yield cases were considered. If
   canola and camelina meal can be sold for \$0.26/kg, in the average yield
   case the optimum plant size and minimum cost of oil production is 140
   million L/year and \$0.63/L for a canola-press plant, 190 million L/year
   and \$0.55/L for a canola-solvent plant, 90 million L/year and \$0.28/L
   for a camelina-press plant, and 120 million L/year and \$0.28/L for a
   camelina-solvent plant. If camelina meal cannot be sold, the cost of oil
   from camelina-press and -solvent plants at their optimum sizes is
   \$1.04/L and \$0.82/L, respectively. Field cost is the largest cost
   component and it makes up 75-85\% of the total oil production cost. A
   sensitivity analysis found that field cost and meal price have the
   greatest effect on oil cost; the optimum size of the plant, on the other
   hand, is most sensitive to transportation, capital, and operating and
   maintenance costs. (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley

Abstract = {{Each year, ice jams occur on many Canadian rivers, obstructing the flow
   and causing rapid increases in upstream water levels. Ice jams can
   significantly affect the river's discharge during their formation and
   release. However, due to safety and logistical issues, direct discharge
   measurements on ice jams are impractical. Also, because of the variable
   backwater effects during such events, rating curves are not applicable.
   Despite these difficulties, it is possible to estimate the discharge
   associated with ice jam events using measured ice and water profiles in
   conjunction with hydraulic modeling. This paper presents an overview of
   ice jam theory and discusses the type of data that is required to
   compute a discharge estimate for various ice jam scenarios. Also,
   guidelines are provided on how to use these data in hydraulic models to
   estimate discharge.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the fusion of information from process data
   and process connectivity and its subsequent use in fault diagnosis and
   process hazard assessment. The Signed Directed Graph (SDG), as a
   graphical model for capturing process topology and connectivity to show
   the causal relationships between process variables by material and
   information paths, has been widely used in root cause and hazard
   propagation analysis. An SDG is usually built based on process knowledge
   as described by piping and instrumentation diagrams. This is a complex
   and experience-dependent task, and therefore the resulting SDG should be
   validated by process data before being used for analysis. This paper
   introduces two validation methods. One is based on cross-correlation
   analysis of process data with assumed time delays, while the other is
   based on transfer entropy, where the correlation coefficient between two
   variables or the information transfer from one variable to another can
   be computed to validate the corresponding paths in SDGs. In addition to
   this, the relationship captured by data-based methods should also be
   validated by process knowledge to confirm its causality. This knowledge
   can be realized by checking the reachability or the influence of one
   variable on another based on the corresponding SDG which is the basis of
   causality. A case study of an industrial process is presented to
   illustrate the application of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are believed to be the major toxic component in
   oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) produced by the oil sands mining
   industry in Northern Alberta, Canada. We recently reported that oral
   exposure to NAs alters mammalian immune responses, but the effect of
   OSPW or NAs on the immune mechanisms of aquatic organisms has not been
   fully elucidated. We analyzed the effects of acute and sub-chronic NAs
   exposures on goldfish immune responses by measuring the expression of
   three pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, antimicrobial functions of
   macrophages, and host defense after challenge with a protozoan pathogen
   (Trypanosoma carassii). One week after NAs exposure, fish exhibited
   increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN gamma, IL-1 beta
   1,TNF-alpha 2) in the gills, kidney and spleen. Primary macrophages from
   fish exposed to NAs for one week, exhibited increased production of
   nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates. Goldfish exposed for one
   week to 20 mg/L NAs were more resistant to infection by T. carassii. In
   contrast, sub-chronic exposure of goldfish (12 weeks) to NAs resulted in
   decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the gills, kidney
   and spleen. The sub-chronic exposure to NAs reduced the ability of
   goldfish to control the T. carassii infection, exemplified by a drastic
   increase in fish mortality and increased blood parasite loads. This is
   the first report analyzing the effects of OSPW contaminants on the
   immune system of aquatic vertebrates. We believe that the bioassays
   depicted in this work will be valuable tools for analyzing the efficacy
   of OSPW remediation techniques and assessment of diverse environmental
   pollutants. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Calculating a robust correlation coefficient and quantifying its
   uncertainty}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Relationships between primary and secondary data are frequently
   quantified using the correlation coefficient; however, traditional means
   of calculating experimental correlation coefficients are known to be
   adversely affected by outlier data. A new method for calculating a
   robust correlation coefficient is proposed based on a weighted average
   correlation calculated from different combinations or subsets of the
   original data. The proposed robust correlation coefficient is shown to
   have a higher breakdown point than either Pearson's or Spearman's
   correlation coefficients as well as two out of three other robust
   correlation coefficients. The least median of squares (LMS) correlation
   coefficient has the highest possible breakdown point; however, it also
   tends to give unrealistically high or low correlation coefficients. A
   simulation study demonstrates the differences between the proposed
   robust correlation coefficient and other robust correlation
   coefficients. When the sample size is small, the uncertainty in the
   measured correlation can be very large, especially when the measured
   correlation is low. The uncertainty in the correlation coefficient is
   calculated based on the measured correlation and the number of data.
   This sampling distribution for the correlation coefficient requires a
   number of independent data; however, earth sciences data are often
   spatially dependent. Thus, a method for calculating an effective number
   of independent data using the variogram is proposed. An example is
   presented that applies the developed techniques to a petroleum
   geostatistics problem. The methodologies presented in this paper are
   implemented in FORTRAN code made available as part of this paper. (C)

Abstract = {{The management of osteochondral defects of articular cartilage, whether
   from trauma or degenerative disease, continues to be a significant
   challenge for Orthopaedic surgeons. Current treatment options such as
   abrasion arthroplasty procedures, osteochondral transplantation and
   autologous chondrocyte implantation fail to produce repair tissue
   exhibiting the same mechanical and functional properties of native
   articular cartilage. This results in repair tissue that inevitably fails
   as it is unable to deal with the mechanical demands of articular
   cartilage, and does not prevent further degeneration of the native
   cartilage. Mesenchymal stem cells have been proposed as a potential
   source of cells for cell-based cartilage repair due to their ability to
   self-renew and undergo multi-lineage differentiation. This proposed
   procedure has the advantage of not requiring harvesting of cells from
   the joint surface, and its associated donor site morbidity, as well as
   having multiple possible adult donor tissues such as bone marrow,
   adipose tissue and synovium. Mesenchymal stem cells have multi-lineage
   potential, but can be stimulated to undergo chondrogenesis in the
   appropriate culture medium. As the majority of work with mesenchymal
   stem cell-derived articular cartilage repair has been carried out in
   vitro and in animal studies, more work still has to be done before this
   technique can be used for clinical purposes. This includes realizing the
   ideal method of harvesting mesenchymal stem cells, the culture medium to
   stimulate proliferation and differentiation, appropriate choice of
   scaffold incorporating growth factors directly or with gene therapy and
   integration of repair tissue with native tissue.}},

Abstract = {{An environmentally friendly and commercially available polymer,
   ethylcellulose (EC), was found to be effective for water removal from
   water-in-diluted-bitumen emulsions. In a previous study, atomic force
   microscopy images of bitumen films transferred from the water toluene
   interface onto a silicon wafer revealed progressive disruption of
   bitumen films by increasing the addition of EC. The in situ micropipet
   experiments, on the other hand, demonstrated the flocculation and
   enhanced coalescence of two approaching water droplets at low and high
   EC concentrations, respectively. In this study, we investigated the
   effect of EC addition on compressibility, composition, thickness, and
   surface properties of the interfacial films formed by surface-active
   components of bitumen, aiming to understand the interfacial behavior of
   EC at the water diluted bitumen interface. The pressure area isotherms
   of Langmuir interfacial films indicated a transformation of a rigid
   interfacial film formed by surface-active components of bitumen to
   become much more compressible in the presence of EC. The polarized
   infrared spectroscopy analysis of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) interfacial
   films proved the adsorption of EC at the water oil interface, while the
   thickness measurement of the film indicated the displacement of
   interfacially active materials by EC. The thickness and contact angle
   measurements of LB interfacial films revealed an irreversible nature of
   EC adsorption at the interface. In conclusion, EC is able to
   irreversibly displace/disrupt the interfacial film formed by
   surface-active components of bitumen at the water oil interface and
   increase the compressibility of the interfacial film, promoting the
   coalescence of water droplets.}},

Abstract = {{The mass fraction and the properties of asphaltenes vary significantly
   with the n-alkane used to separate them from their parent oil and with
   the details of the separation procedure, such as washing steps.
   Measurement repeatability is challenging, with different error bounds
   reported within the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
   standards for a single operator using the same equipment and procedure
   vis-a-vis measurements performed by different operators in different
   laboratories. In this work, reversible interactions between Athabasca
   pentane asphaltenes and n-alkanes from pentane to hexadecane were
   observed using cross-polarized and visible light microscopy and were
   quantified using high-precision density measurements for mixtures
   ranging from 1000 to 8000 ppmw (from 0.8 to 6.5 g/L) and enthalpy of
   solution measurements for mixtures comprising from 1000 to 3500 ppmw
   (from 0.8 to 3 g/L) asphaltenes. The partial specific volumes of
   Athabasca pentane asphaltenes and the enthalpy of solution values,
   including a change of sign, were found to vary systematically with
   n-alkane carbon number. The microscopic observations revealed the
   formation of liquid crystals followed by isotropic liquid on the surface
   of the asphaltene particles. The interactions at low concentrations are
   consistent with n-alkane sorption by asphaltene particles, asphaltene
   particle swelling, and dissolution of a fraction of the asphaltenes in
   n-alkanes. The partial specific volume and enthalpy of solution results,
   simulated using a phenomenological model that includes these effects,
   explain the sensitivity of the repeatability of asphaltene mass fraction
   determinations to the details of the washing procedure applied during
   their preparation. Preparation techniques without washing appear to be
   preferred because the mass fractions of asphaltenes recovered are
   expected to be more repeatable and their properties are likely to be
   more consistent.}},

Abstract = {{Cracking and coke formation of a series of pyrene-based model compounds
   were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and microreactor
   experiments. The structure of the model compounds is that of a
   three-island archipelago, consisting of two pyrenyl groups joined to a
   central aromatic or heteroaromatic group by ethano bridges. The
   molecular weights of these compounds range from 459-679 g/mol and have
   sufficiently high boiling points to remain liquid under the reaction
   conditions. TGA measured the cracking kinetics and the coke yield of
   each compound, where coke yield was defined as the solid residue
   remaining after a 10 degrees C/min ramp to 500 degrees C, followed by
   isothermal heating at 500 degrees C for 15 min. Microreactor experiments
   provided the yield and structure of both cracked and addition products.
   Analysis of the reaction products by gas chromatography, mass
   spectrometry (MS), high-pressure liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted
   laser desorption/ionization MS, and tandem MS/MS show that the initial
   cracked fragments combined to form larger structures through a process
   of alkyl alkyl and, to a lesser extent, alkyl aryl C C bond-forming
   reactions. The most likely mechanism for these processes includes a
   sequence of free-radical addition reactions to an unsaturated bond,
   followed by rearrangement(s), dehydrogenation, and/or further cracking.
   Compounds with heteroatoms incorporated in the central ring typically
   gave higher yields of coke and different selectivity of the cracked
   products, compared to hydrocarbon compounds. The change in cracking
   selectivity is attributed to several possible factors including a
   neophyl like rearrangement, while the coke yield is governed by the rate
   of addition reactions, as well as the nature and reactivity of both the
   starting compound and the initially formed products. To test the
   hypothesis that molecular alignment and aggregation play a role in the
   observed coke yield, six model compounds were examined for liquid
   crystalline behavior under cross-polarized light microscopy. In this
   series of compounds, the coke yield increased as the isotropic
   temperature decreased.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of using outdated channel estimates
   for relay selection and signal amplification on the performance of
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relays under partial relay selection (PRS) and
   opportunistic relay selection (ORS). In practice, outdated channel state
   information (CSI) can occur due to feedback or scheduling delay. Both
   variable gain (VG) AF and fixed gain AF schemes are considered. Outage
   probability, the average bit error rate (BER) and simplified high
   signal-to-noise ratio approximations are derived. The effect of
   parameters such as the number of relays, the rank of chosen relay, and
   the correlation between the delayed and current channel state
   information are analyzed. Outdated CSI for computing relay gains in PRS
   causes about 2 dB loss. In ORS, a 3\% reduction in correlation causes up
   to an order of magnitude increase in the outage probability.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the hydrogen storage behavior of sputtered Mg-AlTi
   multilayers where nanometric Mg or Mg-Al-Ti layers were confined by 2 nm
   thick layers of AlTi. By decreasing the thickness of Mg layers, we were
   able to achieve 5.1 wt.\% H capacity without significant degradation in
   over 200 cycles at 473 K. However, for the samples with pure Mg layers
   degradation eventually occurred at higher cycle numbers. In multilayers
   of 34 nm thick Mg degradation was followed by disintegration of the
   films into sponge-like flakes. Alloying Mg layers with Al and Ti through
   cosputtering improved the performance of the multilayer composites.
   Through cycling, Al and Ti segregated out of Mg matrix and formed a
   nanocrystalline/amorphous AlTi phase as observed by X-ray diffraction
   and electron microscopy. This improved resistance of the microstructure
   against coarsening while a well dispersion of AlTi particles was
   achieved. Moreover, the stability of multilayers enhanced to an extent
   that they not only preserved their physical integrity, also did they
   maintain their superior kinetics up to over 250 cycles. Pressure -
   composition isotherms showed no significance change in thermodynamics of
   MgH2 formation. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Pages = {{340-352}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used widely to show structural
   brain changes during both development and aging. Lifespan studies are
   valuable because they connect these two processes, yet few DTI studies
   have been conducted that include both children and elderly subjects.
   This study used DTI tractography to investigate 12 major white matter
   connections in 403 healthy subjects aged 5-83 years. Poisson fits were
   used to model changes of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
   (MD) across the age span, and were highly significant for all tracts. FA
   increased during childhood and adolescence, reached a peak between 20
   and 42 years of age, and then decreased. MD showed an opposite trend,
   decreasing first, reaching a minimum at 18-41 years, and then increasing
   later in life. These trajectories demonstrate rates and timing of
   development and degradation that vary regionally in the brain. The
   corpus callosum and fornix showed early reversals of development trends,
   while frontal-temporal connections (cingulum, uncinate, superior
   longitudinal) showed more prolonged maturation and delayed declines. FA
   changes were driven by perpendicular diffusivity, suggesting changes of
   myelination and/or axonal density. Tract volume changed significantly
   with age for most tracts, but did not greatly influence the FA and MD
   trajectories. This study demonstrates clear age-related microstructural
   changes throughout the brain white matter, and provides normative data
   that will be useful for studying white matter development in a variety
   of diseases and abnormal conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Measuring safety treatment effects using full Bayes non-linear safety
   performance intervention functions}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{152-163}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Full Bayes linear intervention models have been recently proposed to
   conduct before-after safety studies. These models assume linear slopes
   to represent the time and treatment effects across the treated and
   comparison sites. However, the linear slope assumption can only furnish
   some restricted treatment profiles. To overcome this problem, a
   first-order autoregressive (AR1) safety performance function (SPF) that
   has a dynamic regression equation (known as the Koyck model) is
   proposed. The non-linear `Koyck' model is compared to the linear
   intervention model in terms of inference, goodness-of-fit, and
   application. Both models were used in association with the
   Poisson-lognormal (PLN) hierarchy to evaluate the safety performance of
   a sample of intersections that have been improved in the Greater
   Vancouver area. The two models were extended by incorporating random
   parameters to account for the correlation between sites within
   comparison-treatment pairs. Another objective of the paper is to compute
   basic components related to the novelty effects, direct treatment
   effects, and indirect treatment effects and to provide simple
   expressions for the computation of these components in terms of the
   model parameters. The Koyck model is shown to furnish a wider variety of
   treatment profiles than those of the linear intervention model. The
   analysis revealed that incorporating random parameters among matched
   comparison-treatment pairs in the specification of SPFs can
   significantly improve the fit, while reducing the estimates of the
   extra-Poisson variation. Also, the proposed PLN Koyck model fitted the
   data much better than the Poisson-lognormal linear intervention (PLNI)
   model. The novelty effects were short lived, the indirect (through
   traffic volumes) treatment effects were approximately within 10\%,
   whereas the direct treatment effects indicated a non-significant 6.5\%
   reduction during the after period under PLNI compared to a significant
   12.3\% reduction in predicted collision counts under the PLN Koyck
   model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Herein we report for the first time electrochemical behaviour of anodic

   polarization studies showed that the corrosion resistance was higher for
   heat treated nanotubes than for as-formed nanotubes and conventional
   materials. EIS studies indicated that annealed nanotubes favoured an
   effective passivation. A two layer equivalent circuit can be used as a

Abstract = {{In order to assess the potential application of electrocatalytic
   hydrogenation to petroleum fractions, as an alternative to high-pressure
   hydrotreating, we studied the conversion of a series of model compounds.
   Naphthalene, 1-methyl naphthalene, quinoline, carbazole, and
   dibenzothiophene were reacted in a flow cell over sulfur-resistant
   tungsten disulfide/glassy carbon electrodes. Raney nickel was used as a
   reference catalytic electrode material. The reactants were dissolved in
   a solution of ionic liquid and water, to provide high solubility of
   reactant, high conductivity, and protons for electrochemical
   hydrogenation. Both quinoline and carbazole were hydrogenated on
   WS2/glassy carbon cathodes in the presence of thiophene, but the initial
   current efficiencies were less than 10\%. Conversion of naphthalene was
   detected, but the initial current efficiency was only 1.8\%. Conversion
   of 1-methyl naphthalene and dibenzothiophene was not detected over this
   electrode material. Raney nickel gave higher conversion rates and
   current efficiencies for quinoline, carbazole, and naphthalene, but only
   traces of product from 1-methylnaphthalene were detected. These results
   indicate that current efficiency and sustained conversion rates for
   alkylaromatics and heteroaromatics must be improved considerably in
   order for electrocatalytic hydrogenation to compete with conventional
   hydrotreating. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   adhering to the DNA surface like beads and linear PEIs adhering to the
   DNA surface like cords. The dynamics of each PEI's binding state to the
   DNA during the simulations and how the PEIs neutralize the DNA were
   quantified. For both branched and linear PEIs, the addition of salt ions

Abstract = {{Lake-stream networks dominate much of northern Canada. This study
   explores the hydrological characteristics of an outlet stream from a
   headwater lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Flow hydrographs
   indicated that stream flow was maximal in most of the cross sections
   during the first week of July, and subsequently declined to zero by the
   first week of August 2009 and last week of August 2010. Water balance
   analysis indicated that the lake can be recharged by runoff from the
   catchment, but summer evaporation, combined with groundwater loss,
   caused draw down of lake level below the outflow threshold. Summer
   rainfall in this semi-arid environment was insufficient to overcome
   storage deficits to re-establish flow connectivity between lakes. The
   suitability of the stream sections were assessed for small and large
   young-of-the-year Arctic grayling based on stream geometry, stream flow
   characteristics, stream water temperature, and stream water quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two case studies on the performance evaluation and
   model validation of two industrial multivariate model predictive control
   (MPC) based controllers: (1) a 7-output, 3-input MPC with three measured
   disturbance variables for controlling a part of kerosene hydrotreating
   unit (KHU) and (2) a 8-output, 4-input MPC with five measured
   disturbances for controlling a part of naphtha hydrotreating unit (NHU).
   The first case study focuses on potential limits to control performance
   due to constraints and limits set at the time of controller
   commissioning. The root causes of sub-optimal performance of KHU are
   successfully isolated. Data from the NHU unit with MPC `on' and with MPC
   `off' are analyzed to obtain and compare several different measures of
   multivariate controller performance. Model quality assessment for the
   two MPCs are performed. A new model index is proposed to have a measure
   of simulation ability and prediction ability of a model. Closed-loop
   identification of KHU and closed-loop identification of NHU are
   conducted using the asymptotic method (ASYM) proposed by Zhu (1998). (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to characterize the nanostructures formed from
   assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(alpha-benzyl
   carboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PBCL) in water, determine the
   effect of weight fraction of the hydrophilic block(f(EO)) on their

   delivery of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, valspodar. Three PEO-b-PBCL
   block copolymers having f(EO) ranging from 0.18-0.40 were synthesized.
   Assembly of PEO-b-PBCL was triggered through a co-solvent evaporation
   method. The average critical aggregation concentration (CAC) for
   PEO114-b-PBCL30, PEO114-b-PBCL60, and PEO114-b-PBCL95 was found to be
   62, 41, and 23 nM, respectively. A lower rigidity of the hydrophobic
   domain in nanostructures formed from the assembly of PEO114-b-PBCL60 and
   PEO114-b-PBCL95 in comparison to PEO114-b-PBCL30 was observed. The
   morphology of the assembled structures was characterized by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images of PEO114-b-PBCL30 (f(EO) =
   0.40) showed the formation of spherical micelles with high
   polydispersity, whereas the assembly of PEO114-b-PBCL60 (f(EO) = 0.25)
   and PEO114-b-PBCL95 (f(EO) = 0.18) resulted in a mixed population of
   spherical micelles and vesicles. Valspodar achieved high loading in all
   the three PEO-b-PBCL nanocarriers reaching aqueous solubility of nearly
   2 mg/mL. The morphology of PEO-b-PBCL carrier did not seem to influence
   the pharmacokinetics of the encapsulated valspodar in rats following
   intravenous administration. In conclusion, the results show a potential
   for PEO-b-PBCL nanocarriers as efficient solubilizing agents for
   delivery of valspodar.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method is proposed to design neutral N-phase (N >= 3) elliptical
   inclusions with internal uniform hydrostatic stresses. We focus on the
   study of the internal and external stress states of an N-phase
   elliptical inclusion which is bonded to an infinite matrix through (N -
   2) interphase layers. The interfaces of the N-phase elliptical inclusion
   are (N 1) confocal ellipses. The design of the resulting overall
   composite material consists of four stages: (i) an inner perfectly
   bonded interphase/inclusion interface which is necessary to make the
   internal uniform stress state hydrostatic; (ii) outer imperfect
   interphase layers properly designed to make the coated inclusion
   harmonic (i.e., the uniform mean stress of the original field within the
   matrix is unperturbed); (iii) the aspect ratio of the elliptic inclusion
   uniquely chosen for a given material and thickness parameters to make
   the resulting coated inclusion neutral (i.e., the prescribed uniform
   stress field in the matrix remains undisturbed); and finally (iv) the
   derivation of a simple condition relating the remote uniform stresses
   and the thickness parameters of the (N 2) interphase layers for given
   material parameters which lead to internal uniform hydrostatic stresses.
   We note that another interesting feature of the present results is that
   the mean stress is found to be constant within each interphase layer,
   and the hoop stress in the innermost interphase layer is uniform along
   the entire interphase/inclusion interface. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has excited the scientific
   field due to its potential for wide range of therapeutic applications.
   The pharmacological mediator of RNAi, short interfering RNA (siRNA),
   however, has faced significant obstacles in reaching its target site and
   effectively exerting its silencing activity. Effective pharmacological
   use of siRNA requires `carriers' that can deliver the siRNA to its
   intended site of action. The carriers assemble the siRNA into
   supramolecular complexes that display functional properties during the
   delivery process. This review will summarize non-viral approaches to
   siRNA delivery, emphasizing the current obstacles to delivery and the
   mechanisms employed to overcome these obstacles. The carriers
   successfully pursued in pre-clinical (animal) models will be presented
   so as to provide a glimpse of possible candidates for clinical testing.
   Supramolecular assembly of nucleic acids with carriers will be probed
   from thermodynamics and computational perspectives to understand
   supramolecular structures and their dynamics. The delivery and
   trafficking requirements for siRNA are then dissected and engineering
   approaches to overcoming these barriers will be articulated. The latter
   has been attempted both at the cellular levels, focusing on
   intracellular barriers, as well as systemic level, emphasizing
   macroscopic challenges affecting siRNA delivery. Clinical experience
   with non-viral siRNA delivery is summarized, highlighting the nature
   delivery modes attempted in clinical settings. We conclude with a
   perspective on the future of siRNA therapeutics, specifically
   concentrating on the possible impact of non-viral carriers in the field.

Abstract = {{Bacterial initial adhesion to inertsurfaces in aquatic environments is
   mainly governed by the surface properties of the substratum, which can
   be altered significantly by the formation of conditioning films.
   Bacteria were tested for ability to adhere to bare glass slides and to
   slides coated with alginate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), or Suwannee
   River natural organic matter (SR-NOM). Three Burkholderia cepacia
   strains with different extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion
   capacities were tested. The surface roughness of the slides was measured
   by atomic force microscopy (AFM), but its effect on bacterial initial
   adhesion was not significant. Our results showed the degree (number of
   cells per cm2) of initial adhesion among the three strains of B. cepacia
   was not significantly different, indicating that B. cepacia surface EPS
   did not impact adhesive capacity in the conditions tested. Depending on
   the conditioning film types and ionic strength conditions, conditioning
   film coatings can either enhance or reduce bacterial initial adhesion.
   Bacterial adhesion to bare slides and to alginate or SR-NOM coated
   slides increased with increasing ionic strength; however, a similar
   trend was not observed on BSA coated slides. Although BSA coated slides
   were the most hydrophobic and had the lowest negative surface charge
   among the surfaces tested, bacterial adhesion was not enhanced by the
   BSA coating. The extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory
   was applied to explain bacterial adhesion to solid surfaces. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Nanocomposite materials consisting of platinum deposited on carbon
   nanotubes are emerging electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction
   reaction in PEM fuel cells. However, these materials albeit showing
   promising electrocatalytic activities suffer from unacceptable rates of
   corrosion during service. This study demonstrates an effective strategy
   for creating highly corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts utilizing metal
   oxide coated carbon nanotubes as a support for Pt. The electrode
   geometry consisted of a three-dimensional array of multi-walled carbon
   nanotubes grown directly on Inconel and conformally covered by a bilayer
   of Pt/niobium oxide. The activities of these hybrid carbon-metal oxide
   materials are on par with commercially available carbon-supported Pt
   catalysts. We show that a subnanometre interlayer of NbO2 provides
   effective protection from electrode corrosion. After 10,000 cyclic
   voltammetry cycles from 0.5 V to 1.4 V, the loss of electrochemical
   surface area, reduction of the half-wave potential, and the loss of
   specific activity of the NbO2 supported Pt were 10.8\%, 8 mV and 10.3\%,
   respectively. Under the same conditions, the catalytic layers with Pt
   directly deposited onto carbon nanotubes had a loss of electrochemical
   area, reduction of half-wave potential and loss of specific activity of
   47.3\%, 65 mV and 65.8\%, respectively. The improved corrosion
   resistance is supported by microstructural observations of both
   electrodes in their post-cycled state. First principles calculations at
   the density functional theory level were performed to gain further
   insight into changes in wetting properties, stability and electronic
   structure introduced by the insertion of the thin NbO2 film.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyze the evolution of the implementation
   and integration of standardized Management Systems (MSs) such as ISO
   9001 and ISO 14001. Specifically, we study the implementation of
   different standards during a four-year period (2006-2010) and we examine
   the level of integration of different MS elements such as the resources,
   documentation, goals and procedures during this period. Additionally,
   the paper aims to evaluate the impact of integration on companies over
   time, namely the difficulties experienced by firms during the
   integration of MSs in organizations with more than one MS. In order to
   accomplish these objectives, the first dynamic study on the integration
   of MSs has been undertaken.
   In order to compare firms that integrate their MSs in two different
   moments in time, two empirical studies were conducted, one in 2006 and
   one in 2010. These studies used a survey directed to firms with more
   than one MS in Catalonia (Spain).
   This paper contributes to the understanding of how firms that have an
   Integrated Management System (IMS) integrate their standardized MSs and
   how they perceive the challenges related to managing the IMS over time.
   It also demonstrates that firms integrate their MSs rather than keep
   them separated, therefore showing a tendency toward integration over
   time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{DC microgrids are gaining high momentum under the smart grid
   environment. DC microgrid stability can be an issue under high
   penetration of tightly regulated power converters used to interface
   distributed resources and loads. This paper addresses dc microgrid
   stability under high penetration of tightly regulated power electronic
   converters; and proposes three simple and computationally efficient
   active damping solutions that can be implemented to stabilize a
   controlled voltage-source converter (VSC) interfacing a dc- microgrid to
   an ac system. The proposed active damping methods depend on reshaping
   the VSC impedance by injecting internal-model-based active damping
   signal at the outer, intermediate and inner control loops of the
   voltage-oriented VSC interface. Small signal analysis is conducted to
   assess the system stability under different compensation schemes.
   Moreover, the reshaped source impedance of the VSC interface and the
   modified voltage-tracking dynamics are derived under different
   compensation schemes. Sensitivity and robustness analyses are provided
   to assess the dynamic coupling among active damping and voltage tracking
   controllers. Evaluation results, based on a detailed model of a dc
   microgrid with multiple tightly regulated converter-interfaced loads,
   are provided to validate the developed models and demonstrate the
   effectiveness and robustness of proposed techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A conjugate of distearoylphosphoethanolamine-polyethylene glycol with
   2-(3-mercaptopropylsulfanyl)-ethyl-1,1-bisphosphonic acid (thiolBP) was
   synthesized and incorporated into micelles and liposomes to create
   mineral-binding nanocarriers for therapeutic agents. The micelles and
   liposomes were used to encapsulate the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX)
   and a model protein lysozyme (LYZ) by using lipid film hydration (LFH)
   and reverse-phase evaporation vesicle (REV) methods. The results
   indicated that the micelles and LFH-derived liposomes were better at DOX
   loading than the REV-derived liposomes, while the REV method was
   preferable for encapsulating LYZ. The affinity of the micellar and
   liposomal formulations to hydroxyapatite (HA) was assessed in vitro, and
   the results indicated that all the thiolBP-incorporated nanocarriers had
   stronger HA affinity than their counterparts without thiolBP. The
   thiolBP-decorated liposomes also displayed a strong binding to a
   collagen/HA composite scaffold in vitro. More importantly,
   thiolBP-decorated liposomes gave increased retention in the collagen/HA
   scaffolds after subcutaneously implantation in rats. The designed
   liposomes were able to entrap the bone morphogenetic protein-2 in a
   bioactive form, indicating that the proposed nanocarriers could deliver

Abstract = {{Existing work concerning adaptive control of uncertain teleoperation
   systems only deals with linearly parameterized (LP) dynamic
   uncertainties. Typical teleoperation system dynamics, however, also
   posses terms with nonlinearly parameterized (NLP) structures. An example
   of such terms is friction, which is ubiquitous in the joints of the
   master and slave robots of practical teleoperation systems.
   Uncertainties in the NLP dynamic terms may lead to significant position
   and force tracking errors if not compensated for in the control scheme.
   In this paper, adaptive controllers are designed for the master and
   slave robots with both LP and NLP dynamic uncertainties. Next, these
   controllers are incorporated into the 4-channel bilateral teleoperation
   control framework to achieve transparency. Then, transparency of the
   overall teleoperation is studied via a Lyapunov function analysis.
   Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   adaptive scheme when exact knowledge of the LP and NLP dynamics is

Abstract = {{Complex models can only be realized a limited number of times due to
   large computational requirements. Methods exist for generating input
   parameters for model realizations including Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)
   and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). Recent algorithms such as maximinLHS
   seek to maximize the minimum distance between model inputs in the
   multivariate space. A novel extension of Latin hypercube sampling
   (LHSMDU) for multivariate models is developed here that increases the
   multidimensional uniformity of the input parameters through sequential
   realization elimination. Correlations are considered in the LHSMDU
   sampling matrix using a Cholesky decomposition of the correlation
   matrix. Computer code implementing the proposed algorithm supplements
   this article. A simulation study comparing MCS, LHS, maximinLHS and
   LHSMDU demonstrates that increased multidimensional uniformity can
   significantly improve realization efficiency and that LHSMDU is
   effective for large multivariate problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A cathode-supported SOFC consisting of LSM (La(0.8)Sra(0.2)MnO(3-delta))
   cathode supporter, LSM-Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) cathode functional layer
   (CFL), yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)/SDC bi-layered electrolyte and
   Ni-YSZ anode layer was fabricated by a slurry spin coating technique.
   The influence of the porosity in both the CFL and cathode supporter on
   the electrochemical properties of the cells has been investigated. It
   was found that properly controlling the porosity in the CFL would
   improve the performance of the cells using 02 in the cathode side
   (O-2-cells), with a maximum power density (MPD) value achieving as high
   as 0.58 W cm(-2) at 850 degrees C. However, this improvement is not so
   evident for the cells using air in the cathode side (air-cells). When
   increasing the porosity in the cathode-supporter, a significant increase
   of the power density for the air cells due to the decreasing R-conc,R-c
   (cathode concentration polarization to the cell resistance) can be
   ascertained. In terms of our analysis on various electrochemical
   parameters, the R-act (activation polarization to the cell resistance)
   is assumed to be mainly responsible for the impedance arcs measured
   under the OCV condition, with a negligible R-conc,R-c value being able
   to be detected in our impedances. In this case, a significant decreasing
   size of the impedance arcs due to the increasing porosity in the cathode
   supporter would correspond to a decrease of the R-act values, which was
   proved to be induced by the decreasing R-conc,R-c. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to split up the velocities of atoms of
   flexible molecules into translational, rotational, and vibrational
   components. As a result, the kinetic energy of the system can easily be
   expressed in terms of only three parts related to the above components.
   This is distinct from the standard Eckart method, where the cumbersome
   Coriolis contribution to the kinetic energy appears additionally. The
   absence of such a contribution within the proposed approach allows us to
   readily extend the microcanonical multiple-time-step dynamics of
   flexible molecules to the canonical-isokinetic Nose-Hoover chain
   ensemble by explicitly integrating the translational, orientational, and
   vibrational motion. The previous extensions dealt exclusively with
   translational degrees of freedom of separate atoms, leading to a
   limitation on the size of the outer time step of 100 femtoseconds. We
   show on molecular dynamics simulations of the flexible TIP3P water model
   that the new canonical-isokinetic formulation gives a possibility to
   significantly overcome this limitation. In particular, huge outer time
   steps of order from a few hundred femtoseconds up to several picoseconds
   can now be employed to study conformational properties without loss of
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions in aqueous solutions between a tetrameric naphthenic acid
   in sodium salt (BP10Na(4)) and divalent Mg2+ and Ca2+ cations were
   investigated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and dynamic light
   scattering (DLS). Colloidal aggregation of the tetrameric sodium
   naphthenates to vesicles and micelles enhances its binding with divalent
   cations. In vesicle systems. Ca2+ was found to bind first with
   carboxylate groups located at the external water/lipid interface of
   vesicles. The cations then diffuse through the membrane to interact with
   the inner carboxylate groups. Higher Ca2+ concentration and higher
   salinity gradients enhance cation diffusion. Under solution chemistry
   conditions where micelle dominates. Ca2+ reacts only with outer
   carboxylate groups of BP10Na(4) without any significant cation diffusion
   through the aggregates. The binding of calcium with sodium naphthenate
   is an entropy-driven process where entropy gain comes from the
   dehydration of both cations and carboxylate groups of BP10Na(4). The
   affinity of Mg2+ to BP10Na(4) is much weaker than Ca2+ due to its
   stronger hydration and hence larger size of hydrated magnesium ions than
   hydrated calcium ions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated direct surface modification of nanocolumn relative
   humidity sensors with conformal coatings deposited by atomic layer
   deposition (ALD). TiO2 and Si nanocolumn films were fabricated using
   glancing-angle deposition (GLAD). Both film types were subsequently
   coated with approximate to 0.3-4 nm thick ALD TiO2. The impact of the
   addition of subnanometer TiO2 layers on water contact angle, sensor
   responsivity, and the utility of an ultraviolet regeneration procedure
   has been tested. We have found that TiO2 coatings as thin as 0.5 nm
   provide much of the humidity sensing and regeneration functionality of a
   photocatalytic TiO2 film. In principle, any GLAD film architecture may
   be used as a scaffold for an active sensing layer, decoupling surface
   functionality and nanoscale morphology. Such capability offers an
   additional degree of freedom for designers of nanostructured gas
   sensors. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier By. All rights

Abstract = {{We have studied the activation kinetics of zinc sulfide (ZnS) using
   silver as an activator by a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
   (QCM-D). The zinc sulfide coating on QCM-D sensor was shown to have
   similar crystallographic structure, composition, and surface properties
   as nature sphalerite through the characterization of X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and xanthate adsorption
   measurement using QCM-D. The activation of ZnS sensor by silver was
   confirmed by the mass increase in ZnS sensor coupled with subsequent
   xanthate adsorption during QCM-D measurement, the change of surface
   wettability, and the presence of Ag2S on the surface. Two distinct
   stages on the silver uptake vs. time curve were identified and fitted
   well by a logarithmic function for the initial stage and a parabolic law
   in the later stage, which agrees with the two-stage zinc-silver reaction
   kinetics reported previously. Argon sputtering followed by XPS
   measurement on the ZnS surface demonstrated the penetration of silver
   into the bulk ZnS after activation. The present study is the first of
   its kind to apply the QCM-D technique to investigate sphalerite
   activation, which introduces a new in situ approach to investigate
   surface adsorption and activation in many mineral processes and surface
   modifications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   proposed p-RBF NNs being of a certain functional character and are
   realized by considering four types of polynomials. In order to design
   the optimized p-RBF NNs, a prototype (center value) of each receptive
   field is determined by running the K-means clustering algorithm and then
   a prototype and a spread of the corresponding receptive field are
   further optimized through running Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and
   Differential Evolution (DE). The Weighted Least Square Estimation (WLSE)
   is used to estimate the coefficients of the polynomials (which serve as
   functional connections of the network). The performance of the proposed

Abstract = {{Quasimonoenergetic electron beams with maximum energy > 0.5 GeV and 2

   acceleration with 80 TW, 30 fs laser pulses. Long low energy tail

   The measured peak electron energy decreased with the plasma density,

   showed a threshold electron density of 3 x 10(18) cm(-3) for

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been a lot of interest in using gold nanoparticles

   increase GNP cell uptake and circulation half-life, and to improve its
   bio-distribution in vivo, we chose to coat GNPs with
   1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (sodium
   salt) (POPG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Two different methods were
   used to synthesize POPG-GNPs or PEG-GNPs, but the resulting nanoparticle
   sizes and morphologies were similar. Under the same incubation
   conditions, POPG-GNPs can be uptaken quicker than PEG-GNPs by
   cells-specifically, the maximum uptake was 8 h versus 16 h after
   incubation. In addition, the uptake amount of POPG-GNPs was more than
   that of PEG-GNPs. The uptake processes were confirmed by SEM and TEM
   images. The main reason for the greater uptake of POPG-GNPs can be
   attributed to the structural similarities between the POPG coating and
   the cell membrane as well as GNP aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) is a thin film deposition technique
   capable of fabricating columnar architectures such as posts, helices,
   and chevrons with control over nanoscale film features. Argon
   bombardment during deposition modifies the GLAD process, producing films
   with new morphologies which have shown promise for sensing and photonic
   devices. The authors report modification of column tilt angle, film
   density, and specific surface area for 12 different metal oxide and
   fluoride film materials deposited using Ar-assisted GLAD. For the vapor
   flux/ion beam geometry and materials studied here, with increasing argon
   flux, the column tilt increases, film density increases, and specific
   surface area decreases. With a better understanding of the nature of
   property modification and the mechanisms responsible, the Ar-assisted
   deposition process can be more effectively targeted towards specific
   applications, including birefringent thin films or photonic crystal
   square spirals. (C) 2012 American Vacuum Society. {[}DOI:

Volume = {{82-83}},
Pages = {{27-37}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{An elegant analytical model for the Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage
   (SAGD) process was firstly proposed by Butler and his colleagues for oil
   sands reservoirs in Canada. Some years later, Reis proposed two
   additional analytical linear and radial geometry models that were able
   to mimic the SAGD process satisfactorily. Since then, other mathematical
   models have been developed all with similar approaches considering that
   steam chamber has reached the caprock. This assumption causes the model
   to predict a constant oil production rate, which is not closely the case
   in reality.
   To overcome this shortcoming for practical history matching purposes,
   the current study modifies the Butler/Reis model to simulate the SAGD
   process from the beginning of the steam chamber growth. The study offers
   a circular geometry formulation using a discrete method of analysis,
   called the method of slices, to solve the analytical equations. The
   proposed geometry and formulation show better capability to reproduce
   the SAGD process analytically. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{82-83}},
Pages = {{125-129}},
Month = {{FEB-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Water or gas coning can adversely affect oil production in oil
   reservoirs. In oil reservoirs, a large oil rate can cause upward coning
   of water or downward coning of gas into the well perforations. Once gas
   or water is produced, the oil rate decreases and the cost of water
   and/or gas handling is increased. There is a critical rate below which
   the cone remains stable and does not break through to the wellbore. In
   the present work, a simple-to-use approach, which is easier than
   existing approaches, less complicated with fewer calculations, is
   formulated to arrive at an appropriate estimation of critical oil rate
   for bottom water coning in anisotropic and homogeneous formations with
   the well completed from the top of the formation. This simple-to-use
   correlation can be of immense practical value for petroleum engineers to
   have a quick check on estimating the critical oil rate for wide range of
   condition's without the necessity of any field test trials. In
   particular, petroleum engineers would find the proposed approach to be
   user friendly involving transparent calculations with no complex
   expressions for their calculations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Fronto-limbic dysregulation in major depressive disorder
   (MDD) may be influenced by early life stress and antidepressant
   treatment. The present structural MRI study aimed to determine the
   relationship between amygdala, cingulate and subgenual prefrontal cortex
   volumes in MDD and their associations with child abuse and
   antidepressants.
   Methods: Right-handed subjects (21-50 years), meeting DSM-IV criteria
   for MDD, either with (n =19) or without (n = 20) childhood sexual or
   physical abuse. Healthy controls (n =34) were matched for age, sex,
   education and smoking. 3D-MPRAGE images with a spatial resolution of 1.5
   mm x 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm were acquired with a Siemens Sonata 1.5T system.
   Volumes of subgenual prefrontal cortex, amygdala and affective,
   cognitive, superior and posterior divisions of cingulate cortex were
   analyzed using DISPLAY software using reliable volumetric protocols.
   Groups were compared using ANCOVA, with intracranial volume as a
   covariate.
   Results: MDD subjects had low cingulate (cognitive division) and high
   amygdala volumes. Low cingulate volume was related to abuse and
   treatment history. Amygdala volume was predicted by subgenual prefrontal
   and cingulate (cognitive division) volumes and the presence of
   paracingulate cortex. Limitations: This study was cross sectional and
   the sample size was limited for subgroup and correlational analyses.
   Summary: Our data suggest that MDD may be associated with alterations in
   anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala. Morphological variation, early
   stress and stress-protective factors may contribute to differences in
   fronto-limbic structures in MDD. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the development and application of a hybrid moving
   horizon estimator (HMHE) to achieve simultaneous estimation of both
   continuum and noncontinuum states in a constrained switching dynamic
   system. One of the major issues in a moving horizon estimation approach
   is the development of an arrival cost to summarize the effect of past
   and a prior information. In this work, we have developed a generalized
   arrival cost, which accounts for both continuum and noncontinuum states.
   A generalized hybrid state estimator, which can be used as a stand-alone
   continuum state estimator, or as a simultaneous continuum and
   noncontinuum state estimator, is developed. The effects of constraints,
   process, and measurement noise levels, as well as a moving horizon
   length on the simultaneous estimation of both the continuum and
   noncontinuum states are analyzed. The effectiveness of the HMHE is
   demonstrated through simulation studies, while its practical reliability
   is tested by conducting experimental studies on a distillation column.

Abstract = {{Building mathematical models is a common task in process systems
   engineering, which requires estimation of model parameters as the final
   step of modeling exercise. Model based experimental design has evolved
   as a potential statistical tool for reducing uncertainties in parameter
   estimates. Often a huge volume of process information is generated as an
   end result of an experimental design. Designing optimal experiments
   based on current or prior process knowledge is still an open research
   problem. This paper deals with how information, available a priori, can
   be organized and systematically used for designing robust Bayesian
   dynamic experiments, in the presence of process constraints. The
   designed experiments are `robust' to a poor choice of nominal parameter
   values. Several novel techniques for organizing a priori process
   knowledge are explored from a theoretical view point. The influence of
   proposed prior designs on parameter estimates is demonstrated on a
   semi-continuous baker's yeast fermenter problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   pneumatic actuator with two chambers and four solenoid valves, there are
   sixteen possible input combinations defined directly from the state of
   the four on/off valves present in the system; however, only seven of
   these discrete operating modes are considered both functional and
   unique. Therefore, we introduce a novel seven-mode sliding controller
   that minimizes the position tracking error using modes that have both
   the necessary and sufficient amounts of drive energy and, thus, involve
   reduced switching activity. An analysis of the closed-loop system
   stability is carried out. The performance of the proposed control design

Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is an endopeptidase that has been
   shown to be present in high concentrations during most tissue remodeling
   events, including disease states like active tumor sites, thus making it
   an attractive molecule for use in effecting local delivery of
   therapeutic molecules. Moreover, the use of non-toxic and biodegradable
   nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery is highly sought after. To
   this end, bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (NPs) were stabilized
   with coatings formed using domains of varying sensitivity to MMP-2, viz.
   K(6)GPQG/IASQK(6) and K(6)HPVG/LLARK(6), lysine residues being used to
   facilitate peptide immobilization to the BSA NPs via electrostatic
   interactions, and peptide domains that have a high (HPVG/LLAR) and low
   (GPQG/IASQ) MMP-2 cleavage rate. The MMP-2-induced cleavage rates of
   these two domains (the position of action being noted with a ``/{''})
   have differing kinetics that can be used to provide a novel mechanism
   for facilitating the controlled release of molecules where local
   concentrations of MMP-2 are high. It was found that both surface
   concentration and cleavage domain type influenced the release of the
   model drug (BSA) from these NPs. This stratagem may provide a novel
   pathway for developing multi-functional coatings for controlling the
   local delivery of therapeutics at sites where the presence of various
   enzymes exist as a function of tissue state. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia

Title = {{Visual analysis of diffusion process during oil recovery using a

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the diffusion process between two fully miscible
   liquids in fractured porous media and more specifically, the interaction
   between fluid in a fracture (solvent) and fluid in a porous matrix
   (solute). This type of process is encountered in many different
   applications including enhanced oil (or heavy-oil) recovery and
   groundwater contamination. Experiments were performed on vertical and
   horizontal orientations of 25 mm x 75 mm Hele-Shaw models with different
   boundary conditions. Oil recovery from a unit element reservoir by
   solvent injection was simulated on these models, mimicking solvent
   injection into fractured oil reservoirs. Despite tremendous efforts in
   injection controlled miscible displacement experiments (dispersion
   dominated), purely Fickian-diffusion controlled static experiments (no
   fluid injection) in Hele-Shaw models are very limited. This type of
   experimentation gives a clear understanding of the fluid-fluid
   interaction between oil in the rock matrix and solvent in the
   surrounding fracture.
   We first analyzed the interaction between oil saturated 2-D models and
   the hydrocarbon solvent surrounding it qualitatively. Also provided was
   an analysis of the high temperature water injection that followed this
   process to retrieve the solvent diffuse into the oil saturated model. We
   mainly explored the effects of the model (matrix) boundary conditions
   controlled by the aspect ratio and solvent oil interaction area on the
   process, using the images acquired during the experiments. Results were
   then analyzed quantitatively and two new dimensionless numbers were
   defined as functions of fluid properties and matrix boundary conditions.
   The work concluded that, under a fully static interaction between the
   solvent and oil, the process is strongly controlled by the boundary
   conditions that determined the relative contribution of the gravity and
   diffusion on the interaction process. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to probe asphaltene
   adsorption on gold surfaces and hydrophilic and hydrophobic silica
   particles. The adsorption studies were conducted with solutions of
   various ratios of pentane solvent to model oil (S/O) and asphaltene
   concentrations. The adsorption of asphaltenes on solid surfaces at
   different S/O showed multilayer deposition without reaching equilibrium
   after 16 h. Adsorption of asphaltenes and other components on the
   surfaces were detectable well below the onset of precipitation. The
   amount of material adsorbed increased significantly after the onset of
   precipitation. Adsorption was more pronounced on the gold surface than
   on the silica particles. The swelling of the asphaltene aggregates on
   the surface of the quartz crystal led to restructuring of the adsorbed
   material on the surfaces, depending on the S/O. For S/O > 0, the
   swelling effect suggested open nanoaggregate or polymer brush structure.
   The adsorbed asphaltenes demonstrated more viscoelastic behavior as S/O
   was increased. The kinetics of the adsorption of asphaltenes on gold at
   room temperature suggested the formation of very large, slowly diffusing
   aggregates, even in toluene. These results were not consistent with
   optical microscopy or other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Four joint relay and antenna selection strategies for dual-hop
   amplify-and-forward (AF) multiple-input multiple-output relay networks
   are studied. Two of them require full channel state information (CSI)
   whereas the other two require only partial CSI. The relays are either
   channel-assisted AF or fixed-gain AF type. The first joint selection
   strategy involves choosing the best relay and the best single transmit
   antennas at the source and the relay. The second strategy jointly
   involves choosing the best relay and the best single transmit/receive
   antenna pairs at the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels.
   Moreover, two partial selection strategies, which can be used when the
   global CSI is not available, are also proposed and analyzed. In order to
   quantify the system performance analytically, the exact outage
   probability of all selection strategies is derived in closed-form.
   Direct insights into the system-design are obtained by deriving the
   asymptotic outage probability, asymptotic average symbol error rate,
   diversity order and array gain.}},

   Efficient hydrocarbon recovery requires an understanding of the

   The resulting series of images were used to construct detailed

   nanorneter-scale pores (50-300 nm) inside the solid dolomite matrix. We

   confirmations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{We consider the propagation of a gravity current of density rho(c) at
   the bottom of a two-layer stratified ambient in a horizontal channel of
   height H, in the high-Reynolds number Boussinesq domain. The study
   emphasizes theoretical-analytical modeling, however, experimental and
   Navier-Stokes simulation data are also presented and their comparison
   with theory is discussed. The stratification parameters are S = (rho(1)
   - rho(2))/(rho(c) - rho(2)) where rho is the fluid density, and phi =
   h(1R)/H where h(1R) is the (unperturbed) ambient interface height. Here,
   1 and 2 denote, respectively, the lower and upper layer and c denotes
   the gravity current. The reduced gravity is defined as g' =
   (rho(c)/rho(2) - 1)g. Rigorous results are obtained for the steady-state
   analogue of the classical problem of Benjamin {[}J. Fluid Mech. 31, 209
   (1968)], in which the half-infinite gravity current has thickness h and
   speed U. We thereby demonstrate that the Froude number F = U/(g'1h)(1/2)
   is a function of a = h/H, S, and phi. In general, two solutions (or
   modes) may be realized. Issues of energy dissipation, sub-vs.
   supercriticality with respect to long internal waves and, more
   generally, the influence of upstream-propagating disturbances are
   discussed. For a gravity current released from a lock of height h(0) and
   length x(0), we derive an approximate shallow-water model and show that
   the motion is in this case governed by Xi = H/h(0), S, and phi. Although
   the shallow-water model neglects motion in the ambient layers and
   ignores the impact of propagation on stratification, the gravity current
   front speed in the slumping stage is in excellent agreement with
   measured data. Our theoretical solutions are consistent with previous
   results (in particular, Holyer and Huppert {[}J. Fluid Mech. 100, 739
   (1980)] and Tan et al. {[}Environ. Fluid Mech. 11, 203 (2011)]), but
   have the advantages of being (i) derived without reliance on adjustable
   constants and ad hoc closures; (ii) applicable to a significantly
   broader range of dimensionless parameters; and (iii) better assessed by
   comparison against measured data. The present one-layer shallow-water
   approximation turns out to be a simple and versatile extension of
   existing models for homogeneous and linearly stratified ambients, and
   can be straightforwardly incorporated into the available prediction
   tools for gravity currents. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

   almost completely remove all toluene from synthetic process water at 85
   degrees C and 1 atm feed-side pressure under pervaporative operation.
   Membrane flux was insensitive to toluene over the concentration range
   tested (10-220 mg/L) but decreased with increasing ionic content. This

Title = {{A characterization of electrocardiogram signals through optimal

Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{125-134}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We propose and develop a concept of a granular representation
   of a collection of signals (patterns) where a prototype (representative)
   of such numeric signals is formed as a certain information granule (say,
   a set, fuzzy set, rough set, and alike) instead of a single numeric
   entity. As being more abstract, the granular format of the
   representative of the family of signals is more in rapport with the
   nature of the representation task itself. It is instrumental in
   quantifying the diversity of data and capture their inherent
   distribution characteristics.
   Methods and materials: In the realization of the granular representation
   of the signals, we introduce a certain level of granularity (supplied in
   advance), which in the construction of the granular representative is
   regarded as an essential important modeling asset. A two-phase design is
   developed whose ultimate goal is to optimally allocate (distribute) the
   predefined level of granularity to the individual elements of the
   universe of discourse over which the signals are described. Given the
   nature of the required optimization, the ensuing optimization problem is
   solved by engaging a machinery of population-based optimization, namely
   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Furthermore a number of information
   granularity distribution protocols are proposed. The numerical
   experiments completed for synthetic data and ECG MIT-BIH database
   signals are used to demonstrate the performance of the overall
   optimization algorithm and quantify the effectiveness of the allocation
   of information granularity realized by the PSO. An area under curve
   (AUC) criterion is proposed as a measure to express the quality of the
   overall optimization framework.
   Results: For both synthetic as well as ECG signals, it is shown that the
   method endowed with the PSO identifies the best prototype and spans the
   lower and upper bounds of its granular counterpart. In addition to the
   numeric quantification of the best (optimized) granular prototype, the
   method helps visualizing its bounds. The relative difference in mapping
   performance between the best and the weakest granular prototypes is in
   the range of 18\% (for normal ECG complexes) and over 26\% in case of
   complexes of premature ventricular contraction.
   Conclusions: A complete algorithm of the construction of granular
   prototypes is presented. Treating the granular prototype as a template
   of a given class of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, a matching process
   is facilitated and used as a basis for the design of signal
   classification algorithms. Various realizations of granular prototypes
   can be completed with the use of fuzzy sets or rough sets. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A non-aqueous bitumen extraction process was studied where only toluene
   and heptane. with no water additions, were used to extract bitumen from
   two Alberta oil sands ore samples. One sample had a high bitumen (13.5
   wt.\%) and low fines (5.3 wt.\% <45 pm) contents, while the other sample
   had an intermediate bitumen (10.5 wt.\%) and high fines (23.3 wt.\%)
   contents. Bitumen recovery and product quality were measured under
   different process conditions such as the ratio of toluene to heptane and
   settling time. The Dean Stark procedure was used to determine the
   solids, bitumen and water contents of the extraction products. In
   addition, the water content was determined by the Karl Fischer titration
   method. High bitumen recovery was obtained for both oil sands ore
   samples although the high fines ore sample was more sensitive to the
   extraction conditions, especially the toluene to heptane ratio. A
   product with high purity, containing more than 99.5 wt.\% bitumen on a
   solvent-free basis, was produced at room temperature under the optimum
   extraction conditions tested. The optimum settling time to achieve a
   pure product was less than 10 min, based on solids and water contents in
   the supernatant. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to open up new opportunities in individualized anesthesia
   care, this paper presents a dynamic dose-response model of propofol that
   relates propofol dose (i.e., infusion rate) directly to a clinical
   effect. The proposed model consists of a first-order equilibration
   dynamics plus a nonlinear Hill equation model, each representing the
   transient distribution of propofol dose from the plasma to the effect
   site and the steady-state dose-effect relationship. Compared to
   traditional pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models, the proposed
   model has structural parsimony and comparable predictive capability,
   making it more attractive than its PKPD counterpart for identifying an
   individualized dose-response model in real-time. The efficacy of the
   direct dynamic dose-response model over a traditional PKPD model was
   assessed using a mixed effects modeling analysis of the
   electroencephalogram (EEG)-based state entropty (SE) response to
   intravenous propofol administration in 34 pediatric subjects. An
   improvement in the mean-squared error and r(2) value of individual
   prediction, as well as the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was seen
   with the direct dynamic dose-response model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present interference models for cognitive radio (CR)
   networks employing various interference management mechanisms including
   power control, contention control or hybrid power/contention control
   schemes. For the first case, a power control scheme is proposed to
   govern the transmission power of a CR node. For the second one, a
   contention control scheme at the media access control (MAC) layer, based
   on carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), is
   proposed to coordinate the operation of CR nodes with transmission
   requests. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the interference
   received at a primary receiver from a CR network are first derived
   numerically for these two cases. For the hybrid case, where power and
   contention controls are jointly adopted by a CR node to govern its
   transmission, the interference is analyzed and compared with that of the
   first two schemes by simulations. Then, the interference PDFs under the
   first two control schemes are fitted by log-normal PDFs to reduce
   computation complexity. Moreover, the effect of a hidden primary
   receiver on the interference experienced at the receiver is
   investigated. It is demonstrated that both power and contention controls
   are effective approaches to alleviate the interference caused by CR
   networks. Some in-depth analysis of the impact of key parameters on the
   interference of CR networks is given as well.}},

Abstract = {{In opportunistic relaying systems, only the relay with best channel
   condition among K relays is selected to take part in cooperation. This
   setup efficiently achieves diversity gain. However, the high switching
   rate of such systems may be undesirable due to practical implementation
   issues, for example, the corruption of the data signal by receiver
   switching transients, channel estimation and synchronization failures
   due to excessive switching as well as network control switching
   overheads which increase with increased switching. Recently,
   switch-and-examine relaying whose main advantage is its low switching
   rate, was proposed as a low complexity suboptimal alternative to
   opportunistic relaying. Meanwhile, comparisons of the switching rates of
   opportunistic and switch-and-examine schemes have been undertaken only
   for the case of Rayleigh fading. The switching rates of opportunistic
   relaying and switch-and-examine relaying systems with two or more relays
   operating under Rician and Nakagami-m fading are obtained in closed-form
   or single integral expressions. Results for independent and identically
   distributed fading links are obtained for the case of multiple relays
   and additionally for independent but not identically distributed fading
   links for the two relays case. The closed-form solutions explicitly
   depend on the Doppler frequency of the fading.}},

Abstract = {{Post-combustion CO2 capture from the flue gas is one of the key
   technology options to reduce greenhouse gases, because this can be
   potentially retrofitted to the existing fleet of coal-fired power
   stations. Adsorption processes using solid sorbents capable of capturing
   CO2 from flue gas streams have shown many potential advantages, compared
   to other conventional CO2 capture using aqueous amine solvents. In view
   of this, in the past few years, several research groups have been
   involved in the development of new solid sorbents for CO2 capture from
   flue gas with superior performance and desired economics. A variety of
   promising sorbents such as activated carbonaceous materials,
   microporous/mesoporous silica or zeolites, carbonates, and polymeric
   resins loaded with or without nitrogen functionality for the removal of
   CO2 from the flue gas streams have been reviewed. Different methods of
   impregnating functional groups, including grafting techniques and
   modifying the support materials, have been discussed to enhance the
   performance of the sorbents. The performance characteristics of the
   solid sorbents are assessed in terms of various desired attributes, such
   as their equilibrium adsorption capacity, selectivity, regeneration,
   multicycle durability, and adsorption/desorption kinetics. The potential
   of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is also recognized to determine
   whether these novel materials provide better CO2 adsorption capacity
   under low CO2 partial pressure. A comprehensive critical review and
   analysis of the literature on this subject has been carried out to
   update the recent progress in this arena. A comparison of different
   solid sorbents at different stages is made. It also includes a brief
   review on techno-economic analysis and design aspects of sorbent bed
   contactor configuration. Finally, a few recommendations have been
   proposed for further research efforts to progress post-combustion carbon
   capture.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we fabricate and characterize the properties of
   photopolymerizable proton exchange membranes, formed from composite
   blends of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and sulfonated
   poly(ethylene glycol) phenyl ether acrylate (sPEGPEA). PEGDA-sPEGPEA
   blends were produced through free radical photopolymerization and were
   shown to be easily processed into thin membranes using techniques which
   are compatible with the fabrication of microfluidic fuel cell devices.
   Membrane materials were characterized through electrochemical impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR),
   dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), as well as a host of techniques to
   measure ion exchange capacity, degree of water absorption, and surface
   morphology. We show that PEGDA-sPEGPEA membranes possess favourable
   proton exchange membrane characteristics comparable to those of Nafionl
   based systems, and could therefore be of utility in microscaled fuel
   cell implementations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the thermal stress of the double-ceramic-layer (DCL)
   La2Zr2O7/8YSZ thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) fabricated by atmospheric
   plasma spraying (APS) during thermal shock has been calculated. The
   residual stress of the coating after being sprayed has been regarded as
   the initial condition of the first thermal cycle. The characteristic of
   the stress development during the thermal cycle has been discussed, and
   the influence of the defects on the failure mode during the thermal
   cycle has also been discussed systematically. Finite element simulation
   results show that there exist higher radial thermal shock stresses on
   the ceramic layer surface of these two coatings. There also exist higher
   thermal stress gradient at the interface between the ceramic layer and
   the metallic layer. Higher thermal stress in 8YSZ/NiCoCrAlY coating lead
   to the decrease of thermal shock property as compared to that of
   LZ/8YSZ/NiCoCrAlY coating. The addition of LZ ceramic layer can increase
   the insulation temperature, impede the oxygen transferring to the bond
   coating and can also reduce the thermal stress. Considering from the
   aspects of thermal insulation ability and the thermal shock resistance
   ability, DCL type LZ/8YSZ TBCs is a more promising coating material
   compared with the single-ceramic-layer (SCL) type 8YSZ TBCs for the
   application. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{Intrinsic disorder is relatively common in proteins, plays important
   roles in numerous cellular activities, and its prevalence was implicated
   in various human diseases. However, annotations of the disorder lag
   behind the rapidly increasing number of known protein chains. The last
   decade observed development of a relatively large number of in-silico
   methods that predict the disorder using the protein sequence as their
   input. We perform a first-of-its kind comprehensive empirical evaluation
   of the disorder predictors which is characterized by three novel
   aspects, (1) we evaluate the quality of the disorder predictions at the
   residue, segment, and chain levels; (2) we consider a large number of
   published and accessible to the end user predictors that are evaluated
   on a relatively big dataset with close to 500 proteins; and (3) we
   assess statistical significance of differences between the considered
   methods. Our study reveals that there is no universally superior
   predictor and that the top-performing methods are complementary. We show
   that while recent consensus-based predictors outperform other considered
   methods for the residue-level predictions, some older methods perform
   better for the prediction of the disordered segments. Our analysis
   indicates that certain predictors are biased to under-predict the
   disorder, while some other solutions tend to over-predict the number of
   the disordered residues. We also evaluate the utility of the predicted
   residue-level disorder for prediction of proteins with long disordered
   segments and prediction of the chain-level disorder content. Lastly, we
   provide recommendations concerning development of a new generation of
   consensus-based methods and specialized methods for improved prediction
   of the disorder content.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a stair-step-shaped magnetic pole structure is proposed
   to use in a permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) for its

   by poles to be as close to a sine waveform as possible for the reduction
   of thrust ripple and the increase of motor controllability. An
   analytical model is derived for the PMLSMs by solving Maxwell equations
   and applying the superposition theorem for calculating the magnetic
   field, electromotive force, and thrust/torque of the motor. Magnet
   dimensions are then optimized using the analytical method and genetic
   algorithm, where the reduction of air-gap flux density harmonics is
   considered as the optimization target. Finally, the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new reference symbol (RS) mapping scheme for the
   Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) long-term evolution (LTE)
   and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) downlink is proposed to improve channel
   estimation performance in high-mobility communication scenarios. The
   proposed scheme employs null subcarriers to guard RSs, which helps
   mitigate the effect of intercarrier interference (ICI) on subcarriers
   carrying RSs. Additionally, the proposed scheme allows the ICI gain
   parameters to be estimated via a simple frequency-domain estimator.
   Modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) expressions are derived for the
   proposed scheme, as well as for the conventional RS mapping scheme
   defined in the 3GPP LTE and LTE-A standards to compare their performance
   at high mobile user speeds. These bounds, together with mean square
   errors obtained from simulations, reveal superior performance achieved
   by the proposed scheme in high-mobility scenarios. Additionally, at high

Abstract = {{Motivation: Nucleotides are multifunctional molecules that are essential
   for numerous biological processes. They serve as sources for chemical
   energy, participate in the cellular signaling and they are involved in
   the enzymatic reactions. The knowledge of the nucleotide-protein
   interactions helps with annotation of protein functions and finds
   applications in drug design.
   Results: We propose a novel ensemble of accurate high-throughput
   predictors of binding residues from the protein sequence for ATP, ADP,
   AMP, GTP and GDP. Empirical tests show that our NsitePred method
   significantly outperforms existing predictors and approaches based on
   sequence alignment and residue conservation scoring. The NsitePred
   accurately finds more binding residues and binding sites and it performs
   particularly well for the sites with residues that are clustered close
   together in the sequence. The high predictive quality stems from the
   usage of novel, comprehensive and custom-designed inputs that utilize
   information extracted from the sequence, evolutionary profiles, several
   sequence-predicted structural descriptors and sequence alignment.
   Analysis of the predictive model reveals several sequence-derived
   hallmarks of nucleotide-binding residues; they are usually conserved and
   flanked by less conserved residues, and they are associated with certain
   arrangements of secondary structures and amino acid pairs in the
   specific neighboring positions in the sequence.

Abstract = {{Data-driven soft sensors have been applied extensively in process
   industry for process monitoring and control. Linear soft sensors, which
   are only valid within a relatively small operating envelope, are
   considered to be insufficient in practice when the processes transit
   among several operating modes. Moreover, owing to a variety of causes
   such as malfunction of sensors, multiple rate sampling scheme for
   different process variables, etc., missing data problem is commonly
   experienced in process industry. In this paper, soft sensor development
   with irregular/missing output data is considered and a multiple model
   based linear parameter varying (LPV) modeling scheme is proposed for
   handling nonlinearity. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is
   demonstrated through several numerical simulation examples as well as a
   pilot-scale experiment. It is shown through the comparison with the
   traditional missing data treatment methods in terms of the parameter
   estimation accuracy that the developed soft sensors enjoy improved
   performance by employing the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in
   handling the missing process data and model switching problem. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Pressure-containing structures made from fibre-reinforced polymer
   composites are increasingly used in harsh environments. This is in part
   due to their good corrosion resistance. Assessing the performance of
   such structures often requires consideration of different temperature
   regimes. Compared to metallic structures, pressurized composite
   structures exhibit complex damage behaviour which commonly includes
   fluid leakage that is induced by micro-cracking of the polymer matrix.
   This is an important damage mode to consider since it not only affects
   the pressure capacity of unlined components but also causes reduced
   stiffness and, possibly, fluid ingress into the structure. Leakage
   behaviour, and thus the occurrence of matrix cracking, may conveniently
   be assessed through pressure testing. Since fluid properties vary with
   test temperature, an appropriate testing scheme is required to obtain
   truly comparable leakage thresholds. The work described in the present
   paper involves a permeability based testing methodology.
   Fibre-reinforced tubular specimens were used in this study with either
   an epoxy or bismaleimide matrix material, which are intended for room
   and elevated temperature service, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Misfolded prions (PrPSc) are well known for their resistance to
   conventional decontamination processes. The potential risk of
   contamination of the water environment, as a result of disposal of
   specified risk materials (SRM), has raised public concerns. Ozone is
   commonly utilized in the water industry for inactivation of microbial
   contaminants and was tested in this study for its ability to inactivate
   prions (263K hamster scrapie = PrPSc). Treatment variables included
   initial ozone dose (7.6 to 25.7 mg/liter), contact time (5 s and 5 min),
   temperature (4 degrees C and 20 degrees C), and pH (pH 4.4, 6.0, and
   8.0). Exposure of dilute suspensions of the infected 263K hamster brain
   homogenates (IBH) (0.01\%) to ozone resulted in the in vitro destruction
   of the templating properties of PrPSc, as measured by the protein
   misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) assay. The highest levels of
   prion inactivation (>= 4 log(10)) were observed with ozone doses of 13.0
   mg/liter, at pH 4.4 and 20 degrees C, resulting in a CT (the product of
   residual ozone concentration and contact time) value as low as 0.59
   mg.liter(-1) min. A comparison of ozone CT requirements among various
   pathogens suggests that prions are more susceptible to ozone degradation
   than some model bacteria and protozoa and that ozone treatment may be an
   effective solution for inactivating prions in water and wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional MRI is typically performed with the same orientation
   for radiofrequency slab excitation and slab select phase encoding. We
   introduce independent slab excitation and encoding to create a new
   degree of freedom in three-dimensional MRI, which is the angular
   relationship between the prescribed excitation volume and the voxel
   encoding grid. By separating the directions of slab excitation and slab
   phase encoding, the independent slab excitation and encoding method
   allows choice of optimal voxel orientation, while maintaining volume
   excitation based on anatomic landmarks. The method requires simple pulse
   sequence modifications and uses standard image reconstruction followed
   by removal of aliasing and image reformatting. The independent slab
   excitation and encoding method enables arbitrary oblique angle imaging
   using fixed voxel encoding gradients to maintain similar eddy current,
   concomitant field, or magnetic dipole effects independent of the oblique
   angle of excitation. We apply independent slab excitation and encoding
   to phase and susceptibility-weighted imaging using fixed voxel encoding
   aligned with the main magnetic field to demonstrate its value in both
   standardizing and improving image contrast, when using arbitrary oblique

Abstract = {{A modified mathematical model for simulating gear crack from root with
   linear growth path in a pinion is developed, in which an improved
   potential energy method is used to calculate the time-varying meshing
   stiffnesses of the meshing gear pair while we also take the deformation
   of gear-body into consideration. The formulas for the meshing stiffness
   are deduced when the crack grows as the linear growth path in the
   pinion. A 16DOF dynamic model of a one-stage spur gear system is used to
   study the response from the system considering time-varying meshing
   stiffnesses and different levels of crack growing in the pinion. As
   vibration signals induced by the tooth crack are buried in normal
   vibration signals which are induced by the normal gear pair in meshing
   at the early stage of crack growth, the algorithm combined
   autoregressive modeling method and demodulation method is proposed to
   process the signals to investigate the response characteristics as the
   crack grows, and the comparison of the relationship between indicators
   and the crack levels from different simulation methods are given.

Abstract = {{Conventional geostatistics often relies on the assumption of second
   order stationarity of the random function (RF). Generally, local means
   and local variances of the random variables (RVs) are assumed to be
   constant throughout the domain. Large scale differences in the local
   means and local variances of the RVs are referred to as trends. Two
   problems of building geostatistical models in presence of mean trends
   are: (1) inflation of the conditional variances and (2) the spatial
   continuity is exaggerated. Variance trends on the other hand cause
   conditional variances to be over-estimated in certain regions of the
   domain and under-estimated in other areas. In both cases the uncertainty
   characterized by the geostatistical model is improperly assessed. This
   paper proposes a new approach to identify the presence and contribution
   of mean and variance trends in the domain via calculation of the
   experimental semivariogram. The traditional experimental semivariogram
   expression is decomposed into three components: (1) the mean trend, (2)
   the variance trend and (3) the stationary component. Under stationary
   conditions, both the mean and the variance trend components should be
   close to zero. This proposed approach is intended to be used in the
   early stages of data analysis when domains are being defined or to
   verify the impact of detrending techniques in the conditioning dataset
   for validating domains. This approach determines the source of a trend,
   thereby facilitating the choice of a suitable detrending method for
   effective resource modeling.}},

Abstract = {{A techno-economic model was created in order to develop curves that show
   the typical annual energy savings, rate of return, and payback for
   retrofitting aerial coolers with variable frequency drives (VFDs) for up
   to 50 motors, motor sizes from 4 to 186 kW (5-250 hp), and varying
   climate conditions. The cost savings due to installing a VFD depends on
   the reduction in energy used, as well as the reduction in power demand,
   the capital cost of the VFD, installation cost of the VFD, change in
   operating cost, and cost of electricity. The geographic locations
   examined in this report were Fort McMurray, Calgary, Vancouver, and
   Thunder Bay. This study found that the IRR increases rapidly with motor
   size, becomes greater than 10\% at a motor size of approximately 15 kW,
   and may be as high as 220\% (for the case of fifty, 186 kW motors). The
   IRR is sensitive to the number of fan motors retrofitted with VFDs,
   however the sensitivity rapidly declines as the number of motors is
   increased beyond five. The simple payback period becomes less than 1
   year and nearly independent of number of motors and motor size for
   motors larger than 90 kW. Ambient temperature and geographic location
   affect the profitability of the investment, although the IRR only
   changes by approximately 4\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   The joint computation of beamforming matrices for the transmitter and
   each receiver finger to achieve single-carrier eigenmode transmission

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-76}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Several million tonnes of oil sands coke are generated each year in
   Alberta, Canada as a by-product of bitumen upgrading. Due to its high
   carbon content, oil sands coke can be a suitable precursor for the
   preparation of activated carbon. In this study, delayed and fluid oil
   sands coke were physically activated in a muffle furnace under select
   conditions of activation time (2-6 h), temperature (800-900 degrees C),
   steam rate (0.3-0.5 mL/min), and activation atmosphere (CO(2), CO(2) +
   steam, and N(2) + steam). The activated products were characterized
   using thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, iodine and methylene blue tests. An
   increase in activation time and temperature resulted in higher surface
   areas in both delayed and fluid coke due to an enhanced etching of
   pores. An increase in steam rate led to the production of the highest
   specific surface area (577 m(2)/g) and iodine number (670 mg/g) within
   delayed coke; whereas, a lower steam rate resulted in the production of
   the highest specific surface area (533 m(2)/g) and iodine number (530
   mg/g) in activated fluid coke samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Real-time electromagnetic transient simulation plays an important role
   in the planning, design, and operation of power systems. Inclusion of
   accurate and complicated models, such as the universal machine (UM)
   model and the universal line model (ULM), requires significant
   computational resources. This paper proposes a digital hardware
   emulation of the UM and the ULM for real-time electromagnetic transient
   simulation. It features accurate floating-point data representation,
   paralleled implementation, and fully pipelined arithmetic processing.
   The hardware is based on advanced field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
   using VHDL. A power system transient case study is simulated in real
   time to validate the design. On a 130-MHz input clock frequency to the
   FPGA, the achieved execution times for UM and ULM models are 2.5 mu s
   and 1.42 mu s, respectively. The captured real-time oscilloscope results
   demonstrate high accuracy of the emulator in comparison to the offline
   simulation of the original system in the EMTP-RV software.}},

   thickness for stabilization of largely sp(3) matrix structure distorted

   Meanwhile, an increase in the film thickness promotes an enhancement in
   sp(3) content, the film roughness remains nearly constant as probed by
   spectroscopic techniques and AFM, respectively. The effect of thickness
   on local bonding states of ultrathin ta-C films proves to be the

Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{285}},
Pages = {{68-72}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Several deposits of dense natural clinoptilolite, including one from
   British Columbia, Canada, have been identified which exhibit both high
   zeolite content and essentially no macroporosity or intercrystalline
   voids. Sections of zeolite mineral from the British Columbia deposit
   were machined into thin membranes and used in the pervaporative
   desalination of water samples with varying salinity levels, including
   synthetic seawater. Essentially complete rejection of Mg2+ and Ca2+
   (99.99\% and 98.52\%) and high levels of rejection of Na+ and K+ (over
   97.5\%) were observed when using a synthetic seawater feed at 75 degrees
   C and 1 atm feedside pressure. Water flux through the natural zeolite
   membranes was dependent on the ion concentration in the feed, the
   operating temperature and the feed salinity. At 93 degrees C, water
   fluxes of 2.5 kg/m(2).h and 0.39 kg/m(2). h were obtained for feed
   concentrations of 100 mg/L Na + and 5500 mg/L Na+.respectively. The high
   ion rejection and water flux observed for these rugged and economical
   natural clinoptilolite membranes indicates their potential utility for
   desalination applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dimensional Accuracy of 2 Irreversible Hydrocolloid Alternative
   Impression Materials with Immediate and Delayed Pouring}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE CANADIAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To assess dimensional accuracy and stability of 2
   irreversible hydrocolloid alternative impression materials with
   immediate and delayed pouring.
   Methods: Two alternative impression materials, AlgiNotFS and Position
   Penta Quick, were compared with a traditional irreversible hydrocolloid,
   Jeltrate Plus antimicrobial alginate. Impressions were made of a metal
   model with 4 cylinders of known dimensions, with pouring performed
   immediately or after 4 hours of storage. A digital micrometer was used
   to measure cylinder diameter on the model and the poured casts.
   Dimensional changes were analyzed according to American National
   Standards Institute/American Dental Association (ANSI/ADA) Specification
   19 (2004 version) (alpha = 0.05).
   Results: There were significant differences among the 3 materials,
   between the 2 pour times and as a function of storage time (multivariate
   analysis of variance, p < 0.001). One-way analysis of variance revealed
   no significant differences between the 2 alternative impression
   materials, but changes for these materials differed significantly from
   those for the traditional impression material for immediate (p < 0.05)
   and 4-hour (p < 0.001) pouring. Linear dimensional changes for the 2
   substitute materials were within the limits of the ANSI/ADA
   specification.
   Conclusions: With immediate pouring, both alternative impression
   materials exhibited minimal dimensional changes, which were maintained
   or reduced with 4-hour pouring. For both pouring times, these changes
   were less than 0.5\%.
   Clinical Significance: The minimal dimensional changes observed with
   these irreversible hydrocolloid alternative impression materials after 4
   hours of storage may save chairside time and help to produce accurate
   results for procedures such as partial denture framework, surgical
   guides, and pediatric and orthodontic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of protein secondary structure is essential for
   accurate sequence alignment, three-dimensional structure modeling, and
   function prediction. The accuracy of ab initio secondary structure
   prediction from sequence, however, has only increased from around 77 to
   80\% over the past decade. Here, we developed a multistep neural-network
   algorithm by coupling secondary structure prediction with prediction of
   solvent accessibility and backbone torsion angles in an iterative
   manner. Our method called SPINE X was applied to a dataset of 2640
   proteins (25\% sequence identity cutoff) previously built for the first
   version of SPINE and achieved a 82.0\% accuracy based on 10-fold cross
   validation (Q3). Surpassing 81\% accuracy by SPINE X is further
   confirmed by employing an independently built test dataset of 1833
   protein chains, a recently built dataset of 1975 proteins and 117 CASP 9
   targets (critical assessment of structure prediction techniques) with an
   accuracy of 81.3\%, 82.3\% and 81.8\%, respectively. The prediction
   accuracy is further improved to 83.8\% for the dataset of 2640 proteins
   if the DSSP assignment used above is replaced by a more consistent
   consensus secondary structure assignment method. Comparison to the
   popular PSIPRED and CASP-winning structure-prediction techniques is
   made. SPINE X predicts number of helices and sheets correctly for 21.0\%
   of 1833 proteins, compared to 17.6\% by PSIPRED. It further shows that
   SPINE X consistently makes more accurate prediction in helical residues
   (6\%) without over prediction while PSIPRED makes more accurate
   prediction in coil residues (35\%) and over predicts them by 7\%. SPINE

Abstract = {{A review of literature shows that the majority of papers cite a
   potentially incorrect form of the Cassie and Cassie-Baxter equations to
   interpret or predict contact angle data. We show that for surfaces wet
   with a composite interface, the commonly used form of the Cassie-Baxter
   equation, cos theta(c)=f(1) cos theta - (1-f), is only correct for the
   case of flat topped pillar geometry without any penetration of the
   liquid. In general, the original form of the Cassie-Baxter equation, cos
   theta(c), = f(1) cos theta(1)-f(2), with f(1) + f(2) >= 1, should be
   used. The differences between the two equations are discussed and the
   errors involved in using the incorrect equation are estimated to be
   between similar to 3 degrees and 13 degrees for superhydrophobic
   surfaces. The discrepancies between the two equations are also discussed
   for the case of a liquid undergoing partial, but increasing, levels of
   penetration. Finally, a general equation is presented for the
   transition/stability criterion between the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel
   modes of wetting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Phase behaviour measurement and prediction for ill-defined hydrocarbons
   such as vacuum residue + light hydrocarbons present significant
   challenges, from view-cell design and operation, to thermolysis
   reactions at high temperature to fluid speciation and phase stability
   analysis during equilibrium calculations. In a prior contribution,
   simulated phase behaviour results for Athabasca vacuum residue +
   n-decane mixtures based on the Peng-Robinson equation of state were
   presented. In that work, Athabasca vacuum residue pseudo components that
   were identified exogenously and parameters for the model were computed
   from these pseudo components using the Marrero and Gani group
   contribution method. Here, this thermodynamic model is extended to
   include Athabasca vacuum residue + n-alkanes from n-pentane to
   ndodecane. Only binary interaction coefficient values between residue
   pseudo components and n-alkanes were tuned. Densities of co-existing
   liquid phases present in the three-phase regions are calculated and
   compared to the experimental data for AVR + n-decane. The simulations
   are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with measurements over a
   broad ranges of temperature, pressure, and composition. The results
   presented in this contribution illustrate the reliability of the
   proposed thermodynamic modeling approach and its potential use as a
   universal heavy oil modeling tool for the simulation of paraffinic
   deasphalting, separation and refining processes for ill-defined
   hydrocarbon mixtures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A predictive correlation for the constant-pressure specific heat

Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{313}},
Pages = {{211-226}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{A predictive correlation for the constant pressure specific liquid heat
   capacity (C-p) valid for pure organic compounds and ill-defined mixtures
   such as heavy oil and bitumen is reported. With six universal
   coefficients. the correlation is a function of temperature and a
   similarity variable, alpha, which is proportional to the number of atoms
   per unit mass. Molecule structure is shown to be a variable of secondary
   importance and only the elemental composition of a liquid is required to
   apply the correlation. A training data set comprising 150 experimental
   heat capacity values for 19 liquid organic compounds (including
   paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics, sulphur/oxygen/nitrogen derivatives)
   and 3 molten polymers in the temperature range (207-590) K was used to
   regress coefficients. The correlation was evaluated using a test data
   set comprising 111 heat capacity values for 12 liquid organic compounds
   and 3 molten polymers. The average absolute deviation for the test data
   set was found to be 0.067 J K-1 g(-1). The correlation appears to be
   preferred over the Lee-Kesler correlation, a common reference equation
   for engineering calculations, both with respect to over all accuracy,
   and range of application. The correlation was also applied to two
   ill-defined hydrocarbon liquids, namely Athabasca and Maya pentane
   maltenes. For such ill-defined hydrocarbon liquids neither molecular
   structure nor critical properties are available. Their liquid heat
   capacities were predicted to within 6.0 and 2.8\%. respectively from 325
   K to more than 500 K. This is the first such prediction, and represents
   a significant advance over prior practice. With this new predictive
   correlation, liquid phase heat capacities for ill-defined hydrocarbon
   fluids, such as bitumen, and pure compounds and polymers can be
   predicted with equal ease. The correlation may also be used for the
   development of high-accuracy fluid-specific correlations where warranted
   by customizing one or more of the universal coefficients. (C) 2011

   not been understood completely yet. In this work, we propose an
   intuitional 3-dimension (3D) droplet model along with a reasonable
   thermodynamic approach to gain a thorough insight into the physical
   nature of CAH. Based on this model, the relationships between radius of
   three-phase contact line, change in surface free energy (CFE), average
   or local FEB and contact angle (CA) are established. Moreover, a
   thorough theoretical consideration is given to explain the experimental
   phenomena related to the superhydrophobic behavior. The present study

   800 degrees C. The H-2-fueled cells with naked and plated Ni foam
   current collector have very similar internal ohmic resistance and power
   density, which confirm the good electronic conductivity of the coatings.
   The syngas-fueled cells with Au mesh and plated Ni foam current
   collector reach almost identical power density and internal resistance,
   and the latter has no apparent degradation of power output during
   extended fuel cell stability testing. Thus Ni-P is a promising carbon
   deposition resistant coating of current collector for syngas-fueled
   solid oxide fuel cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Base station (BS) positioning is an effective method for improving the
   performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A metric-aware optimal
   BS positioning and relocation mechanism for WSNs is proposed. This
   technique locates the BS with respect to the available resources and the
   amount of traffic traveling through the sensor nodes. The BS calculates
   its own position over time in response to the dynamic environment in
   which the sensor nodes operate. In most WSN environments, communication
   channel experiences nonlinearity that is influenced by path loss,
   attenuation of signal as it propagated through space, greater than 2. In
   this work, we solved the problem of BS positioning in nonlinear
   environments. We propose a weighted linear or nonlinear least squares
   optimization depending on the value of the path loss exponent. We also
   propose a distributed algorithm that can effectively handle the required
   computation by exploiting node cooperation. The goal is to minimize the
   total energy consumption and to prolong lifetime of the WSNs. The
   performance of the proposed technique is evaluated for various network
   setups and conditions. Our simulation results demonstrate that BS
   positioning and relocation can significantly improve the lifetime and
   power efficiency in WSNs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Abstract = {{A quantum wire with strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction is known to
   exhibit a so-called spin texturing effect in presence of a moderate
   external magnetic field acting transverse to the wire axis and parallel
   to the symmetry-breaking ``gate{''} electric field causing Rashba
   interaction. This effect typically disappears when the external magnetic
   field is made stronger than the effective spin-orbit magnetic field due
   to the Rashba interaction. In this work, we present a detailed study of
   the spin texturing phenomenon in a quantum wire with strong linear
   Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction and an external transverse magnetic
   field. Unlike the pure Rashba case, we observe a persistent spin texture
   even in the limit when the external magnetic field is large and much
   stronger than the effective spin-orbit magnetic field due to Dresselhaus
   interaction. Magnetic field dependence of spin texture is therefore an
   experimentally viable method for identifying the dominant spin-orbit
   interaction in a zinc-blende quantum wire. We show that the local
   distribution of the spin density can be modulated by spin-orbit coupling
   strength, magnetic field, and the Fermi level of the electron gas.}},

Abstract = {{Water soluble organic compounds (OCs), including naphthenic acids (NAs),
   are potentially toxic constituents of oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW) that is generated during extraction of bitumen from Alberta oil
   sands. Ozonation can decrease concentrations of OCs in OSPW. However,
   effects of ozonated-OSPW on multicellular organisms are unknown. A
   10-day and a chronic exposure of Chironomus dilutus to OSPW were
   conducted to assess effects on survival, growth, development, and
   behavior. Two separate batches of OSPW were treated with 30 or 80 mg
   ozone (O-3)/L. Wet body masses of larvae exposed to OSPW were 64 to 77\%
   less than their respective controls (p < 0.001). However, both levels of
   ozonation significantly attenuated effects of OSPW on growth. Similarly,
   chronic exposure to untreated OSPW resulted in significantly less
   pupation than in the controls, with 31\% and 71\% less pupation of
   larvae exposed to the two batches of OSPW (p < 0.05). Emergence was
   significantly less for larvae exposed to OSPW, with 13\% and 8\% of
   larvae emerging, compared to 81\% in controls (p < 0.0001). Both levels
   of zonation of OSPW attenuated effects on emergence. These results
   suggest that OCs degraded by ozonation causes toxicity of OSPW toward C.
   dilutus, and that ozonation attenuates toxicity of OSPW.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This review is intended to highlight and discuss
   discrepancies in the literature of the periodontal ligament's (PDL)
   mechanical properties and the various analytical models, approaches and
   assumptions used in simulating its behaviour. The present study then
   offers to propose a model development that allows for a better
   phenomenological description of PDL behaviour under static, near
   clinical, orthodontic loading conditions.
   Methodology: Searches were performed on biomechanical and orthodontic
   publications (in databases: Compendex, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed,
   ScienceDirect and Scopus).
   Results: The review revealed that significant variations exist, some on
   the order of six orders of magnitude, in the PDL's elastic constants and
   mechanical properties. Possible explanations may be attributable to
   different modelling approaches and behavioural assumptions.
   Significance: The discrepancies highlight the need for further research
   into determining what the key factors that contribute to tooth movement
   are, their correlations and their degree of impact. Despite the PDL's
   definitive role in orthodontic tooth movement, proposed models of the
   PDL's mechanical behaviour thus far have been unsatisfactorily
   inadequate. Hence, there is a need to develop a robust PDL model that
   more accurately simulates the PDL's biomechanical response to
   orthodontic loads. Better understanding of the PDL's biomechanical
   behaviour under physiologic and traumatic loading conditions might
   enhance the understanding of the PDL's biologic reaction in health and
   disease. Providing a greater insight into the response of the PDL would
   be instrumental to orthodontists and engineers for designing more
   predictable, and therefore more efficacious, orthodontic appliances. (C)

Abstract = {{The marginalized likelihood ratio (MLR) approach to fault detection as
   proposed by Gustafsson {[}2] is based on the assumption of improper flat
   priors with infinite support for fault magnitude. This assumption leads
   to the problem that the likelihood function cannot be uniquely defined
   after the occurrence of the fault. In another approach by Dos Santos and
   Yoneyama {[}9] the prior is assumed to follow a Gamma distribution which
   is hard to justify as this selection of prior penalizes low and high
   magnitude faults. However, with presence of safety shutdown systems as
   well as range constraints on sensors and actuators, all process
   variables are generally bounded and this motivates one to investigate
   the possibility of using uniform priors for fault magnitudes. This study
   aims to undertake this task and attempts to discuss the justification
   and the challenges associated with selection of such priors. The outcome
   of this analysis is a new fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme
   that takes advantage of the modified MLR (MMLR) test to accurately
   estimate the time of the occurrence of the fault. The proposed FDI uses
   the MMLR as the detector of time of occurrence of the fault and the
   generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test for the purpose of isolation of
   the fault and estimation of its magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel unknown input observer is proposed for
   discrete-time linear systems. Without using similarity transformations,
   a slightly modified model of the system is obtained and then an observer
   is designed for the modified model. The proposed approach performs state
   and input estimation at the same time, which can be crucial in fault
   detection applications. Based on the linear system theory, necessary
   stability conditions are established and then a Lyapunov-based approach
   is taken to obtain the design LMI's. Simulation results are used to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer.}},

Abstract = {{A novel imaging technique is proposed to visualize phase-change and

   beamforming and postprocessing on a Verasonics system to create a series
   of two dimensional B-scan images before and after an excitation pulse
   from a high-intensity focused ultrasound transducer. This technique
   proves to be a promising imaging technique reliably detecting
   phase-change events of nanodroplets in blood mimicking fluid using a
   wide range of acoustic intensities and cycles of ultrasound at a
   moderate flow rates. This technique could aid researchers in mapping
   targeted nanodroplets for molecular imaging applications and for
   estimating local ultrasound-aided drug-delivery and gene transfection
   non-invasively, in therapeutic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Powders of different compositions of Al-Cu alloys were atomized in
   helium and nitrogen and the microstructure of the atomized droplets was
   examined using X-ray micro-tomography. A method was developed to remove
   X-ray artifacts and background noise from the particles images. The
   method developed involves creating a clean mask file using MATLAB image
   toolbox, followed by applying the mask file to the original image to
   achieve clean images for the particle of interest. Separate features of
   interest in the droplets, such as region of initial growth and primary
   dendrites, were investigated at the various stages of solidification.
   The data is used to estimate the primary phase undercooling of the
   droplets, which will be used in a solidification model as an input to
   estimate the phase fractions. The results will then be compared with the

Abstract = {{The problem of sum-rate maximization with minimum power consumption is
   studied for a decode-and-forward (DF) multiple-input multiple-output
   (MIMO) two-way relaying system consisting of two sources and one relay.
   Two scenarios are investigated. In the first scenario, the relay
   optimizes its own power allocation/beamforming strategy given that the
   strategies of the sources maximize the sum-rate of the multiple-access
   channel (MAC) phase. In the second scenario, the relay and the sources
   jointly optimize their power allocation/beamforming strategies over both
   the MAC and broadcasting (BC) phases. The considered problem of sum-rate
   maximization with minimum power consumption is shown to be nonconvex in
   both scenarios. For the first scenario, an algorithm is proposed to find
   the optimal strategy of the relay. For the second scenario, the sources
   and the relay find their strategies either through transferring the
   original nonconvex problem into corresponding convex problems or using a
   proposed low-complexity algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the
   performance of proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Bioinspired synthetic dry adhesives offer unique potential in the field
   of micro assembly and manipulation. These adhesives, which take their
   basic operating principle from animals like geckos, use van der Waals
   adhesion forces and mechanical fiber optimization to produce significant
   forces. For several years, these materials have been of interest for
   climbing robots and adhesive surfaces due to potential characteristics
   like self-cleaning or anti-fouling behavior, anisotropic adhesion
   strengths and non-transferring materials. These same strengths would
   make these materials an ideal mechanism for handling delicate parts or
   manipulating structures in the field of micro-electro-mechanical systems
   (MEMS) packaging. In this paper, I review the specific fabrication
   processes developed by our group and examine some of the challenges in
   their integration with MEMS assembly and packaging processes. Improving
   normal adhesion strength and directionality of adhesives has been
   completed and work is beginning to focus on reducing polymer transfer
   and improving the anti-static compatibility of the structural materials
   used in the adhesives.}},

   Several test cases were investigated to predict particle velocity- and

   effects of turbulence model selection, dispersed phase wall boundary
   conditions, and interphase force terms on model performance were
   evaluated. The selection of turbulence model had a significant impact on
   the dispersed phase velocity and concentration distributions. Comparison
   of simulations with benchmark experimental data shows clearly that for
   the relatively small particle sizes (similar to 100 microns), poor

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, there has been an increased demand for products
   manufactured using sustainable materials. Natural fiber composites are
   seen as an excellent replacement for synthetic fiber composites due to
   their low density, good mechanical properties (stiffness), good
   thermal/acoustic insulation properties and environmental benefits (waste
   stream utilization and low carbon footprint). While there has been a
   considerable number of studies examining the short-term behavior of
   natural fiber composites, very limited work has been done to
   characterize their long-term durability under cyclic loading. In this
   study, the fatigue behavior of a natural fiber reinforced thermoplastic
   composite material was investigated. Cyclic fatigue experiments were
   conducted on hemp fiber reinforced high density polyethylene (HDPE) at
   various fiber volume fractions, and under both dry and wet ambient
   conditions. Using a stress level concept, a generalized model was
   developed to predict the fatigue life of the various composite
   formulations tested. The concept of pseudo-plastic flow was incorporated
   in the fatigue model to form a new model, which is capable of simulating
   fatigue behavior at different frequencies, fatigue stress ratios and
   volume fractions.}},

Abstract = {{Porous media is an essential part of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
   cells (PEMFC). In order to optimize fuel cell performance and reduce
   catalyst consumption, mass transport in fuel cells needs to be improved.
   Understanding and modelling of mass transport in porous media of fuel
   cell ( e.g. gas diffusion layer (GDL), micro porous layer (MPL) etc.)
   requires a knowledge of transport properties like diffusivity,
   permeability and Knudsen diffusivity. Current research is focused on
   experimental measurement of transport properties of porous media. A
   counter-diffusion bridge (Wicke-Kallenbach setup) has been used to
   estimate permeability, Knudsen diffusivity and effective diffusivity of
   GDLs and MPLs. The obtained transport properties are used with the
   recent theoretical models of multicomponent mass transport to estimate
   transport in fuel cells. The experimental studies show that conventional
   effective approximations like Bruggeman correlations are highly
   overpredicting and do not fully account for all the frictional forces in
   porous media.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge facing PEM fuel cell researchers is the development of
   a cathode electrode model that accurately accounts for the oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) and
   micro-electrode experiments consistently show a doubling of the Tafel
   slope at a cell potential of approx. 0.75V. However, current
   mathematical models repeatedly use a Tafel kinetic model with constant
   Tafel slope, which may lead to inaccurate results. Recently, Wang et al.
   proposed an intrinsic, kinetic model that assumes the ORR is comprised
   of four intermediate steps and two intermediate adsorbed species, with
   the free energies of adsorption and activation used as the kinetic
   parameters. This model is capable of predicting the doubling of the
   Tafel slope and the coverage of the assumed intermediate species. The
   model is extended to include changes in the oxygen concentration with
   changing overpotential and is then implemented in an in-house two
   dimensional, cathode model. Results show the doubling of the Tafel
   slope, resulting in significant losses in the low potential region
   compared to Tafel kinetics. Also shown is the site blocking effect of
   the intermediate species, in particular Pt oxide, which completely
   covers the platinum surface on the catalyst layer in the presence of
   high oxygen concentration, i.e. at low overpotentials. Increasing the
   cell potential favors the reductive transition intermediate step, which
   consumes the Pt oxide and subsequently increases the available platinum
   surface. The change in Tafel slope is caused by this transition from a
   completely oxide covered surface to an oxide free surface.}},

Abstract = {{Axially symmetric fiber-reinforced polymer composite structures such as
   pressure vessels and piping are being widely used in different
   industrial applications where combined loading conditions may be
   applied. It is imperative to determine a suitable fiber angle, or a
   distribution of fiber angles, along the longitudinal direction of the
   structure in order to achieve best performance in terms of mechanical
   behavior and strength for structures subjected to combined loadings. To
   this end, a theoretical study was conducted providing the relationship
   between the fiber orientation and the loading conditions applied to a
   composite structure. The aim of this study is to determine the fiber
   angle variation along the length of an axially symmetric composite
   structure with variable cross-section considering different ratios of
   axial loading and internal pressure. As an initial step, netting
   analysis design theory was implemented in the present study.}},

Abstract = {{Severe cyclic thermo-mechanical operating conditions during delayed
   coking can cause damages in the form of bulging and cracking in coke
   drums. As a result, the industry has to perform costly repairs and
   maintenance shutdowns. Therefore, it is important to understand the
   damage and failure mechanisms of the coke drums and to achieve more
   reliable coke drum design solutions. This paper explores alternative
   selections of clad and base material combinations for coke drum
   applications based on material property data provided in ASME Boiler \&
   Pressure Vessel Code, Section II - Materials. Finite element analyses
   are carried out by simulating two critical loading scenarios in the coke
   drum operation cycle, i.e. the heating up and quenching stages. The
   analysis results show that the major achievement in lowering the stress
   level in the clad layer is due to matching of the coefficients of
   thermal expansion between clad and base materials. In addition, the
   finite element analyses indicate that the differences in Young's modulus
   values play an important role in the variation of maximum stress in the
   coke drum shell during the quenching stage. Among eleven pairs of the
   clad and base material combinations studied, the combination of SA302-C
   as the base and nickel alloy N06625 as the cladding material is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The prospect of micro/nano technology requires the development of
   advanced production processes which joins them into complex systems to
   interact with the macro world. This has led to the evolution of micro
   welding. During the micro welding process, the flow of heat needs to be
   checked so that the essential mechanical and electrical properties of
   the material are not lost. Also, the amount of melting and excess
   evaporation has to be controlled. These can be attained by welding using
   localized heat sources. In the present work, electron beam micro welding
   process is studied and heat transfer analysis has been carried out
   numerically, to obtain the temperature distribution in the material. For
   a specified depth of melting, the effect of Peclet number on the welding
   process is investigated. The study shows that the high Peclet number
   electron beam micro welding process provides two important advantages -
   Control of the maximum temperature on the surface which prevents excess
   material loss, and limited heat transfer under the beam.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term goal of our research is to develop photoacoustic and
   Doppler ultrasound imaging methods for noninvasive estimation of the

   a combined photoacoustic and high-frequency Doppler ultrasound system
   and shown the feasibility of flow velocity and oxygen saturation (sO(2))
   estimation using double-ink flow phantoms. In this work, the results of
   in vitro sheep blood experiments are presented. Blood oxygen flux has
   been estimated at different sO(2) levels and mean flow speeds, and the
   uncertainty of the measurement has been quantified. In vivo experiments
   have been performed on Swiss Webster mice to provide co-registered
   photoacoustic and Doppler flow images with imaging depths of similar to
   2mm. Doppler bandwidth broadening technique has been used to obtain
   transverse flow velocity. The diameter of the blood vessel is similar to
   500 mu m and the mean flow speed is 15cm/s. We are working towards sO(2)
   estimation in vivo and 3D oxygen consumption imaging of tumors at depths

Abstract = {{Recently we have reported in vivo near-real-time volumetric
   optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) using a high
   pulse-repetition-rate (PRR) nanosecond fiber-laser to realize 2
   volumetric image frames per second (fps) within 1mm x 1mm field of view
   (FOV). Based on our previous OR-PAM system, we are developing a
   label-free real-time OR-PAM system in reflection mode for higher
   frame-rates. The system permits imaging of microcirculation
   hemodynamics, and helps make the technology easier to use for
   biologists, providing real-time feedback for focusing and positioning.
   Using a nanosecond-pulsed 532-nm fiber laser combined with fast-scanning
   mirrors, our proposed system demonstrated its capability of sustained in
   vivo imaging of horizontal and vertical translation at 0.5 fps for 1mm x
   1mm FOV (400 x 400 pixels). Also, real-time in vivo imaging of blood
   flow at 30 fps for 250 mu m x 250 mu m FOV (100 x 100 pixels) was
   demonstrated. It is anticipated that the real-time nature of the system
   should prove important in clinical and preclinical adaption, and may
   prove useful for functional brain imaging studies.}},

Abstract = {{The catalyst layer of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell is commonly
   represented in mathematical models as an agglomerate structure of carbon
   catalyst-support particles. There are two prevailing assumptions for the
   structure of the agglomerates. The first is that the pores are filled
   with perfluorosulfonated-ionomer (PFSI). The second is that the pores
   are hydrophilic and are flooded only with liquid water during operation.
   The objective of this work is to develop numerical models for single
   water-filled and ionomer-filled agglomerates in a cathode catalyst layer
   of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and investigate the
   properties of oxygen transport, proton transport, and reaction kinetics.
   The two models provide different solutions for the distribution of
   oxygen and protons, and produce a different reaction profile within the
   agglomerate. Previous numerical water-filled ionomer models in the
   literature have neglected the effect of the ionomer thin film.
   Therefore, the results obtained for both ionomer and water-filled models
   could not be easily compared. In this article, the equations developed
   relate the assumed structure of the agglomerates to the structure of the
   catalyst layer (CL). Results compare the effect of the thin film
   thickness in the two different types of agglomerates and relate the
   phenomena occurring within the agglomerates to overall catalyst layer
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Micro particle image velocimetry forms the basis of modern microscale
   flow measurement techniques. However, the motion of tracking particles
   that have been introduced into the fluid to measure flow velocity in
   micro fluidic flows can be affected by a number of different body forces
   that may not affect the carrier fluid. Under these conditions, molecular
   tagging velocity (MTV) has a distinct advantage in resolving fluid
   motion.
   A MTV approach, based on the photobleaching mechanism, is presented that
   allows any desired pattern of flow markers to be written into the
   region-of-interest to track the flow This allows standard particle
   master shadowgraphy algorithms to be used to track groups of tagged
   molecules in the flow resolving two components of the bulk fluid motion.
   The MTV techniques developed so far for microfluidic application provide
   only a one dimensional flow measurement, typically along the axial
   direction perpendicular to the tagged region. Other tagging methods
   include the use of a grid and a structured mask for macro-scale and
   micro-scale flows respectively. One of the limitations of these
   approaches is that velocity information for only a predefined pattern is
   available. The MTV technique presented here is capable of resolving two
   dimensional flow velocity information with the limitations associated
   with the application of a mask The salient feature of the presented
   approach is the use of a laser scanner which allows unrestricted,
   repeatable and accurate movement of the write laser within the
   field-of-view The temporal displacement of the tagged region is captured
   onto an imaging device.
   The proof of concept of the technique is presented in the current work A
   known flow velocity through a curved section of a 750 pm wide serpentine
   channel is measured using the designed system. The tagged regions are in
   the form of dark dots which advect with the flow The temporal and
   spatial evolution of these tagged regions is tracked to reveal the flow
   information. The aim of this technique is to perform velocity
   measurements in a dielectrophoretic flow of a mixture of nanoparticles
   and the caged fluorescent dye, which may show different flow behavior,
   possibly in two opposite directions due to the charge on them.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, van der Waals and electrostatic interaction energies on a
   nanopattemed rough surface was investigated. Surface element integration
   method (SEI) was applied to determine the interaction between a
   nanostructured substrate and an infinite flat plate. Hemispherical
   protrusions or depressions were mathematically generated on a square
   lattice to represent the rough surface. The size of the asperities and
   the pitch (separation) between their centers were varied. From the above
   calculations, we have analyzed the coupling between the range of the
   interactions and the roughness features of the substrate by comparing
   the ratios of the rough surface to smooth surface interaction energies
   per unit area. At small separations, the rough surface van der Waals
   interaction is seriously attenuated in the presence of protruding
   asperities. This attenuation is less pronounced for depressions. The
   attenuation of the van der Waals interaction due to asperities
   diminishes at large separations. In contrast, attenuation of the
   electrostatic interaction is independent of the separation.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-D scanning molecular tagging velocimetry technique is presented. The
   described MTV technique utilizes a scanning laser system enabling
   two-dimensional flow velocity measurements. The laser scanning system
   allows the tagging of molecules seeded in the flow of any desired
   pattern. This array of small dot markers in the region of interest is
   visualized using an epi-fluorescent optical imaging system. The scanning
   system facilitates the convenient maneuvering of the laser beam allowing
   the tagging of either a single point or a pattern. The laser beam is
   focused onto a single point leading to a more efficient tagging process.
   A standard particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) approach is used to
   resolve the two components of the flow velocity.
   Results obtained show the capability of the designed system to tag a
   region in the centre of the field of view The tagging laser will be
   moved to any desired location within the field of view to tag the
   desired region.}},

Abstract = {{Segmented flow occurs in several microfluidic systems such as monolith
   reactors, cellular systems, and human airways. Liquid-gas bubbles can
   cause different issues in the microchannel by disturbing the flow and

   provides useful information for improving the efficiency of both
   industrial and biomedical devices. Predicting the velocity of bubbles,
   velocity within the liquid slug and the thickness of the thin liquid
   film in the slug flow is one of the challenges in this field. In this
   paper, a novel measurement technique capable of measuring three
   components of the velocity is described and used to investigate the flow
   in the region of the gas-fluid interface of a segmented flow.}},

Abstract = {{Solid surfaces of micro/nanochannels exhibit a certain degree of
   roughness that is incurred during fabrication and/or adsorption of
   macromolecules. The presence of such roughness changes the flow pattern
   in electroosmotic flows (EOF). The present study investigates the effect
   of surface waviness on combined EOF and pressure driven flow (PDF) of an
   electrolyte solution, in a nanochannel having charged walls. The surface
   profile of the top and bottom walls vary either in a varicose or in a
   sinuous mode. The problem is solved by using the Perturbation model, a
   modified linearized disturbance Navier-Stokes equations, by assuming
   two-dimensional combined EOF and PDF between two parallel plates as base
   flow. By discretizing the linearized disturbance equations using the
   Chebyshev collocation method in the wall normal direction and Fourier
   transformation in the flow direction, the perturbed velocity components
   are calculated. The effects of electric double layer (EDL) and amplitude
   of wavy surface on the flow pattern are studied The effects of
   overlapped EDL are also studied as one of the limiting case. The
   formation of circulation regions is observed in the varicose mode
   channel when the EOF and PDF are flowing in the opposite direction. The
   decrease in the number of circulation regions is observed for the
   decrease in the value of average half height of the channel to debye
   length ratio (kappa). Serpentine or triangular type waviness in the
   streamline velocity is observed in sinuous mode type channel when the
   EOF and PDF are in opposite directions. The increase in the waviness of
   the streamline velocity is observed for decrease in the value of kappa
   and increase in the amplitude a when both EOF and PDF are flowing in the
   same direction.}},

Abstract = {{Fiber-reinforced polymer composite piping is known to provide excellent
   corrosion resistance and high specific properties such as
   strength-to-weight ratio. However, the propensity for micro-cracking of
   the polymer matrix and associated potential for fluid leakage, and/or
   insufficient capacity to endure damage from abrasive fluids transported
   in the piping, often requires composite piping to be equipped with
   internal polymeric liners. It has been shown that polyurethane liners
   provide good abrasion resistance and reliable fluid containment. A
   durable bond between polyurethane liner and structural composite pipe
   can be achieved employing suitable manufacturing protocols. This was

Abstract = {{Coke drums are vertical pressure vessels used in the delayed coking

   temperature variation during the delayed coking process causes damage in
   coke drums in the form of bulging and cracking. In order to better
   understand the damage mechanisms, an experimental investigation of coke
   drum material behavior under various thermal-mechanical loading
   conditions was performed. A thermal-mechanical material testing system
   is successfully designed and implemented. Six types of various
   thermal-mechanical cyclic tests were performed: 1. cyclic thermal
   loading under constant uniaxial stress; 2. in-phase thermal and
   mechanical stress cycling; 3. out-of-phase thermal and mechanical stress
   cycling; 4. fully-reversed uniaxial cyclic loading with in-phase thermal
   cycling; 5. in-phase thermal-axial stress cycling with constant
   circumferential stress; 6. in-phase thermal-axial stress cycling with
   mean stress. Some of theses tests are similar to the actual loading,
   scenario experienced by the coke drums. The experimental findings lead
   to better understanding of the damage mechanisms occurring in coke drums
   such as bulging.}},

   etch (ASE) process. Several parameters of the ASE process such as
   etch/passivation cycle time, coil power, platen power, and etching gas

   for simple DOA estimation algorithms at the receive array, it is shown
   that the rotational invariance property (RIP) for the virtual array can
   be guaranteed at the transmit array also by a proper beamspace design.
   The main idea of such beamspace design is to obtain the RIP by imposing
   a specific structure on the beamspace matrix and then designing the
   matrix to obtain a desired beam pattern and a uniform power distribution
   across antenna elements. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages
   of the proposed DOA estimation method based on colocated MIMO radar with
   beamspace design.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new scheme to compress 2D signals using
   parallel compressed sensing. According to this seheme, the
   reeonstruction at the decoder can be performed in parallel. By
   performing certain permutation on a 2D signal, all columns are insured
   to have approximately the same density level and can be sampled using
   the same measurement matrix. In this way, vectorization of a 2D signal
   can be avoided, and thus the size of the measurement matrix can be
   dramatically reduced. We prove that with a good permutation, we can have
   a tighter upper bound on reconstruction mean square error. To illustrate
   this scheme, we apply it to video compression and use two kinds of
   permutations for different frames: the zigzag-scan-based permutation for
   reference frames and the block-test-based permutation for non-reference
   frames. Simulation results show that under the same compression ratio,
   the peak signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by approximately 3-7 dB
   compared to the case without permutation.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer composite materials are widely used in aircraft and wind turbine
   industries due to their high specific stiffness and strength. In this
   study the concept of an electro-thermal anti-icing system is developed
   using composite material. Controlling temperature distribution and
   minimizing energy consumption can be the main benefits of such an
   anti-icing system. The thermal behavior of a composite material, power
   consumption and the type of thermal system were characterized for
   designing the icing mitigation system. Constantan wires as thermal
   elements were embedded inside fiberglass/epoxy composite laminates, and
   the thermal characteristics of the system at specific power levels were
   investigated using thermocouples in a wind tunnel under room temperature
   and cold room conditions. When applying power, the surface temperature
   reached 50\% of its final steady-state value in 20s. To obtain a
   relatively uniform temperature distribution and prevent the formation of
   cold spots on the surface, the maximum distance between the thermal
   elements was 1 cm. The temperature of different points on the surface
   increased with increasing power, and its trend was the same in room
   temperature and cold room tests. In cold room tests, a surface
   temperature above 5 degrees C was reached at the thermal elements and
   between them at 0.42 W/cm, which is sufficient to prevent ice formation
   in icing condition. This power did not cause thermal degradation of the
   composite material.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidics depends on efficient movement of individual drops
   for a variety of tasks, e.g. reagent delivery, mixing, sampling, etc.
   Superhydrophobic (SH) coatings generally show high repellency and low
   adhesion for a variety of liquids. Therefore, SH coatings can provide
   for an efficient drop delivery and hence low energy requirements for a
   fluidic chip. However, wide application of such coatings is hampered by
   fragile nature of such coatings to date. A new SH coating is developed
   that addresses the fragility challenge of such coatings. It is based on
   application of nanoparticles to fluoropolymers. The mechanical
   stability, wear resistance and durability under prolonged liquid
   exposure of this new coating is discussed. It is shown that the new SH
   coating can maintain high contact angles, low contact angle hysteresis
   needed for drop mobility under adverse conditions/application of digital
   microfluidic devices. The developed SH coating can also be sprayed onto
   various surfaces, including glass used in traditional lab-on-chip (LOC)
   devices, or even paper for enabling novel Lap-on-paper (LOP) devices.}},

Abstract = {{Porous transport layers are an integral part of polymer electrolyte fuel
   cells (PEMFC). In order to optimize the catalyst layer performance and
   reduce catalyst consumption, a thorough understanding of mass transport
   through porous media is necessary. Currently, there is a lack of
   experimental measurements of effective mass transport properties of
   porous transport layers. Further, mass transport theories in the
   literature, such as the binary friction model by Kerkhof {[}1], have not
   been extensively validated for porous media. In the present study, mass
   transport measurements have been performed on the porous media of a
   PEMFC, namely a GDL and an MPL. The experimental setup described by Pant
   et al. {[}2] has been used. The setup uses the diffusion
   bridge/counter-diffusion technique for the mass transport measurements.
   The experimental setup has the advantage that it can be used to perform
   studies for pure diffusion and convection-diffusion mass transport. The
   setup also facilitates measurement of permeability of porous media,
   which can then be used in convection-diffusion studies. Preliminary
   permeability measurements of GDL and MPL from the setup show good
   agreement with values available in literature. In preliminary
   experimentation, the conventional diffusivity correlations like
   Bruggeman equation have been found to overpredict the diffusivities.}},

Abstract = {{Freezing of drops on surfaces has many consequences in icing of various
   systems, e.g. micro-condensers. It is known that when a water drop is
   placed on a cold surface and the surface temperature is reduced, it will
   not necessarily freeze when the surface temperature has reached zero
   degrees Celsius. The delay in freezing of a drop on a cold surface is
   not well understood; especially the effect that micro- and nano-texture
   of a surface has this delay. In this study, freezing and melting points
   of water drops on various micro-textured surfaces, i.e.
   superhydrophilic, and superhydrophobic have been measured by
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A comparison of the
   experimental results with smooth hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces
   allows us to understand the roles of surface chemistry and roughness in
   freezing of drops in contact with such surfaces. It is found that when
   the surface chemistry is hydrophobic, roughness will delay the freezing
   and a drop may not freeze until the surface temperature has been lower
   than -15 degrees C. On the contrary, for hydrophilic surfaces, roughness
   will shorten the freezing delay and facilitate formation of ice on the
   surface. This can explain the benefit of the superhydrophobic surfaces
   (SHS) in preventing ice formation.}},

Pages = {{28-37}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has advocated the use of linear intervention models
   developed within a hierarchical full Bayes context to conduct road
   safety evaluations. These models acknowledge that the effects of a
   safety treatment (intervention) do not occur instantaneously but are
   spread over future time periods. Despite the demonstrated advantages of
   such models, the manner in which the implemented countermeasures affect
   safety at the treated locations according to their novelty, direct
   effects, and indirect effects is not completely understood. A novel
   nonlinear intervention model was proposed to better understand how
   safety countermeasures work. To demonstrate the proposed model's
   capabilities, linear and nonlinear (Koyck) models were applied to
   estimate the effectiveness of the installation of shoulder rumble strips
   on a number of highway segments in the province of British Columbia,
   Canada. In addition to providing the best fit, the nonlinear Koyck model
   provided valuable insight into the effectiveness of shoulder rumble
   strips. This model showed an immediate 24.9\% reduction of
   off-road-right collisions after 1 year that decreased with time and a
   19.2\% reduction in collisions as a result of permanent treatment.
   Overall, the findings from this study can have a significant impact on
   the economic evaluation of safety programs and countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of collision aggregation on safety
   evaluation through a case study from the 2001 Signal Head Upgrade
   Program of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, Canada. Three
   types of evaluations were performed. Bivariate intervention models were
   used in the first two evaluations to assess the impacts of different
   collision severity levels {[}severe and property damage only (PDO)] and
   the impact of the time of the collision (daytime and nighttime) on
   safety. In the third evaluation, multivariate intervention models were
   used to determine the safety impacts of the program on each combination
   of collision severity and time of occurrence (i.e., severe daytime,
   severe nighttime, PDO daytime, PDO nighttime). Overall, the results
   indicated that the program was effective in improving the safety of the
   treated intersections. However, the results revealed that aggregate
   analyses could lead to misleading results. Aggregation of collisions
   over time of day indicated that the treatment resulted in significant
   reductions in PDO collisions but not in severe collisions.
   Alternatively, aggregation of collisions over severity levels indicated
   that the treatment resulted in significant reductions in both daytime
   and nighttime collisions. These results were different from the results
   of the disaggregate analysis, in which significant reductions were found
   for all collision types, except for severe collisions during the

   of LLR messages. This paper examines the effect of changing the
   precision of LLRs on the throughput, area and energy efficiency of
   digit-online decoders for the irregular WiMAX rate 3/4A length 1056
   block code. Both single-frame and frame-interlaced decoding are
   considered. Digit-online decoders have a throughput that is largely
   independent of message precision. Frame-interlaced decoding has a higher
   throughput than single-frame, but has an increased energy/bit cost.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical Mechanical Polishing of Copper (Cu-CMP) is an important yet
   poorly-understood nanofabrication technique. In this work, we
   demonstrate that the degree of non-uniformity in polishing rates,
   described by the new quantity MRRNU, relates to the lubrication
   conditions of the polishing couple. MRRNU is the difference between the
   highest and lowest material removal rates (MRRs) recorded across the
   wafer surface, normalized by the average MRR. The polish rate
   non-uniformity that this quantity encapsulates is shown to transition
   from negative (wafer-scale dishing) to positive (wafer-scale doming)
   with increasing Sommerfeld number, for the pad and slurry chemistry used
   here. This is explained by the presence of co-existing lubrication zones
   in the pad-wafer interface. Each of the zones described, namely the edge
   zone, hydrodynamic zone and suppression zone, demonstrate a different
   relationship between pressure and removal rate, resulting in variation
   in MRR across the wafer. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.}},

Abstract = {{The doubly salient permanent-magnet synchronous machine (DSPMSM) is a
   new type of brushless machine with permanent magnet locating in its
   stator pole. Compared with other traditional PMSMs, it can offer
   advantages of high power/torque density, simple mechanical structure and
   wide speed range for high speed cruising, which is attractive to the
   applications of wind energy, plug-in hybrid electrical vehicle, etc.
   However, due to the nature of salient poles in both the stator and
   rotor, the DSPMSM suffers from severe torque and flux ripples for its
   variable magnetic circuits and equivalent air gap length. The
   conventional switching-table-based direct torque control (DTC) receives
   increasing attention for its merits of quick dynamic response, strong
   robustness and simple control structure. However, during the
   conventional DTC algorithm, large ripple of both torque and air gap flux
   often occurs for its hysteresis control based on Bang-Bang modification
   principle. This paper presents one improved strategy to reduce the
   torque ripple of DSPMSM drive system by the help of model based
   predictive torque control (MPTC), which is an improved algorithm in the
   base of conventional DTC. Similar as the traditional MPTC strategy, the
   new algorithm still requires one completely decoupling control scheme.
   By selecting the best voltage vector to satisfy the demands of torque
   and flux, the new method can obviously reduce both torque and flux
   ripples. Comprehensive simulation results are finally presented to
   validate theoretical analysis, and further experiments will be available
   in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{In order to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) system as much
   as possible, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technology has been
   paid more attention during the past decades. Among all the maximum power
   point tracking strategies, the variable step-size MPPT algorithm is
   widely employed due to its high tracking accuracy and fast speed.
   However, most of the existing methods are based on perturbation and
   observation method (P\&O), and some essential parameters such as maximum
   step size and scaling factors are difficult to decide very accurately,
   due to the fact that the slope of power versus voltage (dP/dU) is
   asymmetric at the maximum power point (MPP). In order to avoid this
   defect, a novel variable step-size MPPT algorithm is proposed in this
   paper, which could adjust the step size online intelligently. Compared
   with other variable step-size MPPT algorithm, the new method does not
   need to calculate the maximum step size and speed factor. It can provide
   a simple and effective way to ameliorate both dynamic and steady state
   response characteristics. Plenty of theoretical derivation and
   comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm is
   much faster and more accurate than those traditional fix step-size
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Stability of a haptic teleoperation system is influenced by the
   typically uncertain, time-varying and/or unknown dynamics of the
   operator and the environment. For a stability analysis that is
   independent of the operator and the environment dynamics, Llewellyn's
   absolute stability criterion proposes certain conditions on the two-port
   network representing the teleoperator (comprising the master, the
   controller and communication channel, and the slave) assuming that the
   terminations (i.e., the operator and the environment) are passive. These
   are less-than-accurate assumptions. It is desirable to extend
   Llewellyn's result to the cases where the operator or the environment is
   non-passive. This paper revisits Llewellyn's criterion and relaxes the
   assumption of passivity for one of the terminations. The possibly
   non-passive termination is realistically assumed to have a complex
   impedance with an upper or lower bound on its amplitude or real part,
   respectively. Although the proposed stability criteria are useful for
   any application of two-port network systems, we specifically apply them
   on bilateral teleoperation systems and find the stability conditions
   when the operator or the environment is not passive; this is a result
   that Llewellyn's absolute stability criterion cannot afford.}},

Abstract = {{Instability and poor performance are two well-known problems encountered
   in bilateral teleoperation over a communication channel with variable
   time delays, where force feedback from the slave side is provided to the
   master side. When unknown disturbances or external forces act on the
   master and/or the slave manipulators, the teleoperation system will be
   even more prone to stability and performance degradation. By adopting a
   Lyapunov approach, we present a novel nonlinear disturbance observer
   based control scheme for teleoperation systems that are subject to
   variable time delays and disturbances. Lumping the effects of dynamic
   uncertainties, unknown forces/torques exerted by the human operator and
   the remote environment, and external disturbances into a single
   disturbance term enables us to use a disturbance observer and suppress
   these disturbances in order to alleviate their adverse effects on the
   teleoperation system stability and performance. The proposed disturbance
   observer based control laws guarantee asymptotic disturbance tracking,
   asymptotic position tracking, and stability of teleoperation system in
   both constrained and free motions. Experimental results are presented to
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new adaptive control design method for nonlinear
   telerobotic systems with varying asymmetric time delays is presented.
   Using the proposed controller, it is possible to synchronize the state
   behavior of the local and the remote robots. While prior art on adaptive
   teleoperation has addressed stability in such systems only for constant
   delays, we guarantee asymptotic stability in the presence of delays that
   may be time-varying and/or unequal in the forward and backward
   directions. Using the proposed controller, asymptotic stability of the
   bilateral teleoperation system subject to any bounded varying delay with
   a bounded rate of variation can be guaranteed. The proposed controller
   also has the ability to cope with parameter variations in the dynamics
   of the local and the remote robots. To study the transparency of the
   closed-loop teleoperation system, we prove that the position and
   velocity errors between the local and the remote manipulators converge
   to zero asymptotically. To show the efficiency of the proposed
   controller, simulation results on a pair of two-degree-of-freedom
   manipulators with varying time delays in the communication channel are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{For a pneumatic teleoperation system, sliding-mode control laws ensuring
   both transparency and low switching (open/close) activity of the valves
   are developed. Each pneumatic actuator has four on/off valves, thus
   sixteen possible combinations ({''}operating modes{''}) for the valves
   exist but only seven of them are both functional and unique. While
   previous works have focused on three-mode sliding-based position control
   of one pneumatic actuator, this paper develops seven-mode sliding-based
   bilateral control of a teleoperation system comprising a pair of
   pneumatic actuators. The proposed bilateral sliding control scheme is
   experimentally validated on a pair of actuators arranged in a
   force-position teleoperation architecture. The results demonstrate that
   leveraging the additional modes of operation leads to more efficient and
   smooth control of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable channel estimation is necessary for orthogonal
   frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems employing coherent
   detection to achieve high data rates. Pilot-aided detection algorithms
   benefit from rapid convergence, but suffer from non-efficient bandwidth
   usage. The idea of superimposed data transmission can be enabled for
   channel estimation without sacrificing the data rate. In this paper, we
   first derive the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for channel
   impulse response and then, we propose an iterative joint channel
   estimator and data detector to improve the performance of both the
   estimator and the detector. Furthermore, we derive the variance of the
   proposed estimator and show that the equispace and equipower conditions
   hold for the superimposed pilots to attain the minimum variance of the
   estimator. Simulations show that the performance with perfect knowledge
   of the channel impulse response can be achieved closely by the proposed
   iterative data detector.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-way relaying is a promising approach to enhance the spectral
   efficiency in multi-user communication systems. Several relaying
   strategies have been proposed recently to be used in multi-user
   communication systems. In this paper, we analyze the gap between the
   achievable rate of some of these relaying techniques and the capacity of
   the Gaussian multi-way relay channels (GMWRCs). To this end, for a
   symmetric GMWRC with K users, we prove that lattice-based relaying
   guarantees a gap less than 1/2(K-1) bit from the capacity upper bound.
   Also, we show that decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward relaying
   may have a larger capacity gap than 1/2(K-1) bit depending on the relay
   and users' SNR. Then, we find the SNR regions where these two techniques
   also ensure a 1/2(K-1)-bit gap.}},

   electrophoresis was performed using NuPAGE Novex 4-12\% Bis-Tris gels
   (Invitrogen). Two staining techniques were used, Coomassie blue to
   visualize the protein bands and estimate their molecular weight. The
   second technique is Stains All (SIGMA) was used to differentiate between
   acidic glycoproteins and phosphoproteins which stain blue and other
   classes of proteins which stain red. Samples containing DMP1 were
   further purified using the Hydroxyapatite column. Dot blotting the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   technique for the high-level synthesis of digital filter data-paths. In
   this technique, the cost associated with the final digital filter
   data-path is minimized for obtaining combined area-cum-time optimal
   digital filter data-paths subject to user-specified constraints on the
   number of the required arithmetic functional units. In the proposed
   technique, the digital filter data-path encoding is achieved by
   combining the information regarding the operation scheduling together
   with the information regarding the allocation and binding of operations
   to arithmetic functional units into a single particle. The scheduling,
   and allocation and binding information form the coordinate values of the
   particles in PSO. The salient feature of the resulting PSO technique is
   its fast convergence speed, achieved by ensuring that the (random)
   movement of the particles in the search space in the course of
   optimization are automatically guaranteed to preserve the
   data-dependency relationships in the original digital filter signal
   flow-graph without any recourse to backtracking. The usefulness of the
   proposed PSO technique is demonstrated through the application of it to
   the high-level synthesis of a benchmark elliptic wave digital filter. It
   is observed that the application of the PSO leads to substantially
   faster convergence speeds as compared to the corresponding genetic
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Auction algorithms have been applied in various linear network problems,
   such as assignment, transportation, max-flow and shortest path problem.
   The inherent parallel characteristics of these algorithms are well

   acceleration of auction algorithm to solve assignment problem. The main
   contribution is to set up a flexible platform to generate efficient and
   extendable application-based hardware acceleration. It aims at solving
   both symmetric and asymmetric assignment problem. Experimental results
   show that 10X speedup can be achieved using 128 Processing Elements for
   the problem size of 500.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design, characterization, and testing of a
   close-proximity, real-time thermoacoustic sensor for ultrasound
   intensity measurements. Plexiglass sensors, 20 mm diameter and 3.3 mm
   length, absorbed ultrasound with a frequency of 1.5 MHz, a 20\% duty
   cycle, and a 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency, at intensities between 30
   and 100 mW/cm(2). An embedded system design fit thermistor temperature
   data to a curve relating the temperature rise averaged across the
   backside of the sensor to the applied ultrasound intensity, and
   calculated the corresponding ultrasound intensity. Good linearity was
   demonstrated between the ultrasound intensity measured using a radiation
   force balance, and intensity measured using the thermoacoustic sensor
   when placed in contact with the acoustic transducer: accuracy within 5\%
   of the target value and standard deviation of 4.55\% or less. The sensor
   has an operational temperature range of 22 degrees C to 26 degrees C.
   This design makes for a quick and convenient method of checking
   ultrasound intensity, and also presents the possibility of integrated
   sensor and ultrasound generator systems using feedback loops to achieve
   auto-calibration.}},

Abstract = {{An effective condition monitoring system depends on good observability
   of the effects of a fault. For many damage mechanisms that affect the
   reliability of components in systems, parametric models have been
   developed that describe the rate at which damage accumulates, based
   either on empirical or theoretical models of the physics of the damage
   process. These models can inform the reliability analyst about
   observability of the damage process, and the effect of time-varying
   system behavior on the observable damage effects. Simulations of system
   processes with integral damage models can then be used to determine how
   overall system processes affect damage accumulation in components,
   particularly in time-varying processes, how damage accumulation
   compromises performance of the overall system, and the sensitivity of
   features extracted from signals with respect to fault detection and
   identification. A simple framework is described for incorporating damage
   accumulation into lumped-parameter system models. Examples are given for
   a material handling pipeline process and for a haul truck tire, which
   highlights some specific challenges of relating overall process state
   variables to state variables of a damage process, for choosing sensors
   for a condition monitoring system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the parameter estimation problem for batch
   processes through the maximum likelihood method. Unlike continuous
   processes, a batch process has short operating period and each batch
   repeats the same procedure but with different raw materials. Therefore,
   states and measurements in different batches are not same and should be
   considered individually. However, the feed of material is often adjusted
   according to the performance of previous batches, thus the initial
   states of the next batch are related to the states of the previous
   batch. The proposed algorithm takes individuality and commonality across
   different batches into account and develops likelihood functions
   accordingly. By treating the unmeasured states and the parameters as
   missing variables, the maximum likelihood estimation is accomplished by
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the expectation step, due to
   the complexity of posterior density function (PDF), particle filtering
   methods are employed for the implementation of filtering and smoothing.
   Through iterative optimization, the unknown parameters along with the
   states are estimated. Simulation example illustrates feasibility of this
   method and demonstrates its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Gene therapy has gained widespread interest due to its potential for
   treatment of many genetic diseases. The use of non-viral systems for
   delivery of nucleic acids are of particular interest as they can be
   engineered for high biocompatibility, specificity and targeted delivery.
   Carbohydrate-based non-viral nano-systems, termed as glyconanoparticles,
   have emerged as a unique class of gene delivery systems with the
   potential of having all of these characteristics. Carbohydrates provide
   a stealth layer to delivery carriers without compromising their cellular
   uptake. Furthermore, the targeting efficacies of the glyconanoparticles
   towards certain organs can be tuned either by incorporating specific
   ligands on the surface or by increasing the carbohydrate densities.
   Herein, an overview of the synthesis of different glyconanoparticles and
   their use for gene expression is discussed. Modification of polymeric
   nanoparticles, liposomes, gold and magnetic nanoparticles, quantum dots
   and carbon nanotubes with carbohydrate residues have been achieved and
   used for in vitro and in vivo delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Non-specific adsorption of proteins at the tissue-material interface
   occurs shortly after implantation and is thought to initiate several
   host responses (thrombosis, inflammation, wound healing) as well as
   modify critical therapeutic properties like the drug release profile.
   Furthermore, it has been shown that substrate surface properties can
   dramatically affect the adsorbed amount of proteins, as well as their
   final adsorbed conformation. To further understand how surface
   properties can affect protein adsorption, two drastically different
   types of polymers that represent characteristics crucial for the
   inhibition of non-specific protein adsorption are of interest, viz., the
   `gold-standard' poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and the zwitterionic
   polybetaines. Unlike PEG whose hydration is due to hydrogen bonding
   between water molecules and polar ether bonds of the polymer backbone,
   zwitterionic polybetaines are distinguished by forming a very stable
   hydration shell as a result of a positive and a negative charge on the
   same monomer segment within the polymer chain. Current proposed
   mechanisms of non-specific adsorption and antifouling behaviour of
   polymeric surfaces are largely lacking a detailed understanding of the
   interactions at the molecular level. Therefore, work is continuing to
   utilize these two polymer systems for understanding protein adsorption
   in differing ways. Through controlling secondary structures of peptides,
   it may be possible to systematically discuss how this affects adsorption
   to PEG modified surfaces, as well as the physicochemical properties.
   Moreover, through the use of poly (carboxybetaine methacrylamide)
   (PCBMA), it has been shown to be possible to control the hydration of
   the film, allowing for a systematic evaluation of the effect of
   hydration upon protein adsorption. It is thought that a clear study of
   molecular level events involved in the adsorption of proteins ultimately
   enables us to understand fundamental properties of proteins essential
   for further engineering of clinically relevant surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses how the current practice of bridge inspection and
   assessment can be complemented with long-term structural health
   monitoring (SHIM) data within a bridge asset management framework. A
   brief discussion of asset management is presented with data used in
   current practice and complementary data from SHM. To use any data in a
   timely and effective manner requires an information management system
   that considers all constituents, from bridge owners to decision makers
   to users. Thus a multilayered bridge information system that considers
   multiple end users and includes a broad range of data sources is
   presented. After discussion of the proposed system, the paper presents
   long-term SHM data and inspection and maintenance data from a movable
   bridge in Florida. Dynamic data from long-term monitoring were analyzed
   with time and frequency domain methods as well as statistical methods,
   which were feasible with large amounts of data. The results of the
   analysis showed that certain anomalies at critical components of the
   bridge (e.g., span-lock and gearbox mechanisms) were captured. It was
   also shown that the issues identified with SHIM data were related to the
   operation and maintenance of the bridge, as described in its maintenance
   logs. Integration of monitoring systems with routine maintenance
   applications could be expected to provide timely and effective bridge
   management.}},

   Since direct estimation of these coefficients encounters high

Title = {{Decreased hypertrophic differentiation accompanies enhanced matrix
   formation in co-cultures of outer meniscus cells with bone marrow
   mesenchymal stromal cells}},
Journal = {{ARTHRITIS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The main objective of this study was to determine whether
   meniscus cells from the outer (MCO) and inner (MCI) regions of the
   meniscus interact similarly to or differently with mesenchymal stromal
   stem cells (MSCs). Previous study had shown that co-culture of meniscus
   cells with bone marrow-derived MSCs result in enhanced matrix formation
   relative to mono-cultures of meniscus cells and MSCs. However, the study
   did not examine if cells from the different regions of the meniscus
   interacted similarly to or differently with MSCs.
   Methods: Human menisci were harvested from four patients undergoing
   total knee replacements. Tissue from the outer and inner regions
   represented pieces taken from one third and two thirds of the radial
   distance of the meniscus, respectively. Meniscus cells were released
   from the menisci after collagenase treatment. Bone marrow MSCs were
   obtained from the iliac crest of two patients after plastic adherence
   and in vitro culture until passage 2. Primary meniscus cells from the
   outer (MCO) or inner (MCI) regions of the meniscus were co-cultured with
   MSCs in three-dimensional (3D) pellet cultures at 1:3 ratio,
   respectively, for 3 weeks in the presence of serum-free chondrogenic
   medium containing TGF-beta 1. Mono-cultures of MCO, MCI and MSCs served
   as experimental control groups. The tissue formed after 3 weeks was
   assessed biochemically, histochemically and by quantitative RT-PCR.
   Results: Co-culture of inner (MCI) or outer (MCO) meniscus cells with
   MSCs resulted in neo-tissue with increased (up to 2.2-fold) proteoglycan
   (GAG) matrix content relative to tissues formed from mono-cultures of
   MSCs, MCI and MCO. Co-cultures of MCI or MCO with MSCs produced the same
   amount of matrix in the tissue formed. However, the expression level of
   aggrecan was highest in mono-cultures of MSCs but similar in the other
   four groups. The DNA content of the tissues from co-cultured cells was
   not statistically different from tissues formed from mono-cultures of
   MSCs, MCI and MCO. The expression of collagen I (COL1A2) mRNA increased
   in co-cultured cells relative to mono-cultures of MCO and MCI but not
   compared to MSC mono-cultures. Collagen II (COL2A1) mRNA expression
   increased significantly in co-cultures of both MCO and MCI with MSCs
   compared to their own controls (mono-cultures of MCO and MCI
   respectively) but only the co-cultures of MCO:MSCs were significantly
   increased compared to MSC control mono-cultures. Increased collagen II
   protein expression was visible by collagen II immuno-histochemistry. The
   mRNA expression level of Sox9 was similar in all pellet cultures. The
   expression of collagen x (COL10A1) mRNA was 2-fold higher in co-cultures
   of MCI:MSCs relative to co-cultures of MCO:MSCs. Additionally, other
   hypertrophic genes, MMP-13 and Indian Hedgehog (IHh), were highly
   expressed by 4-fold and 18-fold, respectively, in co-cultures of
   MCI:MSCs relative to co-cultures of MCO:MSCs.
   Conclusions: Co-culture of primary MCI or MCO with MSCs resulted in
   enhanced matrix formation. MCI and MCO increased matrix formation
   similarly after co-culture with MSCs. However, MCO was more potent than
   MCI in suppressing hypertrophic differentiation of MSCs. These findings
   suggest that meniscus cells from the outer-vascular regions of the
   meniscus can be supplemented with MSCs in order to engineer functional
   grafts to reconstruct inner-avascular meniscus.}},

Abstract = {{In the study, we introduce a concept of granular fuzzy rule-based
   systems, offer a motivation behind its emergence and elaborate on
   ensuing algorithmic developments. It is shown that the granularity of
   the fuzzy rules is directly associated with a reduction (compression)
   process in which the number of rules becomes reduced in order to enhance
   the readability (transparency) of the resulting rule base. The retained
   rules are made more abstract (general) by admitting a granular form of
   the fuzzy sets forming their antecedents. In other words, while the
   original rules read as ``if A(i) then B-i{''} their reduced subset comes
   in the form ``if G(A(i)) then B-i{''} with G(.) denoting a certain
   granular extension of the original fuzzy set (which can be realized
   e.g., in the form of interval-valued fuzzy sets, fuzzy sets of type-2 or
   rough - fuzzy sets). It is shown that the optimization of the reduced
   set of rules is realized through an optimal distribution of information
   granularity among fuzzy sets forming the conditions of the reduced
   rules. In particular, it is shown that the distribution of information
   granularity, being regarded as an important design asset, is realized
   through a minimization of a certain objective function quantifying how
   well the granular fuzzy set formed by the reduced rule set represents
   (covers) all rules. In the sequel, we introduce an idea of a granular
   representation of results of inferences realized in fuzzy rule-based
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{A general problem for human-machine interaction occurs when a machine's
   controllable dimensions outnumber the control channels available to its
   human user. In this work, we examine one prominent example of this
   problem: amputee switching between the multiple functions of a powered
   artificial limb. We propose a dynamic switching approach that learns
   during ongoing interaction to anticipate user behaviour, thereby
   presenting the most effective control option for a given context or
   task. Switching predictions are learned in real time using temporal
   difference methods and reinforcement learning, and demonstrated within
   the context of a robotic arm and a multi-function myoelectric
   controller. We find that a learned, dynamic switching order is able to
   out-perform the best fixed (non-adaptive) switching regime on a standard
   prosthetic proficiency task, increasing the number of optimal switching
   suggestions by 23\%, and decreasing the expected transition time between
   degrees of freedom by more than 14\%. These preliminary results indicate
   that real-time machine learning, specifically online prediction and
   anticipation, may be an important tool for developing more robust and
   intuitive controllers for assistive biomedical robots. We expect these
   techniques will transfer well to near-term use by patients. Future work
   will describe clinical testing of this approach with a population of
   amputee patients.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the sensitivity of microwave oven heating and cooking
   performance to load volume, load placement and load properties has been
   a long-standing challenge for microwave and microwave-convection oven
   designers. Conventional design problem and solution methods are reviewed
   to provide greater insight into the challenge and optimum operation of a
   microwave oven after which a new strategy is introduced. In this
   methodology, a special load isolating and energy modulating device
   called a transducer-exciter is used containing an iris, a launch box, a
   phase, amplitude and frequency modulator and a coupling plate designed
   to provide spatially distributed coupling to the oven. This system, when
   applied to a combined microwave-convection oven, gives astounding
   performance improvements to all kinds of baked and roasted foods
   including sensitive items such as cakes and pastries, with the only
   compromise being a reasonable reduction in the maximum available
   microwave power. Large and small metal utensils can be used in the oven
   with minimal or no performance penalty on energy uniformity and cooking
   results. Cooking times are greatly reduced from those in conventional
   ovens while maintaining excellent cooking performance.}},

   systolic (SBP), mean (MAP) and diastolic (DBP) BP based on a 2-parameter
   windkessel (WK) model with dose-dependent total peripheral resistance

   driven by the epinephrine dose, heart rate (HR). Using the epinephrine
   dose and hemodynamic response data collected for young/old normotensive
   and hypertensive subject groups, four group-specific models as well as a
   generalized model were developed and then were evaluated for BP
   estimation performance. The results indicated that the group-specific
   model is superior to its generalized counterpart; on average, the
   root-mean-squared SBP, MAP and DBP estimation errors associated with the
   group-specific model were only 34\%, 52\% and 69\%, respectively,

Abstract = {{In this paper, we developed a low-cost intracellular delivery system
   based on microbubble and high gravity field. We successfully delivered
   FITC-Dextran (40kD) into hard-to-deliver THP-1 cells. The results showed
   that our method achieved high delivery efficiency up to 80\%. It was
   found that the delivery efficiency and cell viability were closely
   related to the centrifuge speed. We speculated that the burst of
   microbubbles causes transient pore opening thus increasing the chance of
   biomolecules entering cells. This fast, low-cost and easy-to-operate
   protocol is very promising for delivering therapeutic genes and drugs
   into any cells which do not actively take up extracellular materials.
   This method is most effective for in-vitro delivery, but after delivery,
   treated cells might be injected back to human for in-vivo imaging.}},

Abstract = {{In the diagnosis of skin melanoma by analyzing histopathological images,
   the segmentation of the epidermis area is an important step. This paper
   proposes a computer-aided technique for segmentation and analysis of the
   epidermis area in the whole slide skin histopathological images. Before
   the segmentation technique is employed, a monochromatic color channel
   that provides a good discriminant information between the epidermis and
   dermis areas is determined. In order to reduce the processing time and
   perform the analysis efficiently, we employ multi-resolution image
   analysis in the proposed segmentation technique. At first, a low
   resolution whole slide image is generated. We then segment the low
   resolution image using a global threshold method and shape analysis.
   Based on the segmented epidermis area, the layout of epidermis is
   determined and the high resolution image tiles of epidermis are
   generated for further manual or automated analysis. Experimental results
   on 16 different whole slide skin images show that the proposed technique
   provides a superior performance, about 92\% sensitivity rate, 93\%
   precision and 97\% specificity rate.}},

Abstract = {{To mitigate the line current harmonics of a high power current source
   rectifier (CSR) system, the selective harmonic elimination (SHE) scheme
   is frequently used due to its low switching frequency and superior
   harmonic performance. However, the SHE scheme only focuses on the
   harmonics generated by the converter itself, it cannot cope with the
   line current harmonics caused by the background grid voltage harmonics.
   In this paper, a selective harmonic compensation scheme using the
   virtual impedance concept (VI-SHC) is presented. This method compensates
   for the pre-existing grid background harmonics using only the line
   current measurement, and provides superior line current harmonic
   performance. This PWM control scheme has been verified by both
   simulations and real-time experiments on a 10kVA/208V CSR prototype.}},

Abstract = {{In three phase converters that use interleaved switching, coupled
   inductors between modules can be used to create a multi-level PWM
   output. To save weight, these coupled inductors can be integrated
   together to use a single three-limb core, but the presence of common
   mode voltages across the three-phase windings significantly reduce the
   converter performance. In this paper, a space vector based approach is
   used to eliminate these common mode winding voltages, allowing efficient
   three-limb coupled inductor operation at standard industrial switching
   frequencies, e.g. 3 kHz. This modulation approach is applied to a
   five-level neutral point clamped coupled inductor inverter (NPC-CII) and
   is intended to allow the use of lower frequency, higher powered devices.
   The proposed approach is compared against an interleaved modulation
   scheme that does not incorporate common mode winding elimination, and a
   10 kW NPC-CII experimental prototype is used to confirm operation.}},

Abstract = {{We derive simple uniform approximations (UAs) for the bit error rate
   (BER), the symbol error rate (SER), and the outage of wireless digital
   communication systems impaired by fading, noise, and interference. The
   striking feature of the UAs is their accuracy over the whole range of
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, whereas the existing high-SNR
   approximations break down as the SNR decreases. The UAs require slightly
   more information than that for high-SNR expressions. The additional
   information required in the case of error probabilities is the several
   moments (fractional) of channel gain, which can be extracted readily
   from the PDF, MGF or the Mellin transform of the PDF. The computation of
   the UA is simple and requires only the solution of a set of linear
   equations. Additionally, we also generalize the previous asymptotic
   results of Wang and Giannakis. The unified asymptotic results of the
   average of an arbitrary performance measure are thus derived. Various
   BER and SER expressions then become special cases of this unified
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{A novel joint beamforming and antenna selection strategy is proposed and
   analyzed for two-way multiple-input multiple-output amplify-and-forward
   relay networks. Specifically, this strategy selects the optimal transmit
   precoding and receiver filtering vectors at the two source terminals,
   and an optimal transmitreceive antenna at the relay terminal based on
   minimizing the overall outage probability. The performance of this
   transmission strategy is quantified by first deriving the exact
   cumulative distribution function of the effective signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR), and thereby, evaluating the overall outage probability, its
   asymptotically exact high SNR approximation and achievable diversity
   order. For a multiple relay scenario, a joint relay, beamforming, and
   antenna selection strategy is proposed and analyzed as well.
   Interestingly, our selection strategies are optimal in the sense of the
   overall outage probability, and hence, in the sense of achievable
   diversity order as well.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a multi-source single-relay wireless network,
   where the relay facilitates transmissions of the sources' signals to the
   destination. We study the relay power allocation among the sources, and
   use the bargaining theory to model the negotiation among the sources on
   fair allocation of the relay power. By assigning a bargaining power to
   each source to indicate its transmission priority, we propose an
   asymmetric Nash bargaining solution (NBS)-based relay power allocation
   scheme. The impact of the bargaining powers on the relay power
   allocation and network performance is analyzed. We show that the
   proposed scheme addresses the tradeoff between the sum-rate of the
   network and the fairness among the sources, and can be adapted to meet
   different requirements in different applications by proper selection of
   the bargaining powers.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of separating simultaneous source blended data
   in applied seismology. Cross-source interference that masks the desired
   signal in the common source domain can be translated into incoherent
   noise by rearranging the data in the common receiver domain. We show
   that applying a virtual blending/deblending process to the data in the
   common receiver domain enables obtaining an additional noisy version of
   the data. By measuring the local similarities and dissimilarities
   between the two noisy versions of the data, it is possible to
   discriminate between corrupt and non-corrupt data points. Corrupt data
   points can be replaced by a weighted sum (e.g., averaging) of
   neighboring non-corrupt data points. The proposed method is applied
   directly in the time-space domain, i.e., no computationally expensive
   data transformation is needed. Moreover, it can be straightforwardly
   extended to higher-dimensional data scenarios. Simulation results are
   given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a multi-pair two-way relay network with multiple single

   subject to a total transmit power constraint is studied for such
   network. The optimization problem is non-convex. First, we show that the
   problem is a monotonic optimization problem and propose a polyblock
   approximation algorithm for obtaining the global optimum. However, this
   algorithm is only suitable for benchmarking because of its high
   computational complexity. After observing that the necessary optimality
   condition for our problem is similar to that of the generalized
   eigenvalue problem, we propose to use the generalized power iterative
   algorithm which can approach the global optimum recursively. Finally, we
   propose the total signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
   eigen-beamformer which is a closed-form suboptimal solution that reduces
   the computational complexity significantly. Simulation results show that
   the proposed algorithms outperform the existing scheme. Moreover, the
   total SINR eigen-beamformer almost achieves the performance of the
   optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of sum-rate maximization in two-way amplify-and- forward
   (AF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying is considered.
   Mathematically, this problem is equivalent to the constrained
   maximization of the product of quadratic ratios that is a non-convex
   problem. Such problems appear also in many other applications. This
   problem can be further relaxed into a difference-of-convex functions
   (DC) programming problem, which is typically solved using the
   branch-and-bound method without polynomial-time complexity guarantees.
   We, however, develop a polynomial-time convex optimization-based
   algorithm for solving the corresponding DC programming problem named
   polynomial-time DC (POTDC). POTDC is based on a specific
   parameterization of the problem, semi-definite programming (SDP)
   relaxation, linearization, and iterations over a single parameter. The
   complexity of the problem solved at each iteration of the algorithm is
   equivalent to that of the SDP problem. The effectiveness of the proposed
   POTDC method for the sum-rate maximization in two-way AF MIMO relay
   systems is shown.}},

   to perform joint iterative detection and decoding in coded
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The SSD offers almost
   optimal symbol error rate (SER) performance over the entire range of
   SNRs, while keeping its complexity roughly constant for uncoded MIMO
   systems. The proposed list SSD (LSSD) further improves the complexity of
   detection schemes in coded MIMO systems, which can greatly reduce the
   number of nodes visited when generating the candidate list. The
   simulation results show that the LSSD achieves mostly equivalent
   performance to the original list sphere decoder (LSD), and much lower
   complexity compared to the LSD.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being recently ratified, the IEEE 802.11p Dedicated Short Range
   Communication (DSRC) 5.9 GHz standard for vehicle-to-vehicle
   communication still does not have a large number of supported radios
   available. This paper outlines the development of an 802.11p
   communication system with adjustable transmission power. The key
   components of the system were a Linux-powered embedded system and a 5.9
   GHz mini-PCI RF transceiver. The software driver controlling the RF
   transceiver had been developed to facilitate communication in the DSRC
   frequency range of 5.85 GHz to 5.92 GHz. A spectrum analyzer was used to
   validate the central operating frequency of 5.9 GHz. Additionally, an
   indoor test confirmed communication between two units at a distance of
   15 m. In a vehicle-to-vehicle test, packet loss of less than 1\% was
   demonstrated when two vehicles traveled together at 60 km/h at a
   distance of approximately 150 m. In the vehicle-to-infrastructure test,
   an average distance of 405 m was measured.}},

Abstract = {{Upgrading or constructing new power transmission lines is a very costly
   and time consuming endeavour. To overcome line capacity problems, some
   utilities have began to employ an alternative approach of incorporating
   Dynamic Thermal Circuit Rating (DTCR) technologies into their existing
   transmission lines to harness underutilized line capacity. However,
   capacity gains that can be obtained from DTCR technologies may be
   hampered by certain segments of given transmission line should they have
   an overall lower ampacity rating compared to the remaining parts of the
   line. If such bottlenecks exist, the overall ampacity rating of the
   entire line is decreased. To maximize gains from DTCR technology, this
   paper presents an intelligent approach of analyzing an existing
   transmission line and searching out bottlenecks by using high-resolution
   meteorological data. The system uses an optimization technique to
   identify segments that will provide the greatest return on investment.
   Carrying out the suggested upgrades will, in turn, increase the
   reliability and provide additional transmission capacity gains. Thus,
   the proposed system will allow utility companies to increase the gains
   from DTCR technology, while maximizing the return on investment in
   construction and upgrading projects.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time digital simulation of electrical machines and drives is a
   cost-effective approach to evaluate the true behavior of newly designed
   machines and controllers before applying them in a real system. Although
   many studies exist regarding the optimized models of power electronic
   drives and digital controllers for real-time simulation, the real-time
   models of electrical machines are still limited to the lumped parameter
   electric circuit models. This is mainly due to the complexity of a
   detailed electrical machine model which makes it computationally
   expensive. This paper presents the modeling, real-time implementation,
   finite element analysis, and experimental validation of a nonlinear
   geometrical permeance network based induction machine model. A nonlinear
   permeance network model (PNM) is developed for the real-time simulation
   of a 3 hp squirrel cage induction machine (SCIM) with closed rotor
   slots. Several studies both under open-loop and closed-loop control
   conditions are conducted and the results obtained from the off-line and
   real-time simulations and the experiment are compared with each other to
   show the effectiveness of the proposed PNM model.}},

   The hardware is based on advanced field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
   using VHDL. A power system transient case study is simulated in real
   time to validate the design. On a 130-MHz input clock frequency to the
   FPGA, the achieved execution times for UM and ULM models are 2.5 mu s

Abstract = {{Smart meter is probably the most visible symbol of the future smart
   grid. Industry hopes that more energy conservation behaviors will be
   induced if customers can access their own energy data from the smart
   meters. However, existing smart meters are not sufficient for providing
   households with the feedback needed to achieve effective energy saving.
   This paper presents techniques that have the potential to make the smart
   meters truly smart in term of metering capability - the tracking of the
   energy consumptions of home appliances. The electrical signatures of
   each home appliance such as harmonics and transients play a significant
   role for this idea, as many appliances inject unique disturbances into
   power system. In addition to demonstrating a potential application of
   the smart meters, this paper shows that power disturbances can have
   positive values and useful information can be extracted from them. This
   represents a new direction for power quality research.}},

   Analysis for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an improved model and controller for nonlinear
   plants using polynomial fuzzy model-based (FMB) systems. To minimize
   mismatch between the polynomial fuzzy model and nonlinear plant, the
   suitable parameters of membership functions are determined in a
   systematic way. Defining an appropriate fitness function and utilizing
   Taylor series expansion, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to form the
   shape of membership functions in polynomial forms, which are afterwards
   used in fuzzy modeling. To validate the model, a controller based on
   proposed polynomial fuzzy systems is designed and then applied to both
   original nonlinear plant and fuzzy model for comparison. Additionally,
   stability analysis for the proposed polynomial FMB control system is
   investigated employing Lyapunov theory and a sum of squares (SOS)
   approach. Moreover, the form of the membership functions is considered
   in stability analysis. The SOS-based stability conditions are attained
   using SOSTOOLS. Simulation results are also given to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a linearly constrained quadratic programming
   (QP) problem arising from cross directional control of large papermaking
   processes. Different from general-purpose QP solvers, we solve the
   optimization problem by taking advantage of the problem structure and
   features, such as positive-definiteness of the Hessian matrix, sparsity
   of the Hessian and constraint matrices. It is implemented based on a
   dual feasible, active-set algorithm, a Schur complement method and a
   warm start strategy. The Schur complement is proved to be nonsingular
   throughout iterations, which makes the solver numerically very reliable.
   In comparison with the standard Matlab QP solver, the proposed QP solver
   is much more efficient in the case studies we performed on real
   industrial papermaking processes.}},

Abstract = {{There are many industrial and biological reaction-diffusion systems
   which exhibit time-varying features where certain parameters of the
   system change during the process. The underlying transport-phenomena are
   often modelled using parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs)
   with time-varying coefficients which describe the dynamics of the
   process. Often it is of interest to control this dynamical behaviour
   such as the regulation of temperature or concentration, and one approach
   is the use of infinite-dimensional systems theory to represent the PDE
   models, with time-varying process parameters, as abstract nonautonomous
   evolution equations on appropriately defined function spaces. In
   contrast to time-invariant control problems, the theory for
   controllability and observability for time-varying systems is less well
   established. In this work, we consider some pertinent aspects regarding
   the controllability and observability of nonautonomous
   infinite-dimensional systems. An example is considered for which the
   conditions for exact, null, and approximate controllability and
   observability are verified, and some observations regarding the
   influence of time-varying input and measurement operators are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Separation cells used in primary extraction in the oil sands industry
   are integral components in the overall process of bitumen extraction.
   Good regulation of the interface level between the bitumen froth and the
   middlings in these cells can result in a significant improvement in
   bitumen recovery and heavily influence process economics. This paper
   details a case study application of identification and the design of a
   model based predictive controller for the separation cell process. Model
   predictive control (MPC) using linear models is designed, implemented
   and tested in real time on the industrial separation cell. The test
   results show that the MPC scheme provides significant benefits over
   current operation which uses a PID controller. The benefits include
   significant reduction in the variance of the interface level and
   underflow pump movement, resulting in higher bitumen recovery, smoother
   operations downstream and pump energy savings.}},

   root cause and hazard propagation analysis. Several methods provide
   effective solutions to this problem for linear relationships. For
   nonlinear situations, currently only causality analysis can be
   conducted, but the direct causality cannot be identified based on
   process data. In this paper, we describe a direct causality detection
   approach suitable for both linear and nonlinear connections. Based on an
   extension of the transfer entropy approach, a direct transfer entropy
   (DTE) concept is proposed to detect whether there is a direct
   information and/or material flow pathway from one variable to another. A
   discrete DTE and a differential DTE are defined for discrete and
   continuous random variables, respectively; and the relationship between
   them is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   illustrated by two examples and an experimental case study.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we explore a methodology to compute the empirical
   eigenfunctions for the order-reduction of nonlinear parabolic partial
   differential equations (PDEs) system with time-varying domain. The idea
   behind this method is to obtain the mapping functional, which relates
   the time-evolution scalar physical property solution ensemble of the
   nonlinear parabolic PDE with the time-varying domain to a fixed
   reference domain, while preserving space invariant properties of the raw
   solution ensemble. Subsequently, the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition is
   applied to the solution ensemble with fixed spatial domain resulting in
   a set of optimal eigenfunctions that capture the most energy of data.
   Further, the low dimensional set of empirical eigenfunctions is mapped
   ({''}pushed-back{''}) on the time-varying domain by an appropriate
   mapping resulting in the basis for the construction of the reduced-order
   model of the parabolic PDEs with time-varying domain. Finally, this
   methodology is applied in the representative cases of calculation of
   empirical eigenfunctions in the case of one and two dimensional model of
   nonlinear reaction-diffusion parabolic PDE systems with analytically
   defined domain evolutions. In particular, the design of both mappings
   which relate the raw data and function spaces transformations from the
   time-varying to time-invariant domain are designed to preserve dynamic
   features of the scalar physical property and we provide comparisons
   among reduced and high order fidelity models.}},

Abstract = {{In process plants, alarms are configured to notify operators of any
   abnormalities or faults. However, in practice a majority of raised
   alarms are false or nuisance and create problems for operators as they
   face an increasing number of alarms to handle. Adding delay-timers is a
   simple technique that can reduce this problem and is widely exercised in
   industry. In this work we propose a generalized delay-timer framework
   where instead of consecutive n samples in the conventional case, n(1)
   out of n consecutive samples (n(1) <= n) are considered to raise an
   alarm. For the generalized delay-timer, two important performance
   indices, namely, the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed alarm rate
   (MAR) are calculated using Markov processes. Also the performance of
   generalized delay-timers is compared with conventional delay-timers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a common practical problem where the output of a
   nonlinear sampled-data system is constrained to be measured at a
   relatively lower sampling rate. Designing a continuous-time controller
   that satisfies a specific dissipation inequality, the dissipativity of
   the digitally implementation of the emulated controller in a multirate
   control scheme is analyzed. It is shown that the closed-loop multirate
   system preserves similar dissipation inequality for the state feedback
   law in a semiglobal practical sense. Moreover, we propose a unified
   framework for designing nonlinear multirate sampled-data control systems
   in presence of disturbance inputs via emulation method and the multirate
   nonlinear H-infinity control is addressed as a special application.
   Simulation results validate that the H-infinity performance criterion is
   achieved not only with a preferable behavior but also under much lower
   measurement sampling rate, in comparison with the fast single-rate
   setup.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, the break between successive missions provides an
   opportunity to perform maintenance under limited resources. Such
   maintenance policy is called selective maintenance. Traditionally, it
   was assumed that a component after repair may be as good as new or as
   bad as old. However, maintenance can bring a component in between these
   two extreme cases as well. This maintenance policy is called imperfect
   repair. Selective maintenance optimization under imperfect repair is
   studied in this paper. Age reduction model is used to represent
   imperfect repair for selective maintenance. It is suggested in {[}1]
   that age reduction factor depends on the maintenance cost, and a
   constant is used to reflect whether a component is relatively young or
   old. In this paper, a formulation is used for this characteristic
   constant which depends on the effective age of the component. It is
   shown that the formulation helps in establishing a relationship between
   age reduction factor, cost of maintenance, and effective age of the
   component. Also, advantage of selective maintenance with imperfect
   repair is shown and results are compared with the case when only minimal
   repair and replacement are considered as repair options.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation process associated with a mechanical device can be
   represented by a discrete type of multi-state degradation model. Each
   discrete state in a multi-state degradation model corresponds to a
   certain health status of the device. In this paper, a general type of
   multi-state degradation model is considered for a device for which the
   health states are not directly observable and instead, indirect
   information is available through condition monitoring. We first
   demonstrate how nonhomogeneous continuous-time hidden semi-Markov
   process can be used to model a multi-state degradation process and then
   briefly review an unsupervised estimation procedure, which can be used
   to estimate the unknown characteristics of the stochastic processes
   associated with the degradation process and the observation process of a
   multi-state device. A simple numerical example is provided to
   demonstrate the application of the presented model.}},

Abstract = {{Rotary comb-drive electrostatic actuators with virtual pivotal point of
   rotation were designed and fabricated for their application in external
   cavity tunable lasers in Littman configuration. Silicon on insulator
   (SOI) wafers with device layer thickness of 50 mu m and buried oxide
   layer of 2 mu m were used. The structures were fabricated through bulk
   micromachining of the device layer followed by release of movable arms
   through wet etching. Six pairs of comb arms were used to symmetrically
   distribute electrostatic forces on an interconnected movable arm
   structure. The movable structure consisting of stiff truss connectors in
   arc shapes on inner and outer periphery was anchored through three
   beams. Actuation of the movable arms on a circular profile with a
   virtual pivotal point was achieved for the designed range of operation.
   A maximum rotation of +/- 1.5 degrees at 190 V was achieved. The
   dimensions of the movable arm are on the order of 1.2-1.5 mm. The
   actuators have a physical clearance of up to 2.8 mm from the device
   structure to the virtual pivot point. The sidewalls of the movable arms
   are accessible for optical applications. The geometrical configuration
   of the fabricated structures supports the stringent requirements of
   optical path alignments in external cavity lasers. The fabricated
   structures can be reliably operated in the kilohertz range.}},

Abstract = {{Using a microfabricated porous media mimic platform, we investigated how
   fluid flow influences the formation of filamentous structures, known as
   streamers, between porous media structures. We demonstrate how
   hydrodynamics govern the formation, morphology and the distribution of
   these biofilm streamers in the device. Our work establishes that, under
   favorable hydrodynamic conditions, streamers can often act as precursors
   to mature microbial structures found in complex geometries, such as
   those involved in porous media.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THERMAL STRESSES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1076-1094}},
Abstract = {{In real applications, beam resonators in MEMS/NEMS often vibrate beyond
   the linear regime. The present paper aims to study the effect of
   large-deflection on thermoelastic dissipation of doubly-clamped
   microbeam resonators. Detailed formulas are derived for quality (Q-)
   factor due to thermoelastic dissipation which depends on the amplitude
   of vibration deflection. Under adiabatic or isothermal surface thermal
   conditions, the nonlinear effect of large-deflection on thermoelastic
   dissipation is demonstrated with a comparison to the results based on
   linearized small deflection vibration. Our results show that
   thermoelastic dissipation is reduced monotonically with increasing
   amplitude of vibration deflection under adiabatic surface condition,
   while thermoelastic dissipation is increased monotonically with
   increasing amplitude under isothermal surface condition. Under both
   adiabatic and isothermal surface conditions, the large-deflection effect
   on thermoelastic dissipation becomes more significant for higher
   vibration frequencies than lower ones. For the first time to the best of
   our knowledge, these results reveal that large deflection has a
   significant effect on thermoelastic dissipation of microbeam resonators
   and surface thermal condition plays an important role in the
   large-deflection effect.}},

Abstract = {{Improved mechanical properties for D2 steels can be achieved by reducing
   microsegregation and obtaining a good distribution of carbides during
   solidification. An understanding of the evolution of microsegregation
   and carbide formation during rapid solidification is necessary to
   control the microstructure. Impulse atomization (IA) was employed to
   produce rapidly solidified (RS) powders of D2 steel in helium and
   nitrogen cooling gases. The resulting powders were sieved into different
   size ranges and the microstructures and phases were examined using SEM
   and XRD. In addition to a substantial refinement of grain size, rapid
   solidification also suppressed the martensitic transformation and
   produced supersaturated retained-austenite. Several annealing tests were
   carried out on the as-atomized powders. SEM images showed a good
   distribution of precipitated carbides after annealing. The effect of
   annealing on the RS powders was evaluated using Vickers microhardness
   measurements and the precipitated carbides were characterized using TEM.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite (HA) coating has been widely applied on metallic
   biomedical implants to enhance their biocompatibility. It has been
   reported that HA coating can be formed on annealed anodic titanium
   dioxide nanotubular arrays after immersion in simulated biological fluid
   (SBF) for about 14 days. In the present study, we apply an alternative
   immersion method (AIM) to form pre-synthesized HA on TiO2 nanotubular
   arrays. An interdigitation phenomenon of the MG63 human osteosarcoma
   cells with the TiO2 nanotubular arrays with pre-synthesized HA is
   observed in the in vitro test, indicating excellent biocompatibility and
   bioactivity for present method. The results demonstrate that the AIM
   treatment is indeed suitable for the TiO2 nanotubular arrays and highly
   enhance the biocompatibility in comparison with the existing methods,
   i.e. the annealing of the as-formed TiO2 nanotubular arrays.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a comparison of various insulated gate bipolar transistor
   (IGBT) models for field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based real-time
   simulation of power electronic devices is presented. System-level
   behavioural models include ideal, switching function and averaged
   models, and the detailed device-level model includes both linear
   behavioural and non-linear look-up table-based models of IGBT. A
   three-level 12-pulse voltage source converter system driving a
   squirrel-cage induction motor has been chosen as the test case system.
   The entire system including the controller and pulse width modulation
   (PWM) is implemented on a single FPGA using very high-speed description
   language in real-time at a fixed time-step of 12.5 ns. The Altera
   Startix III FPGA is the device used for real-time simulation. Results
   obtained through all five models are compared and as expected, it has
   been found that the behaviour-mode simulation is fast but comes with a
   sacrifice of accuracy and details. A guideline is provided for the users
   with suggestions, so that the right kind of model can be selected for a
   particular study.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of pavement temperature variations on field

   conditions. The main objective of this field study was to measure and
   compare the amplitude of load- and thermal-induced strains over a 1-year
   monitoring period. Results indicated that the average monthly
   thermal-induced strains were higher than the load-induced strains by a
   49 kN wheel load moving at 25 km/h. Although the frequency of
   thermal-induced strains is lower than the traffic loads, damage from
   thermal-induced strains could be more than load-induced strains due to

Abstract = {{In this paper, nanopillars with heights of 1 mu m to 5 mu m and widths
   of 250nm to 500nm have been fabricated with a near room temperature
   etching process. The nanopillars were achieved with a continuous deep
   reactive ion etching technique and utilizing PMMA
   (polymethylmethacrylate) and Chromium as masking layers. As opposed to
   the conventional Bosch process, the usage of the unswitched deep
   reactive ion etching technique resulted in nanopillars with smooth
   sidewalls with a measured surface roughness of less than 40nm. Moreover,
   undercut was nonexistent in the nanopillars. The proposed fabrication
   method achieves etch rates four times faster when compared to the
   stateof-the-art, leading to higher throughput and more vertical side
   walls. The fabrication of the nanopillars was carried out keeping the
   CMOS process in mind to ultimately obtain a CMOS-compatible process.
   This work serves as an initial step in the ultimate objective of
   integrating photo-sensors based on these nanopillars seamlessly along
   with the controlling transistors to build a complete bio-inspired smart
   CMOS image sensor on the same wafer.}},

Title = {{Implementation of a Fuzzy TSK Controller for a Flexible Joint Robot}},
Journal = {{DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a fuzzy TSK controller to control a rotary flexible
   joint manipulator. The flexibility of joint is performed by means of a
   solenoid nonlinear spring, which is connected between actuator output
   and joint input in a bilateral connection form to transfer the produced
   torque; also the smooth model of frictions is used for modeling the
   dynamics of flexible manipulator. The effect of coulomb friction and
   also gearbox backlashes is decreased by a pulsation signal as an extra
   voltage that is added to the control voltage of actuator. Actuator
   dynamics is modeled by consideration of saturation mode of armature
   current. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller
   has an ability to control flexible joint manipulator with a good
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of bismuth powders was investigated in this work. Bi powders
   can be obtained from heterogeneous systems e. g., via galvanic
   displacement reaction by an immersion of aluminum metal into Bi(III)
   complexed solutions. It was shown that, on the aluminum substrate, Bi
   powders can be obtained from acid, close to neutral or from alkaline
   solutions. Bi particles obtained via galvanic deposition are
   predominantly dendritic. To avoid the incorporation of Bi - oxides into
   the final product, it is recommended that the deposition via galvanic
   displacement reaction from K{[}BiI4] or complexed Bi(III)-citrate-EDTA
   solutions on Al substrate is carried out in the acidic solutions in
   order to suppress the hydrolysis of Bi(III) ions. Alternatively, bismuth
   powders can successfully be produced from homogenous aqueous systems
   using Bi(III) complexed solutions as a source of Bi and an alkaline
   Sn(II) solution acting as a reducing agent of Bi(III) ions. The average
   particle size was about 0.25 mu m for Bi powders produced from Bi(III) -
   citrate complexed solution using alkaline Sn(II) as a reducing agent.
   For Bi powders produced from K{[}BiI4] solutions with Sn(II) as a
   reducing agent, the average particle size was estimated at about 0.65 mu

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{The main purpose of the paper is to optimize state feedback parameters
   using intelligent method, GA, Hermite-Biehler, and chaos algorithm. GA
   is implemented for local search but it has some deficiencies such as
   trapping into a local minimum and slow convergence, so the combination
   of Hermite-Biehler and chaos algorithm has been added to GA to avoid its
   deficiencies. Dividing search space is usually done by distributed
   population genetic algorithm (DPGA). Moreover, using generalized
   Hermite-Biehler Theorem can find the domain of parameters. In order to
   speed up the convergence at the first step, Hermite-Biehler method finds
   some intervals for controller, in the next step the GA will be added,
   and, finally, chaos disturbance will help the algorithm to reach a
   global minimum. Therefore, the proposed method can optimize the
   parameters of the state feedback controller.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of biomimetic dry adhesives at different ambient

   has previously been determined to be mushroom shaped fibers, but the
   pressure sensitivity of these designs has been unclear - with some
   groups reporting pressure dependent adhesion, and others claiming no
   effect. We have compared the microscale adhesion of mushroom shaped
   polymer fibers at different ambient pressures and have determined that
   suction cup effects are negligible for fibers with caps less than 16.4
   mu m in diameter. Further investigation in this work showed that a
   simple suction cup model provided estimates for the geometry
   requirements for a non-negligible suction cup effect and determined that
   the minimum cap radius for the 10 mu m pillar diameter used in this
   study should be over 26 mu m - past the dimension that can be

Abstract = {{The PAX proteins derive their name from the ``paired box,{''} a region
   of homology first described between the Drosophila paired (Prd) and
   gooseberry (Gsb) proteins and later found to encode a sequence-specific
   DNA-binding activity. Both Prd and Gsb also contain a homeodomain, and
   this combination of DNA-binding domains is conserved in ancestral
   predecessors, reflecting an early ``homeodomain-capturing{''} event. In
   addition, the prototypic PAX protein was thought to contain 2 additional
   features, namely the octapeptide (or eh1) motif and PHT (or OAR) domain
   both modulate PAX regulatory activity but are not unique to the PAX
   family. Together with gene duplications and mutagenesis, a domain loss
   model accounts for the distinct architecture and sequence of extant PAX
   proteins. Despite the disparate evolutionary history of these 4
   conserved motifs, there is a remarkable level of interplay that is
   modulated by discrete sequences elsewhere in the protein. Here, the
   implications with respect to the evolution of PAX protein structure and
   activity are discussed, it is suggested that the sum of these
   constituent domains is more than the contribution of individual parts.
   When combined with alternative splicing and posttranslational
   modifications, this model confers an extraordinary degree of functional
   diversity to even highly related PAX proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic Web as an evolution of Web has led to the introduction of new
   technologies including XML-based formats of representing data on the
   Web: resource description framework (RDF) and ontology. Similarity
   assessment of the entities has a fundamental role in processing and
   analyzing data represented in ontology. In this paper, we propose a
   technique for determining semantic similarity between pieces of
   information defined in ontology based on features describing each piece
   of information. The presented method allows for considering a specific
   context into the similarity evaluation. The quantitative
   characterization of similarity at different levels of abstraction in
   ontology is provided using elements of fuzzy set theory. We show through
   experiments that the proposed method compares favorably to other
   measures in terms of human judgment of similarity.}},

Abstract = {{The bathtub-shaped curve is essential in interpreting the failure rate
   function for the reliability analysis, and its parameters determine the
   representation of the bathtub-shaped function. This paper introduces a
   parameterised bathtub curve that provides an adaptive bathtub-shaped
   failure rate function (ABF) modelling approach which can be also easily
   utilised as a universal objective for further optimisation studies.
   Inspired by the swarm intelligence of the fish schooling behaviours, the
   artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) is an artificial intelligence
   algorithm which firstly simulates the behaviour of an individual
   artificial fish (AF) and then constructs an AF schooling. Each AF in the
   school searches its own local optimal solution and passes on information
   in its self-organised system and finally achieves the global optimal
   solution. In this context the AFSA is employed as the optimiser, where
   the fitness function of coefficient of determination (R-2) is defined as
   a quantity for the quantitative analysis, which measures the proportion
   of total components for the parameters determination. A case study for a
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device acceleration test
   has been devised and the results have shown that the proposed method can
   work valuably for the potential applications of bathtub-shaped failure
   rate function modelling and optimising.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-state systems have received considerable attention recently with
   regards to reliability and maintenance. Since most mechanical equipment
   operates under some sort of stress or load, it tends to deteriorate or
   degrade over time, thus possibly resulting in discrete degradation
   states (damage degrees), ranging from perfect functioning to complete
   failure. This multi-state deterioration is the motivation for using
   condition monitoring tools for the purpose of modeling, diagnosis,
   prognosis, and condition-based maintenance. Most mechanical equipment is
   subject to multiple independent failure modes and degradation processes.
   Rather than independently diagnosing and prognosing the health condition
   of the equipment for a single failure mode, it is important to
   investigate how multi-dimensional condition monitoring information can
   be used for recognition purposes of the state of the health of equipment
   with multiple independent failure modes. This paper focuses on a
   non-repairable piece of equipment with multiple independent failure
   modes, in which the state of the equipment for each single failure mode
   is not directly observable and only incomplete information is available
   through condition monitoring. The main objective of this paper is to
   develop a method to obtain an observation probability matrix which can
   be used as the main tool for damage degree classification of each
   failure mode. An observation probability matrix represents the
   statistical relationship between the actual health state (damage degree
   and failure mode) of the equipment and the condition monitoring
   information. This observation probability matrix is an input for such
   methods, as hidden Markov models, hidden Semi-Markov models, and Naive
   Bayes classifiers. We modify the Naive Bayes classifier to use this
   observation probability matrix for classification. The result of this
   paper is applied for damage degree classification of a planetary
   gearbox, which is subject to multiple failure modes.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of a tunnel can be evaluated using mathematical solutions,
   empirical methods, or numerical modelling. Mathematical solutions are
   precise methods; however the need to conduct mathematical calculations
   usually decreases the user's desire to use this method. Empirical
   methods are based on the experience gathered by researchers in various
   parts of the world whereas numerical modelling utilises computing power
   and, using various modelling techniques, can be a precise way of solving
   very complex problems. In this method the environment and the geometry
   can be set by the user. This method allows the user to conduct
   sensitivity analysis. In this article, empirical methods and numerical
   modelling using UDEC software were used to conduct a stability analysis
   of the access tunnel at the Shahriar dam crest, which was one of the
   most important tunnels of this project. In addition, numerical modelling
   was used to predict the stresses and deformations around the perimeter
   of the tunnel, and select the most suitable ground support system. The
   results obtained from both methods were compared for selection of the
   best suited support system. The results indicated that the empirical
   methods presented similar results to the results of numerical modelling
   at the first stages of tunnel design in jointed rocks. Therefore, in the
   absence of sufficient information for numerical analysis, the results of
   the empirical method can be used for this project.}},

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT \& DATA SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{828-846}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - In recent years, the number of management systems (MSs) has
   sharply increased. These MSs can be certified with, for example, the
   quality standard ISO 9001 or the environmental standard ISO 14001 and
   they can subsequently be integrated into one single, jointly managed
   system. The main purpose of this research is to study the relationships
   between the level of system integration, on one hand, and the
   difficulties encountered in the integration process, as well as the
   related benefits, on the other.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data for this study derive from a survey
   carried out in 76 organizations registered to, at a minimum, both ISO
   14001:2004 and ISO 9001:2008 standards for quality and environmental
   MSs. A descriptive and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) are
   provided. Additionally, structural equation modelling (SEM) is applied
   to the responses of these organizations to a mailed survey.
   Findings - From the results, the paper proposes a model of the
   difficulties related to systems integration that have an effect on the
   level of integration of several specific items of the MSs involved. A
   model related to the effect of the integration level on the benefits is
   also provided.
   Originality/value - The study provides an original contribution to the
   understanding of how difficulties and benefits of MSs integration relate
   to the level of integration achieved in the participating companies.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer-based materials are emerging as a potential substitute for
   metallic structures in the oil and gas industry. In this context,
   fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) piping is one promising application. An
   important area of the research pertaining to FRP piping is the
   connection of pipe sections. Challenges associated with the joining of
   FRP tubular sections are often considerable, which limits more
   widespread industrial application. Adhesive bonding is emerging as a
   promising technique to join tubular FRP structures. The ability to
   maintain undamaged fiber architecture is a major advantage of adhesive
   bonding technology. In the present study a strength-of-materials as well
   as fracture mechanics approach was employed in conjunction with the
   finite element method to investigate the scaling effects on adhesively
   bonded tubular sections. It was found that the scaling effects in joined
   FRP pipe may be significant. For certain composite material
   configurations the analysis indicated a shift of the region of failure
   from the pipe structure to pure adhesive (cohesive) failure with
   increasing pipe diameter.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{39}},
Pages = {{10045-10054}},
Abstract = {{The dynamics of water droplets impacting on a soft dry substrate was
   studied experimentally. Both the drop evolution (i.e. spreading,
   recoiling, as well as oscillations) upon impact on a soft gel substrate
   (i.e. polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) and substrate deformation caused by
   the impact force (for Weber numbers 110 < We < 520) were analyzed.
   Results were compared with similar tests carried out using hard,
   non-deformable PDMS substrates (two orders of magnitude more rigid than
   soft substrates). A sensor was designed based on the principle of a
   two-degree of freedom lever and successfully implemented to measure the
   maximum deformation of soft substrates during drop impact. Analysis of
   drop deformation highlighted that the recoil phase on a soft surface is
   slower, the final diameter of the resting drop is larger, and
   consequently the final resting contact angle is lower, when compared to
   impacts on hard substrates. Also, the oscillation time is significantly
   reduced, i.e. by half on soft substrates, compared to hard ones.
   Differences are likely due to the absorbance of impact energy due to
   substrate deformation. These findings are significant as for the first
   time it is shown that drop impact dynamics can be changed by
   manipulating the substrate stiffness. In addition, the following were
   found: drop impact can cause significant deformation of soft substrates,
   on the order of tens of micrometer. Different analytical models borrowed
   from solid mechanics of deformable bodies and drop impact on
   non-deformable surfaces were used and compared to estimate the force
   upon impact at the liquid-solid interface; in addition, a numerical
   model to study soft substrate deformation dynamics was developed.
   Analytical models significantly disagree on the magnitude of the impact
   force at the liquid-solid interface: model assumptions are critically
   discussed to explain shortcomings of such models. Numerical simulations
   showed that in strongly dynamic conditions, the PDMS substrate may
   respond to loads more rigidly than in static conditions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Infection is the leading complication associated with intravascular
   devices, and these infections develop when a catheter becomes colonized
   by microorganisms. To combat this issue, medical device manufacturers
   seek to provide healthcare facilities with antimicrobial medical devices
   to prevent or reduce the colonization. In order to adequately evaluate
   these devices, an in vivo model is required to accurately assess the
   performance of the antimicrobial devices in a clinical setting. The
   model presented herein was designed to provide a simulation of the
   subcutaneous tunnel environment to evaluate the ability of an
   antimicrobial peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), coated with
   chlorhexidine based technology, to reduce microbial migration and
   colonization compared to an uncoated PICC. Three samples of control,
   uncoated PICCs and three samples of coated PICCs were surgically
   tunneled into the backs of female New Zealand White rabbits. The
   insertion sites were then challenged with Staphylococcus aureus at the
   time of implantation. Animals were evaluated out to thirty days and
   sacrificed. Complete en bloc dissection and evaluation of the catheter
   and surrounding tissue demonstrated that the chlorhexidine coated
   catheter was able to significantly reduce microbial colonization and
   prevent microbial migration as compared to the standard, un-treated
   catheter.}},

Abstract = {{Pneumatic tires are costly components on large off-road haul trucks used
   in surface mining operations. Tires are prone to damage during
   operation, and these events can lead to injuries to personnel, loss of
   equipment, and reduced productivity. Damage rates have significant
   variability, due to operating conditions and a range of tire fault
   modes. Currently, monitoring of tire condition is done by physical
   inspection; and the mean time between inspections is often longer than
   the mean time between incipient failure and functional failure of the
   tire. Options for new condition monitoring methods include off-board
   thermal imaging and camera-based optical methods for detecting abnormal
   deformation and surface features, as well as on-board sensors to detect
   tire faults during vehicle operation. Physics-based modeling of tire
   dynamics can provide a good understanding of the tire behavior, and give
   insight into observability requirements for improved monitoring systems.
   This paper describes a model to simulate the dynamics of haul truck
   tires when a fault is present to determine the effects of physical
   parameter changes that relate to faults. To simulate the dynamics, a
   lumped mass `quarter-vehicle' model has been used to determine the
   response of the system to a road profile when a failure changes the
   original properties of the tire. The result is a model of tire vertical
   displacement that can be used to detect a fault, which will be tested
   under field conditions in time-varying conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Tire condition is integral to the safe operation of heavy machinery,
   such as ultra-class haul trucks. A new approach to haul truck tire
   monitoring is being investigated based on optical strain measurement,
   which has the advantage of providing quantitative information from
   sensors that do not contact the tire. A laboratory-scale apparatus has
   been constructed to monitor a tire as it is subjected to various loads
   and pressures. Digital image correlation is used to calculate the
   deformation in the tire. Using this method, damage resulting from a
   horizontal and vertical cut created on the tire surface could be
   detected. A three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the tire was
   created to assist in the characterization of more complex damage types
   such as wear and fatigue. In addition to providing information for a
   possible industrial scale damage detection system, this apparatus will
   also further the understanding of damage mechanisms in tires.}},

   ``coffee stain{''} effect}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},

Pages = {{8390-8401}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate the dynamics of bidispersed oil droplets
   in an evaporating water sessile drop. This phenomenon is therefore
   equivalent to a unique liquid droplet based ``coffee stain'' effect,
   with the depositing colloidal particles (of a classical ``coffee stain''
   problem) being replaced by the oil droplets partially wetting the
   substrate. The important difference with respect to the classical
   ``coffee stain'' problem, as revealed by our experiments, is that the
   oil droplets, unlike the colloidal particles, cannot reach the contact
   line; rather the aversion of the oil droplets to the air ensures that
   the oil droplets always remain at a finite distance from the contact
   line. We call this effect an ``enclosure'' effect, characterized by this
   distance. We provide a theoretical model to explain this phenomenon, and
   our theoretical results match well with the experimental observations.
   The ``enclosure'' effect depends on the droplet size, thereby allowing
   an automatic size-based separation of the oil droplets. Additionally,
   this effect depends on the wettability of the oil droplets and the
   sessile drop, as well as the relative velocity of the oil droplets with
   respect to the rate of decrease of the sessile drop contact angle. Our
   identification of this new phenomenon in a liquid-droplet based ``coffee
   stain'' problem will have a huge impact on microscale control and
   manipulation of liquid droplets in a two phase system.}},

Abstract = {{The global response of FRC members is known to be influenced by the
   force transfer mechanisms occurring at cracks, including the
   contributions from bridging fibers. These transfer mechanisms depend in
   part on the width of the cracks, which can vary with overall specimen
   size. This paper reports the response in flexure for notched specimens
   fabricated using normal weight concrete containing 1\% volume fraction
   of hooked end steel fibers. Nominal specimen dimensions that varied by a
   factor of up to 2 were used to allow for the quantification of size
   dependent influences on the response. Instrumentation based on the
   digital image correlation technique allowed for a detailed study of the
   variation of crack width over the member depth, and its relation to the
   specimen size and loading. Companion tests were conducted on cylinders
   in compression using a size factor of 1.5. The results showed that the
   flexural strength decreased in relation to the overall specimen depth.
   From the crack width analysis, it was possible to develop relationships
   between the crack width and mid-span deflection.}},

   An ultrasonic acoustic wave is introduced into a column chamber

   spherical particles. In this system the acoustic field is aligned with
   gravity to form horizontal bands of particles, which are also influenced
   by buoyancy and drag forces. Accounting for these forces with the

   modeled. There is a good agreement between the pattern of the particles
   motion in experimental results and the predicted single particle motion;

   weight ratios of the polymers in the reaction solution. The surface
   coated silica nanoparticles were characterized by a range of techniques
   such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared
   (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
   dynamic light scattering (DLS). The functionalized silica nanoparticles
   showed both pH and temperature responsive behavior and the solution
   properties were dependent on the ratio of the two polymers on the
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{Models of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have become
   increasingly complex, using many parameters to define the behavior of
   species and the performance of the cell. A framework is presented here
   to couple an agglomerate electrode based, multi-dimensional,
   multi-physics mathematical model of membrane electrode assembly (MEA)
   model with an optimization-based nonlinear least-squares parameter
   estimation algorithm. The framework is used to estimate the
   micro-structural parameters of the catalyst layer such as agglomerate
   size. The results show that a set of data over a range of operating
   conditions can be accurately described by using a unique set of
   structural parameters that match experimental visualization of the
   catalyst layer. Extension of this methodology can be used to
   systematically estimate any model parameters in order to reduce
   uncertainty in model predictions. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

Abstract = {{Standoff identification of explosive residues may offer early warnings
   to many hazards plaguing present and future military operations. The
   greatest challenge is posed by the need for molecular recognition of
   trace explosive compounds on real-world surfaces. Most techniques that
   offer eye-safe, long-range detection fail when unknown surfaces with no
   prior knowledge of the surface spectral properties are interrogated.
   Inhomogeneity in the surface concentration and optical absorption from
   background molecules can introduce significant reproducibility
   challenges for reliable detection when surface residue concentrations
   are below tens of micrograms per square centimeter. Here we present a
   coupled standoff technique that allows identification of explosive
   residues concentrations in the sub microgram per square centimeter range
   on real-world surfaces. Our technique is a variation of standoff
   photoacoustic spectroscopy merged with ultraviolet chemical
   photodecomposition for selective identification of explosives. We
   demonstrate the detection of standard military grade explosives
   including RDX, PETN, and TNT along with a couple of common compounds
   such as diesel and sugar. We obtain identification at several hundred
   nanograms per centimeter square at a distance of four meters.}},

Abstract = {{We have synthesized a new metastable metal hydride with promising
   hydrogen storage properties. Body centered cubic (bcc) magnesium niobium
   hydride (Mg0.75Nb0.25)H-2 possesses 4.5 wt\% hydrogen gravimetric
   density, with 4 wt\% being reversible. Volumetric hydrogen absorption
   measurements yield an enthalpy of hydride formation of -53 kJ mol(-1)
   H-2, which indicates a significant thermodynamic destabilization
   relative to the baseline -77 kJ mol(-1) H-2 for rutile MgH2. The
   hydrogenation cycling kinetics are remarkable. At room temperature and 1
   bar hydrogen it takes 30 minutes to absorb a 1.5 mu m thick film at
   sorption cycle 1, and 1 minute at cycle 5. Reversible desorption is
   achieved in about 60 minutes at 175 degrees C. Using ab initio
   calculations we have examined the thermodynamic stability of metallic
   alloys with hexagonal close packed (hcp) versus bcc crystal structure.
   Moreover we have analyzed the formation energies of the alloy hydrides
   that are bcc, rutile or fluorite.}},

Abstract = {{A well-known approach to develop a high efficiency solid-oxide fuel-cell
   (SOFC) consists of extracting the microstructure and transport
   properties such as volume fractions, internal surface area, geometric
   connectivity, effective gas diffusivity, effective electronic
   conductivity and geometric tortuosities from three-dimensional (3D)
   microstructure of the SOFC electrodes; thereafter, performing the SOFC
   efficiency calculations using previously mentioned quantities. In the
   present work, dual-beam focused ion beam - scanning electron microscopy
   (FIB-SEM) is applied on one of the SOFC cathodes, a lanthanum strontium
   manganite (LSM) electrode, to estimate the aforementioned properties. A
   framework for calculating transport properties is presented in this
   work. 3D microstructures of LSM electrode are reconstructed from a
   series of two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional FIB-SEM images. Volume
   percentages of connected, isolated and dead-ends networks of pore and
   LSM phases are estimated. Different networks of pore and LSM phases are
   discretized with tetrahedral elements. Finally, the finite element
   method (FEM) is applied to calculate effective gas diffusivity and
   electronic conductivity of pore and LSM phases, respectively. Geometric
   tortuosities are estimated from the porosity and effective transport
   properties. The results obtained using FEM are compared with the finite
   volume method (FVM) results obtained by Gunda et al. {[}J. Power
   Sources, 196(7), 35929(2011)] and other numerical results obtained on
   randomly generated porous medium. Effect of consideration of dead-ends
   and isolated-ends networks on calculation of effective transport
   properties is studied.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{561-576}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid choice modelling approaches allow latent variables in mode choice
   utility functions to be addressed. However, defining attitude and
   behavior as latent variables is influenced by the researcher's
   assumptions. Therefore, it is better to capture the effects of latent
   behavioral and attitudinal factors as latent variables than defining
   behaviors and attitudes per se. This article uses a hybrid choice model
   for capturing such latent effects, which will herein be referred to as
   modal captivity effects in commuting mode choice. Latent modal captivity
   refers to the unobserved and apparently unexplained attraction towards a
   specific mode of transportation that is resulting from latent attitude
   and behavior of passengers in addition to the urban transportation
   system. In empirical models, the latent modal captivity variables are
   explained as functions of different observed variables. Empirical models
   show significant improvement in fitting observed data as well as
   improved understanding of travel behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Significant enhancement in supercapacitor performance was achieved via
   the synthesis of nanocrystalline RuO2 on vertically aligned Few Layered
   Graphene (FLG) nanoflakes, synthesized on bare n-type heavily doped
   silicon substrates by microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition. The
   RuO2 nanoparticles (diameter <2 nm) were deposited using a combination
   of low base pressure radio frequency magnetron sputtering and subsequent
   electrochemical cycling in acidic media. The well-dispersed RuO2
   nanoparticles on FLGs achieve a specific capacitance of the order of 650
   F g(-1). The specific capacitance of RuO2-FLGs is significantly higher
   than pristine sputtered RuO2 (similar to 320 F g(-1)) and FLGs (similar
   to 6 F g(-1)) indicative of the synergistic effect between the FLGs and
   RuO2. In addition, the fabricated RuO2-FLG supercapacitors show
   excellent cycling capability with approximately 70\% retention of
   initial specific capacitance over 4000 cycles at high
   charging-discharging rates of 500 mV s(-1). The superior electrochemical
   performance is attributed to the good electronic conductivity of the
   FLGs as well as high utilization of well-dispersed RuO2 nanoparticles on
   FLGs.}},

Title = {{Bacteriophage based probes for pathogen detection}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3405-3421}},
Abstract = {{Rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria is important for the
   proper treatment, containment and prevention of human, animal and plant
   diseases. Identifying unique biological probes to achieve a high degree
   of specificity and minimize false positives has therefore garnered much
   interest in recent years. Bacteriophages are obligate intracellular
   parasites that subvert bacterial cell resources for their own
   multiplication and production of disseminative new virions, which repeat
   the cycle by binding specifically to the host surface receptors and
   injecting genetic material into the bacterial cells. The precision of
   host recognition in phages is imparted by the receptor binding proteins
   (RBPs) that are often located in the tail-spike or tail fiber protein
   assemblies of the virions. Phage host recognition specificity has been
   traditionally exploited for bacterial typing using laborious and time
   consuming bacterial growth assays. At the same time this feature makes
   phage virions or RBPs an excellent choice for the development of probes
   capable of selectively capturing bacteria on solid surfaces with
   subsequent quick and automatic detection of the binding event. This
   review focuses on the description of pathogen detection approaches based
   on immobilized phage virions as well as pure recombinant RBPs. Specific
   advantages of RBP-based molecular probes are also discussed.}},

Title = {{A New Method for Bilateral Teleoperation Passivity under Varying Time
   Delays}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{A new framework is proposed to mitigate the adverse effect of
   time-varying time delays on the passivity of a teleoperation system. To
   this end, the communication channel with time-varying delays is modeled
   as a constant-delay channel along with additive output disturbances.
   Then, disturbance estimator blocks are added in each of the feedforward
   and feedback paths to estimate these disturbances and to compensate for
   them. In the disturbance estimator block, there is a need for a virtual
   time-varying delay block such that the overall communication channel can
   be seen as one with a constant delay. We also propose a method for
   determining this virtual delay. Two PHANToM haptic devices connected
   through a communication channel with time-varying delays are considered
   for a case study. Simulation and experimental results confirm the
   efficiency of the proposed method in terms of passivating the
   teleoperation system in the presence of time-varying delays.}},

Journal = {{BIOFOULING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{525-538}},
Abstract = {{Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) significantly influence
   bacterial adhesion to solid surfaces, but it is difficult to elucidate
   the role of EPS on bacterial adhesion due to their complexity and
   variability. In the present study, the effect of EPS on the initial
   adhesion of B. cepaciaepacia PC184 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 on glass
   slides with and without an EPS precoating was investigated under three
   ionic strength conditions. The surface roughness of EPS coated slides
   was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and its effect on
   initial bacterial adhesion was found to be trivial. X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed to determine the elemental
   surface compositions of bacterial cells and substrata. The results
   showed that an EPS precoating hindered bacterial adhesion on solid
   surfaces, which was largely attributed to the presence of proteins in
   the EPS. This observation can be attributed to the increased steric
   repulsion at high ionic strength conditions. A steric model for polymer
   brushes that considers the combined influence of steric effects and DLVO
   interaction forces is shown to adequately describe bacterial adhesion
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{We present methods for nanostructuring organic thin films for organic
   photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Using the glancing angle deposition (GLAD)
   technique, we fabricate a variety of columnar morphologies of metal
   phthalocyanine (MPc) materials that can be used as structured donor
   layers in OPV devices. We leverage this capability with block copolymer
   surface patterning techniques to achieve perfectly periodic columnar
   arrays while providing additional control over column dimensions,
   spacing, and density. Our investigation employs hexagonal seed patterns
   of platinum on silicon and we vary the seed spacing between 40 nm and 60
   nm. We find that pattern resemblance begins to fade when the film
   thickness exceeds the seed spacing. We compare the film evolution
   between vertical post and slanted post morphologies, and use advanced
   substrate motion techniques to constrain column diameters. We conclude
   by addressing the compatibility of surface patterning with device
   fabrication. Patterned ITO surfaces and SiO2 seed patterns are shown.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce a novel optical resolution photoacoustic
   micro-endoscopy system using GRIN-lens focusing. This real-time imaging
   system takes advantage of an image guide fiber consisting of 100,000
   individual single-mode fibers in a 1.4-mm-diameter bundle, and a 532-nm
   fiber laser with repetition-rates as high as 600 kHz. Fast scanning
   mirrors were used to scan the entire image guide fiber allowing for the
   maximum field-of-view. The ability of the proposed system is
   demonstrated using both phantom and in vivo studies. The system offers
   <7 mu m lateral spatial resolution and several volumetric/C-scans per
   second frame-rate. The proposed setup can be inserted into the body due
   to the flexible nature of the image guide and micron-scale footprint of
   the apparatus.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously demonstrated that tyrosinase is a reporter gene for
   photoacoustic imaging since tyrosinase is the rate-limiting step in the
   synthesis of melanin, a pigment capable of producing strong
   photoacoustic signals. We previously created a cell line capable of
   inducible tyrosinase expression (important due to toxicity of melanin)
   by stably transfecting tyrosinase in MCF-7 Tet-On (R) cell line
   (Clontech) which expresses a doxycycline-controlled transactivator.
   Unfortunately, Clontech provides few Tet-On Advanced cell lines making
   it difficult to have inducible tyrosinase expression in cell lines not
   provided by Clontech. In order to simplify the creation of cell lines
   with inducible expression of tyrosinase, we created a single plasmid
   that encodes both the transactivator as well as tyrosinase. PCR was used
   to amplify both the transactivator and tyrosinase from the Tet-On (R)
   Advanced and pTRE-Tight-TYR plasmids, respectively. Both PCR products
   were cloned into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid and the newly created plasmid was
   transfected into ZR-75-1, MCF-7, and MIA PaCa-1 cells using
   lipofectamine. After several days, brown melanin was only observed in
   cells incubated with doxycycline, suggesting that the newly created
   single plasmid allowed inducible tyrosinase expression in many different
   cells lines.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new micro-endoscopy system combining real-time C-scan
   optical-resolution photoacoustic micro-endoscopy (OR-PAME), and a
   high-resolution fluorescence micro-endoscopy system for visualizing
   fluorescently labeled cellular components and optically absorbing
   microvasculature simultaneously. With a diode-pumped 532-nm fiber laser,
   the OR-PAM sub-system is capable of imaging with a resolution of similar
   to 7 mu m. The fluorescence sub-system consists of a diode laser with
   445 nm-centered emissions as the light source, an objective lens and a
   CCD camera. Proflavine, a FDA approved drug for human use, is used as
   the fluorescent contrast agent by topical application. The fluorescence
   system does not require any mechanical scanning. The scanning laser and
   the diode laser light source share the same light path within an optical
   fiber bundle containing 30,000 individual single mode fibers. The
   absorption of Proflavine at 532 nm is low, which mitigates absorption
   bleaching of the contrast agent by the photoacoustic excitation source.
   We demonstrate imaging in live murine models. The system is able to
   provide cellular morphology with cellular resolution co-registered with
   the structural and functional information given by OR-PAM. Therefore,
   the system has the potential to serve as a virtual biopsy technique,
   helping researchers and clinicians visualize angiogenesis, effects of
   anti-cancer drugs on both cells and the microcirculation, as well as aid
   in the study of other diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The acquisition speed of previously reported mechanically-scanned
   Optical-Resolution Photoacoustic Microscopy (OR-PAM) systems has been
   limited by both laser pulse repetition rate and mechanical scanning
   speed. In this paper we introduce a mosaicing scheme wherein a grid of
   small sub-mm-scale field-of-view (FOV) patches are acquired in 0.5s per
   patch, and a 3-axis stepper-motor system is used to mechanically move
   the object to be imaged from patch-to-patch in less than 0.5s. Patch
   images are aligned and stitched to generate a large FOV image composite.
   This system retains the SNR-advantages of focused-transducer OR-PAM
   systems, and is a hybrid approach between optical-scanning and
   mechanical scanning. With this strategy we reduce the data acquisition
   time of previously reported large-FOV systems by a factor of around 23.
   SCID hairless mice are imaged. The wide-FOV, high-speed data acquisition
   OR-PAM system broadens the potential applications of the imaging

Journal = {{MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1886-1901}},
Abstract = {{Many biologically active proteins are disordered as a whole, or contain
   long disordered regions. These intrinsically disordered proteins/regions
   are very common in nature, abundantly found in all organisms, where they
   carry out important biological functions. The functions of these
   proteins complement the functional repertoire of ``normal'' ordered
   proteins, and many protein functional classes are heavily dependent on
   intrinsic disorder. Among these disorder-centric functions are
   interactions with nucleic acids and protein complex assembly. In this
   study, we present the results of comprehensive bioinformatics analyses
   of the abundance and roles of intrinsic disorder in 2007 histones from
   746 species. We show that all the members of the histone family are
   intrinsically disordered proteins. Furthermore, intrinsic disorder is
   not only abundant in histones, but is absolutely necessary for various
   histone functions, starting from heterodimerization to formation of
   higher order oligomers, to interactions with DNA and other proteins, and
   to posttranslational modifications.}},

Abstract = {{Single cells based on Ni-CeO2-WC-YSZ anodes were investigated as an
   alternative material for direct methane solid oxide fuel cells. First, a
   YSZ electrolyte-based cell with porous YSZ as the support for electrode
   materials on both sides was prepared. Then electrocatalyst materials
   were incorporated into the porous YSZ: the anode was infiltrated with WC
   (25 vol.\%), Ni (5 wt\%) and ceria (5 wt\%) precursors; and the cathode
   with LSM (20 vol.\%) precursor. A Ni-CeO2-WC-YSZ symmetrical cell study
   showed that the Ni modified electrode performed stably with humidified
   methane at 850 degrees C for a period of 48 hours under open circuit
   condition; no carbon formation was observed either with in-situ
   impedance spectroscopy or ex-situ scanning electron microscopy.
   Furthermore, the fuel cell results revealed that not only does the anode
   operate steadily with a reasonable performance on methane fuel, but the
   stability of the carbide phase is well maintained. The cell also
   successfully survived an oxidation-reduction-recarburization cycle. It
   was demonstrated that with a proper cell configuration, the structural
   integrity can be protected. These results suggest that a Ni modified
   anode is compatible with methane fuel, with reasonable and stable
   performance. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Hippocampal pathology is central to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other
   forms of dementia such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
   Autopsy studies have shown that certain hippocampal subfields are more
   vulnerable than others to AD and FTLD pathology, in particular the
   subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1). We conducted shape analysis of
   hippocampi segmented from structural T1 MRI images on clinically
   diagnosed dementia patients and controls. The subjects included 19 AD
   and 35 FTLD patients {[}13 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 13 semantic
   dementia (SD), and 9 progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA)] and 21
   controls. Compared to controls, SD displayed severe atrophy of the whole
   left hippocampus. PNFA and FTD also displayed atrophy on the left side,
   restricted to the hippocampal head in FTD. Finally, AD displayed most
   atrophy in left hippocampal body with relative sparing of the
   hippocampal head. Consistent with neuropathological studies, most
   atrophic deformation was found in CA1 and subiculum areas in FTLD and
   AD.}},

Title = {{Unraveling the relationship between trip chaining and mode choice:
   evidence from a multi-week travel diary}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Pages = {{409-426}},
Abstract = {{Trip chaining (or tours) and mode choice are two critical factors
   influencing a variety of patterns of urban travel demand. This paper
   investigates the hierarchical relationship between these two sets of
   decisions including the influences of socio-demographic characteristics
   on them. It uses a 6-week travel diary collected in Thurgau,
   Switzerland, in 2003. The structural equation modeling technique is
   applied to identify the hierarchical relationship. Hierarchy and
   temporal consistency of the relationship is investigated separately for
   work versus non-work tours. It becomes clear that for work tours in
   weekdays, trip-chaining and mode choice decisions are simultaneous and
   remain consistent across the weeks. For non-work tours in weekdays, mode
   choice decisions precede trip-chaining decisions. However, for non-work
   tours in weekends, trip-chaining decisions precede mode choice
   decisions. A number of socioeconomic characteristics also play major
   roles in influencing the relationships. Results of the investigation
   challenge the traditional approach of modeling mode choice separately
   from activity-scheduling decisions.}},
