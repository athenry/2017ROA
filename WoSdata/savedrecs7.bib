Abstract = {{The fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is a widely applied clustering
   technique, but the implicit assumption that each attribute of the object
   data has equal importance affects the clustering performance. At
   present, attribute weighted fuzzy clustering has became a very active
   area of research, and numerous approaches that develop numerical weights
   have been combined into fuzzy clustering. In this paper, interval number
   is introduced for attribute weighting in the weighted fuzzy c-means
   (WFCM) clustering, and it is illustrated that interval weighting can
   obtain appropriate weights more easily from the viewpoint of geometric
   probability. Moreover, a genetic heuristic strategy for attribute weight
   searching is proposed to guide the alternating optimization (AO) of
   WFCM, and improved attribute weights in interval-constrained ranges and
   reasonable data partition can be obtained simultaneously. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior
   in clustering performance. It reveals that the interval weighted
   clustering can act as an optimization operator on the basis of the
   traditional numerical weighted clustering, and the effects of interval
   weight perturbation on clustering performance can be decreased. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The cervical spine functions as a complex mechanism that responds to
   sudden loading in a unique manner, due to intricate structural features
   and kinematics. The spinal load-sharing under pure compression and
   sagittal flexion/extension at two different impact rates were compared
   using a bio-fidelic finite element (FE) model of the ligamentous
   cervical functional spinal unit (FSU) C2-C3. This model was developed
   using a comprehensive and realistic geometry of spinal components and
   material laws that include strain rate dependency, bone fracture, and
   ligament failure. The range of motion, contact pressure in facet joints,
   failure forces in ligaments were compared to experimental findings. The
   model demonstrated that resistance of spinal components to impact load
   is dependent on loading rate and direction. For the loads applied,
   stress increased with loading rate in all spinal components, and was
   concentrated in the outer intervertebral disc (IVD), regions of
   ligaments to bone attachment, and in the cancellous bone of the facet
   joints. The highest stress in ligaments was found in capsular ligament
   (CL) in all cases. Intradiscal pressure (IDP) in the nucleus was
   affected by loading rate change. It increased under compression/flexion
   but decreased under extension. Contact pressure in the facet joints
   showed less variation under compression, but increased significantly
   under flexion/extension particularly under extension. Cancellous bone of
   the facet joints region was the only component fractured and fracture
   occurred under extension at both rates. The cervical ligaments were the
   primary load-bearing component followed by the IVD, endplates and
   cancellous bone; however, the latter was the most vulnerable to
   extension as it fractured at low energy impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{The study of wetting characteristics of low-energy (e. g.,
   superhydrophobic) liquid-repellent surfaces is of great importance
   towards optimal design of such micro/nano-engineered surfaces. The most
   common technique to accomplish this involves bringing a drop generated
   at the needle-tip close to the characterizing substrate with a goal to
   deposit it on the substrate, which often becomes a challenge when the
   surface energy of the drop-substrate combination is comparable to the
   needle-drop system. In this paper, we proposed a new ``needle-free{''}
   drop deposition technique, which overcomes this challenge for
   characterization the low-energy substrates. This is achieved by placing
   an additional low-energy substrate above the characterizing substrate
   and allowing the drop-needle combination to impact on this additional
   substrate. This technique is not only independent of the wetting
   properties of the needle and the characterizing substrate but is also
   independent of the liquid drop properties, thereby making it a very
   universal technique for characterizing substrate in air medium. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Various options for the capture and concentration of CO2 from a wet flue
   gas at 25 degrees C containing 1596 CO2 in 82\% N-2 and 3\% moisture
   have been analyzed through detailed simulation and optimization. First,
   a proven cycle for dry flue gas, consisting of four steps including
   light product pressurization in a column packed with zeolite 13X
   established in an earlier communication (Haghpanah et al. AIChE J. 2013,
   59, 4735) and demonstrated at the pilot scale (Krishnamurthy et al.
   AIChE J. 2014, 60, 1830), was applied to the wet flue gas. Detailed
   optimization studies using a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm
   (NSGA-II) in MATLAB were carried out first to maximize purity and
   recovery. Further optimization was carried out to obtain the operating
   conditions corresponding to minimum energy consumption subject to 9596
   purity and 90\% recovery constraints. The minimum energy consumption in
   this process required to achieve 95\% purity (dry basis) and 9096
   recovery was 230 kWh (t of CO2 captured)(-1) with a productivity of 1.03
   t of CO2 (m(3) of 13X)(-1) day(-1). This energy consumption was
   considerably higher and the productivity was considerably lower than
   those reported for dry flue gas (Haghpanah et al. AIChE J. 2013, 59,
   4735). Next, to improve the performance, a new dual-adsorbent, four-step
   vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) process with silica gel and zeolite 13X
   packed separately in two beds was proposed. By separating the two
   adsorbents in two beds, instead of layering them in the same column, it
   was possible to avoid rewetting of the concentrated CO2. The process
   optimization of the new cycle revealed that the 95\% purity and 90\%
   recovery target could be achieved at a lower energy penalty {[}177 kWh
   (t of CO2 captured)(-1)] while also improving the productivity {[}1.82 t
   of CO2 (m(3) of 13X)(-1) day(-1), 1.29 t of CO2 (m(3) of total
   adsorbent)(-1) day(-1)].}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the surface properties and interactions of nonspherical
   particles is of both fundamental and practical importance in the
   rheology of complex fluids in various engineering applications. In this
   work, natural chrysotile, a phyllosilicate composed of 1:1 stacked
   silica and brucite layers which coil into cylindrical structure, was
   chosen as a model rod-shaped particle. The interactions of chrysotile
   brucite-like basal or bilayered edge planes and a silicon nitride tip
   were measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The force-distance
   profiles were fitted using the classical
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which demonstrates
   anisotropic and pH-dependent surface charge properties of brucite-like
   basal plane and bilayered edge surface. The points of zero charge (PZC)
   of the basal and edge planes were estimated to be around pH 10-11 and
   6-7, respectively. Rheology measurements of 7 vol \% chrysotile (with an
   aspect ratio of 14.5) in 10 mM NaCl solution showed pH-dependent yield
   stress with a local maximum around pH 7-9, which falls between the two
   PZC values of the edge and basal planes of the rod particles. On the
   basis of the surface potentials of the edge and basal planes obtained
   from AFM measurements, theoretical analysis of the surface interactions
   of edge-edge, basal-edge, and basal-basal planes of the chrysotile rods
   suggests the yield stress maximum observed could be mainly attributed to
   the basal-edge attractions. Our results indicate that the anisotropic
   surface properties (e.g., charges) of chrysotile rods play an important
   role in the particle-particle interaction and rheological behavior,
   which also provides insight into the basic understanding of the
   colloidal interactions and rheology of nonspherical particles.}},

   particles were still maintained by steric stabilization below the

   of naphthenic acids (NAs) species during the ozonation of OSPW.
   Additionally, the speciation and distribution of classical and oxidized
   NA species in raw and ozonated OSPW were also examined. The
   structure-reactivity of NA species indicated that the reactivity of
   individual NA species increased as the carbon and hydrogen deficiency
   numbers increased. The kinetic parameters obtained in this study allowed
   calculating the evolution of the concentrations of the acid-extractable
   fraction (AEF), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and NA distributions for a
   given ozonation process. High correlations between the AEF and COD and
   NA species were found, suggesting that AEF and COD can be used as
   surrogate parameters to predict the degradation of NAs during the
   ozonation of OSPW. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{276}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility are two key executive
   functions that develop in childhood and adolescence, increasing one's
   capacity to respond dynamically to changing external demands and refrain
   from impulsive behaviors. These gains evolve in concert with significant
   brain development. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified
   numerous frontal and cingulate cortical areas associated with
   performance on inhibition tasks, but less is known about the involvement
   of the underlying anatomical connectivity, namely white matter. Here we
   used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine correlations between a
   DTI-derived parameter, fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter, and
   performance on the NEPSY-Il Inhibition test (Naming, Inhibition and
   Switching conditions) in 49 healthy children aged 5-16 years (20
   females; 29 males). First, whole brain voxel-based analysis revealed
   several clusters in the frontal projections of the corpus callosum,
   where higher FA was associated with worse inhibitory performance, as
   well as several clusters in posterior brain regions and one in the
   brain-stem where higher FA was associated with better cognitive
   flexibility (in the Switching task), suggesting a dichotomous
   relationship between FA and these two aspects of cognitive control.
   Tractography through these clusters identified several white matter
   tracts, which were then manual traced in native space. Pearson's
   correlations confirmed associations between higher FA of frontal
   projections of the corpus callosum with poorer inhibitory performance
   (independent of age), though associations with Switching were not
   significant. Post-hoc evaluation suggested that FA of orbital and
   anterior frontal projections of the corpus callosum also mediated
   performance differences across conditions, which may reflect differences
   in self-monitoring or strategy use. These findings suggest a link
   between the development of inhibition and cognitive control with that of
   the underlying white matter, and may help to identify deviations of
   neurobiology in adolescent psychopathology. This article is part of a

Abstract = {{Mannan (MN) is the natural ligand for mannose receptors, which are
   widely expressed on dendritic cells (DCs). The purpose of this study was
   to assess the effect of formulation parameters on the immunogenicity of
   MN-decorated poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs)
   in terms of their ability to stimulate DC phenotypic as well as
   functional maturation. For this purpose, NPs were formulated from either
   ester-terminated or COOH-terminated PLGA. Incorporation of MN in NPs was
   achieved through encapsulation, physical adsorption or chemical
   conjugation. Murine bone marrow derived DCs (BMDCs) were treated with
   various NP formulations and assessed for their ability to up-regulate DC
   cell surface markers, secrete immunostimulatory cytokines and to
   activate allogenic T cell responses. DCs treated with COOH-terminated
   PLGA-NPs containing chemically conjugated MN (MN-Cov-COOH) have shown
   superior performance in improving DC biological functions, compared to
   the rest of the formulations tested. This may be attributed to the
   higher level of MN incorporation in the former formulation.
   Incorporation of MN in PLGA NPs through chemical conjugation can lead to
   enhanced DC maturation and stimulatory function. This strategy may be
   used to develop more effective PLGA-based vaccine formulations.}},

Title = {{Optimized saturation recovery protocols for T1-mapping in the heart:
   influence of sampling strategies on precision}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: T1-mapping has the potential to detect and quantify diffuse
   processes such as interstitial fibrosis. Detection of disease at an
   early stage by measurement of subtle changes requires a high degree of
   reproducibility. Initial implementation of saturation recovery (SR)
   T1-mapping employed 3-parameter fitting which was highly accurate but
   was quite sensitive to noise; 2-parameter fitting greatly reduced the
   sensitivity to noise at the expense of a small degree of systematic
   bias. A recently introduced implementation that uses a variable readout
   flip angle greatly reduces systematic errors in T1-measurement thereby
   making it feasible to use SR methods with 2-parameter fitting with
   improved accuracy and precision. SR T1 mapping techniques with
   multi-heartbeat recovery times have been proposed to better sample the
   T1 recovery curve, but have not been evaluated for 2-parameter fitting.
   Methods: An analytic formulation for calculating the standard deviation
   (SD) for SR T1-mapping with 2-parameter fitting is developed and
   validated using Monte-Carlo simulation. The coefficient of variation is
   compared for a brute force optimization of sampling and for several
   previously described sampling schemes for T1 measurement over several
   uncertainty ranges. Experimental validation is performed in phantoms
   over a range of T1, and in-vivo both native and post-contrast.
   Pixel-wise SD maps are calculated for SR T1-mapping.
   Results: Sampling schemes that use a non-saturated anchor image and
   multiple (N) measurements at a single fixed saturation delay are found
   to be near optimum for the case of known T1 and are close to the brute
   force optimized solution over wide ranges of native and post-contrast T1
   values. The fixed delay sampling scheme is simple to implement and
   provides an improvement over uniformly distributed schemes.
   Conclusions: Sampling strategies for saturation recovery methods for
   myocardial T1-mapping have been optimized and validated experimentally.
   Reduced SD, or improved precision, may be achieved by using fixed
   saturation delays when considering native myocardium and post-contrast
   T1 ranges. Pixel-wise estimates of T1 mapping errors have been
   formulated and validated for SR fitting methods.}},

Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL \& ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{13750-13763}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{The time delay involved between sampling and obtaining measurements of
   certain quality variables is a common scenario in various process
   applications. Further, this delay is not fixed and can vary for various
   reasons. Moreover, certain measurements may be sampled at irregular time
   intervals. The state estimation algorithms available in the literature
   have been developed for the scenario where the measurements are sampled
   regularly or are available after a fixed time delay. In this work, a
   recursive moving window Bayesian state estimator formulation is proposed
   to utilize such measurements with variable time delays to compute the
   state estimates. The length of the moving window ensures that the
   algorithm utilizes all the available measurements (delayed or otherwise)
   for computing the state estimates. In practice, it may also become
   necessary to account for the physical bounds on the states. A
   constrained version of the moving window recursive state estimator is
   also developed to yield state estimates that are consistent with their
   respective bounds and constraints. The efficacy of the unconstrained
   moving window state estimator is demonstrated by application on the
   benchmark Tennessee Eastman simulation case study and an experimental
   two-tank heater-mixer setup, while the efficacy of the constrained
   moving window state estimator is demonstrated by simulation of a
   benchmark gas-phase batch reactor system.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a framework that integrates existing climate
   conditions with a Geographical Information System (GIS) to develop an
   on-demand dangerous goods (DG) routing support system. The framework
   focuses on mitigating the risks associated with DG transportation via
   route selection. Evidently, DG routing involves a number of decisions
   that require the consideration of multiple and sometimes conflicting
   risks. As a result, the framework includes a number of different routing
   criteria pertaining to safety, efficiency, security, and cost. The
   framework was applied to a large-scale transportation network
   representing the Metro Vancouver area. The network was represented
   spatially in a GIS database along with a real-time dispersion plume
   model to simulate a specific chemical release under local weather
   conditions. The results show that different routing criteria lead to
   different optimal route choices. The authors also compared route
   selection based on the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) for protection
   and isolation actions with route selection based on dispersion models.
   The comparison results show that, when employing the ERG in a small
   spill scenario, decision-makers are at risk of exposing a large number
   of individuals to severe health effects. Vice. versa, if the ERG was to
   be followed in a large spill scenario, many individuals who are not at
   risk would be unnecessarily evacuated. This translates into increased
   evacuation costs, and wastes the time and effort of emergency personnel.
   The study shows that these issues are properly addressed if a dispersion
   model is used to refine the estimation of the impact zone by including
   measures that are specific to the shipment.}},

Title = {{Automating motion trajectory Of crane-lifted loads}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{178-186}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Crane Lifting Path Planning (CLPP) is an important task, especially in
   congested construction sites. This activity becomes extremely complex
   since, as the project advances, new (and sometimes unpredicted)
   constraints may occur. These constraints force lift engineers to explore
   the possibility of alternative paths for the objects still lobe moved.
   Under severe time constraints, manual analysis of such paths is
   practically impossible, which makes it necessary to rely on computer
   implementations in order to avoid project delays. From a mathematical
   standpoint, if the crane payload trajectory is to be defined
   analytically, the polar coordinate system,(r, theta), is naturally the
   most suitable. As a result, this paper proposes an algorithm for CLPP in
   which the path is represented as a piece-wise continuous function where
   each portion is defined either by constant radius (rotation of the load)
   or a constant angle (translation of the load). In other words, rather
   than forcing a crane to adapt to unnatural rectilinear trajectories as
   obtained by traditional path searching procedures, it is the trajectory
   that is adapted to the crane motion. In fact, even though
   (mathematically) a precise balance between the rates of rotation and
   translation of the jib (or boom) will make the payload follow any
   continuous path (regardless of its complexity), the coupling between the
   rotations and translations increases the difficulty of the lifting
   activity. However, a crane lifting path in which these motions are
   uncoupled will lead to less stringent requirements in terms of

Title = {{Experimental Analysis of Heavy-Oil Recovery by Alternate Injection of
   Steam and Solvent (Hydrocarbon/CO2) in Unconsolidated Sand Reservoirs}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the steam-over-solvent injection in fractured
   reservoirs (SOS-FR) method-which was originally suggested for
   heavy-oil/bitumen recovery from oil-wet fractured reservoirs-for
   unconsolidated sands containing heavy oil. One possible application of
   the method in such media is the
   post-cold-heavy-oil-production-with-sands (post-CHOPS) enhanced oil
   recovery (EOR) considering that the wormholes represent the
   high-permeability ({''}fractures{''}) medium while the unproduced
   original part of the reservoir is the matrix containing the essential
   portion of the oil. The methodology used in the experiments and the
   observations will also provide an insight into the applicability of this
   method in ``homogeneous{''} oil sands producing under gravity drainage
   during the alternate injection of solvent and steam (or hot water).
   The SOS-FR method was initially proposed and tested using
   high-carbon-number (heptane and above) hydrocarbons for solvent at
   ambient pressure and temperatures lower than 90 degrees C for oil-wet
   consolidated sandstones and carbonates (Al-Bahlani and Babadagli 2008,
   2009a; Naderi et al. 2013). Later, lower-carbon-number (propane and
   butane) hydrocarbons were tested at higher pressures and temperatures
   for consolidated water-wet and oil-wet sandstones and carbonates (Naderi
   and Babadagli 2012a). This study focuses on the unconsolidated sands
   (water-wet nature) and tests three different types of gases as solvent
   {[}propane, butane, and carbon dioxide (CO2)] at high-pressure
   and-temperature conditions (compatible with a typical heavy-oil-sand
   deposit in Canada).
   The use of CO2 as a solvent in this type of process was considered as a
   lower-cost alternative to more-expensive hydrocarbons and for its
   permanent-storage potential. Several issues are highly critical in this
   process. Like other hydrocarbon solvents used under nonisothermal
   conditions, the recovery process is highly sensitive to pressure and
   temperature because they determine the miscibility level. Also important
   is the capability of CO2 to extract matrix oil. Our earlier studies with
   light oil showed that heavier ends can be extracted if enough time is
   allowed for CO2 to interact with matrix oil (Trivedi and Babadagli
   2009a, 2010). The same needs to be investigated for heavy oils. Another
   challenge is the inverse proportionality of CO2 solubility with
   temperature. Steam (or heating) is required to condition oil and
   decrease its viscosity before CO2 injection, but the temperature should
   be adjusted critically in order not to sacrifice the CO2 solubility of
   the oil.
   To clarify all these points and to determine the optimal application
   conditions (the duration of each cycle and the CO2 soaking time), we
   conducted a series of experiments by first soaking core samples
   saturated with heavy oil in steam, followed by CO2. In the third cycle,
   steam (or hot water) was injected again to produce upgraded oil in the
   matrix. The experiments were performed under static conditions (soaking
   sandpack samples in steam or CO2 chambers) at different temperatures and
   pressures to determine the optimal application conditions. A similar
   experimental protocol was followed using propane and butane, and the
   recovery potential of these hydrocarbon solvents was compared with that
   of CO2.}},

Title = {{Scaleup of Effective Mass Transfer in Vapour-Extraction Process
   Accounting for Field-Scale Reservoir Heterogeneities}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Vapour extraction (VAPEX) is a nonthermal process using vapourized
   solvents, with promising potential to reduce steam consumption in
   heavy-oil recovery. The key recovery mechanisms are convection and
   molecular diffusion enhanced by various spreading mechanisms {[}e.g.,
   capillarity and velocity variations at the micro- and macroscale (i.e.,
   dispersion and mixing)]. The efficiency of diffusion/dispersion depends
   significantly on reservoir heterogeneities, which exhibit a wide range
   of length scales. This paper demonstrates a procedure for quantifying
   the scaling characteristics of effective mass transfer accounting for
   heterogeneities based on the volume-averaging approach.
   Volume averaging is a mathematical technique used to derive continuum
   equations at coarse scales given representative transport equations at
   fine scales. Although treatment of transport problems has been published
   in the past, application to stochastic geological systems is limited. In
   the proposed procedure, results from a fine-scale numerical flow
   simulation reflecting the full physics of VAPEX over a small element of
   the reservoir are integrated by use of the volume-averaging technique to
   provide effective description of mass transfer at the coarse scale.
   Scaling characteristics of effective mass transfer are investigated
   systematically for different heterogeneity distributions. Results show
   (1) spatial variability of effective-mass-transfer coefficients
   increases as a solvent chamber advances through the reservoir; (2) mean
   and variance of effective-mass transfer vary with length scale in a
   fashion similar to that of recovery statistics; and (3) variability in
   effective-mass transfer is a strong nonlinear function of heterogeneity.
   An original contribution is to provide a general framework for
   developing scaling relationships of effective mass transfer in VAPEX
   accounting for reservoir heterogeneities. It also presents an important
   potential in modelling of other solvent-injection applications. Results
   demonstrate that effective-mass transfer varies with length scale and
   heterogeneity; hence, it should be represented properly for accurate
   prediction of recovery performance in simulations using scaled-up
   reservoir models.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging networks and applications require enormous data storage.
   Holographic techniques promise high-capacity storage, given resolution
   of a few remaining technical issues. In this paper, we propose a
   technique to overcome one such issue: mitigation of large magnitude
   peaks in the stored image that cause material saturation resulting in
   readout errors. We consider the use of ternary data symbols, with
   modulation in amplitude and phase, and use a phase mask during the
   encoding stage to reduce the probability of large peaks arising in the
   stored Fourier domain image. An appropriate mask is selected from a
   predefined set of pseudo-random masks by computing the Fourier transform
   of the raw data array as well as the data array multiplied by each mask.
   The data array or masked array with the lowest Fourier domain peak
   values is recorded. On readout, the recorded array is multiplied by the
   mask used during recording to recover the original data array.
   Simulations are presented that demonstrate the benefit of this approach,
   and provide insight into the appropriate number of phase masks to use in
   high capacity holographic data storage systems. (C) 2014 The Japan

Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{126-146}},

Abstract = {{Underground coal gasification (UCG) has been identified as an
   environmentally friendly technique for in-situ gasification of deep
   unmineable coal seams. As coal is gasified, a cavity is created which
   grows with time. Cavity evolution along with high temperature imposes
   changes to the coal and surrounding strata. Understanding structural
   changes in the coal during drying/vaporization, pyrolysis, and
   gasification in UCG is a key factor in studying growth of the
   gasification zone and helps in optimizing the UCG process in order to
   minimize syn- and post-gasification risks to the strata and groundwater.
   The main objective of this study is to elaborate structural impacts of
   UCG process on coal and to review the current state of knowledge in the
   area of influence of elevated temperature on transport and mechanical
   properties of coal in the context of UCG. Published high-pressure
   high-temperature experimental studies on coals are very scarce; hence,
   this study reviews and compares the behavior of different rank coals
   from different parts of the world in order to develop a pathway for
   future high-pressure high-temperature geomechanical experiments of
   coals. Impact of elevated temperature on weight loss, thermal
   deformation, microcrack generation, pore volume, average pore aperture,
   porosity, permeability, tensile, compressive and shear stress-strain
   responses, elastic and shear moduli, and Poisson's ratio of the coals
   under study are discussed and compared. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Understanding of mineralogy and residence of trace elements in coals via
   a novel method combining low temperature ashing and float-sink technique}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{162-171}},

Abstract = {{For understanding the mineralogical characteristic and trace element
   affinities to specific minerals in coals, a combined method has been
   adopted and evaluated, which is low temperature oxygen-plasma ashing
   followed by float-sink density separation in bromoform. Mineral matter
   would be isolated from coals, and light (<2.89 g/cm(3)) and heavy (>2.89
   g/cm(3)) mineral fractions would be separated from coal low temperature
   ash residues. Coals collected from three coalfields in China, namely
   Xiaolongtan (XLT), Huolinhe (HLH) and Yangquan (YQ), have been studied.
   Mineralogical characteristic of coals was characterized by X-ray
   diffraction and a field emission scanning electron microscope equipped
   with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The distributions of trace
   elements in coals, low temperature ashes, and light and heavy mineral
   fractions were determined by inductively coupled-plasma mass
   spectrometry.
   The results show that minerals of different densities in coal can be
   successfully isolated and separated into two mineral fractions with the
   help of the combined method. Phase-mineral compositions in light mineral
   fraction of each coal are very similar to those in the respective low
   temperature ashes as a whole. Phases identified in the heavy mineral
   fraction are completely different from those in the low temperature ash
   and the light mineral fraction of each coal. Pyrite dominates in the
   heavy mineral fractions froth the three coals, which constitutes up 48.7
   wt.\%, 82.9 wt\%, and 100 wt.\% in the heavy mineral fraction of YQ,
   XLT, and HLH coals, respectively. Pyrite particles mostly occur as
   euhedral crystals, which display well-defined shapes, such as pentagonal

Abstract = {{Quantitatively reconstructing optical absorption using photoacoustic
   imaging is nontrivial. Theoretical hurdles, such as nonuniqueness and
   numerical instability, can be mitigated by using multiple illuminations.
   However, even with multiple illuminations, using ANSI-safety-limited
   fluence for practical imaging may result in poor performance owing to
   limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate the use of
   S-sequence coded patterned illumination to boost SNR while preserving
   the enhanced stability of multiple-illumination iterative techniques.

Abstract = {{Nanomembranes with thicknesses less than 100 nm and high
   width-to-thickness ratios are of interest in sensing, energy storage,
   actuator, and optical applications. The fabrication of conductive
   nanocomposite aluminum-molybdenum (AlMo) membranes as thin as 28 nm and
   high fracture strength is reported. The density, Poisson's ratio, and
   Young's modulus of the membranes were determined to be rho = 5000 +/-
   550 kg/m(3), sigma = 0.33 +/- 0.05, and E = 127 +/- 21 GPa,
   respectively. The intrinsic stress of the membranes was determined by
   bulge testing, finite element analysis (FEA), and classical mechanics.
   The resonance frequencies of the membranes were assessed using FEA and
   measured by optical interferometry. The fracture strength of the AlMo
   membranes was 1.89 +/- 0.45 GPa, and the average resistivity was rho =
   5810 +/- 44 mu Omega cm. The high fracture strength and low resistivity
   of such AlMo membranes makes them attractive in the design of
   microdevices requiring ultrathin yet electrically conductive membranes.

Abstract = {{Imaging recommendations for the follow-up of heart transplant recipients
   (HTRs) lack evidence justifying their prognostic value. Cardiovascular
   magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) can characterize heart structure and
   function and has prognostic value in many myocardial diseases. We
   hypothesized that CMRI evaluation of cardiac allografts would predict
   adverse events. We performed CMRI on 60 HTRs evaluating biventricular
   size, function and myocardial scar. We performed survival analysis to
   identify independent predictors of cardiovascular (CV) death or
   hospitalization. Participants had a mean age of 51 +/- 14 years, mean
   graft age of 3.5 years (+/- 4) and 75\% are male. Median follow-up time
   was 4.9 years with 22 CV hospitalizations and 7 CV deaths. A
   multivariable survival analysis of imaging and clinical variables
   identified myocardial scar (hazard ratio {[}HR] of 10.7, p = 0.005),
   right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI; 1.1/mL/m(2), p =
   0.001), graft age (HR = 1.2/year, p = 0.004) and previous allograft
   rejection (HR = 4.4, p = 0.006) as predictive of time to CV death or

Abstract = {{Emissions from crude recovery contribute significantly to the life cycle
   GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions of transportation fuels. Recovery
   emissions come from drilling and land use change, crude extraction,
   crude oil processing, venting, flaring, and fugitives. In this study an
   attempt has been made to provide a transparent quantification of GHG
   emissions from oil well drilling and land use change, crude recovery and
   associated gas and water treatment, and venting and flaring for five
   North American conventional crudes through the development of
   data-intensive engineering models. Estimates of emissions from crude
   extraction were made from recovery efficiency, the amount of energy
   used, and process fuel shares in extraction techniques. Extraction
   emissions vary from 1.24 g-CO2eq/MJ for Bow River heavy oil to 23
   g-CO2eq/MJ for California's Kern County heavy oil. The amount of gas
   vented and flared per m(3) of crude extracted was determined to quantify
   venting and flaring emissions. The amount of energy required for crude
   oil processing was quantified based on the properties of crude oil and
   different techniques applied in the Oil fields. Of the five crudes we
   studied, California's Kern County heavy oil and Mars crude oil emit the
   highest and lowest emissions: 23.85 g-CO2eq/MJ and 3.94 g-CO2eq/MJ,

Abstract = {{Condition assessment is a key component of successful asset management,
   and many diverse condition assessment protocols exist for sewer mains.
   These protocols are used to generate condition grades for sewer mains
   after inspection. Condition assessment protocols are important because
   renewal actions for sewers are prioritized based on condition grades. If
   condition grades assigned to sewers do not reflect actual pipe
   conditions close enough, the resulting allocation of resources will not
   be the best. This paper presents a comparison of three possible sewer
   condition assessment protocols for the City of Edmonton: the Pipeline
   Assessment and Certification Program quick grading method, the Manual of
   Sewer Condition Classification fourth edition, and the City of
   Edmonton's Sewer Physical Condition Classification Manual. The results
   show that structural sewer condition grades depend significantly on the
   protocol used; therefore, protocol selection has significant financial
   consequences for asset management programs in the city.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Our purpose was to test the following hypotheses: (1)
   patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome who develop significant
   tricuspid regurgitation (TR) or require tricuspid valve (TV) surgery in
   the medium term have detectable TV abnormalities by 3-dimensional
   echocardiography (3DE) prestage 1 palliation and (2) TR is associated
   with reduced survival and increased TV intervention.
   Methods and Results-Infants were prospectively studied with 3DE and 2DE
   prestage 1 and followed up for the end points of TR, TV surgery,
   transplantation, or death. From prestage 1 3DE, spatial coordinates of
   TV annulus and leaflets were extracted; annulus size, leaflet area,
   prolapse volume, tethering volume, bending angle, and papillary muscle
   angle were measured. TR was assessed prestage 1 and at latest follow-up.
   Of 70 patients, 62 (88.6\%) had mild or less TR and 8 (11.4\%) had
   moderate or greater TR prestage 1. Prestage 1 tethering volume
   correlated to leaflet area (r=0.736; P<0.001), annulus area (r=0.651;
   P<0.001), right ventricular end-diastolic area (r=0.347; P=0.003),
   fractional area change (r=-0.387; P<0.001), and TR grade (r=0.447;
   P<0.001). At follow-up, 46 (65.7\%) had mild or less TR (group A) and 24
   (34.3\%) had moderate or greater TR (group B). Prestage 1 3DE showed
   greater TV tethering volume and flatter annulus in group B. Survival was
   better in group A.
   Conclusions-Increased TV tethering volume and flatter bending angle
   prestage 1 palliation is associated with TV failure at medium-term
   follow-up. Increased prestage 1 tethering is related to having larger TV
   annulus, larger leaflet area, larger right ventricular size, and reduced
   systolic function. TR progression results in increased TV intervention
   and decreased survival.}},

Abstract = {{Performance analysis of the p-norm detector to date has been limited to
   ad hoc approximations, nonfading channels, and Rayleigh fading. To
   overcome these limitations, we develop several analytical/numerical
   solutions for detection probability P-d and false alarm probability P-f,
   which are necessary to specify the receiver operating characteristic
   (ROC) curves of the p-norm detector. First, for nonfading channels
   (additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) only), the moment-generating
   function (mgf) of the decision variable is derived in two forms: 1)
   closed form for even integer p and 2) series form for arbitrary p. To
   evaluate P-d and P-f, a numerical method utilizing the Talbot inversion
   is developed for case 1, and an infinite series expansion with
   convergence acceleration based on the epsilon-algorithm is derived for
   case 2. As an alternative to mgf-based analysis, a Laguerre polynomial
   series is also used to derive new P-d and P-f approximations. Second,
   series-form mgf-based P-d expressions are derived for kappa-mu and
   alpha-mu fading channels. Third, for antenna diversity reception, new
   p-law combining (pLC) and p-law selection (pLS) schemes are proposed.
   The performance of these combiners with the p-norm detector is derived
   for Nakagami-m fading and is compared with that of the classical maximal
   ratio combining (MRC) and selection combining (SC). Interestingly, both
   pLC and pLS perform similarly to SC at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
   but outperform it at relatively high SNR, with pLC performing closer to
   the optimal MRC. Numerical results are presented to verify the derived
   results and to provide further insights.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the global need for efficient energy recovery, a new
   water-alternate-emulsion (WAE) technique for enhanced oil recovery is
   presented here. The key to this technique is the use of ex situ
   generated emulsion to recover the resident oil phase from reservoirs,
   where the emulsion is injected along with water in alternate slugs.
   Three different flooding ratios for water to emulsion (oil-in-water)
   slugs were investigated here using an unconsolidated sand pack as a
   model porous medium. It was found that for 5:1 WAE flooding, the total
   amount of oil recovered is 82\% of OOIP for only 0.3 PV injection. This
   is significantly higher rate of recovery compared to conventional water
   flooding or emulsion flooding alone. Hence, the WAE flooding technique
   tested under laboratory conditions appears to be a promising technology
   for an enhanced oil recovery process, which needs to be tested in field
   reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, an observer based controller synthesis is proposed based
   on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework to achieve stabilization
   of the parabolic PDE in the presence of input constraints. A novel
   feature of the proposed synthesis is to construct the LMI formulation
   within the modal space by converting the original parabolic PDE into an
   infinite-dimensional abstract state space setting. The state feedback
   controller and the Luenberger observer are developed by accounting for
   the entire infinite number of modal states, thereby stabilizing the
   system and reconstructing the state rigorously. The input constraints
   naturally existing in realistic applications are considered in the
   design framework. Finally, since initial modal states are hardly known
   in advance, the LMI formulation, based on the augmented modal state
   space, including unstable modal states, its estimation error and fast
   modal output, is developed to maximize the region of attraction (ROA)
   for the real process state, such that the controller and the observer
   are robust enough to the error in the initial state guess. By
   considering a numerical example of an unstable parabolic PDE, we
   demonstrate that if feasible, the state feedback controller and the
   observer, generated by the LMI formulation, have capability to drive the
   process state to the equilibrium steady state. (C) 2014 European Control

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid forward and backward threshold voltage
   compensated radio-frequency to direct current (RF-to-DC) power
   conversion circuit for RF energy harvesting applications. The proposed
   circuit uses standard p-channel metal-oxide semiconductor transistors in
   all the stages except for the first few stages to allow individual body
   biasing eliminating the need for triple-well technology in the
   previously reported forward compensation schemes. Two different RF-DC
   power conversion circuits, one optimized to provide high power
   conversion efficiency (PCE) and the other to produce a large output DC
   voltage harvested from extremely low input power levels, are designed
   and fabricated in IBM's 0.13 mu m complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. The first circuit exhibits a
   measured maximum PCE of 22.6\% at -16.8 dBm (20.9 mu W) and produces 1 V
   across a 1 M Omega load from a remarkably low input power level of -21.6
   dBm (6.9 mu W) while the latter circuit produces 2.8 V across a 1M Omega
   load from a peak-to-peak input voltage of 170 mV achieving a voltage
   multiplication ratio of 17. Also, design strategies are developed to
   enhance the output DC voltage and to optimize the PCE of threshold
   voltage compensated voltage multiplier.}},

Abstract = {{Energy consumption is a major concern in nanoscale CMOS ICs; the
   power-OFF operational mode and low-voltage circuits have been proposed
   to alleviate energy dissipation. Static random access memories (SRAMs)
   are widely used in today's chips; nonvolatile SRAMs (NVSRAMs) have been
   proposed to preserve data, while providing fast power-ON/OFF speeds.
   Nonvolatile operation is usually accomplished by the use of a resistive
   RAM circuit (hence referred to as RRAM); the utilization of a RRAM with
   an SRAMs not only enables chips to achieve low energy consumption for
   nonvolatile operation, but it also permits to restore data when a
   restore on power-up is performed (this operation is also commonly
   referred to as ``Instant-on{''}). This paper presents a novel NVSRAM
   circuit for ``Instant-on{''} operation and evaluates its performance at
   nanometric feature sizes. The proposed memory cell consists of a SRAM
   core (in this case, a 6T cell) and an oxide resistive RRAM circuit
   (1T1R), thus making a 7T1R scheme. The proposed cell offers better
   nonvolatile performance (in terms of operations such as ``Store,{''}
   ``Power-down,{''} and ``Restore{''}) when compared with existing
   nonvolatile cells. The scenario of multiple-context configuration is
   also analyzed. Figures of merit such as energy, operational delay, and
   area are also substantially improved, making the proposed design a
   better scheme for ``Instant-on{''} operation.}},

Abstract = {{The drinking water industry is paying more attention to water quality
   monitoring systems that provide real-time detection of contaminants in
   drinking water distribution systems. This thesis presents the results of
   an experimental challenge study on one such system, the Hach
   GuardianBlue Early Warning System. Contaminants of interest included
   organic and inorganic chemicals, and sewage. Experimental results showed
   that the system responded to all of the injected contaminants, except
   dichloromethane, but failed to correctly identify any of the
   contaminants. A mathematical model was used to determine the detection
   limit. Several system design and operational limitations were also
   identified. The GuardianBlue system could not identify a contaminant
   when it detected the changes in water quality parameters. A few
   improvements on the system design need to be done before the system can
   be deployed in the distribution network. At this moment, it can be
   merely used as an online water quality monitor. (C) 2014 American

   coupled lines integrated with the MEMS capacitor is developed and used
   for tuning. The proposed structure is analyzed by considering the LC
   equivalent circuit of the MEMS capacitor and it is shown that an extra
   transmission zero (notch-band) is realized at its resonance. Each
   notch-band frequency can be independently tuned up to 1 GHz using MEMS
   capacitors actuation, while the filter performance across its ultrawide
   pass-band remains unchanged. The proposed filter is suitable for UWB

Abstract = {{Blood biomarkers are potentially powerful diagnostic tools that are
   limited clinically by low concentrations, the inability to determine
   biomarker origin and unknown patient baseline. Recently, ultrasound has
   been shown to liberate proteins and large mRNA biomarkers, overcoming
   many of these limitations. We have since demonstrated that adding
   lipid-stabilized microbubbles elevates mRNA concentration an order of
   magnitude compared with ultrasound without microbubbles, in vitro.
   Unfortunately the large size of some mRNA molecules may limit efficiency
   of release and hinder efficacy as an ultrasound-liberated biomarker. We
   hypothesize that smaller molecules will be released more efficiently
   with ultrasound than larger molecules. Although investigation of large
   libraries of biomarkers should be performed to fully validate this
   hypothesis, we focus on a small subset of mRNA and micro-RNAs.
   Specifically, we focus on miR-21 (22 base pairs {[}bp]), which is
   upregulated in certain forms of cancer, compared with previously
   investigated mammaglobin mRNA (502 bp). We also report release of
   micro-RNA miR-155 (22 bp) and housekeeping rRNA S18 (1869 bp). More than
   10 million additional miR-21 copies per 100,000 cells are released with
   ultrasound-microbubble exposure. The low- molecular-weight miR-21 proved
   to be liberated 50 times more efficiently than high-molecular-weight
   mammaglobin mRNA, releasing orders of magnitude more miR-21 than
   mammaglobin mRNA under comparable conditions. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{One of the challenges of full-scale computer simulation of a catalytic
   reactor is to consider the different scales involved in the problem in a
   practical fashion. In a monolith catalytic converter, these scales range
   from the molecular scale for the reactions, through the pore scale,
   washcoat scale, channel scale, and finally the full converter scale.
   This paper describes the implementation of a model reduction methodology
   using look-up tables to perform a consistent comparison of six different
   catalytic converters used for the catalytic combustion of methane. A
   detailed mechanistic model for methane combustion is used. Diffusion in
   the non-uniform washcoat is considered. The converters have different
   cell densities and wall thicknesses. Steady state and transient
   light-off simulations are performed. Efficient computational speed is
   achieved by successive model reduction, which allows the preservation of
   detailed small-scale information. The results obtained show that there
   is a non-intuitive relationship between the various operating
   parameters, which can only be deduced from a comprehensive model.}},

Abstract = {{Lubricated pipe flow (LPF) is a pipeline transportation technology for
   highly viscous oils. In this technology, a viscous oil-core is
   lubricated by an enveloping water annulus. A major technical challenge
   for LPF is the flow instability caused by a fouling layer of viscous oil
   on pipe wall. To monitor the thickness of this layer, application of a
   capacitance sensor has been investigated. The experiments were conducted
   with two laboratory-scale sensors: a bench-top concentric pipe spool
   set-up and a rectangular flow cell. The experimental study was
   complemented with simulations obtained using COMSOL Multiphysics. The
   results from these experimental and numerical studies are in good

   similar to the ones described here can be used to monitor the thickness
   of a wall-fouling layer. This monitoring will facilitate the reliable

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new family of universal control and management
   strategies for microgrids in smart distribution grids. The paper also
   provides a general and computationally-efficient framework for modeling
   and analysis of power management strategies in a microgrid with
   multiple-distributed generation (DG) units which eases microgrid dynamic
   studies and controller parameters selection in large microgrids with
   multiple DG units. Three different approaches for real and reactive
   power management are proposed. The controllers offer the following
   advantages: 1) the proposed topologies can be applied to both
   voltage-controlled (VC) and current controlled (CC) voltage source
   converters (VSCs). 2) The controllers are universal and realize
   requirements of both grid-connected and islanded modes, i.e., they share
   real and reactive power during islanding with constant frequency
   operation and act as grid supporting VSCs in the grid connected mode. 3)
   The drooping variables can be either power or current, thus VC-power
   drooping, VC-current drooping and CC-power drooping are different
   available variants. 4) The concept of hybrid polar-vector control is
   developed in this paper. Thus, it can combine the benefits of both types
   of controllers in one augmented strategy. 5) The controller emulates the
   behavior of conventional synchronous generators (SGs) which in turn
   results in better integration of electronically-interfaced DG units into
   the power system and prevents instabilities due to interaction of fast
   response DGs and SGs. 6) The controllers realize seamless and robust
   transition to the islanding mode. The controllers are developed under
   new concept of synchronous converters. A theoretical analysis and
   simulation results show that the proposed controllers yield the
   aforementioned requirements in one compact structure.}},

Title = {{Buoyant convection from a discrete source in a leaky porous medium}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{755}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The application of turbulent plume theory in describing the dynamics of
   emptying filling boxes, control volumes connected to an infinite
   exterior through a series of openings along the upper and lower
   boundaries, has yielded novel strategies for the natural ventilation of
   buildings. Making the plume laminar and having it fall through a porous
   medium yields a problem of fundamental significance in its own right,
   insights from which may be applied, for example, in minimizing the
   contamination of drinking water by geologically sequestered CO2 or the
   chemicals leached from waste piles. After reviewing the theory
   appropriate to rectilinear and axisymmetric plumes in porous media, we
   demonstrate how the model equations may be adapted to the case of an
   emptying filling box. In this circumstance, the long-time solution
   consists of two ambient layers, each of which has a uniform density. The
   lower and upper layers comprise fluid that is respectively discharged by
   the plume and advected into the box through the upper opening. Our
   theory provides an estimate for both the height and thickness of the
   associated interface in terms of, for example, the source volume and
   buoyancy fluxes, the outlet area and permeability, and the depth-average
   solute dispersion coefficient, which is itself a function of the
   far-field horizontal flow speed. Complementary laboratory experiments
   are provided for the case of a line source plume and show very good
   agreement with model predictions. Our measurements also indicate that
   the permeability, k(f), of the lower opening (or fissure) decreases with
   the density of the fluid being discharged, a fact that has been
   overlooked in some previous studies, wherein k(f) is assumed to depend
   only on the fissure geometry.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an investigation into the role of
   peat fibers in the development of anisotropic stiffness and strength
   within peat samples taken from below three Canadian National Railway
   embankments across Canada. These sites include two from northern Alberta
   on the Edson and Lac-La-Biche subdivisions and one from the Levis
   subdivision in southern Quebec. The peat samples were collected in
   Shelby tubes and were subjected to a program of consolidated undrained
   triaxial testing. These samples represented a wide variation in fiber
   content and degree of humification. The measured pore-pressure response
   during undrained loading indicated that the peat samples were undergoing
   an anisotropic elastic response to loading. This pore-pressure response
   was similar in the peat from all three sites, with an anisotropic
   pore-pressure parameter, a, of approximately 0.3. The stiffness and
   strength of the different peats were also similar, with an elastic
   modulus of approximately 1.7-2.2 MPa and an effective shear strength of
   38 degrees. The yielding behavior of the laboratory specimens suggested
   that plastic yielding occurs without the development of distinct failure
   planes and is accompanied by strain hardening. The combined effect of
   the effective strength parameters and the anisotropic pore-pressure
   response on the reinforcement provided by the peat fibers is also
   presented. This analysis showed that the net effect is dependent on the
   initial stress state of the peat. Under elevated mean effective stresses
   and low deviatoric stresses, the fibers may have a detrimental effect on
   strength. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the industrial importance of alpha-iron-based polycrystalline
   materials, their grain boundary (GB) structures and properties need to
   be well characterized and understood in order to optimize the materials
   through effective GB engineering. In this study, a molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulation study was performed to investigate a series of < 110 >
   symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) and asymmetric tilt grain
   boundaries (ATGBs) in alpha-iron. It is shown that the GB energy is
   proportional to the GB volumetric expansion. During uniaxial
   deformation, < 111 > \{112\} twinning appears to be more competitive or
   easier than < 111 > \{112\} dislocation emission from the GB at
   yielding. For bicrystal systems containing STGBs the yield strength
   obeys the Schmid law, while for ATGB bicrystal systems the yield
   strengths are mainly determined by the local stress rather than overall
   stress and average GB energy. The higher degree of atomic disordering in
   the ATGB regions generates larger local stress fluctuation and thus
   facilitates local defect emission when subjected to external stresses.}},

Abstract = {{C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) signaling has been implicated as an
   important regulator of chondrogenic differentiation during endochondral
   bone development. This preliminary study further investigated the
   putative effectors and/or targets of CNP signaling in transforming
   growth factor (TGF)-beta induced in vitro chondrogenic differentiation
   of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Previously characterized human
   trabecular bone derived MSCs were induced either with only TGF-beta 1 or
   with a combination of TGF-beta 1 and CNP in micromass culture for 10 or
   20 days. Genome wide gene expression profile changes in between these
   two groups were analyzed on day-10 or day-20 of culture. Results
   revealed that there were only 7 genes, whose expression change was
   fourfolds or higher in TGF-beta 1 and CNP fed group in comparison to
   only TGF-beta 1 fed group. The up-regulated genes included matrilin-3
   (MATN3), engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1), CD24, and DCN1,
   defective in cullin neddylation 1, domain containing 1 (DCUN1D1). The
   down-regulated genes, on the other hand, included LIM domain kinase 2
   (LIMK2), Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1, and guanine nucleotide
   binding protein (G protein), gamma 12 (GNG12). The up-regulation of
   MATN3 was confirmed on the basis of RT-PCR. The known literature on both
   CNP signaling and MATN3 function in chondrogenesis match with each other
   and suggest MATN3 as a putative effector and/or target of CNP signaling

Abstract = {{Objectives. Explore craniofacial landmarks reliability to superimpose
   cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images and assess impact of plane
   reorientation on airway parameters.
   Study design. 10 CBCTs were marked 3 times at baseline, 3 T1, to test
   landmark reliability. Measurement errors of new coordinate system were
   tested using 3 T1, and other 10 paired CBCT images, at T1 and T2. Effect
   on upper airway was assessed using volume, surface area, and point-based
   analysis.
   Results. Tips of nasal bone and clivus and foramina spinosa defined the
   new coordinate system. Plane reorientation didn't affect landmark
   identification reliability and significantly reduced interlandmark
   distances from T1-T2. Airway volume changed by 25.76 +/- 24.9\%, surface
   area by 13.85 +/- 10.8\%, and mean part analysis was 0.43 +/- 0.3 mm.
   Strong correlation (R-2 > 65\%) was found between airway analysis and
   large distances in second and third cervical vertebrae.
   Conclusions. Coordinate transformation significantly reduced measurement
   errors in longitudinal CBCT data; however, it is not designed to correct
   for large neck flexion.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of four
   commonly used myocardial T1 mapping sequences: modified Look-Locker
   inversion recovery (MOLLI), shortened MOLLI (ShMOLLI), saturation
   recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA), and saturation pulse prepared
   heart rate independent inversion recovery (SAPPHIRE).
   Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the
   institutional review board. All subjects provided written informed
   consent. Accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the four T1 mapping
   sequences were first compared in phantom experiments. In vivo analysis
   was performed in seven healthy subjects (mean age 6 standard deviation,
   38 years +/- 19; four men, three women) who were imaged twice on two
   separate days. In vivo reproducibility of native T1 mapping and
   extracellular volume (ECV) were measured. Differences between the
   sequences were assessed by using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum
   tests (phantom data) and mixed-effect models (in vivo data).
   Results: T1 mapping accuracy in phantoms was lower with ShMOLLI (62
   msec) and MOLLI (44 msec) than with SASHA (13 msec; P < .05) and
   SAPPHIRE (12 msec; P,.05). MOLLI had similar precision to ShMOLLI (4.0
   msec vs 5.6 msec; P = .07) but higher precision than SAPPHIRE (6.8 msec;
   P = .002) and SASHA (8.7 msec; P < .001). All sequences had similar
   reproducibility in phantoms (P = .1). The four sequences had similar in
   vivo reproducibility for native T1 mapping (similar to 25-50 msec; P >
   .05) and ECV quantification (similar to 0.01-0.02; P > .05).
   Conclusion: SASHA and SAPPHIRE yield higher accuracy, lower precision,
   and similar reproducibility compared with MOLLI and ShMOLLI for T1
   measurement. Different sequences yield different ECV values; however,
   all sequences have similar reproducibility for ECV quantification.

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICS A-SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{206-210}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Some recent experiments have showed that measured resonant frequencies
   of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were often much lower than the
   theoretical resonant frequencies predicted by the widely used elastic
   beam model which defines the whole MWCNTs as a single elastic beam. The
   present work aims at offering a reasonable explanation of this
   discrepancy by considering interlayer degrees of freedom of MWCNTs. To
   this end, vibration of MWCNts with various outer and inner boundary
   constraints is studied. MWCNTs are modeled as a coupling beam system in
   which the outermost tube(s) is simulated as a single beam while all
   other inner tubes are modeled as another single beam and the two beams
   are coupled through van der walls interlayer forces. To better fit
   typical experimental conditions, the outmost tube is assumed to be
   doubly clamped into the surrounding matrix while all other inner tubes
   are assumed to be free at their ends. Our results confirmed that the
   interlayer degrees of freedom of MWCNts have a substantial effect on
   reducing natural frequencies and thus offer a plausible explanation for
   the observed lower natural frequencies as compared to the theoretical
   predictions of the single beam model which ignored all interlayer
   degrees of freedom. Typically, the natural frequencies predicted by the
   present model are about 30\% lower than those predicted by the single
   beam model, in good agreement with a few recently reported experimental
   data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present work studies a self-similar high-speed expanding crack of
   mode-I in a ductile material with a modified cohesive zone model.
   Compared with existing Dugdale models for moving crack, the new features
   of the present model are that the normal stress parallel to crack faces
   is included in the yielding condition in the cohesive zone and traction
   force in the cohesive zone can be non-uniform. For a ductile material
   defined by von Mises criterion without hardening, the present model
   confirms that the normal stress parallel to crack face increases with
   increasing crack speed and can be even larger than the normal traction
   in the cohesive zone, which justifies the necessity of including the
   normal stress parallel to the crack faces in the yielding condition at
   high crack speed. In addition, strain hardening effect is examined based
   on a non-uniform traction distribution in the cohesive zone.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The dependence of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) eigenvalues
   and fractional anisotropy (FA) on short diffusion times was investigated
   using oscillating gradient spin echo (OGSE) and pulsed gradient spin
   echo (PGSE) DTI in the human brain in vivo.
   Theory and Methods: DTI was performed in seven healthy volunteers at 4.7
   Tesla (T) with b = 300 s/mm(2) and diffusion times of 4.1 ms (OGSE 50
   Hz), 7.4 ms (OGSE 25 Hz), 20 ms (PGSE), and 40 ms (PGSE). Eigenvalues
   and FA were compared in the corpus callosum body, splenium and genu, and
   the corticospinal, cingulum, inferior fronto-occipital, superior and
   inferior longitudinal fasciculi using tractography, and the thalamus and
   putamen using region-of-interest.
   Results: Relative to 40 ms, the 4.1 ms diffusion time led to significant
   increases in DTI eigenvalues in seven white matter tracts (6\% to 20\%
   parallel, 13\% to 40\% perpendicular) and both deep gray matter regions
   (16\% parallel, 18\% to 26\% perpendicular), and reductions of FA (-9\%
   to -12\%) in four tracts.
   Conclusion: DTI eigenvalues and FA depend on diffusion time in both
   white and gray matter in the human brain. The ability to target
   different length scales by means of the diffusion time may improve
   sensitivity to changes in tissue microstructure associated with
   pathology. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Semi-Analytical Proxy for Vapex Process Modeling in Heterogeneous
   Reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Vapex (vapor extraction) is a nonthermal process that has significant
   potential in providing a more environmentally friendly and
   energy-efficient alternative to steam injection. Vaporized solvent
   injected in-situ dissolves into the oil and reduces oil viscosity,
   allowing the oil to flow to a horizontal production well via
   gravitational forces. While compositional simulators are available for
   assessing the Vapex performance, the simulation process may become
   difficult when taking into account the uncertainty due to reservoir
   heterogeneity. A semi-analytical proxy is proposed to model the process,
   in a way analogous to the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) model
   described by Butler, who demonstrated the similarity between two
   processes with a series of Hele-Shaw experiments and derived an
   analytical steady-state flow rate relationship that is comparable with
   the SAGD case. Solvent concentration and intrinsic diffusivity are
   introduced in this model instead of temperature and thermal diffusivity
   in SAGD. In this paper, analytical solutions and implementation details
   for the Vapex proxy are presented. The proposed approach is then applied
   to various reservoirs discretized with spatially varying rock porosity
   and permeability values; bitumen drainage rate and solvent penetration
   are calculated sequentially at grid blocks along the solvent-bitumen
   interface over incremental time steps. Results from this model are
   compared against experimental data available in the literature as well
   as detailed compositional simulation studies. Computational requirement
   of the proxy in comparison with numerical simulations is also
   emphasized. An important contribution from this work is that process
   physics are built directly into this proxy, giving it an advantage over
   other data-driven modeling approaches (e. g., regression). It can be
   used as an efficient alternative to expensive detailed flow simulations.
   It presents an important potential for assessing the uncertainty due to
   multiscale heterogeneity on effective mass transfer and the resulting
   recovery performance, as well as assisting decisions-making for future
   pilot and field development.}},

Abstract = {{The steady-state effective particle density of mainstream smoke from a
   University of Kentucky 3R4F reference cigarette was determined using a
   Differential Mobility Analyser (DMA) and Centrifugal Particle Mass
   Analyser (CPMA). The cigarette smoke was generated using a smoking
   machine under ISO puffing parameters (35 ml puff of 2 s duration, every
   60 s) and collected in a Tedlar (R) bag. This smoke generation process
   resulted in the first puff of the smoking cycle aging approximately 7
   min longer than the last puff. The effective particle density (measured
   immediately upon completion of the last puff) was found to be
   independent of the particle mobility size, indicating the particles have
   a spherical morphology, with an average density of 1180 +/- 113 kg/m(3).
   Particle coagulation was also found to occur within the Tedlar (R) bag
   by comparing particle mobility size distributions, measured with a
   Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), against an analytical model.
   This model showed that particle coagulation dominated the particle
   number concentration decay within the Tedlar (R) bag compared to
   particle diffusion or settling losses. Therefore cigarette smoke
   particles must have a liquid component to maintain a constant effective
   particle density function in the presence of coagulation. After the 7
   min filling process, the effects of particle aging time and initial
   particle number concentration in the Tedlar (R) bag on the effective
   particle density were found to be small and indistinguishable within the
   bias uncertainty of the measurement system. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a
   transcription factor that plays a major role in the development of
   resistance to conventional anti-cancer drugs in many types of cancer,
   when constitutively activated. Inhibition of STAT3 is considered as a
   promising strategy for inhibition of tumor growth and overcoming the
   drug resistance manifested. In this study, the capability of STAT3
   knockdown by lipid substituted low molecular weight (2 kDa)
   polyethyleneimine (PEI2) complexes of STAT3-siRNA was assessed. The
   efficiency of PEI/STAT3-siRNA polyplexes in the induction of STAT3
   associated cell death in wild type and drug-resistant MDA-MB-435 breast
   cancer cells as monotherapy and upon combination with chemotherapeutic
   agents, doxorubicin and paclitaxel, was also investigated. Our results
   identified linoleic acid-substituted (PEI-LA) polymer as the most
   efficient carrier among different lipid substituted PEI2 for siRNA
   delivery, leading to most STAT3 associated loss of cell viability in
   MDA-MB-435 cells. STAT3-siRNA delivery by the PEI-LA polymer resulted in
   efficient down-regulation of STAT3 at both mRNA and protein levels.
   Furthermore, pretreatment of cancer cells with STAT3-siRNA formulation
   increased the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel in both
   wild type and drug resistant MDA-MB-435 cells. The results of this study
   point to the potential of PEI-LA polyplexes of STAT3-siRNA as inhibitors
   of STAT3 expression in breast tumor cells. The results also demonstrate
   an improved efficacy for chemotherapeutic drugs in combination with
   lipid-substituted low molecular weight PEI-LA/STAT3-siRNA complexes in
   comparison to drug therapy alone. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Brain imaging studies suggest that cortical thickness decreases during
   childhood and adolescence, in concert with underlying structural and
   synaptic changes required for cognitive maturation and regional
   specialization of function. Abnormalities of this protracted
   developmental process may provide key insights into the cognitive and
   behavioral deficits that emerge in individuals with fetal alcohol
   spectrum disorders (FASD). Several studies have demonstrated cortical
   thickness differences in children and adolescents who were prenatally
   exposed to alcohol, though all have been cross sectional, limiting
   conclusions about cortical development with age. In this study, we
   analyze serially collected T-1-weighted MRI from 11 children with FASD
   and 21 controls, scanned twice each similar to 2 to 4 years apart.
   Mixed-models analysis of cortical thickness measurements revealed
   age-by-group interactions in cortical thinning, with FASD participants
   undergoing less developmental thinning than controls across many regions
   of the cortex, particularly in medial frontal and parietal areas. These
   results provide further longitudinal evidence in humans that prenatal
   alcohol exposure is associated with altered patterns of brain
   development that persist during childhood and adolescence. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Many severe dynamical loadings such as earthquakes and strong winds may

   alternative design for the old-fashioned design methods, which are
   relatively inefficient in response to these unforeseen conditions. In
   the current study, benefits of employing the modern control systems for
   design of tall buildings in comparison with the uncontrolled
   traditionally designed structures are thoroughly investigated. To
   contract the vibrational responses due to seismic excitations, the

Abstract = {{This study investigates the dynamics of flocculation and transport of
   solid particles suspended in a liquid propellant. Polydisperse particles
   with lognormal size distribution are considered. Collision of particles
   is presumed to be controlled by upward velocity differential and
   Brownian motion. These mechanisms are enhanced by the van der Waals
   force. Flocculation of the particles is described using the continuous
   form of the Smoluchowski equation. Upward transport of the particles is
   specified via a convection term. The general dynamics of the system is
   governed by a nonlinear transient partial integro-differential equation
   which is solved numerically. The technique employed is based on
   discretizing the size distribution function using orthogonal collocation
   on finite elements. This is combined with a finite difference
   discretization of the physical domain, and an explicit
   Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg time marching scheme. The numerical analysis is
   validated by comparing with a closed form analytical solution. The
   simulation results represent the particle size distribution as a
   function of time and position. The method allows prediction of the
   effects of the initial conditions and physical properties of the
   suspension on its dynamic behavior and phase separation. (C) 2014

Title = {{Collision modification functions: Incorporating changes over time}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{46-54}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Collision modification factors (CMFs) are considered the primary tools
   for estimating the effectiveness of safety treatments at road sites.
   Three main techniques are commonly used to estimate CMFs: the empirical
   Bayes (EB) method, the comparison-group (CG) method, and a combination
   of the EB and CG methods. CMF estimates from these techniques are
   usually provided with a measure of uncertainty of the estimate, in the
   form of standard error and confidence interval.
   However, representing CMFs as point estimates may not be adequate to
   explain how a safety countermeasure affects collision frequency over
   time and to evaluate the presence of novelty effects associated with the
   treatment. Therefore, the main goal of this study is to show how to
   overcome this drawback through the development of collision modification
   functions (CMFunctions) which incorporate changes over time for the
   treatment effectiveness, rather than using a single value.
   Within a fully Bayesian (FB) context, linear and non-linear intervention
   models, which acknowledge that the safety treatment effects do not
   always occur instantaneously but are spread over future time periods,
   provide a promising methodological framework for estimating CMFunctions
   with time trend.
   A case study is presented where the linear and non-linear intervention
   models were applied to estimate the effectiveness of the ``Signal Head
   Upgrade Program{''} recently implemented in the city of Surrey (British
   Columbia, Canada). The results of the case study highlight the
   advantages of estimating CMFunctions with time trend and impact on the
   economic evaluation of safety countermeasures. Given the way future
   benefits are discounted to present values, the results of using a
   CMFunction can affect the cost effectiveness of safety countermeasures
   significantly. The results also showed the non-linear intervention
   models provide a more realistic trend where the treatment effect in the
   long-run converges to an everlasting treatment impact. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Life-cycle energy and emission analysis of power generation from forest
   biomass}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{246-253}},

Abstract = {{Forest harvest residues, which include limbs, branches, and tree tops,
   have the potential to generate energy. This paper uses a life-cycle
   assessment to determine the energy input-to-output ratios for each unit
   operation in the use of these residues for power generation. Two
   preparation options for obtaining the biomass were evaluated. For Option
   1, the forest residues were chipped at the landing, while for Option 2
   they were bundled and chipped at the power plant. Energy use and
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were found for power plants sizes ranging
   from 10 to 300 MW. For power plants with capacities greater than 30 MW,
   the transportation of either bundles or woodchips to the power plant
   used the most energy, especially at larger power plant sizes. Option 1
   used less energy than Option 2 for all power plant sizes, with the
   difference between the two becoming smaller for larger power plants. For
   the life-cycle GHG emissions, Option 1 ranges from 14.71 to 19.51
   g-CO(2)eq/kW h depending on the power plant size. Option 2 ranges from
   21.42 to 20.90 g-CO(2)eq/kW h. The results are not linear and are close
   to equal at larger power plant sizes. The GHG emissions increase with
   increasing moisture content. For a 300 MW power plant with chipping at
   the landing, the GHG emissions range from 11.17 to 22.24 g-CO(2)eq/kW h
   for moisture contents from 15\% to 50\%. The sensitivity analysis showed
   both energy use and GHG emissions are most sensitive to moisture content
   and then plant lifetime. For the equipment, both the energy use and GHG
   emissions are most sensitive to changes in the fuel consumption and load
   capacity of the chip van and the log-haul truck used to transport either
   bundles or wood chips to the power plant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel neuro-fuzzy approach for learning and
   modeling socalled Multi-Input Multi-Output Coupling (MIMO) systems,
   i.e., systems where the output variables may depend upon all system's
   input variables. This strong coupling makes the MIMO systems behavior
   highly oscillatory in time and, as a consequence, it makes these systems
   not particularly suitable to be learned and represented by using
   conventional approaches. In order to address this issue, our proposal
   presents an adaptive supervised learning algorithm capable of forming a
   suitable collection of Timed Automata based Fuzzy Systems that model the
   dynamic behavior of a given MIMO system. The adaptive learning is
   accomplished by taking advantage of the theories coming from the area of
   times series analysis (such as the Adaptive Piecewise Constant
   Approximation method) with a well-known neuro-fuzzy framework of the
   Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). In experiments, where our
   proposal has been tested on the Fuzz-IEEE 2011 Fuzzy Competition
   dataset, the proposed supervised learning algorithm significantly
   reduces the output error measure and achieves better performance than
   the one provided by a conventional application of the ANFIS algorithm.

Abstract = {{Quantitative physical models for non oriented electrical steels require

   specimens are examined, where chemistry and grain size are kept similar

   called Magnetic Texture Factor is introduced which is defined as the
   ratio of the volume fractions of < 100 > direction to < 111 > direction
   along magnetization vector. It was found that this Magnetic Texture
   Factor was a better parameter for identifying trends of magnetic

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{4712-4722}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The operation of a nondissipative cascaded modular balancing bridge is
   described for automatically balancing series connected voltage sources,
   such as lithium-ion battery cells or capacitors. Automatic voltage
   balancing is achieved using coupled inductors; modularization and
   voltage balancing is achieved across N cells using cascaded transformers
   with coupled windings. The elementary modular bridge consists of four
   windings placed on a single core and is excited by an asymmetric
   half-bridge. Two of these windings are used to automatically balance
   voltages across two voltage sources, while the remaining two windings
   magnetically cascade one bridge with its neighboring bridges to balance
   N voltage sources. This configuration allows for the voltage balancing
   of N voltage sources using N/2 identical transformers, and N/2
   asymmetric bridges. The voltage balancing action of the resultant
   magnetically coupled cascaded asymmetric bridges can be broken into two
   categories: intrabridge voltage balancing (within a single bridge) and
   interbridge voltage balancing (between neighboring bridges). Design
   parameters relating to automatic voltage balancing are highlighted, as
   the approach is more cost effective than methods using directed, or
   individualized, voltage balancing of each voltage source. The physical
   size considerations of the four winding coupled inductor are discussed
   and a lithium-ion battery-based experimental prototype is used to verify
   simulated results.}},

Abstract = {{Low-temperature (<250 degrees C) plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition
   (PEALD) is used to fabricate aluminum nitride (AlN)/gallium nitride
   (GaN) heterojunctions for tunnelling contacts in devices where selective
   contacts are required, such as GaN metal-oxide semiconductor
   field-effect transistors. AlN is grown on GaN templates with via
   low-temperature plasma-enhanced ALD, and compared in order to extract
   their surface two-dimensional electron gas concentration. A peak
   electron density of >2 x 10(13) cm(-2) was observed for an approximately
   4.5 nm AlN thickness on GaN wafers with a higher initial doping
   concentration while for the lightly doped GaN samples, a peak carrier
   concentration of 1.9 x 10(13) cm-2 was observed for a thickness of 5.7
   nm AlN. Polarization is strongest near the AlN critical thickness of
   strain relaxation for low-temperature deposition methods. This suggests
   that greater initial dopant concentrations are more conducive to
   enhanced polarization characteristics under these low growth
   temperatures because the critical thickness is realized at lower
   thicknesses. This approach also yields a low contact resistance of 0.45
   Omega mm with Al contacts.}},

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{A reconstruction methodology based on threshold energy based energy
   minimization (TA) and different-phase-neighbor (DPN)-based pixel
   swapping is presented. The TA method uses an energy threshold rather
   than probabilities as an acceptance criteria for annealing steps. The
   DPN-based pixel selection method gives priority to pixels which are
   segregated from clusters instead of random selection. An in-house solver
   has been developed to obtain two-dimensional reconstructions of
   heterogeneous two-phase mediums. Compared to conventional simulated
   annealing with random pixel swapping, the proposed method was found to
   achieve an optimal structure with up to an order of magnitude reduction
   in energy. When selecting a threshold tolerance value, the proposed
   method showed a 50\% improvement in convergence time compared to
   conventional simulated annealing with random pixel swapping. The
   improved algorithm is used to study the effect of multiple correlation
   functions during the reconstruction. It was found that a combination of
   two-point correlation function and lineal path function for both phases
   results in most accurate reconstructions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on finding ways to improve the traditional core
   flooding experimental setup that has been used by the reservoir
   engineers over the past decades. The new proposed setup can be used in
   contemporary studies related to enhanced oil recovery. This setup has a
   possibility of using different flooding agents, e.g., surfactant,
   polymer, emulsion, oil and water. It also includes an automated effluent
   analysis, which has been developed to provide estimates on oil recovery
   efficiency. For validation purposes, the core flooding setup has been
   tested with an unconsolidated one-dimensional sand pack as a porous
   medium. Traditional water flooding experiments with paraffin oil and
   water were conducted at first. Also, two types of emulsion flooding
   techniques were tested for the sand packs: the direct emulsion flooding
   and the water flooding followed by the emulsion flooding as an example
   to exploit the capability of the new setup to successfully perform
   enhanced oil recovery techniques. Hence, this setup provides a valuable
   tool for the reservoir engineers to test the different flooding
   strategies in a laboratory scale experiment, before committing to huge
   resources in terms of man-power and cost in actual drilling operations

Abstract = {{In this work, we have developed and demonstrated a rapid and low-cost
   water monitoring sensor that can simultaneously detect total coliform
   and Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in contaminated drinking water
   samples. The test method, called Mobile Water Kit (MWK), comprises a set
   of custom chemical reagents that would serve as colorimetric or
   fluorometric chemosensors, syringe fitter units and a smartphone
   platform that would serve as the detection/analysis system. The MWK
   provides information about the presence/absence of total coliform and E.
   coli in water samples. The MWK has preliminarily been tested for its
   selectivity, sensitivity and accuracy, with samples of known
   concentrations of bacteria. The MWK has also been tested with
   contaminated water samples collected during the two field trials
   conducted in Canada and India, and the obtained results were confirmed
   with conventional laboratory methods. With this MWK, we were able to
   detect the total coliform and E. coli bacteria in water samples within
   30 min or less, depending on the concentration of the bacteria. For one
   of the field samples, the MWK was able to detect the total coliform
   within 35 s, which is faster than any rapid test methods available in
   the market. This new technology can dramatically improve the response
   times for the outbreak of water-borne diseases and will help water
   managers and individuals to assess the quality of water sources.}},

Volume = {{1}},

Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{The integration of nanoscale electronics with conventional optical
   devices is restricted by the diffraction limit of light. Metals can
   confine light at the subwavelength scales needed, but they are lossy,
   while dielectric materials do not confine evanescent waves outside a
   waveguide or resonator, leading to cross talk between components. We
   introduce a paradigm shift in light confinement strategy and show that
   light can be confined below the diffraction limit using completely
   transparent artificial media (metamaterials with epsilon(ij) > 1; mu(ij)
   = 1). Our approach relies on controlling the optical momentum of
   evanescent waves-an important electromagnetic property overlooked in
   photonic devices. For practical applications, we propose a class of
   waveguides using this approach that outperforms the cross-talk
   performance by 1 order of magnitude as compared to any existing photonic
   structure. Our work overcomes a critical stumbling block for
   nanophotonics by completely averting the use of metals and can impact
   electromagnetic devices from the visible to microwave frequency ranges.

Title = {{Bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents against bacterial contaminants in
   yeast fermentation processes}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The emergence of biofuels produced through yeast
   fermentation represents an important avenue for sustainable energy
   production. Despite all its advantages, this process is vulnerable to
   contamination by other organisms - most commonly lactic acid bacteria -
   that are present in raw feedstocks and/or in production lines. These
   contaminants compete with the yeast for nutrients, reducing the overall
   biofuel yield, and release substances that inhibit yeast growth. Here,
   we investigated the application of bacteriophages as potential
   antibacterial agents in yeast fermentation.
   Results: Experiments conducted to understand the impact of pH on yeast,
   bacterial, and phage development showed that the yeast Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae Superstart(TM) grew in a similar fashion at pH levels ranging
   from 3 to 6. Growth of Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC(R) 8014(TM) was
   inhibited by pH levels of less than 4, and phages ATCC(R) 8014-B1(TM)
   (phage B1) and ATCC(R) 8014-B2(TM) (phage B2) displayed different
   infectivities within the pH range tested (pH 3.5 to 7). Phage B1 showed
   the best infectivity at pH 6, while phage B2 was most virulent at pH
   levels ranging from 4 to 5, and the cocktail of these phages showed
   highest infectivity in the range from pH 4 to 6. Population dynamics
   studies in MRS medium at pH 6 showed that, in the presence of bacteria
   inoculated at 10(7) cells/ml, yeast cultures were impeded under aerobic
   and anaerobic conditions, showing major decreases in both cell yield and
   ethanol production. The addition of the phage cocktail at a low initial
   multiplicity of infection was sufficient to reduce contamination by over
   99\%, and to allow yeast and ethanol yields to reach values equivalent
   to those of axenic cultures.
   Conclusions: From the results observed, phages are good candidates as
   antimicrobial agents, to be used in place of or in conjunction with
   antibiotics, in yeast fermentation processes. Their implementation with
   other common contamination abatement/prevention methods could further
   increase their efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the solution quality of robust optimization
   problems when they are used to approximate probabilistic constraints and
   propose a novel method to improve the quality. Two solution frameworks
   are first compared: (1) the traditional robust optimization framework
   which only uses the a priori probability bounds and (3) the
   approximation framework which uses the a posteriori probability bound.
   We illustrate that the traditional robust optimization method is
   computationally efficient but its solution is in general conservative.
   On the other hand, the a posteriori probability bound based method
   provides less conservative solution but it is computationally more
   difficult because a nonconvex optimization problem is solved. Based on
   the comparative study of the two methods, we propose a novel iterative
   solution framework which combines the advantage of the a priori bound
   and the a posteriori probability bound. The proposed method can improve
   the solution quality of traditional robust optimization framework
   without significantly increasing the computational effort. The
   effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through numerical
   examples and applications in planning and scheduling problems.}},

Abstract = {{The solar UV/chlorine process has emerged as a novel advanced oxidation
   process for industrial and municipal wastewaters. Currently, its
   practical application to oil sands process-affected water (OSPW)
   remediation has been studied to treat fresh OSPW retained in large
   tailings ponds, which can cause significant adverse environmental
   impacts on ground and surface waters in Northern Alberta, Canada.
   Degradation of naphthenic acids (NM) and fluorophore organic compounds
   in OSPW was investigated. In a laboratory-scale UV/chlorine treatment,
   the NM degradation was clearly structure-dependent and hydroxyl
   radical-based. In terms of the NM degradation rate, the raw OSPW (pH
   similar to 8.3) rates were higher than those at an alkaline condition
   (pH = 10). Under actual sunlight, direct solar photolysis partially
   degraded fluorophore organic compounds, as indicated by the qualitative
   synchronous fluorescence spectra (SFS) of the OSPW, but did not impact
   NM degradation. The solar/chlorine process effectively removed NM
   (75-84\% removal) and fluorophore organic compounds in OSPW in the
   presence of 200 or 300 mg L-1 OCl-. The acute toxicity of OSPW toward
   Vibrio fischeri was reduced after the solar/chlorine treatment. However,
   the OSPW toxicity toward goldfish primary kidney macrophages after
   solar/chlorine treatment showed no obvious toxicity reduction versus
   that of untreated OSPW, which warrants further study for process
   optimization.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional approaches of exciting plasmons consist of either using
   electrons (e. g., electron energy loss spectroscopy) or light (Kretchman
   and Otto geometry) while more recently plasmons have been excited even
   by single photons. A different approach: thermal excitation of a plasmon
   resonance at high temperatures using alternate plasmonic media was
   proposed by S. Molesky et al. {[}Opt. Express 21, A96-A110 (2013)].
   Here, we show how the long-standing search for a high temperature
   narrowband near-field emitter for thermophotovoltaics can be fulfilled
   by thermally exciting plasmons. We also describe a method to control
   Wein's displacement law in the near-field using high temperature
   epsilon-near-zero metamaterials. Finally, we show that our work opens up

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{296-307}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Communication between neuronal populations in the human brain is
   characterized by complex functional interactions across time and space.
   Recent studies have demonstrated that these functional interactions
   depend on the underlying structural connections at an aggregate level.
   Multiple imaging modalities can be used to investigate the relation
   between the structural connections between brain regions and their
   functional interactions at multiple timescales. We investigated if
   consistent modality-independent functional interactions take place
   between brain regions, and whether these can be accounted for by
   underlying structural properties. We used functional MRI (fMRI) and
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from a population of healthy
   adults together with a previously described structural network A high
   overlap in resting-state functional networks was found in fMRI and
   especially alpha band MEG recordings. This overlap was characterized by
   a strongly interconnected functional core network in temporo-posterior
   brain regions. Anatomically realistically coupled neural mass models
   revealed that this strongly interconnected functional network emerges
   near the threshold for global synchronization. Most importantly, this
   functional core network could be explained by a trade-off between the
   product of the degrees of structurally-connected regions and the
   Euclidean distance between them. For both fMRI and MEG, the product of

Abstract = {{In bilateral teleoperation of a dexterous task, to take full advantage
   of the human's intelligence, experience and sensory inputs, a
   possibility is to engage multiple human arms through multiple masters
   (haptic devices) in controlling a single-slave robot with high
   degrees-of-freedom (DOF); the total DOFs of the masters will be equal to
   the DOFs of the slave. A multi-master/single-slave cooperative haptic
   teleoperation system with w DOFs can be modelled as a two-port network
   where each port (terminal) connects to a termination defined by w inputs
   and w outputs. The stability analysis of such a system is not trivial
   because of dynamic coupling across the different DOFs of the robots, the
   human operators and the physical or virtual environments. The unknown
   dynamics of the users and the environments exacerbate the problem. The
   authors present a novel, straightforward and convenient frequency-domain
   method for stability analysis of this system. As a case study, two 1-DOF
   and 2-DOF master haptic devices are considered to teleoperate a 3-DOF
   slave robot. It is qualitatively discussed how such a trilateral haptic
   teleoperation system may result in better task performance by splitting
   the various DOFs of a dexterous task between two arms of a human or two
   humans. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the validity of
   the stability analysis framework.}},

Abstract = {{Time synchronisation is required for a variety of distributed control
   applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this study, a
   consensus-based time synchronisation protocol is presented. The proposed
   protocol considers asynchronous framework where the sensor nodes can
   have different time-periods, starting times and input update times. The
   communication links are assumed to be unreliable. The clocks in a WSN
   are modelled by a time-varying system with time-delay terms. The
   objective is to design local control inputs to achieve time
   synchronisation by processing the information received from available
   neighbour nodes. By employing tools from non-negative matrix and graph
   theories, the convergence analysis is presented. Numerical examples are
   given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.}},

Abstract = {{A set of surfaces with different Cassie fractions were fabricated. For a
   given Cassie fraction surfaces had different pillar diameter and spacing
   combinations. Advancing and receding contact angles of both water and
   ethylene glycol were measured on the fabricated surfaces. We examined
   the effects of both surface feature size and Cassie fraction on
   advancing and receding contact angles and found no relationship between
   size and contact angle when Cassie fraction was held constant. Also
   examined was the effect of the Cassie fraction on contact angle
   hysteresis, which led to the development of a new theoretical framework
   for understanding contact angle hysteresis on rough surfaces that helps
   unite previous theory and observations with current observations. The
   theoretical framework includes empirically determined contact-line
   pinning forces. From measurements, we found a constant contact-line
   pinning force for the receding contact angles. For the advancing contact
   angles, there was also a contact-line pinning force, but one that
   changed with changing Cassie fraction.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, feasibility of achieving enhanced electron
   field-emission properties of stress-induced carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and
   multilayer graphene (MLGs) by ion modification is studied. Micro-Raman
   spectroscopy is used as a potent technique for in-depth investigations
   of stress-induced CNTs and MLGs. It is found that iron used as a
   catalyst, compresses at particular fluence and induces stresses in CNTs
   and MLGs to modify these structures, supported by high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies. The stresses are
   explained by the buckling wavelength (lambda proportional to
   e((r/t)0.5)). Furthermore, the stresses induced in exotic nanostructures
   are studied for investigating wetting properties, which are
   well-corroborated with electron emission characteristics. It is found
   out that less-wetted CNTs and MLGs display enhanced emission properties
   with turn-on voltages (E-on) of 1.5 and 2.1 V/mu m, respectively, in
   comparison to hydrophilic CNTs and MLGs with E-on of 2.6 and 4 V/mu m,

Abstract = {{The adsorption process of asphaltene onto molecularly smooth mica
   surfaces from toluene solutions of various concentrations (0.01-1 wt \%)
   was studied using a surface forces apparatus (SFA). Adsorption of
   asphaltenes onto mica was found to be highly dependent on adsorption
   time and asphaltene concentration of the solution. The adsorption of
   asphaltenes led to an attractive bridging force between the mica
   surfaces in asphaltene solution. The adsorption process was identified
   as being controlled by the diffusion of asphaltenes from the bulk
   solution to the mica surface with a diffusion coefficient on the order
   of 10(-10) m(2)/s at room temperature, depending on the asphaltene bulk
   concentration. This diffusion coefficient corresponds to a hydrodynamic
   molecular radius of approximately 0.5 nm, indicating that asphaltene
   diffuses to mica surfaces as individual molecules at very low
   concentration (e.g., 0.01 wt \%). Atomic force microscopy images of the
   adsorbed asphaltenes on mica support the results of the SFA force
   measurements. The results from the SFA force measurements provide
   valuable insights into the molecular interactions (e.g., steric
   repulsion and bridging attraction as a function of distance) of
   asphaltenes in organic media and hence their roles in crude oil and
   bitumen production.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant lysin Gp10 from the mycobacteriophage L5 was coupled to
   magnetic Dynabeads 280 and these beads were used to capture
   Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) cells from complex
   media. Skim cow milk spiked with MAP cells, skim milk spiked with both
   MAP and Escherichia coli cells and Middlebrook 7H9 medium spiked with
   MAP cells were used to model the contaminated food matrices. The beads
   bearing immobilized Gp10 were incubated with the samples, separated,
   washed, subjected to DNA extraction and the solution was analyzed by
   real time PCR. The entire process was completed within 24 hours,
   demonstrated high specificity towards the MAP cells and increased the
   sensitivity of detection. The Ct values observed from the
   pre-concentrated samples were close to those obtained from clean buffer,
   whereas they were significantly worse without such bead-based
   pre-concentration. The protocol was successfully tested with two MAP
   strains (ATCC 19698 and 19851) and two target sequences (IS900 and F57).
   The suggested method eliminates the need for lengthy culturing steps
   used in traditional protocols and allows the pre-concentration of MAP
   cells to get rid of the various PCR inhibitors that may be present in
   the food matrices. As such, it offers an overall reduction of the time
   usually required to test milk for MAP. The developed protocol may be
   instrumental for the prevention, diagnosis and monitoring of Johne's and
   Crohn's diseases in cattle and humans, respectively two gastrointestinal
   diseases having huge economic and public health impact.}},

Abstract = {{Chattering and repeating alarms, which repeatedly make transitions

   most common form of nuisance alarms encountered in industrial plants.
   The paper formulates two novel rules to detect chattering alarms caused

   oscillation, and proposes an online method to effectively remove
   chattering and repeating alarms via the m-sample delay timer. Industrial

Abstract = {{In this paper, a coordinated-distributed model predictive control
   (CDMPC) scheme is proposed for discrete-time, linear, unconstrained

   that communicates with local CDMPC controllers. With the assistance of
   the coordinator, the local CDMPC controllers adjust their calculated
   control actions iteratively to achieve the optimal plant-wide operation.
   A `prediction-driven' algorithm is used to coordinate the local CDMPC
   controllers. Convergence of the prediction-driven algorithm is shown
   along with a stability analysis of the closed-loop system under
   coordinated-distributed control. A simulation example is used to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated-distributed

Abstract = {{Several bacterial species possess the ability to attach to surfaces and
   colonize them in the form of thin films called biofilms. Biofilms that
   grow in porous media are relevant to several industrial and
   environmental processes such as wastewater treatment and CO2
   sequestration. We used Pseudomonas fluorescens, a Gram-negative aerobic
   bacterium, to investigate biofilm formation in a microfluidic device
   that mimics porous media. The microfluidic device consists of an array
   of micro-posts, which were fabricated using soft-lithography.
   Subsequently, biofilm formation in these devices with flow was
   investigated and we demonstrate the formation of filamentous biofilms
   known as streamers in our device. The detailed protocols for fabrication
   and assembly of microfluidic device are provided here along with the
   bacterial culture protocols. Detailed procedures for experimentation
   with the microfluidic device are also presented along with
   representative results.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes a new technique for determining an appropriate
   input pulse and its duration, which are important for time-domain
   studies of ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas. For such studies, the
   researchers normally prefer EM simulation tools, and use different types
   of input pulses. The basis of the choice of input pulse is a bit obscure
   in most of the reports appearing in the open literature. Antenna
   researchers indeed face a problem in having suitable guidelines for
   choosing the input pulse, a mathematical approach to generate it, and in
   estimating the pulse's duration. The width or duration of the input
   pulse cannot be arbitrary. This plays a significant role in determining
   the reliable time-domain response of the antenna in both transmitting
   and receiving modes. This is successfully addressed in this paper,
   taking a UWB monopole as the antenna under test. The proposed technique
   should accurately guide and help a researcher to perform the time-domain
   characterization of a UWB monopole/dipole antenna using mathematical
   tools and EM simulators commercially available.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nickel nanoparticles on in-situ upgrading of heavy oil
   (HO) during aquathermolysis and the effect of this process on the
   recovery through cyclic steam injection were studied. High-temperature
   experiments were conducted with a benchtop reactor to study the kinetics
   of the reactions among oil, water, and sandstones in the presence and
   absence of the nickel nanoparticles. Eighteen experiments were conducted
   at three different temperatures and at three different lengths of time,
   and the evolved hydrogen sulfide during the reaction was analyzed. The
   kinetic analysis showed that nickel nanoparticles reduce the activation
   energy of the reactions corresponding to the generation of hydrogen
   sulfide by approximately 50\%. This reaction was the breakage of C-S
   bonds in the organosulfur compounds of the HO. The maximal catalysis
   effect was observed to be at a temperature of approximately 270 degrees
   C. Also, the simulated-distillation gas-chromatography (GC) analysis of
   the oil sample, after the aquathermolysis reactions, confirmed the
   catalysis effect of nickel nanoparticles. According to this analysis, by
   catalytic process, the concentration of the components lighter than C-30
   increased whereas the concentration of heavier components decreased.
   Next, the effect of the catalytic aquathermolysis on the recovery factor
   of the steam-stimulation technique was studied. The stimulation
   experiments consisted of three injection/soaking/production phases. The
   results showed that the nickel nanoparticles increased the recovery
   factor by approximately 22\% when the nanoparticles were injected with a
   cationic surfactant and xanthan-gum polymer. This increase of recovery
   was approximately 7\% more than that of the experiment conducted with
   the surfactant and polymer only.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the problem of exponential stability and
   asynchronous stabilization for a class of switched nonlinear systems.
   The Takagi and Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to approximate the
   subnonlinear dynamic systems. With two-level functions, namely, crisp
   switching functions and local fuzzy weighting functions, we introduce
   continuous-time switched fuzzy systems, which inherently contain the
   features of the switched hybrid systems and T-S fuzzy systems. By the
   use of delicately constructed piecewise Lyapunov-like functions (PLFs)
   and minimum dwell time method, we obtain the exponential stability of
   the switched fuzzy systems, which allows us to have stable and unstable
   nonlinear subsystems. In practice, for the control problem, it
   inevitably takes some time to identify the system modes and apply the
   matched controller, the asynchronous phenomena between the system modes
   switching and the controllers switching generally exists. Based on the
   result of stability, the fuzzy state feedback controller under
   asynchronous switching is proposed for switched fuzzy systems. In
   addition, the lower bound of minimum dwell time can be obtained using
   convex optimization such that the switched fuzzy system can be
   exponentially stabilized if its minimum dwell time is larger than the
   bound. The stability results and control laws of the switched fuzzy
   systems are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities that
   are numerically feasible. Finally, two illustrated numerical examples
   are presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) form a class of graph-oriented fuzzy models

   augment these models by introducing their generalization coming in the

   connections between the nodes (states) are described in the form of
   information granules, especially intervals and fuzzy sets. Key scenarios
   in which granular models (and granular FCMs) arise are presented in
   order to offer a compelling rationale behind the formation of such
   models. In the context of system modeling, we show that information
   granularity emerges as an important design asset. We discuss detailed
   schemes of allocation of information granularity and quantify a
   performance of the resulting granular FCM in terms of a coverage

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a Growing Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier (GT2FC) for
   online rule learning from real-time data streams. While in batch rule
   learning, the training data are assumed to be drawn from a stationary
   distribution, in online rule learning, data can dynamically change over
   time becoming potentially nonstationary. To accommodate dynamic change,
   GT2FC relies on a new semi-supervised online learning algorithm called
   Growing Gaussian Mixture Model (2G2M). In particular, 2G2M is used to
   generate the type-2 fuzzy membership functions to build the type-2 fuzzy
   rules. GT2FC is designed to accommodate data online and to reconcile
   labeled and unlabeled data using self-learning. Moreover, GT2FC
   maintains low complexity of the rule base using online optimization and
   feature selection mechanisms. GT2FC is tested on data obtained from an
   ambient intelligence application, where the goal is to exploit sensed
   data to monitor the living space on behalf of the inhabitants. Because
   sensors are prone to faults and noise, type-2 fuzzy modeling is very
   suitable for dealing with such an application. Thus, GT2FC offers the
   advantage of dealing with uncertainty in addition to self-adaptation in
   an online manner. For illustration purposes, GT2FC is also validated on
   synthetic and classic UCI data-sets. The detailed empirical study shows
   that GT2FC performs very well under various experimental settings.}},

Abstract = {{A six-axis sensor array has been developed to quantify the 3D force and
   moment loads applied in scoliosis correction surgery. Initially this
   device was developed to be applied during scoliosis correction surgery
   and augmented onto existing surgical instrumentation, however, use as a
   general load sensor is also feasible. The development has included the
   design, microfabrication, deployment and calibration of a sensor array.
   The sensor array consists of four membrane devices, each containing
   piezoresistive sensing elements, generating a total of 16 differential
   voltage outputs. The calibration procedure has made use of a custom
   built load application frame, which allows quantified forces and moments
   to be applied and compared to the outputs from the sensor array. Linear
   or non-linear calibration equations are generated to convert the voltage
   outputs from the sensor array back into 3D force and moment information
   for display or analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Orthodontic torque expression is the result of axial rotation of

   investigates the effect of bracket material on torque expression. Torque
   exerted by a rotating archwire on each bracket will be measured as well

   were performed where archwires were rotated within a bracket slot to
   produce torque within a bracket. Thirty Ormco Orthos Ti and 30 Orthos SS
   were compared to investigate the effect of torque on bracket material.
   Each bracket was mounted on a six-axis load cell that measured forces
   and moments in all directions. The archwire was rotated from an initial
   angle of 0 degree in 3 degrees increments to maximum angle of 51 degrees
   and then returned to the initial position. An overhead camera took
   images at each 3 degrees increment. The bracket images were
   post-processed using a digital image correlation technique to measure
   the relative deformation of each bracket slot. The maximum torque
   expressed at 51 degrees was 99.8 Nmm and 93.0 Nmm for Orthos Ti and
   Orthos SS, respectively. Total plastic deformation measured at 0 degrees
   post-torquing of the Orthos SS was 0.038 mm compared to 0.013 mm for
   Orthos Ti. The Orthos Ti brackets plastically deformed less than the
   Orthos SS brackets after torquing. The Orthos SS bracket plastic
   deformation was 2.8 times greater than that of Orthos Ti brackets. The
   Orthos Ti brackets expressed more torque than the stainless steel
   brackets but exhibited substantial variation.}},

Title = {{Applying received signal strength based methods for indoor positioning
   and tracking in construction applications}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Effective positioning and tracking of critical construction resources is
   crucial to fulfilling project objectives in terms of time, cost, and
   safety. Received signal strength (RSS) based localization methods
   increasingly become a popular choice in construction applications,
   especially for indoor scenarios, potentially automating field data
   acquisition and construction process control. However, the fluctuating
   nature of collected RSS data due to multipath propagation effects, along
   with the unavailability of radio signals at certain site locations,
   hampers effective application of such localization techniques in
   challenging and dynamic indoor applications. This research evaluates the
   feasibilities of two RSS-based location tracking techniques, namely, the
   ranging-based method and the profiling-based method. To verify the
   positioning accuracy of the two methods, a wireless sensor network
   system was prototyped for conducting positioning experiments in an
   indoor carpark, which mimics an enclosed construction site. Experimental
   results reveal that the ranging-based method performed poorly in the
   test setting, while on the other hand, the positioning error achieved
   with the profiling-based method was less than 2.14 m with 95\%
   likelihood. Further, to evaluate the achievable accuracy of this method
   in a real-world indoor environment, we coupled the profiling-based
   method with commonly used noise filtering algorithms and conducted field
   testing in a pipe fabrication shop. With 95\% likelihood, consistent
   positioning accuracy of 1-2m away from the actual position of a tracked
   tag was obtained in the fabrication shop, which is deemed sufficient for
   materials and labor hours tracking in support of productivity analysis.
   In conclusion, the RSS profiling-based method is found to be an
   effective method for deployment in real-world indoor settings of
   construction-related applications.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the flotation mechanism of bastnaesite using reactive oily
   bubble, the interaction between bastnaesite particles and reactive oily
   bubbles was investigated by electro-kinetic studies, induction time
   measurements and small-scale flotation experiments. The bastnaesite
   flotation could be seen as a hetero-coagulation between bastnaesite
   particles and reactive oily bubbles which was confirmed by the zeta
   potential distribution and induction time measurements from pH 4.8 to pH
   9.0. The small-scale flotation tests were consistent with the
   hetero-coagulation results, and showed a better flotation of reactive
   oily bubble than air bubble among all pH range. The interaction force
   between bastnaesite particles and reactive oily bubbles was evaluated by
   the classical DLVO theory. It indicated that the attachment could be
   predicted well by the DLVO theory only in a restricted pH range due to
   the absence of hydrophilic interaction repulsion force and chemical
   interaction force.}},

Abstract = {{A drop tube-impulse atomization technique was used to produce D2 tool
   steel powders. Shadowgraph (Sizing Master Shadow from LaVision GmbH in
   Gottingen, Germany) was utilized to measure in-situ velocity and droplet
   size. Simultaneously, the DPV-2000 (Tecnar Automation Ltee, St. Hubert
   Quebec, Canada) was used to measure the radiant energy and droplet size
   of atomized droplets. These devices were mounted on a 3D translation
   stage which was designed, constructed and installed in the drop tube.
   The measurements were done at three different distances from the molten
   metal crucible, 4 cm, 18 cm and 28 cm. A thermal model of droplet
   cooling was coupled with the temperature of primary phase undercooling
   for D2 tool steel. The results from this model were used in order to
   find the emissivity behaviour of the droplets. It is shown that
   emissivity of the droplets is a function of size and temperature. It was
   concluded that the DPV-2000 should be considered as a single color
   pyrometer since the gray body assumption for D2 tool steel falling
   droplets using DPV-2000 during is invalid for the range of measurements
   taken.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate uplink resource allocation for wireless
   local area network and cellular network interworking to provide
   multi-homing voice and data services. The problem is formulated based on
   the physical layer and medium access control layer technologies of the
   two networks to ensure that the resource allocation decisions are
   feasible and can be executed at the lower layers. Furthermore, to
   efficiently utilize users' equipment (UEs) battery power, the power
   distribution among multiple network interfaces of the UEs is included in
   the problem formulation. The optimal resource allocation problem is a
   multiple time-scaleMarkov decision process (MMDP) as the two networks
   operate at different time-scales and due to voice and data service
   requirements. We derive decision policies for the upper and the lower
   levels of the MMDP by decomposing each resource allocation problem over
   multiple time slots to a set of resource allocation problems for
   individual time slots and solving the resource allocation problems
   corresponding to individual time slots using convex optimization
   techniques. To reduce the time complexity, we further propose a
   heuristic resource allocation algorithm by deriving the decision
   policies based on a single system state. The system state consists of
   average square channel gains for dual variable calculation and
   instantaneous channel gains for resource allocation based on the
   calculated dual variables. Simulation results demonstrate the achievable
   throughput and service quality improvements by employing these two
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we focus on the computation load reduction in the
   optimization of economic model predictive control (EMPC) for nonlinear
   systems. Specifically, event-based triggering approach is adopted to
   significantly reduce the number of evaluations of the EMPC. First, we
   consider the case that state feedback is available and design a
   triggering condition based on the difference between the actual system
   state and its predicted value. At a sampling time, if the triggering
   condition is satisfied, the EMPC is re-evaluated. Subsequently, we
   consider the case that only output feedback is available. In this case,
   a robust moving horizon estimator is used to reconstruct the state
   information from output measurements and the corresponding triggering
   condition is based on the difference between the measured and predicted
   output as well as its time derivatives. For both cases, the EMPC is
   redesigned to account for potential open-loop operations. Sufficient
   conditions that ensure the closed-loop stability are provided for both
   cases. A chemical process is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed designs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acute symptoms of methamphetamine-induced psychosis are similar to those
   of primary schizophrenia. Understanding similarities or differences in
   the biological substrate of these psychoses could lead to early
   differentiation of these two clinical conditions resulting in more
   efficient treatment strategies. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   was acquired from the medial prefrontal cortex in 29 unmedicated
   patients with first episode of psychosis (FEP), 29 abstinent
   methamphetamine-addicted people (METH) and 45 healthy controls (HCs)
   (age range 17.3 to 29.9 years old). The METH group displayed robust
   reductions in concentration levels of glutamate (Glu) relative to FEP
   (Cohen's d = 1.20) and HC (d = 0.87). The METH group also displayed
   reduced levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) relative to FEP (d = 0.53) and
   HC (d = 0.76). The HC group displayed a positive association between
   levels of Glu and NAA, r(45) = 0.52, p < 0.001, while the two clinical
   groups failed to show this normal association. This suggests that the
   cellular metabolism is altered in both conditions. These data support
   the assumption that cellular abnormalities differ between primary
   schizophrenia and methamphetamine addiction despite the overlap in
   clinical presentation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbubbles driven by ultrasound are capable of permeabilizing cell
   membranes and allowing biomarkers or therapeutics to exit from or enter
   cancer cells, respectively. Unfortunately, the relatively large size of
   microbubbles prevents extravasation. Lipid-based perfluorobutane
   microbubbles can be made seven-fold smaller by pressurization, creating
   430-nm nanodroplets. The present study compares microbubbles and
   nanodroplets with respect to their ability to enhance miR-21 and
   mammaglobin mRNA release from cultured ZR-75-1 cells. Mammaglobin mRNA
   and miR-21 release increased with escalating concentrations of
   nanodroplets up to, respectively, 25- and 42-fold with 2\% nanodroplets
   (v/v), compared with pre-ultrasound levels, whereas cell viability
   decreased to 62.4\%. Sonication of ZR-75-1 cells incubated with
   microbubbles or nanodroplets caused relatively similar levels of cell
   death and miR-21 release, suggesting that nanodroplets are similar to
   microbubbles in enhancing cell permeability, but may be more
   advantageous because of their smaller size, which may allow
   extravasation through leaky tumor vasculature. (E-mail:

Title = {{IMPROVING CONSISTENCY EVALUATION IN FUZZY MULTI-ATTRIBUTE PAIRWISE
   COMPARISON-BASED DECISION-MAKING METHODS}},
Journal = {{ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A typical approach to handle the complexity of multi-faceted
   decision-making problems is to use multi-attribute decision-making
   (MADM) methods based on pairwise comparisons. Fuzzy set theory has also
   been employed to cope with the uncertainty and vagueness involved in
   conducting the comparisons between components of a decision model. An
   important issue regarding the reliability of the output is the
   consistency of pairwise comparisons provided by the decision maker(s).
   Using the MADM method developed by Lu et al. (2007) as a foundation,
   this paper proposes an algorithm for evaluating the consistency level of
   pairwise comparison matrices, where linguistic data are used. A crisp
   numeric scale has been introduced to consider the priority of linguistic
   data and to avoid the complexity of handling fuzzy calculations in
   consistency evaluation of pairwise comparison matrices. As an advantage,
   the proposed method of consistency evaluation is capable of assessing
   the degree of inconsistency among the pairwise comparisons. Therefore,
   the acceptance or rejection of the pairwise comparisons can be
   determined based on the desired degree of tolerance in accepting
   inconsistent judgments. An application of a revised MADM method is then
   demonstrated in a case study involving flood mitigation project
   selection in Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Flow cytometry is a key instrument in biological studies, used to
   identify and analyze cells in suspension. The identification of cells
   from debris is commonly based on light scatter properties as it has been
   shown that there is a relationship between forward scattered light and
   cell volume and this has become common practice in flow cytometry.
   Cryobiological conditions induce changes in cells that alter their light
   scatter properties. Cells with membrane damage from freeze-thaw stress
   produce lower forward scatter signals and may fall below standard
   forward scatter thresholds. In contrast to light scatter properties that
   cannot identify damaged cells from debris, fluorescent dyes used in
   membrane integrity and mitochondrial polarization assays are capable of
   labeling and discriminating all cells in suspension. Under
   cryobiological conditions, isolating cell populations is more
   effectively accomplished by gating on fluorescence rather than light
   scatter properties. This study shows the limitations of using forward
   scatter thresholds in flow cytometry to identify and gate cells after
   exposure to a freeze-thaw protocol and demonstrates the use of
   fluorescence as an alternative means of identifying and analyzing cells.

Abstract = {{The low-temperature visbreaking of Canadian oilsands-derived bitumen was
   investigated. The objective was to determine the extent to which the
   fluidity of the bitumen can be improved by less-severe thermal
   conversion than normally employed industrially, while, at the same time,
   maintaining a high liquid yield. Most of the experimental work was
   conducted in the temperature range of 340-400 degrees C, although some
   data were also obtained at lower temperatures. It was possible to limit
   gas and coke formation and obtain a 96-97 wt \% liquid yield, while
   decreasing the bitumen viscosity from similar to 100 Pa s to 1 Pa s
   (measured at 40 degrees C). More remarkable was that viscosities of
   similar to 3 Pa s could be obtained by just heating the bitumen to
   either 360 or 380 degrees C and then cooling it. The most plausible
   explanation for the rapid decrease in viscosity during low-temperature
   visbreaking was that there was a decrease in the effective volume
   fraction of the colloidal fraction. The viscosity change over time at
   constant temperature was complex, with at least one local minimum and
   maximum being observed. This aspect of the behavior could not yet be
   fully explained. Overall, it was found that the bitumen was reactive and
   that its thermal conversion behavior over the temperature range studied
   was comparable to that of a young crude oil, not a residuum.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in gasified
   coal seam (i.e., post-underground coal gasification sites) has created a
   need to understand the coal properties, specifically, the adsorption
   behavior of CO2 on gasified coal. In the present study, the CO2 excess
   adsorption isotherms were determined for four coal samples of different
   characteristics based on the volumetric method. Further, coal chars from
   a coking coal and a non-coking coal (within the studied samples) were
   investigated for their CO2 adsorption capacity. The coal samples of size
   22-32 mm were pyrolyzed in a drop-tube furnace at 800 and 1000 degrees C
   with a heating rate of approximately 2.5 degrees C s(-1) under an inert
   atmosphere. Measurements were performed up to a pressure of 65 bar for
   all of the studied samples. Experiments were carried out at an
   isothermal temperature of 45.5 degrees C. The influence of coal
   properties on adsorption was also studied and compared to the literature
   data. Behavior of adsorption capacities was analyzed as a function of
   coal properties, such as vitrinite content, coal rank, volatile matter,
   ash content, and surface area. Results indicated that the adsorption
   capacity of coal char is much higher in comparison to the virgin coal
   samples. It was understood from the surface area analysis that there is
   a significant increase in surface area when coal is pyrolyzed. In
   addition, for coal samples, the trend of adsorption isotherms was in
   good agreement with the literature data.}},

Abstract = {{In the Hadoop distributed file systems (HDFSs), to lower costly
   communication traffic for data recovery, the concept of locally
   repairable codes (LRCs) has been recently proposed. With regard to the
   immense size of modern energy-hungry HDFS, computational complexity
   reduction can be attractive. In this letter, to avoid finite field
   multiplications, which are the major source of complexity, we put
   forward the idea of designing binary locally repairable codes (BLRCs).
   More specifically, we design a BLRC with a length of 15, rate of 2/3,
   and minimum distance of 4, which has the minimum possible locality among
   its type. We show that our code has lower complexity than most recent
   non-binary LRC in the literature while meeting other desirable
   requirements in HDFS such as storage overhead and reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can disrupt communications between the brain
   and the body, resulting in loss of control over otherwise intact
   neuromuscular systems. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the

   restoration and to manage medical complications following SCI. The use
   of FES for the restoration of muscular and organ functions may
   significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality following SCI. Many
   FES devices are commercially available and should be considered. as part

Abstract = {{By reducing tensile test speeds over four orders of magnitude, from 5 to
   0.001 mm/min (corresponding to the initial strain rate of 4 x 10(-3) to
   8 x 10(-7) s(-1)), color of polyethylene (PE) specimens remains
   translucent during the necking process, no longer changing to opaque
   white. Since changing the color to opaque white indicates the presence
   of cavities, the unchanged color suggests that such cavitation process
   is avoided by reducing the crosshead speed. With this discovery, the
   study proceeds to investigate the mechanical behavior of PE specimen
   shown at two crosshead speeds, 1 and 0.001 mm/min, before neck is
   developed; the former crosshead speed leads to opaque white neck but the
   latter translucent. The results show that at 1 mm/min, a stretch
   corresponding to a strain smaller than 4\% can cause degradation of
   mechanical properties. Since this level of deformation is close to that
   allowed in service, the study recommends the consideration of in-service
   loading rate for evaluation of the mechanical properties, especially for
   long-term applications such as plastic pipes for natural gas
   transportation. (C) 2013 Society of Plastics Engineers}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the application of Electrochemical Noise (EN) to

   (SS) in high purity water system at varying temperatures (105, 160, 190,
   220, 250, 293 C) and pressures (0.6, 7, 9, 10.5, 16, 19 MPa). An EN
   sensor has been developed and applied to the high temperature water
   system. The potential and coupling current noise were recorded
   simultaneously and a variety of analytical methods (such as wavelet
   transform, chaos theory, noise resistance (Re), the spectral noise
   resistance (R5) and the direct current (DC) limit of the spectral noise
   resistance (Kin)) have been used to obtain corrosion rate and corrosion
   form. EN analysis results demonstrated an increase in Rn with increasing
   temperature and pressure, except for a peak value at 293 degrees C, 19
   MPa, which was possibly due to the change in the thickness of passive
   film; combined chaos analysis results with morphology analysis, we may
   infer that the corrosion form of 304NG SS under high purity water system
   at high temperature and high pressure is general corrosion. The

   Volume, Face Mask Seal, and Inhaled Corticosteroid Delivery Through an
   Idealized Infant Replica}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL MEDICINE AND PULMONARY DRUG DELIVERY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{290-298}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: During the aerosol delivery device design and optimization
   process, in vitro lung dose (LD) measurements are often performed using
   soft face models, which may provide a more clinically relevant
   representation of face mask dead volume (MDV) and face mask seal (FMS)
   than hard face models. However, a comparison of MDV, FMS, and LD for
   hard and soft face models is lacking.
   Methods: Metal, silicone, and polyurethane represented hard, soft, and
   very soft facial materials, respectively. MDV was measured using a water
   displacement technique. FMS was measured using a valved holding chamber
   (VHC) flow rate technique. The LD of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP)
   delivered via a 100-mu g Qvar (R) pressurized metered dose inhaler with
   AeroChamber Plus (R) Flow-Vu (R) VHC and Small Mask, defined as that
   which passes through the nasal airways of the idealized infant geometry,
   was measured using a bias tidal flow system with a filter. MDV, FMS, and
   LD were measured at 1.5 lb and 3.5 lb of applied force. A mathematical
   model was used to predict LD based on experimental measurements of MDV
   and FMS.
   Results: Experimental BDP LD measurements for ABS, silicone, and
   polyurethane at 1.5 lb were 0.9 (0.6) mu g, 2.4 (1.9) mu g, and 19.3
   (0.9) mu g, respectively. At 3.5 lb, the respective LD was 10.0 (1.5) mu
   g, 13.8 (1.4) mu g, and 14.2 (0.9) mu g. Parametric analysis with the
   mathematical model showed that differences in FMS between face models
   had a greater impact on LD than differences in MDV.
   Conclusions: The use of soft face models resulted in higher LD than hard
   face models, with a greater difference at 1.5 lb than at 3.5 lb. A lack
   of a FMS led to decreased dose consistency; therefore, a sealant should
   be used when measuring LD with a hard ABS or soft silicone face model at
   1.5 lb of applied force or less.}},

Abstract = {{The composition, oil type, and thermodynamic parameters influence the

   tension, and also the structural parameters of microemulsion systems. In
   the present study sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and
   hexadecyltrimethylarrunonium bromide (HTAB) have been used as
   surfactants and 3-methyl-1-butanol as cosurfactant to prepare
   microemulsions. Four n-alkanes (hexane, heptane, decane, and dodecane)
   were chosen as oil phases. Water solubilization capacities of anionic
   (SLS) and cationic (HTAB) microemulsions were investigated in both the
   presence and the absence of NaCl salt. A detailed study of particle size
   analysis for both the surfactants with different composition has been
   made from laser light scattering measurement. Surface tensions of
   microemulsions and surfactant solutions were also measured for
   investigation of their surface activities. Surface tensions have been
   reduced remarkably in the case of microemulsion systems compared to
   simple aqueous solutions of surfactants. Different structural parameters
   like water droplet and effective microemulsion droplet size including
   interface, aggregation numbers of surfactant, and cosurfactant have been
   determined assuming monodispersity of the droplets from dilution
   experiment. The effects of temperature on the above parameters have also
   been studied.}},

   recovered and modified into an adhesive. The adhesive developed as such
   was formulated for OSB adhesion applications, and the OSB performance
   was also evaluated. Performance results showed that the OSB specimens
   made with up to 60\% by weight of protein hydrolyzate based adhesive met
   the Canadian Standard Association (CSA O437.0-93) requirements for
   commercial applications. Based on the intermediate moisture resistance
   results observed, the recommended use of these boards could be for
   relatively low moisture environments.}},

   semiconductivity of Alloy 800 in sulfate and chloride solutions was
   investigated using Mott-Schottky analysis, electrochemistry impedance
   spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and scanning
   electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The Mott-Schottky results show that
   the semiconductivity is affected by the sulfate to chloride
   concentration ratio; p-type semiconductivity is exhibited at high
   concentration ratios but transitions to n-type when the concentration
   ratio is low. EIS, SEM, and SECM results indicate that the degradation
   form of the passive film changes from transpassive dissolution to
   pitting as the concentration ratio decreases while the film's surface
   reactivity increases, an effect that is related to the semiconductivity
   conversion. The observed variation in semiconductivity results from the
   competitive adsorption of sulfate and chloride, a process that modifies
   the potential drop at the film/solution interface, changes the vacancy
   types and ultimately determines the semiconductivity.}},

Abstract = {{VAPEX (vapour extraction) is a non-thermal process that has significant
   potential to provide a more environmentally friendly and
   energy-efficient alternative to steam injection. While numerical
   modelling techniques are available for simulating mass transfer in VAPEX
   process, computational constraints often preclude detailed numerical
   solution of the flow and transport differential equations, as is often
   implemented in traditional flow simulators. Efficient alternatives that
   are based on analytical solutions could be employed to assess the
   transport physics. In this paper, a novel physical-based proxy is
   developed to model solvent transport in VAPEX at isothermal conditions,
   in a way analogous to the SAGD model described by Butler (Butler, J.
   Can. Petrol. Technol. 1985, 24, 42). Detailed analytical formulations
   are derived and implemented in a calculation procedure to advance the
   solvent-bitumen interface and to estimate producing oil rate with time.
   In our approach, solvent concentration and intrinsic diffusion
   coefficient are introduced in the model instead of temperature and
   thermal diffusivity in SAGD. A new mass penetration parameter is
   introduced and its change with time is modelled. Growth of solvent
   chamber and oil drainage rate predicted from the proxy model are in good
   agreement with Hele-Shaw experimental data available in the literature.
   Results predicted by proxy model also match well with scaled-up flow
   rates for a field case described by Das and Butler (Das and Butler, J.
   Can. Petrol. Technol. 1994, 33, 39).}},

   Simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The lack of the expertise and resources, the unavailability of
   sufficient and complete operations data, and the absence of relevant
   site information present obstacles to applying combined simulation
   modeling in practice. Construction modelers are required to make
   critical decisions in a short turnaround time for planning operations
   and improving productivity. Thus, a more convenient discrete event
   simulation-based approach in simulating the production capacity of the
   continuous plant given limited data availability is desirable and
   formalized, which essentially discretizes the modeling of continuous
   elements in a predominantly discrete system without loss of significance
   or accuracy. As such, a direct application of a discrete simulation
   method intended for construction applications will offer a
   straightforward, sufficient solution to model the whole system. A
   concrete pumping case is used to illustrate the proposed approach. The
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is further demonstrated to tackle
   a real-world challenge: modeling iron ore mining operations to achieve
   efficiency and enhance productivity. Especially, the formula proposed is
   applied to simplify the modeling of the iron ore processing plant with
   magnetic separation drums, which constitutes the major plant used for
   extracting iron sand from the slurry of iron ore. A discrete event
   simulation model was rapidly developed for the complex mining system and
   the insight derived from simulation experiments assisted a mining
   company in (1)configuring the processes of raw sand excavation, iron
   sand magnetic separation and iron sand shipment at a seaport,
   (2)optimizing resource allocation and utilization. In conclusion, the
   proposed approach adds to the usefulness and flexibility of a discrete
   simulation methodology in modeling complicated construction systems.}},

   of nonlinear suture tissue}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{179-186}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The interrelation between creep and relaxation response of a nonlinear
   material is a widely studied topic with major implications in the study
   of viscoelasticity. When considering maxillary expansion, a common
   orthodontic treatment, a variety of appliances and protocols may be
   utilized placing the midpalatal suture in a creep or relaxation
   scenario; hence, it is imperative to fully understand the suture's
   viscoelastic behavior in prediction of patient response to maxillary
   expansion. The presented study considers four approaches to a full
   creep-relaxation model, including both separable and inseparable
   functions. Each model is fit to rabbit midsagittal suture creep data
   from the literature and then transformed into its subsequent relaxation
   form for evaluation. Due to a lack of experimental relaxation data in
   the literature for this tissue, an additional study considering medial
   collateral ligament data was used to further evaluate ideal model
   candidates based on the initial analysis. Results from the study
   presented here show that the suture's creep behavior is best described
   through functions with variable stress exponents. In addition, the four
   models tested were found to give a physically reasonable range of
   relaxation predictions. Such findings further highlight the necessity to
   explore the creep-relaxation behavior of a material using a variety of
   approaches when building a comprehensive viscoelastic model. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Methoxy poly(ethylene
   oxide)-block-poly-(alpha-carboxylate-epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCCL)
   was used to develop pH-responsive polymeric micelles for the delivery of
   cisplatin (CDDP). Micelles were prepared through complexation of CDDP
   with the pendant carboxyl groups on the poly(e-caprolactone) core,
   perhaps through coordinate bonding. The obtained micelles were
   characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement for size
   and stability. The in vitro release of CDDP at different pHs (7.4, 6.0
   and 5.0) was evaluated. The in vitro cell uptake as well as cytotoxicity
   of developed micelles against two breast cancer cell lines, i.e.
   MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231, were also assessed and compared to free CDDP
   as control. DLS results showed PEO-b-PCCL to form stable micelles with
   an average diameter of <50nm upon complexation with CDDP. Developed
   polymeric micelles were capable of slowly releasing CDDP in
   physiological pH. However, CDDP release from polymeric micelles was
   triggered upon exposure to electrolytes and/or acidic pHs mimicking that
   of extracellular tumor microenvironment or intracellular organelles.
   Consistent with the slow release of CDDP from its polymeric micellar
   formulation, polymeric micellar CDDP exhibited lower cytotoxicity and
   CDDP intracellular uptake compared to free drug. The results indicate a
   great potential for the developed formulation in platinum therapy of
   breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{A mechanical geometric crystal growth model is developed to describe the
   crystal length and radius evolution. The crystal radius regulation is
   achieved by feedback linearization and accounts for parametric
   uncertainty in the crystal growth rate. The associated parabolic partial
   differential equation (PDE) model of heat conduction is considered over
   the time-varying crystal domain and coupled with crystal growth
   dynamics. An appropriately defined infinite-dimensional representation
   of the thermal evolution is derived considering slow time-varying
   process effects. The computational framework of the Galerkin's method is
   used for parabolic PDE order reduction and observer synthesis for
   temperature distribution reconstruction over the entire crystal domain.
   It is shown that the proposed observer can be utilized to reconstruct
   temperature distribution from boundary temperature measurements. The
   developed observer is implemented on the finite-element model of the
   process and demonstrates that despite parametric and geometric
   uncertainties present in the model, the temperature distribution is
   reconstructed with the high accuracy. (C) 2014 American Institute of

Abstract = {{A noise figure and noise parameter measurement system was developed that
   consists of a combination spectrum and network analyzer, preamplifier,
   programmable power supply, noise source, tuning board, and desktop
   computer.
   The system uses the Y-factor method for noise figure calculation and
   allows calibrations to correct for a decrease in excess noise ratio
   between the noise source and device under test, second stage (system)
   noise, ambient temperature variations, and available gain of the device
   under test. Noise parameters are extracted by performing noise figure
   measurements at several source impedance values obtained by adjusting an
   electronically controlled tuner. Results for several amplifiers at 128
   MHz and 200 MHz agree with independent measurements and with the
   corresponding datasheets.
   With some modifications, the system was also used to characterize the
   noise figure of MRI preamplifiers in strong static magnetic fields up to
   9.4 T. In most amplifiers tested the gain was found to be reduced by the
   magnetic field, while the noise figure increased. These changes are
   detrimental to signal quality (SNR) and are dependent on the electron
   mobility and design of the amplifier's semiconductor devices.
   Consequently, gallium arsenide (GaAs) field-effect transistors are most
   sensitive to magnetic fields due to their high electron mobility and
   long, narrow channel, while silicon-germanium (SiGe) bipolar transistor
   amplifiers are largely immune due to their very thin base. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The paper presents a piezoresistive sensor array designed for use in
   touch panel applications. The sensor array is able to detect both
   amplitude and position of an applied force. A numerical method was used
   in designing both the normal force sensor and the sensor array. The
   normal force sensor has been designed, fabricated and tested with
   sensitivity of 0.5 mV/mN V. The sensor array has been modeled as
   feasible through the implementation of normal force sensor, and shows
   the sensitivity of 0.42 mV/mN V. The numerical results of the sensor
   array demonstrate linearity, which can be used for characterization of
   touch position and force amplitude. The intrinsic force-angle-related
   property of the normal force sensor can affect the characterization of
   the sensor array, and produce redundancy information for more precise
   data analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have demonstrated an efficient optical immunoassay
   technique for the detection of a food-borne pathogen, Listeria
   monocytogenes, using a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) configuration.
   We have investigated ten different MZI configurations with angular and
   Sbend Y-junction geometries. An efficient Hydrofluoric acid (HF) based
   technique was used for rapid and specific binding of L. monocytogenes to
   the sensor arm of the MZI biosensor. The MZI biosensor was able to
   detect L. monocytogenes at concentrations of the order of 10(5) CFU/ml,
   which is lower than the infection dose for healthy human beings. SEM
   analysis and light intensity measurements showed the biosensor is highly
   selective to L. monocytogenes over other microbial species (such as
   Escherichia coli). Finally, a novel calibration scheme of the MZI
   biosensor was developed from experimental data that can be used for
   determining unknown concentrations of L. monocytogenes.}},

Abstract = {{Torrefaction based co-firing in a pulverized coal boiler has been
   proposed for large percentage of biomass co-firing. A 220 MWe pulverized
   coal-power plant is simulated using Aspen Plus for full understanding
   the impacts of an additional torrefaction unit on the efficiency of the
   whole power plant, the studied process includes biomass drying, biomass
   torrefaction, mill systems, biomass/coal devolatilization and
   combustion, heat exchanges and power generation. Palm kernel shells
   (PKS) were torrefied at same residence time but 4 different
   temperatures, to prepare 4 torrefied biomasses with different degrees of
   torrefaction. During biomass torrefaction processes, the mass loss
   properties and released gaseous components have been studied. In
   addition, process simulations at varying torrefaction degrees and
   biomass co-firing ratios have been carried out to understand the
   properties of CO2 emission and electricity efficiency in the studied
   torrefaction based co-firing power plant. According to the experimental
   results, the mole fractions of CO2 and CO account for 69-91\% and 4-27\%
   in torrefied gases. The predicted results also showed that the
   electrical efficiency reduced when increasing either torrefaction
   temperature or substitution ratio of biomass. A deep torrefaction may
   not be recommended, because the power saved from biomass grinding is
   less than the heat consumed by the extra torrefaction process, depending
   on the heat sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The number of Maxwell-Boltzmann particles that hit a flat wall in
   infinite space per unit area per unit time is a well-known result. As
   new applications are arising in micro and nanotechnologies there are a
   number of situations in which a rarefied gas interacts with either a
   flat or curved surface in a small confined geometry. Thus, it is
   necessary to prove that the Maxwell-Boltzmann collision frequency result
   holds even if a container's dimensions are on the order of nanometers
   and also that this result is valid for both a finite container with flat
   walls (a rectangular container) and a finite container with a curved
   wall (a cylindrical container). An analytical proof confirms that the
   Maxwell-Boltzmann collision frequencies for either a finite rectangular
   container or a finite cylindrical container are both equal to the
   well-known result obtained for a flat wall in infinite space. A major
   aspect of this paper is the introduction of a mathematical technique to
   solve the arising infinite sum of integrals whose integrands depend on
   the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Delivery of polynucleotides into patient cells is a promising strategy
   for treatment of genetic disorders. Gene therapy aims to either
   synthesize desired proteins (DNA delivery) or suppress expression of
   endogenous genes (siRNA delivery). Carriers constitute an important part
   of gene therapeutics due to limitations arising from the
   pharmacokinetics of polynucleotides. Non-viral carriers such as polymers
   and lipids protect polynucleotides from intra and extracellular threats
   and facilitate formation of cell-permeable nanoparficles through
   shielding and/or bridging multiple polynucleotide molecules. Formation
   of nanoparticulate systems with optimal features, their cellular uptake
   and intracellular trafficking are crucial steps for an effective gene
   therapy. Despite the great amount of experimental work pursued, critical
   features of the nanoparticles as well as their processing mechanisms are
   still under debate due to the lack of instrumentation at atomic
   resolution. Molecular modeling based computational approaches can shed
   light onto the atomic level details of gene delivery systems, thus
   provide valuable input that cannot be readily obtained with experimental
   techniques. Here, we review the molecular modeling research pursued on
   critical gene therapy steps, highlight the knowledge gaps in the field
   and providing future perspectives. Existing modeling studies revealed
   several important aspects of gene delivery, such as nanoparticle
   formation dynamics with various carriers, effect of carrier properties
   on complexation, carrier conformations in endosomal stages, and release
   of polynucleotides from carriers. Rate-limiting steps related to
   cellular events (i.e. internalization, endosomal escape, and nuclear
   uptake) are now beginning to be addressed by computational approaches.
   Limitations arising from current computational power and accuracy of
   modeling have been hindering the development of more realistic models.
   With the help of rapidly-growing computational power, the critical
   aspects of gene therapy are expected to be better investigated and
   direct comparison between more realistic molecular modeling and
   experiments may open the path for design of next generation gene
   therapeutics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were constructed and filled with

   COD removal reached 12\% and 20\% in the AS-SBR and the MFT-SBR,
   respectively, when 100\% raw OSPW was fed into the reactors. Maximum
   removal of acid-extractable organics (AEO) was 8.7\% and 16.6\% in the
   AS-SBR and the MFT-SBR, respectively with a hydraulic retention time of
   one day. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was the
   dominant phylum and beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria were dominant classes
   in both reactors. Evidence of a microbial community change was observed
   when influent raw OSPW was switched from 50 to 100\%. More significant

Abstract = {{Many technologies, such as cell line screening and host cell
   engineering, culture media optimization and bioprocess optimization,
   have been proposed to increase monoclonal antibody (mAb) production in
   Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Unlike the existing biochemical
   approaches, we investigated stimulation using low-intensity pulsed
   ultrasound (LIPUS) as a purely physical approach, offering enhanced
   scalability, contamination control and cost-efficiency, while
   demonstrating significantly increased cell growth and antibody
   production. It was found that daily ultrasound treatments at 40 mW/cm(2)
   for 5 min during cell culture increased the production of human
   anti-IL-8 antibody by more than 30\% using 10 or 30 mL shake flasks.
   Further increasing the ultrasound dosage (either intensities or the
   treatment duration) did not appreciably increase cell growth or antibody
   production, however feeding the culture with additional
   highly-concentrated nutrients, glucose and amino acids (glutamine in
   this cage), did further increase cell growth and antibody titer to 35\%.
   Similar ultrasound treatments (40 mW/cm(2), 5 min per day) when scaled
   up to larger volume wavebags, resulted in a 25\% increase in antibody
   production. Increased antibody production can be attributed to both
   elevated cell count and the ultrasound stimulation. Theoretical study of
   underlying mechanisms was performed through the simulations of molecular
   dynamics using the AMBER software package, with results showing that
   LIPUS increases cell permeability. The significance of this study is
   that LIPUS, as a physical-based stimulation approach, can be externally
   applied to the cell culture without worrying about contamination. By
   combining with the existing technologies in antibody production, LIPUS
   can achieve additional mAb yields. Because it can be easily integrated
   with existing cell culture apparatuses, the technology is expected to be
   more acceptable by the end users. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{The finite element method for micro-scale modeling of ultrasound
   propagation in cancellous bone}},
Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1663-1676}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative ultrasound for bone assessment is based on the correlations
   between ultrasonic parameters and the properties (mechanical and
   physical) of cancellous bone. To elucidate the correlations,
   understanding the physics of ultrasound in cancellous bone is demanded.
   Micro-scale modeling of ultrasound propagation in cancellous bone using
   the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been so far utilized
   as one of the approaches in this regard. However, the FDTD method
   accompanies two disadvantages: staircase sampling of cancellous bone by
   finite difference grids leads to generation of wave artifacts at the
   solid-fluid interface inside the bone; additionally, this method cannot
   explicitly satisfy the needed perfect-slip conditions at the interface.
   To overcome these disadvantages, the finite element method (FEM) is
   proposed in this study. Three-dimensional finite element models of six
   water-saturated cancellous bone samples with different bone volume were
   created. The values of speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound
   attenuation (BUA) were calculated through the finite element simulations
   of ultrasound propagation in each sample. Comparing the results with
   other experimental and simulation studies demonstrated the capabilities
   of the FEM for micro-scale modeling of ultrasound in water-saturated
   cancellous bone. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale light-matter interaction in the weak-coupling regime has been
   achieved with unique hyperbolic metamaterial modes possessing a high
   density of states. Here, we show strong coupling between intersubband
   transitions (ISBTs) of a multiple quantum well (MQW) slab and the bulk
   polariton modes of a hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM). These HMM modes have
   large wave vectors (high-k modes) and are normally evanescent in
   conventional materials. We analyze a metal-dielectric practical
   multilayer HMM structure consisting of a highly doped semiconductor
   acting as a metallic layer and an active multiple quantum well
   dielectric slab. We observe delocalized metamaterial mode interaction
   with the active materials distributed throughout the structure. Strong
   coupling and characteristic anticrossing with a maximum Rabi splitting
   (RS) energy of up to 52 meV is predicted between the high-k mode of the
   HMMand the ISBT, a value approximately 10.5 times greater than the ISBT
   linewidth and 4.5 times greater than the material loss of the structure.
   The scalability and tunability of the RS energy in an active
   semiconductor metamaterial device have potential applications in quantum
   well infrared photodetectors and intersubband light-emitting devices.}},

Abstract = {{A mechanism for control of the energy and pitch angle of surface plasmon
   accelerated electron pulses is proposed. Electrons generated via

   fs, 800 nm optical pulse. Through introduction of a single-cycle
   terahertz (THz) pulse, the energy spectrum and trajectory of the
   generated electron pulse can be controlled via the THz field strength.
   Generated electron pulses achieve peak kinetic energies up to 1.56 keV,
   while utilizing an incident optical field strength five times less than
   comparable plasmon accelerated electron pulses. These results
   demonstrate that THz pulses can be utilized to achieve tunable, high

Title = {{The Alberta Heart Failure Etiology and Analysis Research Team (HEART)
   study}},
Journal = {{BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nationally, symptomatic heart failure affects 1.5-2\% of
   Canadians, incurs \$3 billion in hospital costs annually and the global
   burden is expected to double in the next 1-2 decades. The current
   one-year mortality rate after diagnosis of heart failure remains high at
   >25\%. Consequently, new therapeutic strategies need to be developed for
   this debilitating condition.
   Methods/Design: The objective of the Alberta HEART program
   (http://albertaheartresearch.ca) is to develop novel diagnostic,
   therapeutic and prognostic approaches to patients with heart failure
   with preserved ejection fraction. We hypothesize that novel imaging
   techniques and biomarkers will aid in describing heart failure with
   preserved ejection fraction. Furthermore, the development of new
   diagnostic criteria will allow us to: 1) better define risk factors
   associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; 2)
   elucidate clinical, cellular and molecular mechanisms involved with the
   development and progression of heart failure with preserved ejection
   fraction; 3) design and test new therapeutic strategies for patients
   with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Additionally,
   Alberta HEART provides training and education for enhancing
   translational medicine, knowledge translation and clinical practice in
   heart failure. This is a prospective observational cohort study of
   patients with, or at risk for, heart failure. Patients will have
   sequential testing including quality of life and clinical outcomes over
   12 months. After that time, study participants will be passively
   followed via linkage to external administrative databases. Clinical
   outcomes of interest include death, hospitalization, emergency
   department visits, physician resource use and/or heart transplant.
   Patients will be followed for a total of 5 years.
   Discussion: Alberta HEART has the primary objective to define new
   diagnostic criteria for patients with heart failure with preserved
   ejection fraction. New criteria will allow for targeted therapies,
   diagnostic tests and further understanding of the patients, both at-risk
   for and with heart failure.}},

   capacity at breakthrough is 0.7 mol of H2S per mole of copper while
   above 750 degrees C the capacity of the adsorbent is halved. The change
   in H2S capacity is due to Cu2+ reduction by the H-2 which is formed

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},

Volume = {{482}},
Pages = {{327-335}},

Abstract = {{Alloy and core shell bimetallic Pd-Ir nanoparticles stabilized by
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and deposited on alumina were subjected to
   PVP removal via thermal treatments. Less than 25\% of the PVP was
   removed at 200 degrees C calcination/375 degrees C reduction, while the
   400 degrees C calcination eliminated over 95\% of PVP. The treated
   samples were tested in the gas-phase ring opening of indane at 350
   degrees C. The cleaning was paramount for the bimetallic catalysts with
   Pd-rich surfaces that only exhibited activity after 400 degrees C
   calcination, while the catalysts with Ir-rich surfaces were similarly
   active irrespective of the presence or absence of the PVP residuals. For
   the CO chemisorption, complete cleaning was required for all catalysts.
   The study is supported by CO-DRIFTS, CO-TPD, indane-TPD, carbon
   analysis, TEM, CO chemisorption and catalytic measurements, and shows
   that the necessity to remove PVP depends on the nature of metals in
   bimetallic catalysts and their surface arrangements. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A high performance Raman system equipped with a CCD (charged coupled
   device) sensor and recently developed optical filter technology is
   described. It provides high sensitivity, high resolution, and access to
   low-frequency vibrations enabling resolution of spectral features due to
   lattice vibrational modes and internal vibrational modes, greatly
   improving the ability to detect small changes due to variations in the
   three dimensional molecular arrangement, e.g., during loss of
   crystallinity. Applications to solid state analysis, such as solid phase
   identification and differentiation of glycopyrronium bromide and
   formoterol fumarate in pharmaceutical powders, and identification of
   active pharmaceutical ingredients, e.g., salmeterol xinafoate,
   fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and salbutamol sulphate, as
   well as excipients, e.g., amino acids, in different formulations, are
   presented. For the first time, low-frequency shift Raman spectra of
   mannitol polymorphs were measured and used for solid phase
   identification. Unambiguous identification of two similar bronchodilator
   metered dose inhalers, Ventolin (R) HFA and Airomir (R), was
   accomplished. The low-frequency shift Raman signals can be used for the
   analysis of crystallinity of small samples (<5 mg) of respiratory dosage
   forms in a multi-component formulation matrix containing less than 3\%
   by weight of the component of interest. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   is based on ab initio simulations within the framework of density
   functional theory. The optical properties are obtained by evaluating the
   Kubo-Greenwood formula. By applying the material parameters of our ab
   initio model to a two-temperature model we are able to describe the
   temperature relaxation process of femtosecond-laser-heated gold and its
   optical properties within the same theoretical framework. Recent
   time-resolved measurements of optical properties of ultrafast heated
   gold revealed the dynamics of the interaction between femtosecond laser
   pulses and solid state matter. Different scenarios obtained from
   simulations of our study are compared with experimental data.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{133-140}},

Abstract = {{Time varying and non-linearity issues are commonly seen in soft senso
   development. Recently, just-in-time approach has been widely used to
   address the non-linearity problem in near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy
   modeling. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the time
   varying problems in just-in-time (JIT) framework are rarely discussed
   and the adaptation strategy for the local models in JIT approach remains
   an open issue. In this paper, a new model updating approach is proposed
   which can adjust to process changes by merging the traditional recursive
   algorithm in the JIT framework. The advantage of the presented approach
   is that it can solve both time varying and non-linearity issues
   simultaneously under the JIT framework. The performance of the method
   has been tested on a spectroscopic dataset from an industrial process.
   By comparison with traditional PLS, locally weighted PLS and several
   other on-line model updating strategies, it is shown that the proposed
   method achieves good performance in the prediction of fuel properties.

Abstract = {{Removal of residual oil from reject sand grains is a major challenge in
   solvent-based bitumen extraction. A proposed solution is to wash the
   oil-contaminated sand grains with water and surfactants (the remediation
   agent). Due to the very favourable interfacial properties of naphthenic
   acids, namely, its ability to significantly reduce the oil-water
   interfacial tension and render the solid substrate hydrophilic, the
   surfactant has been proposed as a promising remediation agent. In this
   study, we evaluated the washing performance of naphthenic acids and
   demonstrated its inadequacy in sand remediation. The fundamental reason
   for the surfactant's poor performance was the inadvertent formation of a
   bicontinuous microemulsion which consumed much of the naphthenic acids,
   leaving little if any for remediation purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   cells were quantified by the microfluidic platform with different
   constriction channel cross-section areas, recording no differences with
   statistical significance (p < 0.001) in both C-specific (membrane) (1.63

Abstract = {{The citrate gel method was used to synthesize ZrO2 samples loaded with
   different concentrations of CuO for potential use as oxygen sorbents for
   high-temperature air separation. The effect of yttria addition was
   investigated by studying the change in the crystal structure (X-ray
   diffraction) and morphology (scanning electron microscopy). Oxygen
   sorption and desorption kinetics of all samples and their cyclic
   stability were tested using thermogravimetric analysis. In oxygen
   desorption studies, a mixture of CO2 and O-2 similar to recycled flue
   gas in composition was used as purges gas to study the possibility of
   using these sorbents in the ceramic autothermal recovery process. Yttria
   addition improved the cyclical stability of the sorbents without any
   significant change in sorptive/desorptive properties. Sorbents with CuO
   loading below 20\% showed improved performance with a sorption capacity
   higher than existing perovskite or spinel/perovskite oxides. Yttria
   doping improves dispersion of CuO on the support therefore leading to
   higher desorption rates. Yttria doping also prevents the agglomeration
   of Cu2O particles in desorption cycles making the rate of desorption and
   absorption stable over long time periods.}},

   Identification with Missing Output Data Using an

Month = {{JUL 9}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the identification problems of the linear
   parameter varying (LPV) system with missing output in the presence of
   the time-delay. A multiple-model approach is adopted. Local models
   varying from one operating point to another are first described by
   finite impulse response (FIR) models. To handle missing output and
   time-delay, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to
   estimate the unknown parameters and the time-delay simultaneously.
   Output Error (OE) models are widely used in controller design.
   Therefore, the auxiliary model principle is employed to recover the OE
   models based on the initially identified FIR models. The EM algorithm is
   then used again to refine the unknown parameters of the OE models with
   the complete data set to obtain the final global model. Simulation
   examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics simulation was used to study the
   diffusion of a hydrophobic drug Cucurbitacin B (CuB) in pseudomicelle
   environments consisting of poly(ethylene oxide-b-caprolactone)
   (PEO-b-PCL) swollen by various amounts of water. Two PEO-b-PCL
   configurations, linear and branched, with the same total molecular
   weight were used. For the branched configuration, the block copolymer
   contained one linear block of PEO with the same molecular weight as that
   of the PEO block used in the linear configuration but with one end
   connecting to three PCL blocks with the same chain length, hereafter
   denoted PEO-b-3PCL. Regardless of the configuration, the simulation
   results showed that the diffusivity of CuB was insensitive to the water
   concentration up to similar to 8 wt \% while that of water decreased
   with an increasing water concentration. The diffusivity of CuB (10(-8)
   cm(2)/s) was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of water (10(-5)
   cm(2)/s). This is attributed to the fact that CuB relied on the wiggling
   motion of the block copolymers to diffuse while water molecules diffused
   via a hopping mechanism. The rates at which CuB and water diffused into
   PEO-b-PCL were twice those in PEO-b-3PCL because the chain mobility and
   the degree of swelling are higher and there are fewer intermolecular
   hydrogen bonds in the case of PEO-b-PCL. The velocity autocorrelation
   functions of CuB show that the free volume holes formed by PEO-b-3PCL
   are more rigid than those formed by PEO-b-PCL, making CuB exhibit
   higher-frequency collision motion in PEO-b-3PCL than in PEO-b-PCL, and
   the difference in frequency is insensitive to water concentration.}},

   resonators}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Resonating strings have shown promise in a variety of applications
   including micron-scale mass and temperature sensors. We present
   microchannel string resonators (MSRs) which have resonance frequency
   modulated by the internal gauge pressure of silicon nitride
   microchannels sitting atop the strings. We present an analytical model
   to predict the pressure sensitivity (Hz/kPa) of the first resonance
   frequency as well as experimental results for three identical MSRs.
   While the highest experimental sensitivity of one of the resonators is
   5.19 Hz/kPa (0.5 Hz/mbar), the analytical model suggests sensitivity
   could increase by two orders of magnitude if the microchannels are
   fabricated at nanometer scale with a length of 10 mu m, a channel width
   of 600 nm, and a channel thickness of 50 nm. The average pressure
   resolution of the sensors is 0.4 kPa. These results are for a calibrated
   range of pressure from 50 kPa to 100 kPa (500 mbar to 1000 mbar).
   However, the analytical model shows that resonance frequency is a linear
   function of pressure over a range of several MPa, suggesting that the
   microchannel resonators could have a pressure sensing range (dynamic
   range) suitable for many applications. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   behaviors of a piezoelectric nanoplate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Flexoelectricity, referring to the coupling between electric
   polarization and strain gradients, is a universal effect in all
   dielectrics and may become manifest at the nano-scale. The current work
   aims to investigate the flexoelectric effect on the electroelastic
   responses and the free vibrational behaviors of a piezoelectric
   nanoplate (PNP). Based on the conventional Kirchhoff plate theory and
   the extended linear piezoelectricity theory, the governing equation and
   the boundary conditions of a clamped PNP with the consideration of the
   static bulk flexoelectricity are derived. Ritz approximate solutions of
   the electroelastic fields and the resonant frequencies demonstrate the
   size-dependency of the flexoelectric effect, which is more prominent for
   thinner plates with smaller thickness as expected. Simulation results
   also indicate that the influence of the flexoelectricity upon the
   electroelastic fields of a bending PNP and the transverse vibration of
   the PNP is sensitive to the plate in-plane dimensions as well as the
   applied electric voltage. Moreover, it is suggested that the possible
   frequency tuning of a PNP resonator by adjusting applied electrical load
   warrants the consideration of the flexoelectricity. This study is
   claimed to provide a theoretical predicition on the trend of the
   flexoelectric effect upon the static and dynamic behaviors of a bending
   PNP, thus sheding light on understanding the underlying physics of
   electromechanical coupling at the nano-scale to some extent. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Nd2NiO4+delta infiltrated into porous yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ)
   is proposed in this work as a cathode for solid oxide fuel cells
   (SOFCs). In order to obtain nickelate single phase, calcination times
   and temperatures of the salt precursors are studied. Anode supported
   microtubular cells using this cathode are fabricated and characterized,
   showing power densities of about 0.76 W cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and a
   voltage as high as 0.8 V. No degradation is detected after 24 hours
   under current load, assuring reasonable stability of the cell.
   Preliminary solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) results show slightly
   better performances in comparison with SOFC operation. It is believed
   that infiltration of nickelate salt precursors followed by calcination
   proposed in this work avoids high temperature sintering of the nickelate
   phase with the electrolyte and. as a consequence, prevents their
   reaction. For this reason, infiltrated nickelates are very attractive

Abstract = {{In the present study, we perform molecular dynamic simulations to
   investigate the compression response and atomistic deformation
   mechanisms of twinned nanospheres. The relationship between load and
   compression depth is calculated for various twin spacing and loading
   directions. Then, the overall elastic properties and the underlying
   plastic deformation mechanisms are illuminated. Twin boundaries (TBs)
   act as obstacles to dislocation motion and lead to strengthening. As the
   loading direction varies, the plastic deformation transfers from
   dislocations intersecting with TBs, slipping parallel to TBs, and then
   to being restrained by TBs. The strengthening of TBs depends strongly on
   the twin spacing.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of two in-house synthesized organic-inorganic hybrid
   polymers, Al(OH)(3)-polyacrylamide (Al-PAM) and Fe(OH)(3)-polyacrylamide
   (Fe-PAM) on kaolin and corresponding flocculation of fluid fine kaolin
   suspensions were investigated. For comparison, a commercial anionic
   flocculant (partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide or known as H-PAM) was
   also examined. The flocculation dynamics of fine kaolin suspensions were
   determined using an on-line focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM)
   probe. As an example of applications, flocculation of a laboratory oil
   sands extraction tailings sample was studied. A quartz crystal
   microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) was used to determine adsorption
   kinetics of the polymers on silica and alumina as representative of T-
   and O-basal planes of kaolin.
   Al-PAM, Fe-PAM and H-PAM were shown to be excellent flocculant of kaolin
   suspensions, with H-PAM being less effective and more sensitive to
   overdosing. The flocculation performance was greatly influenced by
   proper mixing. Strong flocculation of kaolin suspension by Al-PAM and
   Fe-PAM is attributed to their ability to adsorb on both basal planes of
   kaolin, in contrast to relatively weak flocculation of kaolin by H-PAM
   which adsorbs only on positively charged aluminum oxy-hydroxyl basal
   planes. The electrostatic attraction or repulsion is identified as a
   critical parameter in determining polymer adsorption and hence
   corresponding flocculation of kaolin suspensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Electrophoresis is an integral part of many molecular diagnostics
   protocols and an inexpensive implementation would greatly facilitate
   point-of-care (POC) applications. However, the high instrumentation cost
   presents a substantial barrier, much of it associated with fluorescence
   detection. The cost of such systems could be substantially reduced by
   placing the fluidic channel and photodiode directly above the detector
   in order to collect a larger portion of the fluorescent light. In
   future, this could be achieved through the integration and monolithic
   fabrication of photoresist microchannels on complementary metal-oxide
   semiconductor microelectronics (CMOS). However, the development of such
   a device is expensive due to high non-recurring engineering costs. To
   facilitate that development, we present a system that utilises an
   optical relay to integrate low-cost polymeric microfluidics with a CMOS
   chip that provides a photodiode, analog-digital conversion and a
   standard serial communication interface. This system embodies an
   intermediate level of microelectronic integration, and significantly
   decreases development costs. With a limit of detection of 13 +/- 0.4 nM
   of fluorescently end-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), it is suitable
   for diagnostic applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG) uses axle load
   spectra and the number of axle applications to characterise traffic
   loads for pavement design. Alberta Transportation installed
   weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems at six highway locations to characterise
   traffic loads in Alberta for MEPDG design. Seasonal and regional trends
   in traffic characteristics of the six WIM sites were investigated and
   compared with the default values in the MEPDG for the years 2009 and
   2010. Truck traffic classification (TTC) and axle load distribution
   factor (ALDF) for the WIM sites showed deviations from the MEPDG
   defaults. Seasonal variations were also evident in the distribution of
   different classes of truck throughout the year. Differences are
   attributed to cold climate conditions and special truck traffic in
   Alberta because of local industries. Influence of the differences
   between site-specific traffic characteristics and the MEPDG defaults on
   the performance of both flexible and rigid pavements for Alberta
   conditions was investigated through a sensitivity analysis. It was found
   that the flexible pavement performance is sensitive to TTC and ALDF, and
   the rigid pavement performance is most sensitive to ALDF.}},

Abstract = {{Trilateral haptic systems can be modeled as three-port networks. We
   present a criterion for absolute stability of a general class of
   three-port networks. Traditionally, existing (i.e., Llewellyn's)
   criteria have facilitated the stability analysis of bilateral haptic
   systems modeled as two-port networks. If the same criteria were to be
   used for stability analysis of a three-port network, its third port
   termination would need to be assumed known for it to reduce to a
   two-port network. This is restrictive because, for absolute stability,
   all three terminations of the three-port network must be allowed to be
   arbitrary (while passive). Extending Llewellyn's criterion, we present
   closed-form necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute stability
   of a general class of three-port networks. We first find a
   symmetrization condition under which a general asymmetric impedance (or
   admittance) matrix Z(3x3) has a symmetric equivalent Z(eq) from a
   network stability perspective. Then, via the equivalence of passivity
   and absolute stability for reciprocal networks, an absolute stability
   condition for the original nonreciprocal network is derived. To
   demonstrate the convenience and utility of using this criterion for both
   analysis and design, it is applied to the problem of designing
   stabilizing controllers for dual-user haptic teleoperation systems, with
   simulations and experiments validating the criterion.}},

Abstract = {{Titanium dioxide has been attached much attention due to its unique
   antimicrobial, photocatalytic, self-cleaning activities. Practical
   applications of TiO2 are limited because of the problems of low
   recycling efficiency and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 fine particles.
   In this paper, natural zeolite supported S doped TiO2 photocatalysts
   were synthesised by TiCl4 hydrolysis method for the sake of improving
   the recovery and photocatalytic efficiency of fine TiO2. The as prepared
   materials were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX),
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse
   reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) and photoluminescence (PL). Methyl
   orange was used to estimate the photocatalytic activity of the samples.
   The results showed that S ions (S6+) incorporated into the TiO2 crystal
   lattice or existed as SO42- on the surface of TiO2. The doped S ions
   stabilised the structure of anatase, restrained the transformation of
   anatase to rutile and the growth of TiO2 crystallite, and also improved
   the adsorption ability of the photocatalysts. The photocatalytic and
   adsorption activities of the S doped samples were obviously higher than
   that of the undoped sample.}},

Title = {{Beam Design Force Demands in Steel Plate Shear Walls with Simple
   Boundary Frame Connections}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Where simple beam-to-column connections are used in the boundary frame
   of a steel plate shear wall and the tension fields in the infill plates
   are assumed to be uniform and at the yield stress for capacity design,
   the moment and shear force distributions in each beam are statically
   determinate, while the axial force distribution is highly indeterminate
   and depends on several contributing factors. In this paper, in addition
   to quantifying appropriate moment and shear force distributions for use
   in design, a simple but powerful analysis method is presented for
   evaluating the beam's axial force demand. The method is based on the
   principle of capacity design and nonlinear finite element simulations of
   wall systems with different numbers of stories, infill plate aspect
   ratios and thicknesses, and lateral load distributions. The axial force
   demands are highly dependent on the mechanism of load transfer to the
   system from the floor and roof diaphragms and the shear force
   distribution in the compression column. The various components of shear
   force demand on the beams of the system are also studied, and it is
   shown that the net shear forces on an intermediate beam depend on the
   pattern of yield progression in the infill plates above and below. A
   method for determining appropriate design moment and shear values is
   proposed for the case where the same infill plate thickness is used
   above and below an intermediate beam. The methods presented for moment,
   shear, and axial force determination are verified against experimental
   results for a two-story steel plate shear wall with simple bolted
   double-angle beam-to-column connections. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{X-ray transmission videography is used to observe the thermodynamic
   phase behavior of heavy oil mixtures of industrial interest that are
   opaque to visible light. The knowledge of the volumes of various phases
   provide important information for enhancing oil refining technology.
   Phase boundaries are usually marked by visual examination based upon
   which the volumes and densities of the phases are computed. Typically,
   phase behavior is computed at various temperatures and pressures to
   generate the phase diagram. This paper presents an image processing
   algorithm, which automates the task of detecting phase boundaries in the
   generated images. The interface and region models are first obtained
   from the image generation process. Using these models, a new method for
   interface detection based on the Mumford-Shah model is presented.
   Results are presented to show that the algorithm detects the phase
   boundaries to subpixel accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In non-equilibrium conditions, the coring phenomena may occur in the
   alpha-Mg solid solution and alpha-Mg17Al12 phase forms in the
   microstructure of AZ magnesium alloy series. This eutectic phase may
   introduce detrimental effect on workability of wrought alloys. In the
   present work, the dissolution characteristics of gamma phase have been
   investigated in AZ31 wrought magnesium alloy. Considering the eutectic
   temperature of AZ31 alloy, the homogenization treatment was executed in
   temperature range of 300-437 degrees C (i.e., somewhat below eutectic
   melting temperature of gamma precipitate) and 437-500 degrees C (i.e.,
   higher eutectic melting temperature of gamma precipitate) for different
   durations. A thorough microstructural investigation and also
   thermodynamic calculations were executed. The results indicated that the
   dissolution rate of gamma phase is very low even at temperatures just
   below the eutectic point of the alloy, whereas it dramatically increases
   at temperatures higher than eutectic point. Moreover, it is suggested
   that partial melting of gamma phase due to eutectic melting reaction
   (alpha+gamma -> L) may lead to reduced formability.}},

Abstract = {{Trajectories of bubbly jets in crossflows by injecting air-water
   mixtures vertically through a circular nozzle were experimentally
   studied. Bubbles separated from the water jets in strong crossflow,
   similarly to that of multiphase plumes in crossflow reported in the
   literature. Based on dimensional analysis, a semiempirical relation was
   developed to predict the separation height for bubbly jets with strong
   initial momentum. Centerline trajectories of both the water and air
   phases of bubbly jets were examined. After the separation, the air-phase
   centerlines can be treated as straight lines. The spreading rates of
   half-thickness and half-width of the air phase were studied along the
   airphase centerline. They decreased substantially after the bubble
   separation from the water jets and their terminal values appeared to
   increase with mean bubble diameter. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{A key problem in environmental flow assessment is the explicit linking
   of the flow regime with ecological dynamics. We present a hybrid
   modeling approach to couple hydrodynamic and biological processes,
   focusing on the combined impact of spatial heterogeneity and temporal
   variability on population dynamics. Studying periodically alternating
   pool-riffle rivers that are subjected to seasonally varying flows, we
   obtain an invasion ratchet mechanism. We analyze the ratchet process for
   a caricature model and a hybrid physical-biological model. The water
   depth and current are derived from a hydrodynamic equation for variable
   stream bed water flows and these quantities feed into a
   reaction-diffusion-advection model that governs population dynamics of a
   river species. We establish the existence of spreading speeds and the
   invasion ratchet phenomenon, using a mixture of mathematical
   approximations and numerical computations. Finally, we illustrate the
   invasion ratchet phenomenon in a spatially two-dimensional hydraulic
   simulation model of a meandering river structure. Our hybrid modeling
   approach strengthens the ecological component of stream hydraulics and
   allows us to gain a mechanistic understanding as to how flow patterns
   affect population survival.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic properties of aggregate are different from those of
   impermeable particles and have not been well established, owing to their
   complex structural feature. Therefore, this paper focuses on the study
   of hydrodynamic properties of an aggregate by computational fluid
   dynamics method. An aggregate with self-similar structure composed of
   four primary spheres is constructed to account for its fractal geometry.
   Navier-Stokes equations are applied for the whole flow field in relation
   to the aggregate. Both exterior and interior flow through the aggregate
   could be seen clearly. Fluid collection efficiency, an indication of
   permeability, is also obtained. Reynolds number has complicated
   influence on fluid collection efficiency. Furthermore, the larger the
   space between four primary particles is, the larger the fluid collection
   efficiency. The smaller the fractal dimension is, the larger the fluid
   collection efficiency. These findings will enable the development of
   more realistic models for the flocculation and material transfer
   dynamics of fractal aggregate. All these results contribute to further
   research about mass transfer between the aggregate interior and the bulk
   liquid solution, as well as those researches related to irregular porous
   structures. (C) 2014 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published

Abstract = {{The main objective of this work is to introduce a new expression for the
   hydrogel's hydration for use within the Poisson Nernst-Planck chemo
   electro mechanical (PNP CEM) transport models. This new contribution to
   the models support large deformation by considering the higher order
   terms in the Green-Lagrangian strain tensor. A detailed discussion of
   the CEM transport models using Poisson Nernst-Planck (PNP) and Poisson
   logarithmic Nernst-Planck (PLNP) equations for chemically and
   electrically stimulated hydrogels will be presented. The assumptions
   made to simplify both CEM transport models for electric field
   application in the order of 0.833 kV m(-1) and a highly diluted
   electrolyte solution (97\% is water) will be explained. This PNP CEM
   model has been verified accurately against experimental and numerical
   results. In addition, different definitions for normalizing the
   parameters are used to derive the dimensionless forms of both the PNP
   and PLNP CEM. Four models, PNP CEM, PLNP CEM, dimensionless PNP CEM and
   dimensionless PNLP CEM transport models were employed on an axially
   symmetric cylindrical hydrogel problem with an aspect ratio (diameter to
   thickness) of 175:3. The displacement and osmotic pressure obtained for
   the four models are compared against the variation of the number of
   elements for finite element analysis, simulation duration and solution
   rate when using the direct numerical solver.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple valued logic (MVL) circuits are particularly attractive for
   nanoscale implementation as advantages in information density and
   operating speed can be harvested using emerging technologies. In this
   paper, a new family of MVL gates is proposed for implementation using
   carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs). The proposed designs
   use pseudo N-type CNTFETs and no resistor is utilized for their
   operation. This approach exploits threshold voltage control of the
   P-type and N-type transistors, while ensuring correct MVL operation for
   both ternary and quaternary logic gates. This paper provides a detailed
   assessment of several figures of merit, such as static power
   consumption, switching power consumption, propagation delay and the
   power-delay product (PDP). Compared with resistor-loaded designs, the
   proposed pseudo-NCNTFET MVL gates show advantages in circuit area, power
   consumption and energy efficiency, while still incurring a comparable
   propagation delay. Compared to a complementary logic family, the
   pseudo-NCNTFET MVL logic family requires a smaller circuit area with a
   similar propagation delay on average, albeit with a larger PDP and
   static power consumption. A design methodology and a discussion of
   issues related to leakage and yield are also provided for the proposed
   MVL logic family.}},

Abstract = {{The existing rate transient models for fractured horizontal wells assume
   single-phase fluid flow. This assumption is violated in early times,
   when hydraulic fractures (HF) are filled with fracturing water and
   hydrocarbon. This calls for a model that captures the transient 2-phase
   (gas/oil + water) flow in HF, and can be used for history matching
   rate/pressure data measured during flowback operations. This paper
   extends the existing linear dual-porosity model (DPM) and develops a
   flowback analysis model (FAM) which accounts for transient 2-phase flow
   in HF.
   FAM assumes that water-saturation in HF drops with time, which causes a
   non-linear increase in relative-permeability. Hence, it adopts an
   explicit dynamic-relative-permeability (DRP) function of time for the
   hydrocarbon-phase to account for water-saturation drop in HF. The
   resulting DRP function is obtained by integrating cumulative flowback
   hydrocarbon + water (from 15 tight-oil, tight-gas and shale-gas
   multifractured horizontal wells) data with drainage
   relative-permeability curves from existing literature. DRP is then
   incorporated into the DPM to obtain FAM flow equations. These flow
   equations capture the fluid physics from flowback till ``full{''}
   hydrocarbon production.
   The FAM equations are solved using Laplace transforms. Type-curves are
   generated by numerically inverting the resulting Laplace-space solutions
   to time-space using the Gaver-Stefhest algorithm. FAM converges to DPM
   at the limit of constant water-saturation. Flow-regimes observed
   comprise linear, bilinear, and boundary dominated. This paper proposes
   an interpretation workflow for analysing flowback data. The application
   of this workflow on 2-phase rate + pressure flowback data from a shale
   gas well provides a means to (1) estimate effective HF half-length and
   volume of interconnected secondary fractures, (2) evaluate flowback
   performance and (3) forecast hydrocarbon recovery. The results encourage
   the industry to start careful and accurate data measurement immediately
   when wells are put on flowback. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Large scale trends are important geological features that should be
   accounted for in geostatistical characterization of uncertainty. The
   workflow for uncertainty characterization accounting for a trend
   involves two major steps: (1) trend modeling and (2) integrating the
   trend into geostatistical estimation and/or simulation. While there are
   several options to consider for integrating trend models into
   geostatistical workflow, building a reasonable and fair trend model
   based on data coming from different sources and/or defined on different
   support still presents a challenge. In this paper we describe a locally
   varying methodology for building a fades proportion trend for Surmont
   area of Athabasca Oil Sands. The trend is built based on vertical well
   data and seismic attribute - acoustic impedance; several probability
   combination schemes are considered for merging facies probability cubes
   calculated from the two data sources. All steps required building trend
   models and selecting one representative based on the criteria of
   fairness and certainty are documented and detailed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Viscosity reduction of heavy oil/bitumen using micro- and nano-metal

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{119}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to clarify the mechanisms of additional
   viscosity reduction of heavy oil/bitumen using nano-size metal particles
   during steam injection techniques. For this purpose, three sets of
   experiments are designed. The objective of the first series of
   experiments was to study the effect of metal particles on the viscosity
   of the produced oil at low temperature. Viscometry experiments at
   temperatures below 100 degrees C were conducted for this purpose. Then,
   their effect was studied in the presence of aqueous phase at high
   temperature of 300 degrees C to simulate the steam stimulation
   processes. The third set of experiments was designed to study the effect
   of micro- and nano-sized metal particles on the enhancement of heat
   transfer within the oil phase.
   The experiments showed that at low temperatures, the particles reduce
   the heavy oil viscosity after being mixed with the oil phase. The amount
   of the viscosity reduction is a function of the concentration of the
   particles and there exists an optimum concentration of particles
   yielding maximum amount of viscosity reduction. Also, the trend of
   viscosity versus concentration of the particles is a function of the
   type and size of the metal, and the temperature. The second series of
   experiments revealed that the same trend of viscosity versus
   concentration of particles is observed at steam injection conditions.
   However, much higher degree of reduction in viscosity was observed in
   this case compared to the low temperature experiments. The third series
   of experiments showed that metal particles used at their optimum
   concentration do not provide significant improvement of heat transfer.
   The experiments provided a good understanding of the ongoing mechanisms
   that would lead to a viscosity reduction by the addition of metal
   particles. The concentration, type, and size of the particles were found
   to be highly critical on viscosity reduction. The optimal values of
   these parameters were identified. The results and observations are
   expected to be useful in further studies and applications as to the
   efficiency improvement of the thermal applications for heavy-oil/bitumen
   recovery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical weather prediction (NWP) model outputs are point
   deterministic values arranged on a three-dimensional grid. However,
   there is always some level of uncertainty in the prediction. Many
   applications would benefit from provision of relevant uncertainty
   information along with the forecast. A common means of formulating and
   communicating forecast uncertainty are prediction intervals (PI). In
   this study, various methods for modelling the uncertainty of NWP
   forecasts are investigated and PIs provided for predictions accordingly.
   In particular, the interest is in analysing the historical performance
   of the system as a valuable source of information for uncertainty
   analysis. Various clustering algorithms are employed to group the
   performance records as the first step of the PI determination process.
   In the second step, a range of methods are used to fit appropriate
   probability distributions to errors of each cluster. As a result, PIs
   can be computed dynamically depending on the forecast context. The
   clustering algorithms are applied over different feature sets and
   derived and generated features. All presented PI computation methods are
   empirically evaluated using a comprehensive verification framework in a
   set of experiments involving two real-world data sets of NWP forecasts
   and observations. The proposed evaluation provides a considerably fairer
   and more reliable judgement compared to existing methods. Results show
   that incorporating trained uncertainty model outputs into the NWP point
   predictions provides PI forecasts with higher reliability and skill.
   This can lead to improvement of decision processes for many applications
   that rely on these forecasts.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Banana peel pseudographite (BPPG) offers superb dual functionality for
   sodium ion battery (NIB) and lithium ion battery (LIB) anodes. The
   materials possess low surface areas (19-217 m(2) g(-1)) and a relatively
   high electrode packing density (0.75 g cm(-3) vs similar to 1 g cm(-3)
   for graphite). Tested against Na, BPPG delivers a gravimetric (and
   volumetric) capacity of 355 mAh g(-1) (by active material similar to 700
   mAh cm(-3), by electrode volume similar to 270 mAh cm(-3)) after 10
   cycles at 50 mA g(-1). A nearly flat similar to 200 mAh g(-1) plateau
   that is below 0.1 V and a minimal charge/discharge voltage hysteresis
   make BPPG a direct electrochemical analogue to graphite but with Na. A
   charge capacity of 221 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) degraded by 7\% after
   600 cycles, while a capacity of 336 mAh g(-1) 100 mAg(-1) is degraded by
   11\% after 300 cycles, in both cases with similar to 100\% cycling
   Coulombic efficiency. For LIB applications BPPG offers a gravimetric
   (volumetric) capacity of 1090 mAh g(-1) (by material similar to 2200 mAh
   cm(-3), by electrode similar to 900 mAh cm(-3)) at 50 mA g(-1). The
   reason that BPPG works so well for both NIBs and LIBs is that it
   uniquely contains three essential features: (a) dilated intergraphene
   spacing for Na intercalation at low voltages; (b) highly accessible
   near-surface nanopores for Li metal filling at low voltages; and (c)
   substantial defect content in the graphene planes for U adsorption at
   higher voltages. The <0.1 V charge storage mechanism is fundamentally
   different for Na versus for Li. A combination of XRD and XPS
   demonstrates highly reversible Na intercalation rather than metal
   underpotential deposition. By contrast, the same analysis proves the
   presence of metallic Li in the pores, with intercalation being much less
   pronounced.}},

Abstract = {{Normally chemically inert materials such as Au have been found to be
   catalytically active in the form of particles whose size is about 1 nm.
   Direct and indirect observations of various types of metal nanoparticles
   (NPs) in this size range, under catalytically relevant conditions for
   fuel-cell operation and catalysis, have indicated that such ``small{''}
   particles can exhibit large spontaneous shape fluctuations and
   significant changes in shape and chemical activity in response to
   alterations in environmental conditions. NPs also normally exhibit
   facile coalescence when in proximity, impacting their stability and
   reactivity in applications. We perform molecular dynamics simulations on
   Ni nanoparticles, a commonly used NP in catalytic applications and
   carbon nanotube growth, in the approximate to 1 nm size regime where
   large-scale shape fluctuations have been observed experimentally. An
   analysis of the large-gale shape fluctuations observed in our
   simulations of these ``small{''} NPs indicates that they are accompanied
   by collective motion of Ni atoms through the NP center, and we quantify
   these dynamic structures and their impact on NP shape. In contrast,
   stringlike collective atomic motion is confined to the NP interfacial
   region of NPs having a diameter greater than a few nanometers, and
   correspondingly, the overall NP shape remains roughly spherical, a case
   studied In our prior Ni NP simulations. Evidently, the large spontaneous
   NP shape fluctuations reflect a change in character of the collective
   atomic dynamics when the NPs become critically small in size.}},

Abstract = {{Severe rain events can subject our existing drainage systems to
   capacity. While the conveyance capacity of sewers can be increased by
   temporarily tolerating a full pipe flow condition, the complex dynamics
   of water-air mixture occurring in vertical dropshafts can largely
   restrict the overall conveyance capacity of drainage systems. In this
   study, the hydraulic performance of plunging flow dropshafts is
   investigated experimentally with respect to their conveyance capacity.
   The model dropshaft consisted of an upstream horizontal inflow pipe, a
   vertical circular shaft, and an outflow pipe discharging to the
   atmosphere. Five setups were built with DsDi from 1.0 to 3.0 for the
   range of drop heights H/D-s = 3.0 to 21.0, where D-i is the inlet pipe
   diameter, D-s the shaft diameter, and H the drop height. A wide range of
   discharges up to Q{*} = 25 was tested, where Q{*} = Q/(gD(i)(5))((1/2)).
   Flow patterns recognized within the shaft (free flow, surface roller,
   plug flow, slug flow, and full pipe flow) help to assess the two stages
   of choking: the incipient and fully choked state. Criteria to predict
   choking occurrences were developed experimentally. The flow is
   considered to reach its conveyance capacity when an incipient choking
   state is visible. For a typical dropshaft with D-s/D-i = 2, Q{*} was
   found to be approximately 5.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines stream modification efforts to increase the
   productive capacity of an isolated system of three small lakes in the
   Barrenlands region of Arctic Canada by enhancing system connectivity.
   The lakes' outlet streams were modified to create conditions favourable
   for fish passage and thereby promote migration among the lakes and the
   large lake into which they drain. Gabion step pools (in two streams) and
   a nature-like choke-and-pool structure (in one stream) were installed.
   Two years of post-construction hydraulics data were compared to data
   collected for two years prior to construction to determine the efficacy
   of the various stream modifications. Initial evaluations indicated
   unsuccessful performance of gabion step pools, so after the first year,
   they were retrofitted with boulders to increase flow depth, restrict
   discharge, improve flow duration, and create unimpeded connections
   rather than sudden drops. Variation of lake levels and duration,
   variability, and depth of stream flow indicated that outlet geometry and
   lake catchment area should be important considerations when enhancing
   connectivity for fish migration in ephemeral systems. A narrow,
   rectangular cross-section was deemed effective for increasing flow depth
   while decreasing discharge, resulting in increased duration of flows.
   Catchment area was an effective indicator of a headwater lake's
   potential response to connectivity enhancements. Smaller catchments may
   provide inadequate runoff to sustain minimum storage requirements for
   enhanced connectivity. Our findings should advance the knowledge of
   headwater system hydraulics in the Barrenlands and assist in designing
   future fish habitat compensation projects on similar systems.}},

Abstract = {{Each winter, Canadian municipalities deploy significant capital for snow
   plowing. Any improvements to snowplow operations not only results in
   significant capital savings for municipalities and road agencies, but
   also improves roadway safety and user mobility. In the existing
   research, routing snowplow operations is generally considered a network
   optimization problem; however, the formulations and solutions can be
   very diverse, as each urban area has unique environmental conditions and
   operational constraints. For a specific district and depot, the problem
   is determining a set of routes that ensure that all road links are
   serviced, all operational constraints are satisfied, and total
   operational costs are minimized. This study used a mathematical
   optimization model based on the capacitated arc routing problem (CARP)
   to minimize the total travel distance for snowplow operations in the
   City of Edmonton. Depot location and route number are critical input
   parameters to the operation cost control. Sensitivity analyses were
   conducted to not only derive snowplow routing strategies using the CARP
   methodology, but also draw useful conclusions for winter road
   maintenance planners.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments show the strong water uptake of gas shales which are
   strongly oil-wet based on contact angle measurements.(1,2) Clay
   hydration, microfracture induction, lamination, and osmotic effect are
   collectively responsible for the excess water uptake. However, the
   previous measurements are not sufficient to isolate the above factors
   nor to explain why the bulk of shale samples can hardly imbibe the oil
   which completely spreads on their surface. To answer the remaining
   questions, we measure and compare spontaneous imbibition of oil and
   water into the crushed packs of the similar shales. In contrast to the
   intact samples, the crushed samples consistently imbibe more oil than
   water. The comparative study suggests that the connected pore network of
   the intact samples is water wet while the majority of rock including
   poorly connected pores is oil-wet. This argument is backed by complete
   spreading of oil on fresh surfaces of the rock. In contrast to the
   artificial pores of crushed rock, the existing pores of intact rock are
   already wetted by a film of water and/or covered by precipitated salt,
   which gives the pores a preference for water over oil. Furthermore, the
   presence of salt in the pore space provides an additional force for
   water uptake through an osmotic effect. This argument is backed by the
   observed reduction in shale alteration and water imbibition through
   increasing the salt concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Bromination of oilsands-derived materials was investigated as part of a
   search to find conversion pathways other than traditional
   hydroprocessing and thermal processing for the upgrading of asphaltenes.
   The working hypothesis was that the insertion of a bulky halogen
   substituent on an aromatic carbon of a multinuclear aromatic might
   sterically disrupt pi-pi ring stacking. Mild bromination (1-3 wt \% Br
   incorporation) caused observable changes in the physical appearance of
   bitumen, maltenes, and asphaltenes. The hardness was increased and the
   asphaltenes gained solvent resistance, suggesting potential application
   as pretreatment for road paving asphalt. UV vis spectrometry indicated
   that metalloporphyrin structures were disrupted, suggesting possible
   demetalation. There was also an increased association of oxygenate-rich
   asphaltenes with iron pyrite particulates already present in this
   fraction. Bromination was deleterious in its effect on bitumen and the
   maltenes, resulting in a decrease in straight run vacuum gas oil yield
   and increase in microcarbon residue. Conversely, bromination of
   asphaltenes resulted in an increase in straight run vacuum gas oil yield
   from 2.0 +/- 0.3 wt \% to 7.5 +/- 1.8 wt \% without affecting the
   microcarbon residue. It was not possible to unequivocally attribute the
   observed changes in the asphaltenes to the disruption of pi-pi ring
   stacking.}},

Abstract = {{Coal liquids were produced by solvent extraction of Bienfait lignite at
   415 degrees C and 4 MPa H-2 for 1 h with a hydrotreated coal tar
   distillate in a 2:1 solvent to coal ratio. Detailed characterization was
   performed on four straight-run distillation fractions of the coal
   liquids in the 120-370 degrees C boiling range. It was found that the
   coal liquids contained very little aliphatic material. Most of the
   compounds were aromatics, with aromatic compounds having no alkyl
   substituents dominating the composition. The aromatic carbon content
   increased with boiling fraction from 80 wt \% in the 120-250 degrees C
   fraction to 94 wt \% in the 343-370 degrees C fraction. Major compounds
   identified in the coal liquids were acenaphthene, phenanthrene,
   fluoranthene, and pyrene, which constituted 62 wt \% of the total
   product. The coal liquids also contained heteroatom species.
   Interestingly, the nitrogen content did not monotonically increase with
   an increase in boiling point. The maximum nitrogen content was found in
   the 300-343 degrees C boiling fraction as a result of a high
   concentration of carbazole. The refining pathways for transportation
   fuel production were evaluated. It was found that the naphtha fraction
   could be upgraded to a motor gasoline blending component just by
   hydrotreating. No subsequent catalytic reforming was necessary because
   of the low aliphatic content of the naphtha. The kerosene required
   severe hydrotreating in order to be acceptable as a jet fuel blending
   component, mainly because of the high dinuclear aromatic content of the
   straight-run kerosene. The distillate made a poor feed material for
   diesel fuel and required severe hydrotreating to achieve an acceptable
   cetane number. In general, the coal-derived distillate would benefit
   from ring opening to reduce its density. The prognosis for
   transportation fuel production from the coal liquids was not favorable.
   The production of aromatic chemicals was a better fit with the
   properties of the coal liquids.}},

Abstract = {{Athabasca bitumen and other denser-than-water reservoir fluids are
   coproduced with water or are produced using water or steam injection.
   Organic solvent injection into reservoirs to reduce hydrocarbon resource
   viscosity and hence improve production rates is envisaged. A consequence
   of solvent addition is that the density of the resulting
   hydrocarbon-rich phase can drop below that of the water-rich phase over
   broad ranges of composition, temperature, and pressure. In this
   contribution, densities of Athabasca bitumen from 20 to 200 degrees C at
   0.10, 1.12 and 3.29 MPa, Athabasca bitumen + heptane from 10 to 80
   degrees C at 0.10 MPa and 30 to 140 degrees C at 0.10, 1.11, and 3.29
   MPa and Athabasca bitumen + toluene from 10 to 80 degrees C at 0.10 MPa
   were measured (using an Anton Paar DMA 5000 and an Anton Paar DMA HP)
   and compared with those of pure and produced liquid water from 20 to 200
   degrees C at 0.10, 1.12, and 3.29 MPa. Phase order inversion is shown to
   overlap with envisaged processing conditions for production, transport,
   and refining of denser-than-water reservoir fluids because only low mass
   fractions of solvent are required to cause inversion to occur. The phase
   order inversion envelopes also include compositions that invert twice as
   a function of temperature, and the upper temperature associated with
   phase inversion is a function of pressure. Remote from the critical
   point of added solvents, the phase inversion boundary is shown to be
   well-approximated by the ideal mixing assumption applied to Athabasca
   bitumen + solvent pseudobinary mixtures. The impact of solvent critical
   temperature on the volume of mixing for solvent + oil mixtures is
   discussed. Phase order inversion is a general and readily computed
   phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Phage therapy has been suggested as a potential treatment for highly
   antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as the species of the Burkholderia
   cepacia complex (BCC). To address this hypothesis, experimental B.
   cenocepacia respiratory infections were established in mice using a
   nebulizer and a nose-only inhalation device. Following infection, the
   mice were treated with one of five B. cenocepacia-specific phages
   delivered as either an aerosol or intraperitoneal injection. The
   bacterial and phage titers within the lungs were assayed 2 days after
   treatment, and mice that received the aerosolized phage therapy
   demonstrated significant decreases in bacterial loads. Differences in
   phage activity were observed in vivo. Mice that received phage treatment
   by intraperitoneal injection did not demonstrate significantly reduced
   bacterial loads, although phage particles were isolated from their lung
   tissue. Based on these data, aerosol phage therapy appears to be an
   effective method for treating highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial
   respiratory infections, including those caused by BCC bacteria.}},

Title = {{Evolution of the crane selection and on-site utilization process for
   modular construction multilifts}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},

Abstract = {{Modular construction technology has been used in building construction
   for decades, having been widely utilized on sites with high traffic
   volume, restricted accessibility/storage, or business operations which
   cannot be interrupted by long construction time. A key challenge in this
   method of construction lies in planning and executing lifts within a
   short timeframe. In this regard, proper crane selection and site layout
   optimization can significantly increase productivity and shorten the
   lifting schedule. This paper thus proposes a methodology for the crane
   selection process and introduces mathematical algorithms to assess the
   construction of multi-lift operations. The modular lift process is
   divided into three stages: crane load and capacity check, crane
   location, and boom and superlift clearance. Each stage's parameters are
   introduced, analyzed, and graphically explained. The methodology logic
   is supported by a generalized mathematical algorithm and is applied and
   tested on a case study involving the construction of five three-storey
   dormitories in 10 working days for Muhlenberg College in Allentown,
   Pennsylvania. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deep tissue injuries are subcutaneous regions of tissue breakdown
   associated with excessive mechanical pressure for extended period of
   time. These wounds are currently clinically undetectable in their early
   stages and result in severe burdens on not only the patients who suffer
   from them, but the health care system as well. The goal of this work was
   to numerically characterize the use of quasi-static ultrasound
   elastography for detecting formative and progressive deep tissue
   injuries. In order to numerically characterize the technique,
   finite-element models of sonographic B-mode imaging and tissue
   deformation were created. These models were fed into a local
   strain-estimation algorithm to determine the detection sensitivity of
   the technique on various parameters. Our work showed that quasi-static
   ultrasound elastography was able to detect and characterize deep tissue
   injuries over a range of lesion parameters. Simulations were validated
   using a physical phantom model. This work represents a step along the
   path to developing a clinically relevant technique for detecting and
   diagnosing early deep tissue injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Using wavelet analysis, wavelet-based principal component analysis
   (WPCA), composite analysis and scale-averaged wavelet power (SAWP) of
   seasonal precipitation, we investigated their spatiotemporal
   variability, their relationships with seven large-scale climate indices
   and atmospheric circulation patterns, sea surface temperature (SST) of
   the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and the predictability of Alberta's
   seasonal precipitation. June-August (JJA) precipitation showed
   statistically significant oscillations at about 16-20 year, while
   September-November (SON) precipitation at about 4-8 year time scale.
   Plots showing clusters of annular contour lines for positive and
   negative Morlet wavelet coefficients, respectively represent cycles of
   abundant and sparse seasonal precipitation that had occurred over
   1900-2011. Wavelet power spectrum plots show that seasonal climate
   indices and principal component (PC1) of precipitation anomalies
   exhibited dominant oscillations that appeared and disappeared in an
   unpredictable manner. Wavelet coherence analysis shows that Alberta's
   precipitation had been linked more to Nino3, Pacific decadal Oscillation
   (PDO) and Pacific/North American (PNA) than other climate indices, and
   in the 8-25 year than inter-annual time scales. Similar results are
   found from Pearson's correlation between PC1 of band-passed, zero to
   three seasonal lags, of Alberta's seasonal precipitation and climate
   anomalies. Aggregate composites of Alberta's December-February (DJF)
   precipitation showed that the influences of El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO), PDO and PNA had been stronger in southern than in northern
   Alberta. El Nino (La Nina), warm PDO (cool PDO) and high PNA (low PNA)
   are associated mainly with sparse and abundant DJF precipitation of
   southern Alberta. Prevalent atmospheric circulation patterns provide
   physical explanations on the effects of climate anomaly on the DJF
   precipitation revealed by the composite analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a hardware implementation of an image processing
   algorithm for blood type determination. The image processing technique
   proposed in this paper uses the appearance of agglutination to determine
   blood type by detecting edges and contrast within the agglutinated
   sample. An FPGA implementation and parallel processing algorithms are
   used in conjugation with image processing techniques to make this system
   reliable for the characterization of large numbers of blood samples. The
   program was developed using Matlab software then transferred and
   implemented on a Vertex 6 FPGA from Xilinx employing ISE software.
   Hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm on FPGA demonstrates a
   power consumption of 770 mW from a 2.5 V power supply. Blood type
   characterization using our FPGA implementation requires only 6.6 s,
   while a desktop computer-based algorithm with Matlab implementation on a
   Pentium 4 processor with a 3 GHz clock takes 90 s. The presented device
   is faster, more portable, less expensive, and consumes less power than
   conventional instruments. The proposed hardware solution achieved
   accuracy of 99.5\% when tested with over 500 different blood samples.

Abstract = {{Microgrids have gained a lot of interest under the smart grid vision
   demanding systematic procedures for their optimal construction and
   performance enhancement. By defining a new probabilistic index, this
   paper presents approaches for clustering active distribution systems
   into a set of microgrids with optimized reliability and supply-adequacy
   indices. After proposing two different methods for optimally designing
   the microgrids, as two corrective actions to improve the defined index,
   the advantages of installing distributed reactive sources (DRSs) and
   distributed energy storage resources (DESRs) are investigated. The
   problem formulation and solution algorithms are presented in this paper.
   The well-known PG\&E 69-bus distribution system is selected as a test
   case and through several sensitivity studies, the robustness of the
   design and the effect of interconnecting different amounts of DRSs' and
   DESRs' capacities on the defined index are investigated. It is found
   that by properly designing the system and integrating the DRSs and
   DESRs, the index can be improved from 23\% in the base system without
   distributed generators (DGs) to 77\% in the basic microgrid design with
   distributed generators and to 93\% considering all resources.}},

   To solve this complicated combinatorial, non-differentiable constrained

   measured; algorithms to compute the conductor currents based on the
   magnetic fields measured; a simple, integrated sensor calibration and
   communication scheme. Prototype devices have been developed based on the
   technique. Extensive lab and field tests have demonstrated that the

Abstract = {{Protein-carbohydrate interactions are involved in a wide variety of
   cellular recognition processes including cell growth regulation,
   differentiation and adhesion, the immune response, and viral or
   bacterial infections. A common way for bacteria to achieve adhesion is
   through their fimbriae which possess cellular lectins that can bind to
   complementary carbohydrates on the surface of the host tissues. In this
   work, we synthesized glycopolymers using reversible addition
   fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization which were
   subsequently immobilized on a sensor surface for studies of bacterial
   adhesion by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D).
   Ricinus communis Agglutinin (RCA(120)), a galactose specific lectin, was
   first studied by QCM-D to determine the specific lectin interactions to
   the different glycopolymers-treated surfaces. Subsequently, Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa PAO1 (a Gram-negative bacterium with galactose-specific
   binding C-type lectin (PA-IL)) and Escherichia coli K-12 (a
   Gram-negative bacterium with mannose-specific binding lectin) were then
   used as model bacteria to study bacterial adhesion mechanisms on
   different polymer-treated sensor surfaces by the coupled resonance
   theory. Our results showed that lectin carbohydrate interactions play
   significant roles in comparison to the nonspecific interactions, such as
   electrostatic interactions. A significantly higher amount of P.
   aeruginosa PAO1 could adhere on the glycopolymer surface with strong
   contact point stiffness as compared to E. coli K-12 on the same surface.
   Furthermore, in comparison to E. coli K-12, the adhesion of P.
   aeruginosa PAD 1 to the glycopolymers was found to be highly dependent
   on the presence of calcium ions due to the specific C-type lectin
   interactions of PA-IL, and also the enhanced bacterial adhesion is
   attributed to the stiffer glycopolymer surface in higher ionic strength
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal temperature variations exist in a compost pile.
   This study demonstrates that systematic temperature sampling of a
   compost pile, as is widely done, tends to underestimate these
   variations, which in turn may lead to false conclusions about the
   sanitary condition of the final product. To address these variations, a
   proper scheme of temperature sampling needs to be used. A comparison of
   the results from 21 temperature data loggers randomly introduced into a
   compost pile with those from 20 systematically introduced data loggers
   showed that the mean, maximum and minimum temperatures in both methods
   were very similar in their magnitudes. Overall, greater temperature
   variation was captured using the random method. In addition, 95\% of the
   probes introduced systematically had attained thermophilic sanitation
   conditions (>= 55 degrees C for three consecutive days), as compared to
   76\% from the group that were randomly introduced. Furthermore, it was
   found that, from a statistical standpoint, readings from at least 47
   randomly introduced temperature loggers are necessary to capture the
   observed temperature variation. Lastly, the turning of the compost pile
   was found to increase the chance that any random particle would be
   exposed to the temperature >= 55 degrees C for three consecutive days.
   One turning was done during the study, and it increased the probability
   from 76\% to nearly 85\%. Using the Markov chain model it was calculated
   that if five turnings had been implemented on the evaluated technology,
   the likelihood that every particle would experience the required
   time-temperature condition would be 98\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to obtain a correlation that

   Experiments were conducted using steady inhalation air flow rates to
   measure the deposition of monodisperse particles with diameters of
   3.5-5.5 mu m in replicas of the upper tracheobronchial airways of 11
   children aged 2-8 years. The total deposition of particles was measured
   in each replica using gravimetry. Validation was performed by also
   measuring deposition in five adult replicas and the Alberta Idealized
   Throat and comparing with existing published data. Although there is
   considerable intersubject variability in our data, the empirical
   correlation of Chan \& Lippmann (1980) was found to predict total
   deposition reasonably well in all of our adult and child replicas. (C)

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study is to understand the effect of altitude on the
   performance of selected pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) and
   dry powder inhalers (DPIs). A testing apparatus that created consistent
   breath profiles through the Alberta Idealized Throat was designed to
   test five pMDIs and two DPIs at altitudes of 670, 2450, 3260, and 4300
   m. Both gravimetric and chemical assays were conducted to determine the
   in vitro lung dose. Additionally, spray duration and shot weight for
   pMDIs and device resistance for DPI were measured. There was no
   significant change in in vitro lung dose for any of the pMDIs tested.
   Shot weight and spray duration were unaffected. The device resistance of
   the DPIs decreased with increasing altitude and was successfully modeled
   as a function of ambient pressure. The in vitro lung dose of both DPIs
   showed no significant change when operated with an inhaler pressure drop
   of 4 kPa, but for the Bricanyl (R) Turbuhaler (R), a significant
   decrease occurred when matching the volumetric inspiratory flow rate to
   that of the baseline altitude. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the

Abstract = {{Crack initiation in uniaxial compressive loading of rocks occurs well
   before the peak strength is reached. The factors that may influence the
   onset of cracking and possible initiating mechanisms were explored using
   a discrete element numerical approach. The numerical approach was based
   on grain-based model that utilized the Voronoi tessellation scheme to
   represent low porosity crystalline rocks such as granite. The effect of
   grain size distribution (sorting coefficient ranging from 1.5 to 1.03),
   grain size (average grain size ranging from 0.75 to 2.25 mm), and the
   heterogeneities of different mineral grains (quartz, K-feldspar,
   plagioclase) on the onset of cracking were examined. The modelling
   revealed that crack initiation appears to be a tensile mechanism in low
   porosity rocks, and that shear cracking along grain boundaries is only a
   prominent mechanism near the peak strength. It was also shown that the
   heterogeneity introduced by the grain size distribution had the most
   significant effect on peak strength and crack initiation stress. The
   peak strength ranges from 140 to 208 MPa as the grain size distribution
   varies from heterogeneous to uniform, respectively. However, the ratio
   of crack initiation to peak stress showed only minor variation, as the
   heterogeneity decreases. The other factors investigated had only minor
   effects on crack initiation and peak strength, and crack initiation
   ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the treatment of oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW) using a fluidized bed biofilm reactor (FBBR) with granular
   activated carbon (GAC) as support media. The bioreactor was operated for
   120 days at different organic and hydraulic loading rates. The combined
   GAC adsorption and biodegradation process removed 51\% of chemical
   oxygen demand (COD), 56\% of acid-extractable fraction (AEF) and 96\% of
   classical naphthenic acids (NAs) under optimized operational conditions.
   Bioreactor treatment efficiencies were dependent on the organic loading
   rate (OLR), and to a lower degree, on the hydraulic loading rate (HLR).
   Further ultra performance liquid chromatography/high resolution mass
   spectroscopy (UPLCIHRMS) analysis showed that the removal of classical
   NAs increased as the carbon number increased. Compared with planktonic
   bacterial community in OSPW, more diverse microbial structures were
   found in biofilms colonized on the surface of GAC after 120-day
   treatment, with various carbon degraders namely Polaromonas jejuensis,
   Algoriphagus sp., Chelatococcus sp. and Methylobacterium fujisawaense in
   the GAC-biofilm reactor. The results of this study, therefore, showed
   that the GAC-biofilm seems to be a promising biological treatment method

Abstract = {{The Scholander-Hammel pressure chamber has been used in thousands of
   papers to measure osmotic pressure, c, turgor pressure, Pt, and bulk
   modulus of elasticity, epsilon, of leaf cells by pressure-volume (PV)
   curve analysis. PV analysis has been questioned in the past. In this
   paper we use micromechanical analysis of leaf cells to examine the
   impact on PV curve analysis of negative turgor in living cells (Pt).
   Models predict negative Pt (-0.1 to -1.8MPa) depending on leaf cell size
   and shape in agreement with experimental values reported by J. J.
   Oertli. Modeled PV curves have linear regions even when Pt is quite
   negative, contrary to the arguments of M.T. Tyree. Negative Pt is
   totally missed by PV curve analysis and results in large errors in
   derived c and Pt but smaller errors in epsilon. A survey of leaf cell
   sizes vs habitat (arid, temperate, and rainforest), suggests that the
   majority of published PV curves result in errors of 0.1-1.8MPa in
   derived c and Pt, whereby the error increases with decreasing cell size.
   We propose that small cell size in leaves is an ecological adaptation
   that permits plants to endure negative values of water potential with
   relatively little water loss.}},

Abstract = {{Based on finite element simulation, the present work studies free
   vibration of a microtubule surrounded by 3D randomly distributed cross
   linkers in living cells. A basic result of the present work is that
   transverse vibration modes associated with the lowest frequencies are
   highly localized, in sharp contrast to the through-length modes
   predicted by the commonly used classic elastic foundation model. Our
   simulations show that the deflected length of localized modes increases
   with increasing frequency and approaches the entire length of
   microtubule when frequency approaches the minimum classic frequency
   given by the elastic foundation model. In particular, unlike the
   length-sensitive classic frequencies predicted by the elastic foundation
   model, the lowest frequencies of localized modes predicted by the
   present model are insensitive to the length of microtubules and are at
   least 50\% lower than the minimum classic frequency for infinitely long
   microtubules and could be one order of magnitude lower than the minimum
   classic frequency for shorter microtubules (only a few microns in
   length). These results suggest that the existing elastic foundation
   model may have overestimated the lowest frequencies of microtubules in
   vivo. Finally, based on our simulation results, some empirical relations
   are proposed for the critical (lowest) frequency of localized modes and
   the associated wave length. Compared to the classic elastic foundation
   model, the localized vibration modes and the associated wave lengths
   predicted by the present model are in better agreement with some known
   experimental observations.}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{Hot water from the Maim limestone formation in the central part of the
   South German Molasse Basin is utilized by a number of geothermal power
   plants. However, in the low permeability western part of the basin
   geothermal systems need to be engineered in order to become commercial
   prospects. This study investigates the potential productivity increase
   resulting from hydraulic stimulation treatments for reservoir conditions
   typically found in the western part of the basin using commercial
   hydraulic fracturing software which is routinely used in the hydrocarbon
   industry and in addition an open source reservoir simulator. The focus
   of this study is to evaluate the possible dimensions of generated
   tensile fractures for different reservoir and stimulation parameters and
   to show their potential to increase the productivity of an exemplary
   well in that region. One single stimulation treatment does not lead to
   an economic productivity increase. The most promising ways to stimulate
   the considered low permeability well sufficiently for geothermal power
   production are (1) to connect the well to a higher permeable damage zone
   around a major fault and (2) to perform multiple stimulation treatments.
   Water circulation through a second well (injection well) additionally
   increases the productivity of the production well. Under favorable
   conditions less than 10 parallel hydraulic fractures need to be
   developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Toward an understanding of the impact of production pressure on safety

Abstract = {{It is not unusual to observe that actual schedule and quality
   performances are different from planned performances (e.g., schedule
   delay and rework) during a construction project. Such differences often
   result in production pressure (e.g., being pressed to work faster).
   Previous studies demonstrated that such production pressure negatively
   affects safety performance. However, the process by which production
   pressure influences safety performance, and to what extent, has not been
   fully investigated. As a result, the impact of production pressure has
   not been incorporated much into safety management in practice. In an
   effort to address this issue, this paper examines how production
   pressure relates to safety performance over time by identifying their
   feedback processes. A conceptual causal loop diagram is created to
   identify the relationship between schedule and quality performances
   (e.g., schedule delays and rework) and the components related to a
   safety program (e.g., workers' perceptions of safety, safety training,
   safety supervision, and crew size). A case study is then experimentally
   undertaken to investigate this relationship with accident occurrence
   with the use of data collected from a construction site; the case study
   is used to build a System Dynamics (SD) model. The SD model, then, is
   validated through inequality statistics analysis. Sensitivity analysis
   and statistical screening techniques further permit an evaluation of the
   impact of the managerial components on accident occurrence. The results
   of the case study indicate that schedule delays and rework are the
   critical factors affecting accident occurrence for the monitored
   project. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A polymer coating was developed to enable the sensing of naphthenic acid
   (a hydrocarbon contaminant found in oil sands process affected water)
   using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). Previous research on
   QCM-based hydrocarbon sensors has focused on developing polymer coatings
   to sense non-polarhydrocarbons, rather than polar organic acids such as
   naphthenic acid. To detect a naphthenic acid model compound
   (4-methyl-cyclohexane acetic acid, MCAA), a polybutadiene thin film
   surface was modified with amine functional groups through a facile
   two-step process: hydroxides were generated on the surface of the
   polymer and subsequently used as sites for reaction with amino silanes.
   The attachment of amino groups was characterized by X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. QCM measurements revealed that polybutadiene thin films
   modified with amino groups exhibited much higher sensitivity to MCAA
   than unmodified films. After amine modification, frequency shifts of 56
   Hz were measured with exposure to 100 ppm MCAA, compared with only 8 Hz
   for an unmodified polybutadiene film. The QCM response was fast with
   stable readings achieved within 5 min of the sensor being exposed to a
   particular solution, and a linear relationship between frequency change
   and MCAA concentration was obtained. The responsivity of the system was
   also tested in various buffer solutions to determine how variations in
   both pH and salinity affected the measurements. To both investigate the
   applicability of this surface treatment and to elucidate the mechanism
   by which the amine group increased the responsivity of the film, the
   application of amine functional groups to other polymers and SiO2 was
   examined. Both the modification with the amino group and the properties
   of the hydrophobic polymers themselves were found to impact the QCM
   sensor performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   with the aim of using the drug for in-vivo radiotherapy. The inclusion
   of PEG was found to significantly prolong the half-life period, where
   PEG-Glu-GNPs achieved 6.17 +/- 3.71 h, compared to 1.23 +/- 0.14 h for
   Glu-GNPs and 1.07 +/- 0.22 h for uncoated GNPs. Our data indicates that
   nanoparticle size impacts cell uptake performance, with 20 nm being the
   optimal diameter for cancer treatment applications. Although
   PEG-Glu-GNPs mainly distributed in the spleen, liver, lung, and kidneys,
   the concentration of PEG-Glu-GNPs in tumour tissue was 20 times higher
   than healthy cells in the uterus and ovaries, reaching 9.22 +/- 2.41 mu
   g/g cancer tissue at 48 h after injection. This difference in uptake
   holds promise for selective tumor targeting which can in turn lead to
   more effective radiotherapy through the interaction of X-rays and GNPs.
   Specifically tumor size after 47 days of treatment had reduced to (769
   +/- 92) mm(3) compared to (1432 +/- 269) mm(3) using X-rays alone and
   (3514 +/- 1818) mm(3) without any treatment. Moreover, the mice remained
   healthy without statistically significant weight loss. Results of our
   pharmacokinetic and bio-distribution study as well as therapeutic data
   for PEG-Glu-GNPs in our tumor bearing animal model demonstrate that
   PEG-Glu-GNPs provide excellent in-vivo stability, tumor targeting
   function, and radiotherapeutic enhancement effects, providing useful
   insights for further clinical studies.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions among the parallel grid-connected converters coupled
   through the grid impedance tend to result in stability and power quality
   problems. To address them, this paper proposes an active damper based on
   a high bandwidth power electronics converter. The general idea behind
   this proposal is to dynamically reshape the grid impedance profile seen
   from the point of common coupling of the converters, such that the
   potential oscillations and resonance propagation in the parallel
   grid-connected converters can be mitigated. To validate the
   effectiveness of the active damper, simulations and experimental tests
   on a three-converter-based setup are carried out. The results show that
   the active damper can become a promising way to stabilize the
   power-electronics-based ac power systems.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{To mitigate the line current harmonics of a high-power current source
   rectifier (CSR) system, the selective harmonic elimination (SHE) scheme
   is frequently used due to its low switching frequency and superior
   harmonic performance. However, the SHE scheme only focuses on the
   harmonics generated by the converter itself. It cannot cope with the
   line current harmonics caused by the background grid voltage harmonics.
   In this paper, a selective harmonic compensation scheme using the
   virtual impedance concept (VI-SHC) is presented. This method compensates
   for the preexisting grid background harmonics using only the line
   current measurement, and provides superior line current harmonic
   performance. The proposed method does not require measuring the grid
   voltage harmonics (which are typically low), does not rely on an
   accurate CSR system model, and therefore is very robust for practical
   implementation. This PWM control scheme has been verified by real-time
   experiments on a CSR prototype.}},

   nonlinearities, including hysteresis phenomena, is carried out based on
   the Preisach theory. The nonlinear solution in real time is undertaken
   using a full Newton iteration. All the hardware modules for the
   transformer emulation were developed in VHDL. The model is fully
   parallelized and pipelined to achieve the lowest latency and the
   smallest hardware resource consumption. Real-time results on the

Abstract = {{The limbic system is presumed to have a central role in cognitive
   performance, in particular memory. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the relationship between limbic white matter microstructure
   and neuropsychological function in temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients
   using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Twenty-one adult TLE patients,
   including 7 non-lesional (nITLE) and 14 with unilateral mesial temporal
   sclerosis (uTLE), were studied with both DTI and hippocampal T2
   relaxometry. Correlations were performed between fractional anisotropy
   (FA) of the bilateral fornix and cingulum, hippocampal T2,
   neuropsychological tests. Positive correlations were observed in the
   whole group for the left fornix and processing speed index. In contrast,
   memory tests did not show significant correlations with DTI findings.
   Subgroup analysis demonstrated an association between the left fornix
   and processing speed in nITLE but not uTLE. No correlations were
   observed between hippocampalT2 and test scores in either the TLE group
   as a whole or after subgroup analysis. Our findings suggest that
   integrity of the left fornix specifically is an important anatomical
   correlate of cognitive function in TLE patients, in particular patients
   with nITLE.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we developed and optimized a technique to produce a
   thin, stable silane layer on silicon substrate in a controlled
   environment using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). The effect of
   APTES concentration and silanization time on the formation of silane
   layer is studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Biomolecules of interest are immobilized
   on optimized silane layer formed silicon substrates using glutaraldehyde
   linker. Surface analytical techniques such as ellipsometry, FTIR,
   contact angle measurement system, and atomic force microscopy are
   employed to characterize the bio-chemically modified silicon surfaces at
   each step of the biomolecule immobilization process. It is observed that
   a uniform, homogenous and highly dense layer of biomolecules are
   immobilized with optimized silane layer on the silicon substrate. The
   developed immobilization method is successfully implemented on different
   silicon substrates (flat and pillar). Also, different types of
   biomolecules such as anti-human IgG (rabbit monoclonal to human IgG),
   Listeria monocytogenes, myoglobin and dengue capture antibodies were
   successfully immobilized. Further, standard sandwich immunoassay
   (antibody-antigen-antibody) is employed on respective capture antibody
   coated silicon substrates. Fluorescence microscopy is used to detect the
   respective FITC tagged detection antibodies bound to the surface after
   immunoassay. C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   presence of these lipid-modified PEIs was calculated using the weighted

   found to enhance the stability of DNA aggregation in the case of long
   lipids (LA and OA) but reduce the stability in the case of a short lipid
   (CA). In addition, LA-substituted PEI was shown to form stronger DNA
   aggregate than OA-substituted PEI, which correlates positively with

Abstract = {{A novel micropipet technique was developed to quantify the dewetting
   dynamics of individual microsphere particles by emulsified viscous crude
   oil drops in aqueous media. This technique allowed dynamic microscale
   receding contact angles of water to be measured in situ for solid oil
   water systems. System parameters, including modification of glass
   microspheres and characteristics of oil drops, were varied to study
   their effect on dewetting dynamics of the systems. Increasing solvent
   dosage in viscous oil was found to decrease static receding contact
   angle of water for clean and bitumen-treated glass surfaces, but showed
   a negligible effect on static receding contact angle for ethyl cellulose
   (EC)-treated glass surface. Interestingly, dynamic dewetting behavior
   exhibited a strong dependence on surface modification and the addition
   of solvent to viscous oil. No dewetting dynamics was observed for clean
   hydrophilic glass surface. For bitumen- or EC-treated glass surfaces,
   more rapid dewetting dynamics of water were determined with increasing
   addition of solvent to viscous oil. Both de Gennes viscous dissipation
   hydrodynamic and the Blake/Haynes molecular-kinetic models were
   developed for the current system to understand the observed dynamic

Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{We give a detailed account of equilibrium and non-equilibrium
   fluctuational electrodynamics of hyperbolic metamaterials. We show the
   unifying aspects of two different approaches; one utilizes the second
   kind of fluctuation dissipation theorem and the other makes use of the
   scattering method. We analyze the near-field of hyperbolic media at
   finite temperatures and show that the lack of spatial coherence can be
   attributed to the multi-modal nature of super-Planckian thermal
   emission. We also adopt the analysis to phonon-polaritonic super-lattice
   metamaterials and describe the regimes suitable for experimental
   verification of our predicted effects. The results reveal that far-field
   thermal emission spectra are dominated by epsilon-near-zero and
   epsilon-near-pole responses as expected from Kirchoff's laws. Our work
   should aid both theorists and experimentalists to study complex media
   and engineer equilibrium and non-equilibrium fluctuations for
   applications in thermal photonics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Channel cracks in atomic-layer and molecular-layer deposited multilayer
   thin film coatings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Metal oxide thin film coatings produced by atomic layer deposition have
   been shown to be an effective permeation barrier. The primary failure
   mode of such coatings under tensile loads is the propagation of channel
   cracks that penetrate vertically into the coating films. Recently,
   multi-layer structures that combine the metal oxide material with
   relatively soft polymeric layers produced by molecular layer deposition
   have been proposed to create composite thin films with desired
   properties, including potentially enhanced resistance to fracture. In
   this paper, we study the effects of layer geometry and material
   properties on the critical strain for channel crack propagation in the
   multi-layer composite films. Using finite element simulations and a
   thin-film fracture mechanics formalism, we show that if the fracture
   energy of the polymeric layer is lower than that of the metal oxide
   layer, the channel crack tends to penetrate through the entire composite
   film, and dividing the metal oxide and polymeric materials into thinner
   layers leads to a smaller critical strain. However, if the fracture
   energy of the polymeric material is high so that cracks only run through
   the metal oxide layers, more layers can result in a larger critical
   strain. For intermediate fracture energy of the polymer material, we
   developed a design map that identifies the optimal structure for given
   fracture energies and thicknesses of the metal oxide and polymeric
   layers. These results can facilitate the design of mechanically robust
   permeation barriers, an important component for the development of
   flexible electronics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Metalloporphyrins are ubiquitous in nature, particularly iron porphyrins
   (hemes) and magnesium dihydroporphyrins or chlorophylls. Oxovanadium
   (IV) complexes of alkyl porphyrins are widely distributed in petroleum,

   vanadium compounds in Venezuela Orinoco heavy crude oil detected by
   Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS).
   These compounds likely have the main structure of porphyrin, with the
   addition of more aromatic rings, thiophene and amino functional groups,
   corresponding to molecular series of CnH2n-40N4V1O1 (36 <= n <= 58),

Abstract = {{Adsorption of asphaltenes at the water oil interface contributes to the
   stability of petroleum emulsions by forming a networked film that can
   hinder drop drop coalescence. The interfacial microstructure can either
   be liquid-like or solid-like, depending on (i) initial bulk
   concentration of asphaltenes, (ii) interfacial aging time, and (iii)
   solvent aromaticity. Two techniques interfacial shear rheology and
   integrated thin film drainage apparatus provided equivalent interface
   aging conditions, enabling direct correlation of the interfacial
   rheology and droplet stability. The shear rheological properties of the
   asphaltene film were found to be critical to the stability of contacting
   drops. With a viscous dominant interfacial microstructure, the
   coalescence time for two drops in intimate contact was rapid, on the
   order of seconds. However, as the elastic contribution develops and the
   film microstructure begins to be dominated by elasticity, the two drops
   in contact do not coalescence. Such step-change transition in
   coalescence is thought to be related to the high shear yield stress
   (similar to 10(4) Pa), which is a function of the film shear yield point
   and the film thickness (as measured by quartz crystal microbalance), and
   the increased elastic stiffness of the film that prevents mobility and
   rupture of the asphaltene film, which when in a solid-like state
   provides an energy barrier against drop coalescence.}},

   gene expression in xenograft tumors}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{Photoacoustic imaging is an emerging hybrid imaging technology capable
   of breaking through resolution limits of pure optical imaging
   technologies imposed by optical-scattering to provide fine-resolution
   optical contrast information in deep tissues. We demonstrate the ability
   of multi-wavelength photoacoustic imaging to estimate relative gene
   expression distributions using an inducible expression system and
   co-register images with hemoglobin oxygen saturation estimates and
   micro-ultrasound data. Tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin
   production, is used as a reporter gene owing to its strong optical
   absorption and enzymatic amplification mechanism. Tetracycline-inducible
   melanin expression is turned on via doxycycline treatment in vivo.
   Serial multi-wavelength imaging reveals very low estimated melanin
   expression in tumors prior to doxycycline treatment or in tumors with no
   tyrosinase gene present, but strong signals after melanin induction in
   tumors tagged with the tyrosinase reporter. The combination of new
   inducible reporters and high-resolution photoacoustic and

Title = {{Removal of organic compounds and trace metals from oil sands

Abstract = {{The oil production generates large volumes of oil sands process-affected
   water (OSPW), referring to the water that has been in contact with oil
   sands or released from tailings deposits. There are concerns about the
   environmental impacts of the release of OSPW because of its toxicity.
   Zero valent iron alone (ZVI) and in combination with petroleum coke
   (CZVI) were investigated as environmentally friendly treatment processes
   for the removal of naphthenic acids (NAs), acid-extractable fraction
   (AEF), fluorophore organic compounds, and trace metals from OSPW. While
   the application of 25 g/L ZVI to OSPW resulted in 58.4\% removal of NAs
   in the presence of oxygen, the addition of 25 g petroleum coke (PC) as
   an electron conductor enhanced the NAs removal up to 90.9\%. The
   increase in ZVI concentration enhanced the removals of NAs, AEF, and
   fluorophore compounds from OSPW. It was suggested that the electrons
   generated from the oxidation of ZVI were transferred to oxygen,
   resulting in the production of hydroxyl radicals and oxidation of NAs.
   When OSPW was de-oxygenated, the NAs removal decreased to 17.5\% and
   65.4\% during treatment with ZVI and CZVI, respectively. The removal of
   metals in ZVI samples was similar to that obtained during CZVI
   treatment. Although an increase in ZVI concentration did not enhance the
   removal of metals, their concentrations effectively decreased at all ZVI
   loadings. The Microtox (R) bioassay with Vibrio fischeri showed a
   decrease in the toxicity of ZVI- and CZVI-treated OSPW. The results
   obtained in this study showed that the application of ZVI in combination
   with PC is a promising technology for OSPW treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{The modeling of time series based on fuzzy information granules}},

Abstract = {{A lot of research has resulted in many time series models with high
   precision forecasting realized at the numerical level. However, in the
   real world, higher numerical precision may not be necessary for the
   perception, reasoning and decision-making of human. Model of time series
   with an ability of humans to perceive and process abstract entities
   (rather than numeric entities) is more adaptable for some problems of
   decision-making, With this regard, information granules and granular
   computing play a primordial role. Fox example, if change range
   (intervals) of stock prices for a certain period in the future is
   regarded as information granule, constructing model that can forecast
   change ranges (intervals) of stock prices for a period in the future is
   better able to help stock investors make reasonable decisions in
   comparison with those based upon specific forecasting numerical value of
   stock price. In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach to
   realize interval prediction, in which the idea of information granules
   and granular computing is integrated with the classical Chen's method.
   The proposed method is to segment an original numeric time series into a
   collection of time windows first, and then build fuzzy granules
   expressed as a certain fuzzy set over each time windows by exploiting
   the principle of justifiable granularity. Finally, fuzzy granular model
   can be constructed by mining fuzzy logical relationships of adjacent
   granules. The constructed model can carry out interval prediction by
   degranulation operation. Two benchmark time series are used to validate
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The obtained
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. Besides, for
   modeling and prediction of large-scale time series, the proposed
   approach exhibit a clear advantage of reducing computation overhead of
   modeling and simplifying forecasting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   The as-prepared Fe3O4@PDA-Ag microspheres also show high cyclic
   stability (>27 cycles), good acid stability, and fast regeneration
   ability, which can be achieved efficiently within several minutes by
   using NaBH, as the desorption agent, showing great potentials in a wide

Title = {{Interplay Between the Oxidoreductase PDIA6 and microRNA-322 Controls the
   Response to Disrupted Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Homeostasis}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{329}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{The disruption of the energy or nutrient balance triggers endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER) stress, a process that mobilizes various strategies,
   collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR), which
   reestablish homeostasis of the ER and cell. Activation of the UPR stress
   sensor IRE1 alpha (inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha) stimulates its
   endoribonuclease activity, leading to the generation of the mRNA
   encoding the transcription factor XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), which
   regulates the transcription of genes encoding factors involved in
   controlling the quality and folding of proteins. We found that the
   activity of IRE1 alpha was regulated by the ER oxidoreductase PDIA6
   (protein disulfide isomerase A6) and the microRNA miR-322 in response to
   disruption of ER Ca2+ homeostasis. PDIA6 interacted with IRE1 alpha and
   enhanced IRE1 alpha activity as monitored by phosphorylation of IRE1
   alpha and XBP1 mRNA splicing, but PDIA6 did not substantially affect the
   activity of other pathways that mediate responses to ER stress. ER Ca2+
   depletion and activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry reduced the
   abundance of the microRNA miR-322, which increased PDIA6 mRNA stability
   and, consequently, IRE1 alpha activity during the ER stress response. In
   vivo experiments with mice and worms showed that the induction of ER
   stress correlated with decreased miR-322 abundance, increased PDIA6 mRNA
   abundance, or both. Together, these findings demonstrated that ER Ca2+,
   PDIA6, IRE1 alpha, and miR-322 function in a dynamic feedback loop
   modulating the UPR under conditions of disrupted ER Ca2+ homeostasis.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we systematically evaluate vacuum swing adsorption (VSA)
   processes for the kinetic separation of CO2/N-2 from dry postcombustion
   flue gas on carbon molecular sieve by performing rigorous optimization.
   The synthesized VSA configurations are assessed first for their ability
   to produce high purity of CO2 at high recovery. A one-stage heavy reflux
   cycle and a two-stage process with an enriching VSA followed by a
   polishing VSA, both operated as basic four-step cycles with light
   product pressurization, are able to meet the purity-recovery
   constraints. These configurations are then optimized to minimize energy
   consumption and maximize productivity, and their energy-productivity
   Paretos are compared. General guidelines for purity-recovery targets in
   the first stage of a two-stage process are also discussed. The analysis
   also shows that the performance of zeolite 13X is superior to carbon
   molecular sieve.}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature thermal gradient interaction chromatography (HT-TGIC)
   was recently introduced into the area of polyolefin analysis. This new
   technique uses commercially available Hybercarb columns to separate
   polyolefin chains based on their interaction with the porous graphitic
   carbon stationary phase in a temperature gradient mode. In this paper, a
   systematic study of HT-TGIC operation conditions is presented for
   ethylene/1-octene copolymers and their blends. One of the objectives of
   this investigation is to identify the best set of conditions that
   maximize peak separation of copolymers in a binary blend. Although the
   chromatograms of individual resins and their blends are independent of
   the cooling rate, it will be shown that sample volume (column loading)
   and heating rate during the elution cycle affect the peak separation of
   the components in binary blends.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic detection of oscillatory variables in the presence of multiple
   oscillations is still a challenging problem in the literature, despite
   the fact that there are several methods for detection and estimation of

   estimate the oscillation periods in the presence of multiple
   oscillations. The advantage of the developed method is that it requires
   no or little human interference in the detection process. It is also
   capable of estimation of the decay rate for decaying oscillations and is
   advantageous over methods based on analyzing the power spectrum for
   oscillation detection in case of nonsinusoidal oscillations. The
   proposed method is verified through a case study.}},

Title = {{Interfacial Free Energy Controlling Glass-Forming Ability of Cu-Zr
   Alloys}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{Glass is a freezing phase of a deeply supercooled liquid. Despite its
   simple definition, the origin of glass forming ability (GFA) is still
   ambiguous, even for binary Cu-Zr alloys. Here, we directly study the
   stability of the supercooled Cu-Zr liquids where we find that Cu64Zr36
   at a supercooled temperature shows deeper undercoolability and longer
   persistence than other neighbouring compositions with an equivalent
   driving Gibbs free energy. This observation implies that the GFA of the
   Cu-Zr alloys is significantly affected by crystal-liquid interfacial
   free energy. In particular, the crystal-liquid interfacial free energy
   of Cu64Zr36 in our measurement was higher than that of other
   neighbouring liquids and, coincidently a molecular dynamics simulation
   reveals a larger glass-glass interfacial energy value at this
   composition, which reflects more distinct configuration difference
   between liquid and crystal phase. The present results demonstrate that
   the higher crystal-liquid interfacial free energy is a prerequisite of
   good GFA of the Cu-Zr alloys.}},

   filter}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& CHEMICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{The extended Kalman filter (EKF) remains the most preferred state
   estimator for solving both unconstrained and constrained state
   estimation problems in the field of Chemical Engineering. Given, the
   wide spread use of EKF, we have proposed a novel optimization free
   recursive formulation of the EKF, to handle elegantly bounds on the
   estimated state variables of a stochastic non-linear dynamic system. It
   is well known that in the EKF, the prior and posterior distributions are
   approximated to be a multivariate normal distribution. In the presence
   of bounds imposed on the state variables, the accuracy of the first two
   moments of the initial state distribution and prior distribution namely
   the means and covariance matrices, plays a significant role in the
   extended Kalman filter performance. Hence, in this paper, we propose two
   novel schemes to modify the prior and posterior distributions of the EKF
   in order to satisfy the bound constraints. In addition, the initial
   state distribution is also suitably modified in order to satisfy the
   bound constraints. The efficacy of the proposed state estimation schemes
   using the EKF is validated on two benchmark problems reported in the
   literature namely a simulated gas-phase reactor and an isothermal batch
   reactor involving constraints on estimated state variables. Extensive
   simulation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed optimization
   free recursive constrained state estimation schemes using extended
   Kalman filter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Partial nitritation is an essential first step in anaerobic ammonium
   oxidation. This study compared the performance of air-lift partial
   nitritation reactors with attached growth (AG) and suspended growth (SG)
   without biomass retention using ammonium-rich recirculated liquor
   produced from the dewatering of anaerobically digested sludge. The
   steady-state results showed that the AG can effectively retain
   ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) with high activity and allow
   minimizing biomass discharge (approximate to 10mg volatile suspended
   solids/L) in the effluent. The nitrogen loading (based on the total
   reactor volume) satisfying the effluent characteristics could be
   suggested to be 0.42g N/L/d for the SG, and 0.76g N/L/d for the AG,
   respectively. Compared with the SG, the AG achieved a higher ammonium
   loading rate (approximate to 1.8 times), maximal ammonium oxidation
   activity (48mg N/L-h based on liquid-phase volume) under a short
   hydraulic retention time (HRT) and a long solids retention time (SRT>80
   d). The overall performance confirmed that AG is a promising
   configuration for partial nitritation in terms of the process stability,
   maximization of the AOB activity and minimization of the effluent
   biomass under a short HRT and high nitrogen loading rate.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A five-year, humidity-cell experiment was used to study the weathering
   evolution of a low-sulfide, granitic waste rock at 5 and 22 degrees C.
   Only the rock with the highest sulfide content (0.16 wt \%) released
   sufficient acid to overcome a limited carbonate acid-neutralization
   capacity and produce a substantial decline in pH. Leached SO4 and Ca
   quickly increased then decreased during the first two years of
   weathering. Sulfide oxidation continued to release acid and SO4 after
   carbonate depletion, resulting in an increase in acid-soluble elements,
   including Cu and Zn. With the dissolution of Al-bearing minerals, the pH
   stabilized above 4, and sulfide oxidation continued to decline until the
   end of the experiment. The variation in activation energy of sulfide
   oxidation correlates with changes in sulfide availability, where the
   lowest activation energies occurred during the largest releases of SO4.
   A decrease in sulfide availability was attributed to consumption of
   sulfide and weathered rims on sulfide grains that reduced the oxidation
   rate. Varying element release rates due to changing carbonate and
   sulfide availability provide identifiable geochemical conditions that
   can be viewed as neutralization sequences and may be extrapolated to the
   field site for examining the evolution of mineral weathering of the
   waste rock.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of plant leaves usually lasts 3-6 weeks and it is widely
   believed that most cell types ( epidermal and mesophyll) continue to
   expand in unison over a similar time period. The evidence supporting
   this account was derived from studies of herb leaves. We observed in
   woody species, however, that the diameter of mesophyll cells ( spongy
   and palisade) changed little during leaf expansion from about 5 to 100
   \% maximum size. To keep pace with epidermal cell enlargement and leaf
   area expansion, mesophyll cells divided but palisade cell length
   expanded as leaves grew thicker. The prolonged division of mesophyll and
   apparently unchanging mesophyll cell diameters constitute a novel
   pattern of leaf cell development, different from that previously
   described for herbs. Possible mechanisms that attribute the varied
   expansion direction and speed to the different cellulose distributions
   in woody and herbaceous species are suggested. This finding could
   contribute to an enhanced understanding of the overall mechanism of leaf
   development.}},

Title = {{Analysis of rigging assembly for lifting heavy industrial modules}},
Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{512-522}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Modularization of heavy industrial plants is a standard mode of
   operation utilized to reduce costs, site congestion, and schedule. The
   standard module is 6 m wide, 24 to 36 m long, and up to 7.5 in high (20
   ft wide, 80 to 120 ft long and 24 ft high) with weights ranging from 50
   to 160 tonnes. On-site traditional rigging arrangements are costly to
   adjust for dimension and center of gravity and have inherent safety
   risks in handling the rigging. Additionally, the modules are often
   over-designed because of uncertainties in the load redistribution due to
   lifting. The aim of this work is to design a new system, improving upon
   the limitations of the traditional system. To achieve this goal, a
   thorough understanding of the traditional system is required. In this
   paper, finite element analysis was used to analyze the load
   redistribution due to lifting of three module types with different sizes
   under various extreme loading scenarios. The results show that load
   redistribution depends primarily on the triangular assembly of the
   traditional rigging independent of the module type, size and loading.
   Secondly, an adjustable and functionally very flexible engineered module
   lift frame was designed to handle the variety of loading and dimensional
   conditions and reduce module stresses exerted due to lifting. It is
   comprised of two main running beams, adjustable interconnecting cross
   braces, sliders for longitudinal flexibility in connection points, and
   supporting slings to a common upper point. Finite element analysis was
   used to confirm the module lift frame loading resistance and to
   determine its limits under a variety of extreme loading scenarios. There
   are significant improvements in the module load redistribution forces as
   compared to traditional rigging.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitory feedback from sensory pathways is important for controlling
   movement. Here, we characterize, for the first time, a long-latency,
   inhibitory spinal pathway to ankle flexors that is activated by
   low-threshold homonymous afferents. To examine this inhibitory pathway
   in uninjured, healthy participants, we suppressed motorevoked potentials
   (MEPs), produced in the tibialis anterior (TA), by a prior stimulation
   to the homonymous common peroneal nerve (CPN). The TA MEP was suppressed
   by a triple-pulse stimulation to the CPN, applied 40, 50, and 60 ms
   earlier and at intensities of 0.5-0.7 times motor threshold (average
   suppression of test MEP was 33\%). Whereas the triple-pulse stimulation
   was below M-wave and H-reflex threshold, it produced a long-latency
   inhibition of background muscle activity, approximately 65-115 ms after
   the CPN stimulation, a time period that overlapped with the test MEP.
   However, not all of the MEP suppression could be accounted for by this
   decrease in background muscle activity. Evoked responses from direct
   activation of the corticospinal tract, at the level of the brain stem or
   thoracic spinal cord, were also suppressed by low-threshold CPN
   stimulation. Our findings suggest that low-threshold muscle and
   cutaneous afferents from the CPN activate a long-latency, homonymous
   spinal inhibitory pathway to TA motoneurons. We propose that inhibitory
   feedback from spinal networks, activated by low-threshold homonymous
   afferents, helps regulate the activation of flexor motoneurons by the
   corticospinal tract.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider state estimation based on the information from
   multiple sensors that provide their measurement updates according to
   separate event-triggering conditions. An optimal sensor fusion problem
   based on the hybrid measurement information (namely, point- and
   set-valued measurements) is formulated and explored. We show that under
   a commonly-accepted Gaussian assumption, the optimal estimator depends
   on the conditional mean and covariance of the measurement innovations,
   which applies to general event-triggering schemes. For the case that
   each channel of the sensors has its own event-triggering condition,
   closed-form representations are derived for the optimal estimate and the
   corresponding error covariance matrix, and it is proved that the
   exploration of the set-valued information provided by the
   event-triggering sets guarantees the improvement of estimation
   performance. The effectiveness of the proposed event-based estimator is
   demonstrated by extensive Monte Carlo simulation experiments for
   different categories of systems and comparative simulation with the

Abstract = {{Dynamic fault tree (DFT) analysis has been used to account for dynamic
   behaviors such as the sequence-dependent, functional-dependent, and
   priority relationships among the failures of basic events. Various
   methodologies have been developed to analyze a DFT; however, most
   methods require a complex analytical procedure or a significant
   simulation time for an accurate analysis. In this paper, a stochastic
   computational approach is proposed for an efficient analysis of the top
   event's failure probability in a DFT with priority AND (PAND) gates. A
   stochastic model is initially proposed for a two-input PAND gate, and a
   successive cascading model is then presented for a general
   multiple-input PAND gate. A stochastic approach using the proposed
   models provides an efficient analysis of a DFT compared to an accurate
   analysis or algebraic approach. The accuracy of a stochastic analysis
   increases with the length of random binary bit streams in stochastic
   computation. The use of non-Bernoulli sequences of random permutations
   of fixed counts of 1s and 0s as initial input events' probabilities
   makes the stochastic approach more efficient, and more accurate than
   Monte Carlo simulation. Non-exponential failure distributions and
   repeated events are readily handled by the stochastic approach. The
   accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the stochastic approach are
   shown by several case studies of DFT analysis.}},

   Carrier transport in Rtl-NWs is of fundamental importance but has
   hitherto been inferred indirectly via impedance and intensity-modulated
   spectroscopic techniques. We report an effective electron drift mobility
   of 1.95 x 10(-5) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in rutile nanowire arrays directly
   measured using the time-of-flight (TOF) and space charge limited current
   techniques. In addition, we measure an equilibrium free electron
   concentration of similar to 10(14) cm(-3) and a trap density of 3.5 x
   10(16) cm(-3) in rutile nanowires. These results point to the importance
   of reducing traps to improve charge transport in rutile nanowires.

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the aggregation mechanisms of asphaltenes in

   Violanthrone78-based model asphaltenes with different aliphatic/aromatic
   ratios. Our simulation results show that the attraction between
   poly-aromatic cores is the main driving force for asphaltene aggregation
   in toluene, and that the extent of aggregation is independent of the
   aliphatic/aromatic ratios. On the other hand, analysis of the aggregated
   structures indicates that long side chains do hinder the formation of
   large direct parallel stacking structures. In contrast with water as a
   solvent, toluene exhibits attractive interactions with both the
   aliphatic and aromatic regions of the asphaltenes, hence reducing the
   size and stability of the asphaltene aggregates. Our findings help to
   elucidate, at a molecular level, the different solubility behaviors of
   asphaltenes in toluene and in water.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability is fast becoming a major concern due to the nanometric
   scaling of CMOS technology. Accurate analytical approaches for the
   reliability evaluation of logic circuits, however, have a computational
   complexity that generally increases exponentially with circuit size.
   This makes intractable the reliability analysis of large circuits. This
   paper initially presents novel computational models based on stochastic
   computation; using these stochastic computational models (SCMs), a
   simulation-based analytical approach is then proposed for the
   reliability evaluation of logic circuits. In this approach, signal
   probabilities are encoded in the statistics of random binary bit streams
   and non-Bernoulli sequences of random permutations of binary bits are
   used for initial input and gate error probabilities. By leveraging the
   bit-wise dependencies of random binary streams, the proposed approach
   takes into account signal correlations and evaluates the joint
   reliability of multiple outputs. Therefore, it accurately determines the
   reliability of a circuit; its precision is only limited by the random
   fluctuations inherent in the stochastic sequences. Based on both
   simulation and analysis, the SCM approach takes advantages of ease in
   implementation and accuracy in evaluation. The use of non-Bernoulli
   sequences as initial inputs further increases the evaluation efficiency
   and accuracy compared to the conventional use of Bernoulli sequences, so
   the proposed stochastic approach is scalable for analyzing large
   circuits. It can further account for various fault models as well as
   calculating the soft error rate (SER). These results are supported by
   extensive simulations and detailed comparison with existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Principal curves arising as an essential construct in dimensionality
   reduction and data analysis have recently attracted much attention from
   theoretical as well as practical perspective. In many real-world
   situations, however, the efficiency of existing principal curves
   algorithms is often arguable, in particular when dealing with massive
   data owing to the associated high computational complexity. A certain
   drawback of these constructs stems from the fact that in several
   applications principal curves cannot fully capture some essential
   problem-oriented facets of the data dealing with width, aspect ratio,
   width change, etc. Information granulation is a powerful tool supporting
   processing and interpreting massive data. In this paper, invoking the
   underlying ideas of information granulation, we propose a granular
   principal curves approach, regarded as an extension of principal curves
   algorithms, to improve efficiency and achieve a sound
   accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. First, large amounts of numerical data are
   granulated into C intervals-information granules developed with the use
   of fuzzy C-means clustering and the two criteria of information
   granulation, which significantly reduce the amount of data to be
   processed at the later phase of the overall design. Granular principal
   curves are then constructed by determining the upper and the lower
   bounds of the interval data. Finally, we develop an objective function
   using the criteria of information confidence and specificity to evaluate
   the granular output formed by the principal curves. We also optimize the
   granular principal curves by adjusting the level of information
   granularity (the number of clusters), which is realized with the aid of
   the particle swarm optimization. A number of numeric studies completed
   for synthetic and real-world datasets provide a useful quantifiable

Abstract = {{It is still uncertain to what extent pore scale mechanisms, such as the
   counter and co-current nature of multiphase flow, the trapping
   mechanisms, the distribution of phases, and heat transfer mechanisms
   affect the process of isothermal and non-isothermal gravity drainage
   dominated oil and heavy-oil recovery. This type of processes is
   encountered during gas injection into oil reservoirs for enhanced oil
   recovery under isothermal conditions. Steam injection in thick
   reservoirs where gravity displacement is an effective mechanism and
   steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) are well-known examples of a
   non-isothermal gravity dominated heavy-oil recovery applications. It is
   commonly observed that field scale applications of the latter yield less
   recovery than estimated. One may also encounter this type process in the
   removal of any crude oil contamination in shallow zones where steam
   injection is used for cleaning. All these require in-depth analysis of
   the problem at the pore scale to account for the residual oil saturation
   (S,) in the swept zone.
   In this paper, we used a single capillary tube (radius <0.03 cm) to
   mimic an elementary volume in the swept area during gravity dominated
   displacement applications and studied the flow characteristics of two
   and three phase flow with emphasis on film development. We carried out
   two-phase (air-oil) and three phase (air-oil-initial water saturation)
   flow displacements in a capillary tube under different temperature
   conditions, varying the air injection rate and the capillary properties.
   Detailed visualization experiments were carried out to analyze (1) the
   effects of heavy oil viscosity, wettability and spreading coefficient on
   displacements at different temperature conditions, (2) the interplay
   among capillary, gravity and viscous (air injection rates) forces and
   wettability using different capillary sizes (pore size), and (3) the
   residual oil saturation in the form of film development and phase
   distribution in the capillaries (mainly the thicknesses of the wetting
   and non-wetting phases).
   The experimental observations suggest that for heavy oil there is a
   threshold capillary number around 1.0E 2 over which the oil recovery
   (and therefore the residual oil saturation) is very sensitive to the
   capillary number, i.e., the injection rate, interfacial tension,
   wettability and temperature. At lower capillary numbers (typical range
   for oil reservoirs) temperature and hence viscosity do not have a
   significant influence in the residual oil saturation of the processed
   and crude oils; for horizontal displacement the residual oil saturation
   is a function of the capillary forces and for gravity drainage
   experiments it depends of the competition between capillary and gravity
   forces (Bond number). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Efficient oil displacement near the chamber edge in ES-SAGD}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{99-113}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is the most widely used method
   for in-situ bitumen recovery. Expanding-solvent-SAGD (ES-SAGD) has been
   proposed as an alternative to SAGD to improve its efficiency. In
   ES-SAGD, steam is coinjected with a small amount of solvent. Detailed
   oil recovery mechanisms near the chamber edge are little known due to
   the complex interaction of fluid and energy flow, and phase behavior.
   Prior research on ES-SAGD explains that coinjected solvent can further
   decrease oil viscosity near the chamber edge by dilution, in conjunction
   with heat.
   In this paper, we conduct a detailed investigation on oil displacement
   mechanisms and the placement of solvent near the chamber edge using
   fine-scale reservoir simulation. The importance of properly considering
   both phase behavior and flow to design ES-SAGD is demonstrated. Results
   show that ES-SAGD can achieve a higher displacement efficiency than
   SAGD. Oil production rate in ES-SAGD can be two times higher than that
   in SAGD. As a result, the ultimate oil recovery of ES-SAGD is enhanced
   by almost 20\%, compared to SAGD in this research. The oil saturation
   reduction results from condensed solvent bank and phase transition near
   the chamber edge. The condensed solvent bank lowers the oil-component
   concentrations there. The diluted oil with solvent is then redistributed
   in the gaseous and oleic phases in the presence of the water phase on
   the phase transition at the chamber edge. The resulting amount of the
   oleic phase can be significantly small, yielding lowered oil saturations
   in the ES-SAGD chamber. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an efficient algorithm to find optimal underground
   cable configuration with maximum ampacity in a concrete duct bank. The
   current's harmonics and its effects on the sheath losses are considered
   in the proposed algorithm. To find the optimal configuration of the
   cables in the duct bank, two heuristic optimisation methods are applied:
   the first algorithm is the well-known particle swarm optimisation (PSO),
   and the second one is the shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) which
   has attracted considerable attraction in recent years. The objective
   function of these methods which has to be optimised is total ampacity.
   Calculating the total ampacity for a required configuration by using
   PSO/SFLA is a convex optimisation problem. The interior point method is
   utilised to solve this problem. The proposed method has been implemented
   on four test cases to show the importance of considering the current
   harmonics in determining the optimal configuration. To evaluate the
   performance of the PSO and the SFLA, the obtained results are compared

Abstract = {{A novel electrochemical noise (EN) sensor was elaborately designed to

Abstract = {{The electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation of a large-scale power
   system consumes so much computational power that parallel programming
   techniques are urgently needed in this area. For example,
   realistic-sized power systems include thousands of buses, generators,
   and transmission lines. Massive-thread computing is one of the key
   developments that can increase the EMT computational capabilities
   substantially when the processing unit has enough hardware cores.
   Compared to the traditional CPU, the graphic-processing unit (GPU) has
   many more cores with distributed memory which can offer higher data
   throughput. This paper proposes a massive-thread EMT program (MT-EMTP)
   and develops massive-thread parallel modules for linear passive
   elements, the universal line model, and the universal machine model for
   offline EMT simulation. An efficient node-mapping structure is proposed
   to transform the original power system admittance matrix into a
   block-node diagonal sparse format to exploit the massive-thread parallel
   GPU architecture. The developed MT-EMTP program has been tested on
   large-scale power systems of up to 2458 three-phase buses with detailed
   component modeling. The simulation results and execution times are
   compared with mainstream commercial software, EMTP-RV, to show the
   improvement in performance with equivalent accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory tract deposition models provide a useful method for
   optimizing the design and administration of inhaled pharmaceutical
   aerosols, and can be useful for estimating exposure risks to inhaled
   particulate matter. As aerosol must first pass through the extrathoracic
   region prior to reaching the lungs, deposition in this region plays an
   important role in both cases. Compared to adults, much less
   extrathoracic deposition data are available with pediatric subjects.
   Recently, progress in magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography
   scans to develop pediatric extrathoracic airway replicas has facilitated
   addressing this issue. Indeed, the use of realistic replicas for
   benchtop inhaler testing is now relatively common during the development
   and in vitro evaluation of pediatric respiratory drug delivery devices.
   Recently, in vitro empirical modeling studies using a moderate number of
   these realistic replicas have related airway geometry, particle size,
   fluid properties, and flow rate to extrathoracic deposition. Idealized
   geometries provide a standardized platform for inhaler testing and
   exposure risk assessment and have been designed to mimic average in
   vitro deposition in infants and children by replicating representative
   average geometrical dimensions. In silico mathematical models have used
   morphometric data and aerosol physics to illustrate the relative
   importance of different deposition mechanisms on respiratory tract
   deposition. Computational fluid dynamics simulations allow for the
   quantification of local deposition patterns and an in-depth examination
   of aerosol behavior in the respiratory tract. Recent studies have used
   both in vitro and in silico deposition measurements in realistic
   pediatric airway geometries to some success. This article reviews the
   current understanding of pediatric in vitro and in silico deposition
   modeling via oral and nasal inhalation.}},

Abstract = {{Enabling multipacket reception (MPR) at the physical layer is a
   promising way to achieve higher bandwidth efficiency while reducing the
   complexity of the medium access control layer in distributed wireless
   networks. We study distributed probabilistic access where transmitting
   nodes access the shared wireless medium with a probability based on the
   node's information about the aggregate traffic carried by the network.
   We model bursty traffic by rate-controlled two-state Markov sources and
   introduce a parameter that describes the ``burstiness{''} level of the
   offered traffic. A throughput-optimal medium access strategy utilizing
   limited feedback is then described and its performance is examined for
   traffic with different levels of burstiness. It is shown that the bursty
   nature of the traffic in data networks allows for improvement of the
   bandwidth efficiency. Bounds on the system throughput are proposed and
   the queuing delay is analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Unique rheological and phase behaviors of rod-like nanocrystalline
   cellulose (NCC) suspensions in aqueous media are revealed in the present
   article. Specifically, the NCC aqueous suspension remained isotropic in
   a wide NCC concentration range in which the suspension underwent
   transition from dilute solution to gel, and the relative viscosity of
   the NCC suspension could be well fitted by the Sato-Teramoto theory in
   the full concentration range tested. Correspondingly, both zero-shear
   viscosity and complex viscosity increased monotonically with NCC
   concentration, and no maximum value was observed along the curves of
   zero-shear viscosity or complex viscosity versus NCC concentration,
   indicating a deviation from the lyotropic system. However, a
   shear-induced birefringence phenomenon was observed, indicating the NCC
   suspension formed a temporary ordered structure in the external force
   field but was unable to form an anisotropic (liquid crystalline) phase.
   The Cox-Merz rule was not applicable for the NCC suspension as a result
   of oriented domains, i.e., rod-like NCC particles. Moreover,
   time-concentration superposition was successfully applied to both the
   storage and loss modulus, attributed to the isotropic feature of the NCC
   suspension in the tested concentration range. The reason why this NCC
   suspension remained isotropic could be because of the strong
   electrostatic repulsions between NCC particles and the weak tendency or
   driving force of anisotropy formation as a result of the small aspect
   ratio of NCC particles, Na+ counterions and large amounts of negative
   charges along the NCC particles. The results suggested that not all the
   rod-like particles were able to form an anisotropic phase in aqueous
   suspension, but dominated by various factors.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Carbohydrates are key participants in many biological
   processes including reproduction, inflammation, signal transmission and
   infection. Their biocompatibility and ability to be recognized by
   cell-surface receptors illustrate their potential therapeutic
   applications. alpha Yet, they are not ideal candidates because they are
   complex and tedious to synthesize. However, recent advances in the field
   of polymer science and nanotechnology have led to the design of
   biologically relevant carbohydrate mimics for therapeutic uses. This
   review focuses mainly on the therapeutic potential of glycopolymers and
   glyconanoparticles (GNPs).
   Areas covered: The significance of engineered glycopolymers and GNPs as
   nanomedicine is highlighted in areas such as targeted drug delivery,
   gene therapy, signal transduction, vaccine development, protein
   stabilization and anti-adhesion therapy.
   Expert opinion: Major effort should be focused towards the design and
   synthesis of more complex and biologically relevant carbohydrate mimics
   in order to have a better understanding of the
   carbohydrate--carbohydrate and carbohydrate-protein interactions. The
   full therapeutic potential of these carbohydrate-based polymeric and
   nanoparticles systems can be achieved once the pivotal participation of
   the carbohydrates in biological systems is clarified.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) coated with a high surface area
   thin film are fabricated. Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) is used to
   uniformly deposit high surface area, nanostructured SiO2 films on top of
   released NEMS. The resonance frequencies and quality factors are
   measured to assess the potential of the high surface area NEMS for
   sensing experiments. Resonance frequencies of coated cantilevers,
   although reduced by mass loading, can be predicted accurately using our
   derived model. Compressive stress makes the resonance frequencies of
   coated doubly-clamped beams difficult to predict. The quality factors of
   the coated NEMS are reduced by one order of magnitude by a
   quasi-continuous layer at the base of the GLAD film, which also
   introduces an estimated compressive stress of 5.3-9.3 MPa. The limit of
   detection is demonstrated to be similar to 2 pg cm(-2). With this
   successful proof-of-concept demonstration, we anticipate the future use
   of these devices as high surface area gravimetric mass sensors for
   applications such as gas chromatography.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a new insight into clustering with a
   spring-mass dynamics, and propose a resulting hierarchical clustering
   algorithm. To realize the spectral graph partitioning as clustering, we
   model a weighted graph of a data set as a mass-spring dynamical system,
   where we regard a cluster as an oscillating single entity of a data set
   with similar properties. And then, we describe how oscillation modes are
   related with eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian matrix of the dataset. In
   each step of the clustering, we select a group of clusters, which has
   the biggest number of constituent clusters. This group is divided into
   sub-clusters by examining an eigenvector minimizing a cost function,
   which is formed in such a way that subdivided clusters will be balanced
   with large size. To find k clusters out of non-spherical or complex
   data, we first transform the data into spherical clusters located on the
   unit sphere positioned in the (k - 1)- dimensional space. In the sequel,
   we use the previous procedure to these transformed data. The
   computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method works
   quite well on a variety of data sets, although its performance degrades
   with the degree of overlapping of datasets. (C) 2014 The Franklin

   rheology}},
Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{97-104}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Low-grade ultramafic nickel ores, while representing a large potential
   nickel resource, are difficult to process due to their high serpentine
   content. Serpentine is anisotropic and the mineral particles tend to be
   non-spherical, resulting in challenging slurry rheology. In general,
   suspensions of serpentine minerals have high viscosity and yield stress,
   which can be detrimental in comminution and flotation operations. It is
   proposed that ultramafic nickel ores be treated with microwave radiation
   prior to grinding in order to reduce slurry viscosity and yield stress.
   The rheology of two different ultramafic nickel ores, before and after
   microwave pre-treatment, was characterized in this work. Serpentine
   minerals were found to dominate the rheology of the untreated ultramafic
   nickel ores, with the ore containing minor chrysotile exhibiting higher
   viscosity and yield stress than the ore containing strictly lizardite
   serpentine. Microwave pre-treatment was found to greatly reduce the
   shear viscosity (average 80\% reduction at 200 s(-1)) and direct yield
   stress (peak yield stress reduced by 92-93\%) of ultramafic nickel ore
   slurries. The reduction in slurry viscosity and yield stress of the ore
   slurries as a result of microwave pre-treatment was attributed to the
   conversion of serpentine to olivine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of polymerization method on the stability and
   drug release properties of polymeric micelles formed using stereo-active
   block copolymers.
   Diblock copolymers consisting of methoxy poly ethylene oxide (MePEO) and
   poly(lactide)s (PLA)s of different stereochemistry were synthesized by
   bulk or solution polymerization. Polymers and micelles were
   characterized for their chemical structure by H-1 NMR, optical rotation
   by polarimetry, critical micellar concentration by fluorescence
   spectroscopy, thermal properties by differential scanning calorimetry,
   morphology by transmission electron microscopy and size as well as
   kinetic stability by dynamic light scattering. Release of encapsulated
   nimodipine from polymeric micelles at different levels of loading was
   also investigated.
   Solution polymerization yielded a higher degree of crystallinity for
   stereo-regular PLA blocks. Consequently, the related polymeric micelles
   were kinetically more stable than those prepared by bulk polymerization.
   At high drug loading levels, the release of nimodipine was more rapid
   from polymeric micelles with crystalline cores. At lower levels of drug
   loading, drug release was slower and independent of the stereochemistry
   of the core.
   The results underline the effect of polymerization method in defining
   core crystallinity in stereoregular block copolymer micelles. It also
   shows the impact of core crystallinity on enhancing micellar stability
   and drug release.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of drug emitted from two commercially available inhalers was
   measured in an in vitro child oral airway model and compared to existing
   in vivo data to examine the ability of the child model to replicate in
   vivo deposition.
   In vitro deposition of drug from a QVARA (R) pressurized metered dose
   inhaler (pMDI) and PulmicortA (R) TurbuhalerA (R) dry powder inhaler
   (DPI) in an Idealized Child Throat (1) and downstream filter was
   measured using UV spectroscopy and simulated realistic breathing
   profiles. Potential effects of ambient relative humidity ranging from
   10\% to 90\% on deposition were also considered.
   In vitro QVAR pMDI deposition in the idealized mouth-throat at 50\% RH
   (39.2 +/- 2.3\% of delivered dose) compared well (p > 0.05) with in vivo
   extrathoracic deposition in asthmatic children age 8 to 14 (45.8 +/-
   12.3\%). In vitro Turbuhaler DPI deposition in the idealized
   mouth-throat at 50\% RH (69.0 +/- 1.5\%) matched in vivo extrathoracic
   deposition (p > 0.05) in 6 to 16 year old children with cystic fibrosis
   (70.4 +/- 21.2\%). The effects of ambient humidity were found to be
   insignificant for Turbuhaler and minor for QVAR.
   The Idealized Child Throat successfully mimics in vivo deposition data
   in school age children for the inhalers tested, and may provide a
   standard platform for optimizing pediatric treatment with inhaled
   pharmaceutical aerosols.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{101-109}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we develop an economic model predictive control scheme for
   a class of nonlinear systems with bounded process and measurement noise.
   In order to achieve fast convergence of the state estimates to the
   actual system state as well as the robustness of the observer to
   measurement and process noise, a deterministic (high-gain) observer is
   first applied for a small time period with continuous output
   measurements to drive the estimation error to a small value; after this
   initial small time period, a robust moving horizon estimation scheme is
   used on-line to provide more accurate and smoother state estimates. In
   the design of the robust moving horizon estimation scheme, the
   deterministic observer is used to calculate reference estimates and
   confidence regions that contain the actual system state. Within the
   confidence regions, the moving horizon estimation scheme is allowed to
   optimize its estimates. The output feedback economic model predictive
   controller is designed via Lyapunov techniques based on state estimates
   provided by the deterministic observer and the moving horizon estimation
   scheme. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed rigorously
   and conditions that ensure the closed-loop stability are derived.
   Extensive simulations based on a chemical process example illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, a new design equation is derived to predict the shear
   strength of slender reinforced concrete (RC) beams without stirrups
   using gene expression programming (GEP). The predictor variables
   included in the analysis are web width, effective depth, concrete
   compressive strength, amount of longitudinal reinforcement, and shear
   span to depth ratio. A set of published database containing 1942
   experimental test results is used to develop the model. An extra set of
   test results which is not involved in the modeling process is employed
   to verify the applicability of the proposed model. Sensitivity and
   parametric analyses are carried out to determine the contributions of
   the affecting parameters. The proposed model is effectively capable of
   estimating the ultimate shear capacity of members without shear steel.
   The results obtained by GEP are found to be more accurate than those
   obtained using several building codes. The GEP-based formula is fairly
   simple and useful for pre-design applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy was used to measure local surface potentials (or

   plotted as a function of position along the bitumen surface, the
   potential appeared as a random ``noise.{''} Autocorrelation of the
   random noise revealed that the surface charges were correlated over
   distances much larger than molecular dimensions. Further, this
   correlation length appeared to be pH-dependent, exhibiting an almost
   threefold decrease as the pH was increased from 6 to 10. The correlation
   length, which is a measure of surface charge heterogeneity, is of
   practical importance as it affects strongly the probability of
   coalescence between emulsified bitumen droplets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are ubiquitous heme-thiolate
   proteins that have potential biotechnological application.
   Thermostable-P450s that can withstand hostile industrial conditions,
   such as high temperatures, extremes of pH and organic solvents, are
   needed for biotechnological usage. Here, for the first time, we report a
   large number of thermostable-P450s from two thermophilic
   biomass-degrading fungi, Myceliophthora thermophila and Thielavia
   terrestris. Genome-wide P450 analysis revealed the presence of 79 and 70
   P450s (P450ome) in T. terrestris and M. thermophila. Authentic P450s
   containing both the P450 signature domains (EXXR and CXG) were
   classified as follows: T. terrestris (50 families and 56 subfamilies)
   and M. thermophila (49 families and 53 subfamilies). Bioinformatics
   analysis of P450omes suggested the presence of a large number of
   thermostable-P450s. Based on aliphatic index cut-off (> 90), 14 and 11
   P450s were determined to be thermostable in T. terrestris and M.
   thermophila. Among the thermostable P450s, six P450s from T. terrestris
   and three from M. thermophila had a melting temperature (Tm) of > 65 A
   degrees C, suggesting their hyperthermal tolerance. Analysis of the
   instability index of two ascomycete P450omes revealed the presence of 12
   and 19 in vitro stable P450s in T. terrestris and M. thermophila.
   Overall, six P450s from T. terrestris and four from M. thermophila
   showed both thermal tolerance and in vitro stability. Thermophilic
   ascomycetes P450s are of potential interest from a structural,
   mechanistic and biotechnological point of view, as five P450s showed
   higher thermal tolerance and five showed higher in vitro stability
   compared to the well-characterized thermostable-P450s CYP175A1
   (bacteria) and CYP119 (archaea).}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Three individual wave power generation technologies were studied and
   evaluated using multicriteria decision analysis through the use of the
   PROMETHEE method. To evaluate the three technologies, data were
   collected from previously performed experimental testing on the
   performance of each wave power generation technology. These data were
   used to feed into seven different criteria; namely the capacity factor,
   rated power, capital cost, operation and maintenance (O\&M) costs, cost
   of electricity (COE) for a 10 year payback, maturity, and survivability.
   The associated data and criteria were used to determine the optimal
   technology. The results from the Decision Lab modeling ranked the Wave
   Dragon, AquaBuOY, and Pelamis technologies as 1, 2, and 3, respectively,
   for all three locations: Tofino/Ucluelet, Hibernia Oil Platform, and St.
   John's, Newfoundland. A sensitivity analysis of the threshold values
   determined for the baseline modeling indicated that the original ranking
   was essentially unaffected when the threshold values were modified
   (increased and decreased). The weights of the criterion were
   individually adjusted to evaluate any change in ranking order. A sizable
   increase in weighting of greater than 40\% of any one criterion (while
   the others were weighed equally) resulted in a change of the overall
   ranking order of the three technologies. Final weightings on each of the
   criterion were assigned with preference on rated power, COE, and
   maturity stage. All other criteria were weighted equally and like the
   baseline modeling output, the results of the model ranked Wave Dragon,
   AquaBuOY, and Pelamis from most favorable to least favorable for all
   three of the locations analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate hydraulic features of the flooding flow on a staircase
   with a rest platform, experiments were conducted on a 1:2-scale physical
   model of a staircase with a middle rest platform between two stair
   segments. The transition or skimming flow occurring on the first segment
   is similar to that on a stepped chute. However, a jet flow forms
   immediately downstream of the rest platform, followed by a redeveloping
   transition flow on the second segment. The measured profiles of air
   concentrations in those flow regions agree well with that in the
   skimming and transition flow known from stepped spillways. The amount of
   air entrained into the free-falling jet increases dramatically because
   of a higher air concentration in the approaching flow. Rapid rises of
   the air-water mixture depth and the flow velocity in part of the jet and
   the transition flow downstream were observed. These features could
   affect human maneuverability on a flooding staircase with rest
   platform(s) and make it more difficult for people to safely evacuate
   from underground spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Cold-gas dynamic spraying ({''}cold spraying{''}) was used to deposit
   aluminum-alumina (Al-Al2O3) metal-matrix composite (MMC) coatings onto
   6061 Al alloy. The powders consisted of -45 mu m commercially pure Al
   that was admixed with either 10 mu m or agglomerated 20 nm Al2O3 in
   weight fractions of 25, 50, 75, 90, and 95 wt.\%. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), Vickers microhardness testing, and image analysis were
   conducted to determine the microstructure, properties, and the volume
   fractions of reinforcing particles in the coatings, which was then
   converted to weight fractions. As the weight fraction of the Al2O3 in
   the coatings increased, the hardness values of the MMC coatings
   increased. A maximum hardness of 96 +/- A 10 HV0.2 was observed for the
   MMC coating that contained the agglomerated 20 nm Al2O3 particles, while
   a maximum hardness of 85 +/- A 24 HV0.2 was observed for the coatings
   with the 10 mu m Al2O3 particles. The slight increase in hardness of the
   coating containing the agglomerated 20 nm Al2O3 particles occurred in a
   coating of Al2O3 content that was lower than that in the coating that
   contained the 10 mu m reinforcing Al2O3 particles. The increased
   hardness of the MMC coatings that contained the agglomerated 20 nm Al2O3
   particles and at lower reinforcing particle content was attributed to
   the increased spreading of the nanoagglomerated particles in the
   coating, which increased load-sharing and reinforcement capability of
   the particles. These results suggest that the use of nanoagglomerated,
   reinforcing hard-phase particles in cold-sprayed MMC coatings may be a
   more efficient alternative to the use of conventional micronsized
   reinforcing particles.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo investigate a novel phase-contrast MRI velocity-encoding
   technique for faster imaging and reduced chemical shift-induced phase
   errors.
   MethodsVelocity encoding with the slice select refocusing gradient
   achieves the target gradient moment by time shifting the refocusing
   gradient, which enables the use of the minimum in-phase echo time (TE)
   for faster imaging and reduced chemical shift-induced phase errors. Net
   forward flow was compared in 10 healthy subjects (N=10) within the
   ascending aorta (aAo), main pulmonary artery (PA), and right/left
   pulmonary arteries (RPA/LPA) using conventional flow compensated and
   flow encoded (401 Hz/px and TE=3.08 ms) and slice select refocused
   gradient velocity encoding (814 Hz/px and TE=2.46 ms) at 3 T.
   ResultsImproved net forward flow agreement was measured across all
   vessels for slice select refocused gradient compared to flow compensated
   and flow encoded: aAo vs. PA (1.7\%1.9\% vs. 5.8\%+/- 2.8\%, P=0.002),
   aAo vs. RPA+LPA (2.1\%+/- 1.7\% vs. 6.0\%+/- 4.3\%, P=0.03), and PA vs.
   RPA+LPA (2.9\%+/- 2.1\% vs. 6.1\%+/- 6.3\%, P=0.04), while increasing
   temporal resolution (35\%) and signal-to-noise ratio (33\%).
   ConclusionSlice select refocused gradient phase-contrast MRI with a high
   receiver bandwidth and minimum in-phase TE provides more accurate and
   less variable flow measurements through the reduction of chemical
   shift-induced phase errors and a reduced TE/repetition time, which can
   be used to increase the temporal/spatial resolution and/or reduce breath
   hold durations. Magn Reson Med 71:2014-2023, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley

Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo validate a new saturation recovery single-shot acquisition
   (SASHA) pulse sequence for T-1 mapping and to compare SASHA T-1 values
   in heart failure patients and healthy controls.
   TheoryThe SASHA sequence consists of 10 electrocardiogram-triggered
   single-shot balanced steady-state free precession images in a
   breath-hold. The first image is acquired without magnetization
   preparation and the remaining nine images follow saturation pulses with
   variable saturation recovery times.
   MethodsSASHA was validated through Bloch equation simulations, Monte
   Carlo simulations, and phantom experiments. Pre- and postcontrast
   myocardial and blood T-1 values were measured in 29 healthy volunteers
   and 7 patients with heart failure.
   ResultsSASHA T-1 values had excellent agreement (bias, 5 5 ms) with spin
   echo experiments in phantoms with a wide range of physiologic T-1 and
   T-2 values and its accuracy was independent of flip angle, absolute T-1,
   T-2, and heart rate. The average baseline myocardial T-1 in heart
   failure patients was higher than in healthy controls (1200 +/- 32 vs.
   1170 +/- 9 ms, P < 0.05) at 1.5T, as was the calculated blood-tissue
   partition coefficient, , (0.42 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.02, P < 0.05),
   consistent with diffuse myocardial fibrosis.
   ConclusionsThe SASHA sequence is a simple and fast approach to in vivo
   T-1 mapping with good accuracy in simulations and phantom experiments.

Title = {{Surface topography asymmetry maps categorizing external deformity in

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects 2\% to
   4\% of the population and predominantly affects female individuals. The
   scoliosis researchers and clinical communities use the ``Cobb angle''
   obtained from anterior-posterior radiographs as the standard assessment
   tool for scoliosis. However, excessive radiation exposure over
   consecutive visits during the growing years increases the risk of cancer
   in young patients with AIS. Surface topography (ST) is a noninvasive
   method that is being investigated as an alternative tool for scoliosis
   assessment. The necessity of applying markers by skilled operators,
   which is time consuming and a potential area for errors, is one of the
   main limitations of these methods.
   PURPOSE: This study introduces a three-dimensional markerless analysis
   technique for assessing torso asymmetry in AIS and a system for
   classifying patients based on this technique. The intra/interobserver
   and test-retest reliability and validity of the classification system
   was assessed.
   STUDY DESIGN: A novel three-dimensional analysis technique of ST data of
   patients with scoliosis and its clinical applications.
   METHODS: Full-torso ST scans of 46 patients with AIS (Cobb angle: 34 +/-
   15 degrees, curve types: Lenke 1, 3, and 5) and five healthy subjects
   were used for analysis. The best plane of symmetry, dividing the torso
   into left and right, was calculated for each scan. The deviation between
   the original torso and its reflection with respect to the best plane of
   symmetry was illustrated using deviation contour maps. The subjects were
   visually classified into three main groups and six subgroups based on
   the number and location of the asymmetry contours. A second baseline
   scan and a 1-year follow-up scan were analyzed for 15 subjects and
   reliability of the method was assessed using kappa coefficients. Funding
   for this research is provided by the Scoliosis Research Society, Women
   and Children's Health Research Institute, and the Natural Sciences and
   Engineering Research Council of Canada.
   RESULTS: The intraobserver reliability of the group classification
   demonstrated excellent agreement with mean kappa coefficient of 0.85.
   The multiobserver kappa value of 0.62 was attained in the interobserver
   reliability test conducted among four observers classifying 46 subjects
   in three groups. The test-retest reliability of the method was assessed.
   Mean kappa values of 0.99 and 0.83 were achieved for group (three
   groups) and subgroup (six subgroups) classifications, respectively. The
   classification system showed good reliability when five observers
   classified the first baseline and the 1-year follow-up scans.
   CONCLUSIONS: A novel method to examine torso asymmetry in patients with
   AIS is presented, using noninvasive ST scans and a visually intuitive
   asymmetry map. Distinct patterns of asymmetry were identified allowing
   patients to be classified into three groups, with six subgroups based on
   their asymmetry map with very good to excellent reliability. The
   presented technique shows promise to provide a noninvasive tool for
   assessment and monitoring of AIS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{During steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process, a steam chamber
   forms due to continuous steam injection. This chamber first moves upward
   to the top of the reservoir and then spreads sideways. The upward
   chamber displacement is one of the key factors for optimising the steam
   injection rate. It is necessary to determine the accurate chamber rise
   velocity for predicting the oil recovery rate. Recent experiments show
   that oil flow is coupled to water flow during three-phase gravity
   drainage in water-wet systems. In this paper, we argue that this type of
   flow coupling can be significant in SAGD operations. We extend Butler's
   {[}Butler, J. Can. Petrol. Technol. 1987, 26, 70] and Gotawala and Gates
   {[}Gotawala and Gates, Can. J. Chem. Eng. 2008, 86, 1011] analytic
   models for the rise of interfering steam chambers to account for
   three-phase flow and flow coupling. We also show the importance of flow
   coupling by solving a simple numerical example. We observe that by
   including three-phase drainage and the flow coupling at the steam finger
   edge, the vertical rise velocity of a steam chamber increases. Moreover,
   the rise velocity is very sensitive to the coupling term introduced in
   the new models. Even a small value of the coupling term increases the
   rise velocity significantly. Furthermore, we compare the model
   predictions with the values measured in six fields.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis is presented for the heat transfer from molten salt in the
   copper-chlorine thermochemical cycle for hydrogen production. For this
   cycle to become economical relative to other existing or developing
   technologies, effective heat recovery is very important. Heat recovery
   processes are investigated from molten CuCl (a product of the copper
   oxychloride decomposition process in the Cu-Cl cycle). Recovering heat
   from molten CuCl at 500 degrees C is challenging due to its phase change
   from liquid to solid. Based on a previous examination of different
   options for this heat recovery (including atomization with steam
   generation, casting/extrusion, drum flaker and a rotary spinning
   atomizer), the casting/extrusion method was deemed advantageous. Hence
   that process is considered here, with a counter-current air flow as a
   coolant. Predicted results for axial growth of the solid layer and
   variations of the coolant and wall temperatures are presented and

Title = {{Computation of the Shortest Path in a Bounded Domain With Free Form
   Boundary by Domain Partitioning}},

Abstract = {{The shortest path computation is important in industrial automation,
   especially for robot and autonomous vehicle navigation. However, most of
   the computations concentrate on computing the shortest path between two
   points within a polygon. The common approach for handling a bounded
   domain with free form boundary is to convert the domain into a polygon
   by boundary approximation so that the conventional computing algorithms
   can be used. Such an approximation affects the accuracy of the path.
   This article presents an approach to compute the shortest path between
   two given points in a free form boundary domain without any boundary
   approximation. This is addressed geometrically by imaginably placing a
   source at one of the points which radiates the shortest paths to various
   points of the domain. Some shortest paths are deflected by the geometry
   of the boundary so that they are no longer straight lines. Based on the
   deflections of the shortest paths, the bounded domain is partitioned
   into a set of subdomains. A tree is then constructed to show the
   relationships among these subdomains. The shortest path between two
   points is obtained from this tree.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on
   orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption in vivo. Ten beagle
   dogs were treated with an orthodontic appliance to move the mandibular
   fourth premolars bodily. The orthodontic movement was carried out for 4
   wk with a continuous force of 1 N/side; using a split-mouth model, LIPUS
   was applied daily for 20 min. Fourth premolar and surrounding
   periodontal tissue were evaluated with micro-computed tomography and
   hematoxylin and eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining.
   We calculated the number, volume and distribution of root resorption
   lacunae and their percentage relative to total root volume, orthodontic
   tooth movement and periodontal ligament space. There was no significant
   difference in orthodontic tooth movement between the two sides. LIPUS
   significantly reduced the number of orthodontically induced inflammatory
   root resorption initiation areas by 71\%, reduced their total volume by
   68\% and reduced their volume relative to the affected root total volume
   by 70\%. LIPUS induced the formation of a precementum layer, thicker
   cementum and reparative cellular cementum. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{AlN nanotubes (NTs) have many novel characteristics and great potential
   applications in electronic and optoelectronic nanodevices. However,
   little is known about the influence of Mg-Al-O-N co-doping effects on
   their optical properties. Here, we focus on investigating the electronic
   structures, clarify the interband optical transition mechanism and give
   a clear atomic picture for the important electron/hole localization
   centre in AlN: Mg-Al-O-N NTs using the GGA-1/2 method. We find that the
   Mg-Al doping efficiency can be improved effectively due to ON doping in
   AlN NTs. The Mg-Al and ON form Mg-Al-O-N defect complex easily along the
   AlN NT axis (C-axis). The Mg-Al-O-N defect complex can result in a
   remarkable charge transfer around it and modify the valence band maximum
   and conduction band minimum significantly. Meanwhile, the Mg-Al-O-N
   defect complex also forms the important exciton localization centre and
   effectively enhances the interband radiative recombination rate.
   Moreover, the light emission/absorption sensitively depends on its
   polarization. The parallel polarized light (E parallel to C) is much
   stronger than the perpendicular one (E perpendicular to C). The
   Mg-Al-O-N co-doping thus paves a new way for improving the performance
   of electronic and optoelectronic nanodevices based on AlN NTs.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHS) are promising nature-inspired materials
   in low-temperature-condition applications to resist frost, ice, snow and
   water drop freezing. However, other observations bring into question the
   advantage of using SHS. In particular, the water supercooling phenomenon
   and the lack of characterization methods make it difficult to understand
   icing phenomena on SHS. Here, the authors bring about clarity by
   measuring water kinetic freezing points on surfaces of various
   wettabilites through differential scanning calorimetry technique. It is
   shown that under relatively dry environment, the freezing delay on cold
   surfaces is attributed to the water-freezing-point depression, which is
   determined by the combined effect of surface chemistry and roughness. In
   addition, drop-freezing tests using a thermoelectric cooler under humid
   atmosphere showed that the freezing delay is dependent on the frosting,
   as well. Frost crystals growing on the cold surface will act as nucleus
   initiating drop freezing. The results of this study provide new insights
   into the mechanism responsible for the drop-freezing delay on SHS. This
   article contains supporting information that is available online.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-wide oscillations are common in many industrial processes. They
   may impact the overall process performance and reduce profitability. It
   is important to detect and diagnose such oscillations. This paper
   reviews advances in diagnosis of plant-wide oscillations. The main focus
   of this study is on identifying possible root causes of oscillations
   using two techniques, one based on data analysis in the temporal and
   spectral domains and the other based on process connectivity analysis.
   The process data-based analysis provides an effective way to capture the
   difference between the root cause variable and the secondary propagated
   oscillating variables. It is shown that process topology-based methods
   are capable of finding oscillation propagation pathways and, thus, help
   in determining the root cause. This paper discusses and compares five
   such methods-spectral envelope, adjacency matrix, Granger causality,
   transfer entropy, and Bayesian network inference methods- by application

Abstract = {{Increasingly in practical applications, nonlinearity, non-Gaussianity,
   and constraint must be considered to obtain good state estimation. A
   constrained particle filter (PF) approach for state estimation, which
   involves three alternative strategies to impose the constraints on the
   prior particles, posterior particles, and state estimation has been
   proposed. First, to impose constraints on prior particles, a constrained
   Gibbs sampling method with a constrained inverse transform sampling is
   proposed to restrict sampling within the constraint region under cases
   of both univariate and coupling constraints. Second, to ensure validity
   of posterior particles, resampling is confined to the valid prior
   particles and the violated ones are discarded, which results in a
   similar formulation as the existing acceptance/rejection constrained PF
   method in literature. Third, if the state estimation violates the
   constraint, different from the existing methods that either discard all
   violated particles or accept all of them by projecting them onto the
   constraint region, the proposed method makes a balance between the prior
   and the likelihood function by adjusting the weights of violated and
   valid particles, respectively. Compared with the existing methods, the
   proposed method provides better physical interpretation and involves no
   restrictive assumptions about the distributions. Simulation results
   demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed methods. (c) 2014 American

Abstract = {{This investigation enabled the identification of a discontinuous crack
   growth mechanism of pipeline steels in near-neutral pH environments,
   which was determined from experimental simulations lasting more than 4
   months, using a novel experimental setup that had incorporated the
   synergistic effects of realistic mechanical loading and the changes of
   environments affected by coating disbonding and CO2 level in the system.
   The discontinuous crack growth occurs by repeated crack dormancy-active
   growth cycles. Crack.dormancy can be either mechanically or
   environmentally induced, while the active growth is initiated because of
   a combined effect of cyclic loading, stress concentration and hydrogen
   segregation and trapping. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Time-varying mesh stiffness, caused by the change of tooth contact
   number and contact position, is one of the main sources of vibration of
   a gear transmission system. In order to comprehensively understand the
   vibration properties of a planetary gear set, it is necessary to
   evaluate the mesh stiffness effectively. When a crack happens in one
   gear, the mesh stiffness will decrease and consequently the vibration
   properties of the gear system will change. This change of vibration can
   be characterized through dynamic simulation of a gearbox and processed
   further to detect the crack severity and location. In this paper, the
   potential energy method is used to analytically evaluate the mesh
   stiffness of a planetary gear set. A modified cantilever beam model is
   used to represent the external gear tooth and derive the analytical
   equations of the bending, shear and axial compressive stiffness. A crack
   propagation model is developed and the mesh stiffness reduction is
   quantified when a crack occurs in the sun gear or the planet gear. (C)

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials in biological solutions are known to interact with
   proteins and have been documented to affect protein function, such as
   enzyme activity. Understanding the interactions of nanoparticles with
   biological components at the molecular level will allow for rational
   designs of nanomaterials for use in medical technologies. Here we
   present the first detailed molecular mechanics model of functionalized
   gold nanoparticle (NP) interacting with an enzyme (l-lactate
   dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the
   response of LDH to the NP binding demonstrate that although atomic
   motions (dynamics) of the main chain exhibit only a minor response to
   the binding, the dynamics of side chains are significantly constrained
   in all four active sites that predict alteration in kinetic properties
   of the enzyme. It is also demonstrated that the 5 nm gold NPs cause a
   decrease in the maximal velocity of the enzyme reaction (V-max) and a
   trend towards a reduced affinity (increased K-m) for the -NAD binding
   site, while pyruvate enzyme kinetics (K-m and V-max) are not
   significantly altered in the presence of the gold NPs. These results
   demonstrate that modeling of NP:protein interactions can be used to
   understand alterations in protein function.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the quality of the recently developed

   sensitivity of pavement performance to climate conditions, predicted
   using the MEPDG, was also studied. The pavement performance predicted
   using the virtual weather station and existing weather station data was
   compared. From the pavement performance sensitivity study, it was found
   that the asphalt concrete, total pavement rutting and international
   roughness index show sensitivity to climate changes. It was also found
   that differences in the quality and duration of data for close-by
   stations can result in variation in the predicted performance. Overall,

Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{370}},
Pages = {{75-84}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{Accurate descriptions of the phase behavior and thermophysical
   properties of unconventional hydrocarbon resource + water mixtures are
   of great interest for their production, transport and refining. In this
   work, the phase behavior of ternary mixtures of Athabasca bitumen +
   toluene + water in the temperature range 473.2 to 573.5 K and pressure
   range 2.5 to 12.6 MPa are elucidated. Pressure-composition phase
   diagrams, solubility data for water in the hydrocarbon-rich phase, and
   the density of the water-saturated hydrocarbon phase are reported.
   Toluene + water binary exhibits Type IIIa phase behavior, where the
   toluene rich phase becomes critically identical with the vapor phase in
   the presence of a subcritical water-rich liquid phase. The Athabasca
   bitumen + water pseudo binary exhibits Type Bib phase behavior, where
   the water-rich liquid phase becomes critically identical with the vapor
   phase in the presence of a subcritical bitumen-rich phase. As toluene is
   added to the bitumen + water mixture, there is a transition in the order
   of liquid-vapor criticality. Further, the hydrocarbon-rich liquid phase
   becomes less dense than the water-rich liquid phase as toluene is added
   to the mixture. The boundary for the inversion of the phase density for
   mixtures of Athabasca bitumen + toluene + water is evaluated as a
   function of toluene composition, and these and other key features of the
   phase behavior and phase properties discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{214-221}},

Abstract = {{The sol-gel transition in the mixture system of oppositely charged
   polyelectrolyte (quaternized hydroxyethylcellulose ethoxylate, QHEC) and
   nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) induced by electrostatic adsorption
   interaction was investigated by rheological means. Winter and Chambon
   theory was validated to be applicable for the critical gel point
   determination, and critical gel point have been successfully determined.
   With QHEC concentration increasing, more NCC were needed to form a
   critical gel, and smaller loss tangent and relaxation exponent (n)
   values at the gel point were observed, indicating the elastic nature of
   mixture was enhanced with QHEC increase. Gel strength behaved as a
   function of both QHEC and NCC concentrations, suggesting the gel network
   at the critical point was composed of entanglements and association of
   QHEC macromolecular chains, as well as the electrostatic adsorption
   interaction between QHEC chains and NCC rods. The calculated number of
   NCC rods per junction decreased from 0.30 to 0.01 when the QHEC
   concentration increased from 1.0 wt\% to 3.0 wt\%, indicating the
   electrostatic adsorption interaction between the NCC rods and QHEC
   chains was less significant to gel formation at higher QHEC
   concentrations. Therefore, the exponents of scaling law eta(0) alpha
   epsilon(-gamma) and G(e) alpha epsilon(z) for the QHEC/NCC mixtures
   revealed that the scaling law n = z/(z + gamma) between n, gamma, and z
   was only feasible at highest QHEC concentration, since the
   intermolecular interaction (electrostatic adsorption interaction in this
   article) was so weak that can be neglected and the critical gel network
   was dominated by QHEC chain entanglements and association. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The rollover observed in the landslide size distribution, i.e., the
   deviation from power law behavior for small landslides, has not been
   previously described by a widely accepted physical interpretation. In
   this paper, the volume-to-failure-surface-area ratio V/S is proposed as
   an essential constraining factor for the emergence of the rollover. We
   first demonstrate that, from a three-dimensional perspective, landslide
   failures require a minimum threshold V/S value for a given mechanical
   configuration. The heterogeneity of the slope properties presents each
   potential landslide with a probability that V/S will exceed the
   threshold value, and further, results in a decay of frequency but not a
   cutoff for small landslides in the landslide size distribution.
   Empirical data show that the variance of the landslide shape is one
   aspect of the heterogeneity that can cause the inverse power law
   distribution of the landslide volume to decrease for smaller sizes.}},

Title = {{Gene perturbation and intervention in context-sensitive stochastic
   Boolean networks}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: In a gene regulatory network (GRN), gene expressions are
   affected by noise, and stochastic fluctuations exist in the interactions
   among genes. These stochastic interactions are context dependent, thus
   it becomes important to consider noise in a context-sensitive manner in
   a network model. As a logical model, context-sensitive probabilistic
   Boolean networks (CSPBNs) account for molecular and genetic noise in the
   temporal context of gene functions. In a CSPBN with n genes and k
   contexts, however, a computational complexity of O(nk(2)2(2n)) (or
   O(nk2(n))) is required for an accurate (or approximate) computation of
   the state transition matrix (STM) of the size (2(n).k) x (2(n).k) (or
   2(n) x 2(n)). The evaluation of a steady state distribution (SSD) is
   more challenging. Recently, stochastic Boolean networks (SBNs) have been
   proposed as an efficient implementation of an instantaneous PBN.
   Results: The notion of stochastic Boolean networks (SBNs) is extended
   for the general model of PBNs, i.e., CSPBNs. This yields a novel
   structure of context-sensitive SBNs (CSSBNs) for modeling the
   stochasticity in a GRN. A CSSBN enables an efficient simulation of a
   CSPBN with a complexity of O(nLk2(n)) for computing the state transition
   matrix, where L is a factor related to the required sequence length in
   CSSBN for achieving a desired accuracy. A time-frame expanded CSSBN can
   further efficiently simulate the stationary behavior of a CSPBN and
   allow for a tunable tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. The CSSBN
   approach is more efficient than an analytical method and more accurate
   than an approximate analysis.
   Conclusions: Context-sensitive stochastic Boolean networks (CSSBNs) are
   proposed as an efficient approach to modeling the effects of gene
   perturbation and intervention in gene regulatory networks. A CSSBN
   analysis provides biologically meaningful insights into the oscillatory
   dynamics of the p53 Mdm2 network in a context-switching environment. It
   is shown that random gene perturbation has a greater effect on the final
   distribution of the steady state of a network compared to context
   switching activities. The CSSBN approach can further predict the steady
   state distribution of a glioma network under gene intervention.
   Ultimately, this will help drug discovery and develop effective drug
   intervention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Two aspects of nanonickel particle injection into porous media were
   studied: stabilization and transportation. Three different surfactants
   {[}sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
   (CTAB), and Tergitol Np-9] and xanthan gum polymer were tested for
   stabilization of the nanoparticles. In the analysis of these tests,
   zeta-potential, size distribution measurements, and sedimentation
   photographs were used. The observations were analyzed using the
   classical DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek) theory. Only
   xanthan gum polymer could stabilize the particles for a sufficient time,
   which is required to transport into the oil reservoir. The interaction
   of the nanoparticles, stabilized in xanthan gum solution, with the oil
   phase was studied by visualization experiments. It was observed that the
   transfer of particles to oil water interfaces requires modification of
   the surface charges of the oil phase. This was achieved by CTAB
   surfactant. The ionic interactions of the polymer and the surfactant and
   the presence of oil phase were found to be of utmost importance in this
   process. The micromodel visualization experiments were also conducted to
   study the interactions between the injected chemicals with oil and rock
   matrix. These experiments showed that, when injected with the proposed
   method, the nickel particles moved to the oil water interface or
   attached to the matrix without agglomeration. The distribution of the
   particles depends on the heterogeneity of the medium and the injection
   rate.}},

Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{With growing, accessible natural gas reserves, there is renewed interest
   in natural gas engines for the wider automotive market. A potential
   issue, if legislated, is controlling (reducing) the un-combusted CH4
   emissions. The key challenge in catalytic CH4 oxidation is the high
   temperature required, relative to other hydrocarbon species. In this
   context, a monolith-supported Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was evaluated for CH4
   combustion under fuel lean and fuel rich mixtures using temperature
   programmed reaction (TPRxn) and step-change temperature and oxygen level
   experiments. The experiments included performance evaluation during both
   ignition (increasing temperature) and extinction (decreasing temperature
   after ignition). Conversion hysteresis was observed, with the
   conversions during extinction higher than those during ignition under
   fuel lean or stoichiometric combustion reaction conditions. Results
   obtained demonstrate that this hysteresis effect can be used to achieve
   high CH4 oxidation conversions at temperatures lower than that required
   for ignition, admittedly first through using high temperatures to obtain
   ignition, then lowering the temperature to take advantage of the
   hysteresis. Results also suggest that changing O-2 levels can lead to
   similar benefits. With the assumption that lean conditions and lower
   exhaust temperatures are associated with improved fuel economy, while
   higher exhaust temperatures and fuel rich conditions lead to higher CH4
   oxidation rates over the catalyst, the findings presented clearly
   demonstrate the potential to achieve both via a cyclic operating
   approach, with the frequency on the order of 10 s of minutes. Data
   obtained when cycling between temperatures above and below the ignition
   point and between excess O-2 and stoichiometric O-2 levels proved this
   hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   onto a cantilever, its surface area is increased by 2 orders of
   magnitude and the surface is converted into a preconcentrator. Resonant
   excitation of adsorbed molecules using IR radiation causes the
   cantilever to bend due to temperature changes originating from the
   nonradiative decay process. The porous structure of the cantilever
   increases its thermomechanical sensitivity as well as the number of
   adsorbed molecules. The system performance was demonstrated by detecting
   binary explosive mixtures under ambient conditions. The TiO2 sensor

Abstract = {{For a pneumatic teleoperation system with on/off solenoid valves,
   sliding mode control laws for position and force ensuring low switching
   (open/close) activity of the valves are developed. Since each pneumatic
   actuator has two pneumatic chambers with a total of four on/off valves,
   16 possible combinations ('operating modes') for the valves' on/off
   positions exist, but only seven of which are both functional and unique.
   While previous work has focused on three-mode sliding-based position
   control of one pneumatic actuator, this paper develops the seven-mode
   sliding-based bilateral control of a teleoperation system comprising a
   pair of pneumatic actuators. The proposed bilateral sliding control
   schemes are experimentally validated on a pair of actuators utilizing
   position-position and force-position teleoperation architectures. The
   results demonstrate that leveraging the additional modes of operation
   leads to more efficient and smoother control of the pneumatic
   teleoperation system. It was found that viscous friction forces were
   crippling haptic feedback in the position-position architecture. Through
   the use of force sensors, the force-position architecture was able to
   compensate for the heavy viscous friction forces.}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic approaches are common in the analysis of reliability of
   complex engineering systems. However, they require quantitative
   historical failure data for determining reliability characteristics. In
   many real-world areas, such as e.g., nuclear engineering, quantitative
   historical failure data are unavailable or become inadequate and only
   qualitative data such as expert opinions, which are described in
   linguistic terms, can be collected and then used to assess system
   reliability. Moreover, experts are more comfortable justifying event
   failure likelihood using linguistic terms, which capture uncertainties
   rather than by expressing judgments in a quantitative manner. New
   techniques are therefore needed that will help construct models of
   reliability of complex engineering system without being confined to
   quantitative historical failure data. The objective of this study is to
   develop a fuzzy reliability algorithm to effectively generate basic
   event failure probabilities without reliance on quantitative historical
   failure data through qualitative data processing. The originality of
   this study comes with an introduction of linguistic values articulated
   in terms of component failure possibilities in order to qualitatively
   assess basic event failure possibilities treated as inputs of the
   proposed model and generate basic event failure probabilities as its
   outputs. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm, actual basic event failure probabilities collected
   from nuclear power plant operating experiences are compared with the
   failure probabilities generated by the algorithm. The results
   demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy reliability algorithm arises as a
   suitable alternative for the probabilistic reliability approach when
   quantitative historical failure data are unavailable. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   cells (50:50 wt\% NiO:YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) or 34:66 vol.\%
   Ni:YSZ) as the fuel electrode and YSZ as the electrolyte) under SOFC
   (solid oxide fuel cell) and SOEC (solid oxide electrolysis cell) modes
   were studied in this research. LSM (La0.80Sr0.20MnO3-delta) was
   infiltrated into a thin porous YSZ layer to form the oxygen electrode of
   both cells and, in addition, SDC (Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9) was infiltrated into
   the fuel electrode of one of the cells. The microstructure of the
   infiltrated fuel cells showed a suitable distribution of fine LSM and
   SDC particles (50-100 nm) near the interface of electrodes and
   electrolyte and throughout the bulk of the electrodes. The results show
   that SDC infiltration not only enhances the electrochemical reaction in
   SOFC mode but improves the performance even more in SOEC mode. In
   addition, LSM infiltrated electrodes also boost the SOEC performance in
   comparison with standard LSM YSZ composite electrodes, due to the
   well-dispersed LSM nanoparticles (favouring the electrochemical
   reactions) within the YSZ porous matrix. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen

Abstract = {{Lab-scale ethane dehydrogenation experiments with natural mordenite
   disks in a membrane reactor showed an increase in ethane conversion and
   ethylene yield compared to their equilibrium values. Experiments
   performed with larger membrane permeation area confirmed the trend that
   higher conversions are expected as the ratio of product permeation and
   product formation rates increases. Using the lab-scale membrane reactor
   module an ethylene yield enhancement of similar to 17\% was observed at
   500 degrees C. At a higher reaction temperature (550 degrees C), ethane
   dehydrogenation experiments resulted in a similar to 10\% ethylene yield
   enhancement versus 6\% for comparative experiments at 500 degrees C. At
   550 degrees C the membrane reactor effectiveness improved since the H-2
   permeation rate increased proportionally more than its formation rate.
   This material screening test revealed natural mordenite as a material to
   be considered in the development of highly-integrated membrane reactor
   modules for dehydrogenation of alkanes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The effects of three types of defect (i.e., two micro defects-broken
   fibers and separation of fiber joints and one macro defect-crack) on the
   mechanical properties of porous metal fiber sintered sheets (MFSSs) are
   investigated by a combination of numerical simulation, analytical
   modeling, and experimental test. All simulations are based upon the
   previously developed micromechanics random beam model (Jin et al.,
   2013). Broken fibers are realized by removing cell edges (i.e., fibers
   between two joints) in an otherwise perfect model. Their induced
   decreases in the elastic moduli and strengths are found to be much lower
   than those of two dimensional (2D) foams and Kagome grids. For the
   defect in the form of separation of fiber joints, both analytical and
   numerical models are developed. The predicted linear decreases in the
   moduli and strengths (except for the compressive strength) with
   increasing number of separated fiber joints indicate that MFSSs be
   insensitive to the defect of joint separation. To explore the effect of
   crack, fracture toughness of MFSSs is measured and is found to be
   significantly higher than that of metal foams of the same relative
   density (i.e., volume fraction of the constituent solid material). The
   underlying ductile mechanism of MFSSs is further investigated by
   numerical simulations, showing that plastic deformation spreads all over
   the fibers in ligament rather than concentrates around crack tip. This
   study shows that MFSSs are superior in view of their resistance to the
   considered micro-defects and crack. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{254}},

Abstract = {{High performance anode supported proton-conducting solid oxide fuel
   cells (PC-SOFC) were fabricated and their performance in syngas was
   studied. PC-SOFC button cells produced a maximum power density of 812 mW
   cm(-2) in H-2 at 750 degrees C. It was found that the CO-containing feed
   streams could drastically degrade the performance of PC-SOFC. Based on
   the experimental results and the theoretical analysis, the detailed
   process of the CO-induced Ni catalyst deactivation was identified. This
   process could be divided into three distinguishable stages during the
   continuous exposure of the Ni catalyst in the CO-containing environment.
   The first stage could be described using the CO surface active site
   blocking mechanism, which was further confirmed by CO/H-2 competitive
   adsorption model. The second stage deactivation was proposed to be
   related to the carbon deposition at TPB (Triple-phase Boundary). The
   deactivation during this stage was accelerated by the electrochemical
   conversion of H-2. The last stage was attributed to the coking of Ni
   catalyst and the resulted metal dusting effect. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{202-211}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltene destabilization during solvent-based heavy oil and bitumen
   recovery applications is a common problem due to continuous changes of
   temperature, pressure, and oil composition. The effects of these
   characteristics on the recovery performance should be investigated for a
   wide range of solvent and oil types. In this paper, two heavy oil
   samples from fields in Alberta, Canada were destabilized using three
   different types of paraffin: propane, n-hexane, and n-decane. The
   solvent-based process was conducted at different reservoir conditions
   with alterations made to the temperature, pressure, and oil composition
   to determine the effect on asphaltene flocculation in the produced fluid
   and its deposition on the rock surface. Initially, experiments were
   carried out using a pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) cell at
   different reservoir pressures and under different temperature
   conditions. Next, a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Scanning Electron
   Microscope (SEM) were used to characterize the morphology of the organic
   deposition on the glass beads surface through core flooding experiments.
   The results obtained through these two sets of experiments showed that
   temperature, pressure and oil compositions have a critical influence on
   asphaltene solubility. The PVT cell experiments and organic deposition
   surface roughness calculations were fundamentally important to explain
   the plugging formation in the reservoir under different operational
   conditions and with different oil types. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dispersion-correcting potentials (DCPs) are atom-centered Gaussian
   functions that are applied in a manner that is similar to effective core
   potentials. Previous work on DCPs has focussed on their use as a simple
   means of improving the ability of conventional density-functional theory
   methods to predict the binding energies of noncovalently bonded
   molecular dimers. We show in this work that DCPs developed for use with
   the LC-omega PBE functional along with 6-31+G(2d,2p) basis sets are
   capable of simultaneously improving predicted noncovalent binding
   energies of van der Waals dimer complexes and covalent bond dissociation
   enthalpies in molecules. Specifically, the DCPs developed herein for the
   C, H, N, and O atoms provide binding energies for a set of 66
   noncovalently bonded molecular dimers (the ``S66{''} set) with a mean
   absolute error (MAE) of 0.21 kcal/mol, which represents an improvement
   of more than a factor of 10 over unadorned LC-omega PBE/6-31+G(2d,2p)
   and almost a factor of two improvement over LC-.PBE/6-31+ G(2d, 2p) used
   in conjunction with the ``D3{''} pairwise dispersion energy corrections.
   In addition, the DCPs reduce theMAE of calculated X-H and X-Y (X,Y = C,
   H, N, O) bond dissociation enthalpies for a set of 40 species from 3.2
   kcal/mol obtained with unadorned LC-.PBE/6-31+G(2d,2p) to 1.6 kcal/mol.
   Our findings demonstrate that broad improvements to the performance of
   DFT methods may be achievable through the use of DCPs. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyurethane elastomers have commonly
   been used to manufacture mushroom shaped gecko-inspired dry adhesives
   with high normal adhesion strength. However, the thermosetting nature of
   these two materials severely limits the commercial viability of their
   manufacturing due to long curing times and high material costs. In this
   work, we introduce poly(styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene) (SEBS)
   thermoplastic elastomers as an alternative for the manufacture of
   mushroom shaped dry adhesives with both directional and nondirectional
   performance. These materials are attractive for their potential to be
   less contaminating via oligomer transfer than thermoset elastomers, as
   well as being more suited to mass manufacturing. Low material transfer
   properties are attractive for adhesives that could potentially be used
   in cleanroom environments for microscale assembly and handling in which
   device contamination is a serious concern. We characterized a
   thermoplastic elastomer in terms of oligomer transfer using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy and found that the SEBS transfers negligible
   amounts of its own oligomers, during contact with a gold-coated silicon
   surface, which may be representative of the metallic bond pads found in
   micro-electro-mechanical systems devices. We also demonstrate the
   fabrication of mushroom shaped isotropic and anisotropic adhesive fibers
   with two different SEBS elastomer grades using thermocompression molding
   and characterize the adhesives in terms of their shear-enhanced normal
   adhesion strength. The overall adhesion of one of the thermoplastic
   elastomer adhesives was found to be stronger or comparable to their
   polyurethane counterparts with identical dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant-free emulsions are prepared using bi-wetting particles which
   occupy the oil water interface to effectively reduce the oil water
   interfacial area. The equilibrium position of the particle at the
   interface is determined by its wettability. CO2-reponsive chemical
   functional groups are grafted onto the surface of silica particles.
   Particles with only CO2-switchable functional groups are capable of
   stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. Particles prepared with both
   CO2-responsive and hydrophobic chemical functional groups on its surface
   are capable of stabilizing water-in-oil emulsions. Emulsion stability is
   disturbed when the wettability of the stabilizing particle is altered by
   introducing CO2 gas to the biphasic mixture, leading to phase separation
   of emulsions prepared using the functionalized particles. The emulsion
   stability can be re-established by the removal of CO2 through air
   sparging. The presence of CO2 imposes positive surface charge to the
   responsive particles, increasing wettability and, consequently, the
   ability of the particles to destabilize emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional mathematical model was developed to study competitive
   adsorption of n-component mixtures in a fixed-bed adsorber. The model
   consists of an isotherm equation to predict adsorption equilibria of
   n-component volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mixture from single
   component isotherm data, and a dynamic adsorption model, the macroscopic
   mass, energy and momentum conservation equations, to simulate the
   competitive adsorption of the n-components onto a fixed-bed of
   adsorbent. The model was validated with experimentally measured data of
   competitive adsorption of binary and eight-component VOCs mixtures onto
   beaded activated carbon (BAC). The mean relative absolute error (MRAE)
   was used to compare the modeled and measured breakthrough profiles as
   well as the amounts of adsorbates adsorbed. For the binary and
   eight-component mixtures, the MRAE of the breakthrough profiles was 13
   and 12\%, respectively, whereas, the MRAE of the adsorbed amounts was 1
   and 2\%, respectively. These data show that the model provides accurate
   prediction of competitive adsorption of multicomponent VOCs mixtures and
   the competitive adsorption isotherm equation is able to accurately
   predict equilibrium adsorption of VOCs mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Key-point trajectory based approaches to recognizing human actions in
   realistic videos have recently shown promising results. However, their
   coverage of the entire actor is not sufficient for describing human
   actions, and the trajectories often disappear due to partial occlusions.
   In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on weighted feature
   trajectories and concatenated bag-of-features (BOF) using weighted
   spatio-temporal descriptors to overcome these limitations. To capture
   spatio-temporal regions of interest (ROI), we first build
   scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) trajectories based on matching
   SIFT descriptors. Then, we extract particle trajectories around the SIFT
   trajectories using dense optical flow to retain ROI subsidiarily and to
   give a sound coverage of the actors. For balancing the leverages between
   SIFT and particle trajectories, a weighting scheme is presented
   according to the accumulated global distribution of feature points.
   Furthermore, we propose the concatenated two distinct SIFT and particle
   BOFs with weighted spatio-temporal descriptors for action recognition.
   Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in
   challenging real-world action datasets such as KTH, UCF sports, and TV
   human interaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An in vitro study was conducted in the Alberta idealized child
   mouth-throat, which mimics average deposition in a set of nine
   6-14-year-old subjects, to examine the enhancement of deposition of
   monodisperse uniformly charged particles as a result of induced
   electrostatic forces. A purpose-based atomizer was designed and built
   for generating monodisperse, uniformly charged particles. The atomizer
   generates droplets by jet break up under the action of capillary waves
   and charges them via electrostatic induction. The experiments cover
   different particle aerodynamic diameters (d (a) = 3.6, 4.4, and 5.9 mu
   m), at two flow rates (Q = 10 and 20 L/min), over a wide range of
   elementary charges per particle (0-10,000 e). The results show
   substantial increases in particle deposition in the present idealized
   pediatric mouth throat compared to neutral aerosols. Two empirical
   equations, as a function of Reynolds number, Stokes number, and induced
   charge number are introduced for the prediction of mouth-throat
   deposition in children, based on two different characteristic diameters

   Using Fluorescence}},
Journal = {{Jove-Journal of Visualized Experiments}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{87}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Algae are considered excellent candidates for renewable fuel sources due
   to their natural lipid storage capabilities. Robust monitoring of algal
   fermentation processes and screening for new oil-rich strains requires a
   fast and reliable protocol for determination of intracellular lipid
   content. Current practices rely largely on gravimetric methods to
   determine oil content, techniques developed decades ago that are time
   consuming and require large sample volumes. In this paper, Nile Red, a
   fluorescent dye that has been used to identify the presence of lipid
   bodies in numerous types of organisms, is incorporated into a simple,
   fast, and reliable protocol for measuring the neutral lipid content of
   Auxenochlorella protothecoides, a green alga. The method uses ethanol, a
   relatively mild solvent, to permeabilize the cell membrane before
   staining and a 96 well micro-plate to increase sample capacity during
   fluorescence intensity measurements. It has been designed with the
   specific application of monitoring bioprocess performance. Previously
   dried samples or live samples from a growing culture can be used in the
   assay.}},

Pages = {{139-145}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The main object of this study was to use a geometric morphometric
   approach to quantify the left-right symmetry of talus bones.
   Methods
   Analysis was carried out using CT scan images of 11 pairs of intact
   tali. Two important geometric parameters, volume and surface area, were
   quantified for left and right talus bones. The geometric shape
   variations between the right and left talus bones were also measured
   using deviation analysis. Furthermore, location of asymmetry in the
   geometric shapes were identified.
   Results
   Numerical results showed that talus bones are bilaterally symmetrical in
   nature, and the difference between the surface area of the left and
   right talus bones was less than 7.5\%. Similarly, the difference in the
   volume of both bones was less than 7.5\%. Results of the
   three-dimensional (3D) deviation analyses demonstrated the mean
   deviation between left and right talus bones were in the range of -0.74
   mm to 0.62 mm. It was observed that in eight of 11 subjects, the
   deviation in symmetry occurred in regions that are clinically less
   important during talus surgery.
   Conclusions
   We conclude that left and right talus bones of intact human ankle joints
   show a strong degree of symmetry. The results of this study may have
   significance with respect to talus surgery, and in investigating
   traumatic talus injury where the geometric shape of the contralateral
   talus can be used as control.}},

Abstract = {{Because of low efficiencies and the high cost of the individual
   injection of steam and solvent for heavy-oil recovery, their hybrid
   applications have gained significant attention recently. Although
   numerous laboratory studies exist and there are a considerable number of
   field projects for sandstone environments, fractured carbonates lack
   technologies to drain matrix oil efficiently. An alternative-method
   injection of solvent and steam was proposed and tested earlier
   (Babadagli and Al-Bahlani 2008). This process applies steam initially to
   condition the matrix oil for succeeding solvent injection and steam
   reinjection to retrieve solvent in the matrix and to recover additional
   upgraded oil. The present study uses carbon dioxide (CO2) as a solvent
   and compares it with hydrocarbon solvents in this type of application.
   To clarify the physics of the process and to test the applicability of
   the method for different reservoir and injection conditions, we
   conducted a series of experiments by first injecting steam, followed by
   CO2 injection. In the third cycle, steam was injected again to produce
   upgraded oil in the matrix. The experiments were performed under static
   conditions (soaking sand and carbonate samples in steam or CO2 chambers)
   at different temperatures and pressures. CO2 is shown to be a reasonable
   alternative for hydrocarbon solvents in such a process in terms of cost
   and benefits by reducing the solvent expenses, keeping the
   oil-production levels, and disposing of a greenhouse gas.}},

Abstract = {{The province of Alberta has a high demand of thermal energy for both
   industrial and residential applications. Currently, the vast majority of
   the heat used in these applications is obtained by burning natural gas.
   Geothermal energy production from deep aquifer systems in the
   sedimentary basin could provide an alternative sustainable source of
   heat that would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   To date there has been no geothermal field development in Alberta
   because the average geothermal gradient was considered to be too low for
   economic geothermal energy generation. However, with new technologies
   for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), it may be possible to develop
   geothermal resources from the sedimentary rocks in the Western Canadian
   Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). A numerical feasibility study based on a
   regional geological model and existing and newly gained data was
   conducted to identify scenarios for geothermal energy production in the
   region.
   In central Alberta, three Devonian carbonate formations (Cooking Lake,
   Nisku, Wabamun) and the Cambrian Basal Sandstone Unit were identified as
   the highest geothermal potential zones. Thermal-hydraulic reservoir
   simulations for a 5 km x 5 km site in the city of Edmonton were
   performed to evaluate reservoir development concepts for these four
   potential target formations: therefore, hydraulic fracturing treatments
   were also simulated. Different utilization concepts are presented for
   possible applications of geothermal energy generation in residential,
   industrial and agricultural areas.
   The Cooking Lake formation and the Basal Sandstone Unit are potentially
   the most promising reservoirs because the most heat can be extracted and
   the applications for the heat are widespread although the costs are
   higher than utilizing the shallower formations. Reservoir stimulation
   considerably improves the economics in all formations. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, we adopt a novel efficiency measure, namely the received
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) per unit power, in amplify-and-forward (AF)
   relay networks. The measure is addressed as the power-normalized SNR
   (PN-SNR). For several relay network scenarios, we solve the PN-SNR
   maximization problems and analyze the network performance. First, for
   single-relay networks, we find the optimal relay power control scheme
   that maximizes the PN-SNR for a given transmitter power. Then, for
   multi-relay networks with a sum relay power constraint, we prove that
   the PN-SNR optimization problem has a unique maximum, thus the globally
   optimal solution can be found using a gradient-ascent algorithm.
   Finally, for multi-relay networks with an individual power constraint on
   each relay, we propose an algorithm to obtain the globally optimal
   solution and also a low complexity algorithm for a suboptimal solution.
   Our results show that with the same average relay transmit power, the
   PN-SNR maximizing scheme is superior to the fixed relay power scheme not
   only in PN-SNR but also in the outage probability for both single and
   multi-relay networks. Compared with SNR-maximizing scheme, it is
   significantly superior in PN-SNR with moderate degradation in outage
   probability. Our results show the potential of using PN-SNR as
   efficiency measure in network design.}},

Abstract = {{While most previous work in the subject of Bayesian Fault diagnosis and
   control loop diagnosis use discretized evidence for performing diagnosis
   (an example of evidence being a monitor reading), discretizing
   continuous evidence can result in information loss. This paper proposes
   the use of kernel density estimation, a non-parametric technique for
   estimating the density functions of continuous random variables. Kernel
   density estimation requires the selection of a bandwidth parameter, used
   to specify the degree of smoothing, and a number of bandwidth selection
   techniques (optimal Gaussian, sample-point adaptive, and smoothed
   cross-validation) are discussed and compared. Because kernel density
   estimation is known to have reduced performance in high dimensions, this
   paper also discusses a number of existing preprocessing methods that can
   be used to reduce the dimensionality (grouping according to dependence,
   and independent component analysis). Bandwidth selection and
   dimensionality reduction techniques are tested on a simulation and an
   industrial process. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we focus on distributed moving horizon estimation (DMHE)
   of nonlinear systems subject to time-varying communication delays. In
   particular, a class of nonlinear systems composed of subsystems
   interacting with each other via their states is considered. In the
   proposed design, an observer-enhanced moving horizon state estimator
   (MHE) is designed for each subsystem. The distributed MHEs exchange
   information via a shared communication network. To handle communication
   delays, an open-loop state predictor is designed for each subsystem to
   provide predictions of unavailable subsystem states (due to delays).
   Based on the predictions, an auxiliary nonlinear observer is used to
   generate a reference subsystem state estimate for each subsystem. The
   reference subsystem state estimate is used to formulate a confidence
   region for the actual subsystem state. The MHE of a subsystem is only
   allowed to optimize its subsystem state estimate within the
   corresponding confidence region. Under the assumption that there is an
   upper bound on the time-varying delays, the proposed DMHE is proved to
   give decreasing and ultimately bounded estimation error. The theoretical
   results are illustrated via the application to a reactor-separator
   chemical process. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study employed the wavelet empirical orthogonal function (WEOF)
   analysis to analyse the nonstationary variability of rainfall in
   Ethiopia and global sea surface temperature (SST) for 1900-1998. The
   study found that the nonstationary variations of both the June to
   September (JJAS) and February to May (FMAM) Ethiopian rainfall can be
   delineated into three zones: western half of Ethiopia north of the Great
   Rift Valley (GRV), southern Ethiopia south of the GRV and the GRV from
   southwestern Ethiopia to the Afar Triangle. The leading wavelet
   principal component (WPC) signals showed that Ethiopian rainfall had
   been in stagnation for most of 1900-1998, with major droughts in the
   1940s and 1980s. The dominant frequencies of Ethiopian rainfall ranged
   between 2 and 8 years. In western Ethiopia, the 2-4-year rainfall
   frequencies dominated the rainfall variation, but their trends are
   modulated by 5-7-year frequencies, whereas in the Afar Triangle, the
   5-7-year frequencies were dominant. Between 1900 and 1998, the Afar
   Triangle region experienced decreasing rainfall for 60 years
   (1900-1960). The seasonal global SST revealed that regardless of what
   time of the year, the strongest contributions to global SST variations
   occur in the Antarctic Ocean, the El Nino region of South America and in
   the southwestern Pacific Ocean, followed by the Atlantic and the Indian
   Oceans. Further, this study also shows annual migrations of SST
   variations in the El Nino region, the Antarctic and the Atlantic Oceans.
   The leading SST signal variations show that SST warming started in the
   Atlantic and Indian Oceans, from 1950 to 1975, and spread to the
   Antarctic Ocean between 1960 and 1990, which probably contributed to the
   melting of sea ice. Teleconnections between WPC1 of Ethiopian rainfall
   and SST scale-averaged wavelet power were found for the El Nino region
   and northern Atlantic, west of the Sahara desert.}},

Abstract = {{Symmetry is a trait that has been extensively reviewed, especially
   clinically, as an indication of ideal geometry and health. Many
   geometric symmetry assessment techniques rely on two-dimensional
   measurements that do not account for the three-dimensional nature of the
   object. In this article, two methods, reflection and a process termed
   rotoinversion, a combination of reflection and rotation, are presented
   as potential methods to assess an object's deviation from symmetry. With
   reflection, the geometric models are reflected about a calculated best
   plane of symmetry. With rotoinversion, the models are reflected about an
   arbitrary plane and then rigidly translated and rotated to best align
   the translated and original models. The methods give the same results
   for bilaterally symmetric objects, but different results for bilaterally
   and rotationally symmetric objects. The two methods are applied to
   assess asymmetry in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis torso geometric
   models, producing similar results. There was an angle of 0.408 degrees
   between the normal to the plane of reflection from the reflection
   process and the normal from the rotoinversion process and average
   rotation of 0.067 degrees from rotoinversion. The most appropriate
   method depends on the purpose of the symmetry assessment and must be
   determined on a case-by-case basis.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic transmit aperture (STA) ultrasound imaging offers near-ideal
   reconstruction across an entire field of view. This performance comes at
   the cost of SNR compared with scanning using only dynamic receive
   focusing. SNR may be enhanced by using spatial encoding using a Hadamard
   sequence. An encoding based on a Hadamard sequence has two main
   drawbacks: the array must be capable of transmitting a pulse and an
   inverted pulse at the same time, and the inverted transmission must be
   symmetrical with respect to the non-inverted transmission. These are
   often not the case in practice, and thus Hadamard encoding may require
   twice as many transmission events and special consideration of the
   inverted waveform. As an alternative, we propose the use of S-sequences,
   which are similar to Hadamard sequences, but use half the elements and
   do not require an inverted pulse. This encoding is implemented on a
   commercial ultrasound system and compared with STA imaging using
   single-element emissions and Hadamard encoding in terms of SNR and
   resolution using a point target. We find that the two encodings perform
   very similarly despite the increased transmit power and doubling of
   transmit events in our implementation of Hadamard imaging. Both
   encodings give up to 19 dB signal improvement over single-element STA
   imaging, while maintaining resolution. Finally, we show sample in vivo
   human carotid images with all three methods which illustrate the
   suitability of S-sequence-encoded STA imaging for a clinical setting.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a critical analysis of submerged flow over
   rectangular weirs of finite crest length. For finite crest length weirs,
   because the existing data sets are not extensive, new experiments for
   these weirs with sharp-edged and rounded crest were conducted. Based on
   these data, a diagram is developed to show the variation of the
   normalized tailwater depth with h(o)/L where h(o) is the free flow head
   and L is the length of the crest, to predict the onset of submergence or
   the modular limit. Water surface profiles of flow over weirs of finite
   crest length with square-edge and rounded crests were plotted to study
   the formation of waves in modular and submerged conditions.
   Characteristics length scales such as wave length and amplitude at the
   modularity limit and the location of the first trough downstream of the
   weir were measured to generalize surface profiles at different flow
   discharges. An empirical equation for the discharge reduction factor was
   also formulated. This equation has two exponents with different values
   for several classes of finite crest length weirs with either square
   edged or rounded crest. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

   slurry pressure loss gradients}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{329-336}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Pipeline transport in the form of a slurry can reduce the cost of
   transportation of biomass material to a bioreflnery, as compared to
   trucks. This research experimentally studies the hydraulics of slurries
   of wheat straw with water for pipeline transport. Slurries with a range
   of particle sizes and saturated solid mass fractions are examined in a
   laboratoryscale 50 mm diameter carbon steel pipeline system. Slurries
   with particles approximately 3 mm long can flow with saturated solid
   mass fractions of up to 30\%. Pressure loss gradients results suggest
   the influence of drag reducing fibre suspensions. This phenomenon
   enables slurry pressure losses to be below that of the carrier fluid
   alone (water) and be achieved with sufficiently long particle sizes, low
   saturated solid mass fractions and high velocities. Our results suggest
   that to reduce pressure losses per unit biomass material, slurries
   should have short particle sizes, to allow high saturated solid mass
   fractions to be pumped at low velocities. With the pipeline system and
   slurries examined in this study, slurries with particles approximately 3
   mm long and saturated solid mass fractions of 20 30\% pumped at 1.5 m
   s(-1) experience the lowest pressure losses. This result helps in the
   design and optimal operation of biomass slurry pipeline systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Here we provide the first report on several compositions of ternary
   Sn-Ge-Sb thin film alloys for application as sodium ion battery (aka
   NIB, NaB or SIB) anodes, employing Sn50Ge50, Sb50Ge50, and pure Sn, Ge,
   Sb as baselines. Sn33Ge33Sb33, Sn50Ge25Sb25, Sn60Ge20Sb20, and Sn50Ge50
   all demonstrate promising electrochemical behavior, with Sn50Ge25Sb25
   being the best overall. This alloy has an initial reversible specific
   capacity of 833 mAhg(-1) (at 85 mAg(-1)) and 662 mAhg(-1) after 50
   charge discharge cycles. Sn50Ge25Sb25 also shows excellent rate
   capability, displaying a stable capacity of 381 mAhg(-1) at a current
   density of 8500 mAg(-1) (similar to 10C). A survey of published
   literature indicates that 833 mAhg(-1) is among the highest reversible
   capacities reported for a Sn-based NIB anode, while 381 mAhg(-1)
   represents the optimum fast charge value. HRTEM shows that Sn50Ge25Sb25
   Is a composite of 10-15 nm Sn and Sn-alloyed Ge nanocrystallites that
   are densely dispersed within an amorphous matrix. Comparing the
   microstructures of alloys where the capacity significantly exceeds the
   rule of mixtures prediction to those where it does not leads us to
   hypothesize that this new phenomenon originates from the Ge(Sn) that is
   able to sodiate beyond the 1:1 Na:Ge ratio reported for the pure
   element. Combined TOF-SIMS, EELS TEM, and FIB analysis demonstrates
   substantial Na segregation within the film near the current collector
   interface that is present as early as the second discharge, followed by
   cycling-induced delamination from the current collector.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveBrain imaging studies have shown widespread structural
   abnormalities in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) within and
   beyond the affected temporal lobe, suggesting an altered network. Graph
   theoretical analysis based on white matter tractography has provided a
   new perspective to evaluate the connectivity of the brain. The
   alterations in the topologic properties of a whole brain white matter
   network in patients with TLE remain unknown. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the white matter network in a cohort of patients with
   left TLE and mesial temporal sclerosis (mTLE) compared to healthy
   controls.
   MethodsAnatomic brain networks of 16 patients with left mTLE were
   compared to those of 21 healthy controls. A white matter structural
   network was constructed from diffusion tensor tractography for each
   participant, and network parameters were compared between the patient
   and control groups.
   ResultsPatients with left mTLE exhibited concurrent decreases of global
   and local efficiencies and widespread reduction of regional efficiency
   in ipsilateral temporal, bilateral frontal, and bilateral parietal
   areas. Communication hubs, such as the left precuneus, were also altered
   in patients with mTLE compared to controls.
   SignificanceOur results demonstrate white matter network disruption in
   patients with left mTLE, supporting the notion that mTLE is a systemic
   brain disorder. A PowerPoint slide summarizing this article is available
   for download in the Supporting Information section .}},

Abstract = {{New infinite-series expressions are obtained for the probability density
   function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
   instantaneous end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of dual-hop
   amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying systems operating over Rician fading
   channels and dissimilar dual-hop AF systems operating over mixed
   Nakagami-m/Rician fading channels. Precise analytical solutions for
   outage probability, as well as precise single-integral solutions for the
   ergodic capacity and the average symbol error probability, are obtained.
   Simulation results are used to verify the solutions obtained. It is
   shown that the limiting slopes of the average symbol error probability
   curves and the outage probability curves are not affected by the Rician
   fading parameter in contrast to the case of Nakagami-m fading links. For
   the case of mixed fading links, the exact performance metrics are
   compared to performance bounds in the literature. It is shown that the
   existing performance bounds are not tight for medium ranges of SNR. The
   effects of the Rician and Nakagami-m fading parameters on the system
   performance are also studied. It is shown that, while increasing the
   Rician parameter results in a notable SNR gain, increasing the
   Nakagami-m parameter results in a negligible improvement in the system
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{The colloidal gas aphron (CGA) drilling fluids are designed to minimize
   formation damage by blocking pores of the rock with microbubbles and
   reducing the filtration loss.
   In order to gain a better understanding of the factors controlling the
   pore blocking mechanisms of microbubbles, a set of core flooding
   experiments was conducted by using various CGA drilling fluid
   formulations. The differential pressure drop along the sand-pack was
   measured.
   Effects of CGA fluid composition, flow rates, type of reservoir
   saturating fluids, permeability and wettability on the resistance to CGA
   drilling fluid flow through porous media (i.e., pressure drop due to CGA
   fluid flow) have been investigated.
   An increasing resistance to flow of CGA drilling fluids through porous
   media was observed as more CGA fluid was injected. Results confirmed
   that CGA microbubble build-up across the pore structure could establish
   an effective seal for controlling filtration loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The extraction of bitumen from the oilsands using solvents has the
   potential to avoid the environmental problems with wet tailings
   associated with water-based extraction technology. One of the key
   performance parameters for this technology is the concentration of fine
   solids in the recovered bitumen. In this study, the concentration and
   properties of the fine solids in cyclohexane-extracted bitumen were
   examined as a function of the water content of the ore. Total water
   contents from 3.4-13.4 wt \% gave the lowest concentrations of fine
   solids in the bitumen, ca. 0.2 wt \% of the initial mass of a low-fines
   content ore. Higher fine solids contents in the bitumen were observed
   with water concentrations outside this range and with higher
   concentrations of fine solids in the initial oilsands ore. The fine
   solids exhibited a distribution of surface properties, and the most
   hydrophobic, carbon rich solids were carried into the bitumen even under
   the most favorable conditions. When the bitumen was more contaminated
   with fine solids, due to higher fines in the ore or lack of water to
   bind the fines to the sand, the carbon content of the fine solids
   decreased. The majority of the carbon in the fine solids was organic
   material due to bitumen and surface adsorbed components. Despite carbon
   contents over 20 wt \%, XPS analysis showed significant surface silicon
   and aluminum, and contact angles were in the range of 80-88 degrees,
   consistent with partial organic coating of the mineral particles.
   Characterization of the fine solids by SEM, particle size, and
   mineralogy suggested that the migration of the fine solids into the
   bitumen, versus remaining with the coarse sand, was significantly
   affected by the organic surface deposits on the particles.}},

Abstract = {{The far-infrared spectra of the aromatic hydrocarbons tetracene and
   pentacene have been calculated using a perturbational-variational method
   coupled with potential truncation. This shortening of the potential
   enabled accurate vibration calculations for these large molecules and
   their respective dimers. Thus, it was possible to identify all IR bands
   obtained experimentally in the far-IR range by Michaelian et al., as
   well as to differentiate bands resulting from intermolecular and
   intramolecular modes of vibration separately, and combined
   intermolecular + intramolecular vibration modes. Far-IR spectra for
   smaller acene family members, naphthalene and anthracene, were also
   computed, and trends in intermolecular vibrations, for the acene family
   as a whole, were identified. The results obtained illustrate the quality
   and the detail of the insights realized by interrogating experimental
   spectra using high-precision, unscaled quantum mechanics computational
   approaches, and provide a benchmark for future work targeting
   identification of dominant molecular motifs and intermolecular
   association phenomena arising in ill-defined hydrocarbons including
   asphaltenes based on IR and Raman spectral decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Water addition to natural-zeolite-catalyzed reactions significantly
   improves cracking of oilsands bitumen compared to analogous reactions in
   the absence of water. We report that the addition of 3\% water to the
   catalyzed cracking reactions results in samples with lower viscosities
   and average molecular weights, less residue, olefin, and coke formation,
   and higher C-2+ gas production compared to analogous reactions in the
   absence of water. Our study suggests that untreated natural zeolites
   undergo self-acidification by hydrolysis reactions in the presence of
   water. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid-state NMR
   analyses detected the presence of acid -OH groups on the raw untreated
   chabazite and clinoptilolite surfaces that are capable of supplying
   protons to initiate carbocation reactions. Stable isotopic mass
   spectrophotometric analyses on bitumen on D2O-doped catalytic reactions
   confirm up to similar to 56\% hydrogen incorporation from added water to
   the liquid products. Aromaticity and proton and deuterium distribution
   of products by liquid NMR indicate the occurrence of a number of
   catalytic reactions, including aromatization, rearrangement and
   substitution in the aliphatic chains, beta-scission, dehydrogenation,
   and increased hydrogen enrichment at beta- and gamma-positions. On the
   basis of our findings, we postulate that water addition to natural
   zeolites generates catalytic reactions that involve carbocation on acid
   sites. Studies with model compounds such as cumene and hexadecane also
   demonstrated significant cracking activity with water addition.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to vehicle-only collisions, traffic collisions with pedestrians
   are studied less because of insufficient data. However, with the
   development of image processing technology, a growing number of road
   user behavioural analyses have been conducted using video data. This
   study tries to extract road users' movements from video data in order to
   analyse the conflict between pedestrian and vehicle and to evaluate
   pedestrian safety performance during conflicts. The time difference to
   collision (TDTC) parameter is used to fit the safety analysis on
   pedestrian-involved conflicts. Scene-based analysis, which evaluates the
   safety performance of traffic intersections and segments where several
   pedestrian-vehicle conflicts may happen together, is conducted using 91
   groups of scene data. The parameters most related to pedestrian safety
   are located using a sensitivity test, a quantitative definition of
   pedestrian-vehicle conflict is then defined, and a scene-based
   pedestrian safety performance evaluation model is built. The model can
   correctly detect nearly 94.4\% of possibly dangerous traffic scenes.
   Other kinds of mixed traffic scenes can also be studied based on this
   research.}},

Title = {{Mean Flow in a Submerged Hydraulic Jump with Baffle Blocks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The flow in a submerged hydraulic jump with three-dimensional (3D)
   baffle blocks was experimentally studied. An incoming jet with varying
   supercritical Froude numbers was deflected with one or two rows of 3D
   baffle blocks for different downstream water depths. Depending on the
   submergence factor, two flow regimes were observed for which the
   time-averaged 3D velocity field was measured with an acoustic Doppler
   velocimeter (ADV). Measurements were conducted at different stations
   located both upstream and downstream of the blocks and above the crest
   of the blocks. Velocity measurements were made in a plane located at the
   center of the middle block (i.e., the centerplane of the flume) and,
   also, in a plane located at the midpoint between the blocks
   (off-centerplane). The mean flow pattern was found to be significantly
   different for the two flow regimes. In the deflected surface jet (DSJ)
   regime, which occurred at low submergence factors, the major flow
   features were a small surface roller upstream of the blocks and a larger
   recirculating flow region located downstream of the blocks. The
   reattaching wall jet (RWJ) regime, which was formed at large submergence
   factors, could be characterized by a large surface roller and a small
   standing eddy just behind the blocks in the centerplane. In both flow
   regimes, the maximum longitudinal velocity component was observed to
   decrease rapidly at the blocks and the jet half-width was found to
   increase quickly. The DSJ regime was found to have a smaller streamwise
   dimension and to be more effective in reducing the streamwise velocity
   and increasing the jet half-width. These features can be considered an
   advantage of the DSJ regime over the RWJ regime; that is, hydraulic
   structures should be designed such that the DSJ regime occurs over the
   entire range of tailwater depths that are likely to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Strong magnetoresistance effects are often observed in

   nickel surface by chemical vapor deposition. A negative
   magnetoresistance effect of similar to 10(4)\% has been observed, which
   persists even at room temperature. This effect is correlated with the
   shape of the 2D peak as well as with the occurrence of D peak in the
   Raman spectrum of the as-grown multilayer graphene. The observed
   magnetoresistance is extremely high as compared to other known materials
   systems for similar temperature and field range and can be qualitatively

Abstract = {{Shape irregularity and size dispersion exhibited by TiO2 nanotube arrays
   (TNAs) is a disadvantage for size-selective applications such as
   flow-through membranes, cell differentiation and drug delivery, and for
   photonic applications such as photonic crystals and metallodielectric
   metamaterials, where size and shape dispersity are sources of defects
   and scattering. We show that achieving extremely smooth Ti films is more
   critical than a large Ti grain size in attaining highly ordered nanotube
   arrays with minimal dispersity in shape and size, and obtain the insight
   that uniform pore nucleation is determinative of the quality of the
   nanostructures that result following electrochemical anodization. TiO2
   nanotubes formed by anodization of highly smooth Ti films on single
   crystal silicon wafers in electrolytes with high water concentrations
   had only circular pores with a narrow dispersion of pore diameters, and
   exhibited uniform cross-sections along the tube-axis. Pattern order was

   LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) is
   investigated. The addition of an appropriate amount of lithium
   bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) into the LiPF6-based electrolyte
   contributes to an electrochemical improvement of the graphite anode.
   However, the LiFePO4 cathode is difficult to cycle in such an
   electrolyte due to the severe corrosion of the aluminium current
   collector by FSI anions. Lithium bis-oxalato borate (LiBOB) is able to
   passivate Al and suppress the corrosion arising from the FSI anions. An
   improvement of rate performance and cycling stability for both the
   LiFePO4 cathode and the graphite anode is obtained in 1.0 mol L-1
   LiPF6/EC/EMC electrolyte containing 0.2 mol L-1 LiFSI and 0.2 mol L-1
   LiBOB salts.
   Moreover, an excellent compatibility between the graphite anode and
   LiFePO4 cathode in the ternarysalt electrolyte system is further
   confirmed by the full cell tests. The electrochemical performance
   improvement of the electrolyte resulting from Li-salt mixing provides a
   new way for optimization of electrolyte for high performance Li-ion
   batteries. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that sea levels are rising even faster than
   projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under
   a sea level rise (SLR) scenario, estuarine and coastal areas would be
   affected first. In this paper, the effects on the Yangtze River Estuary
   (YRE) by potential future SLR are studied using a hydrodynamic (MIKE21)
   model. The model is calibrated with field data. Scenarios of 0.5, 1, and
   2 m SLR in the flood season are simulated with the calibrated model. The
   predicted results show that under SLR (1) the tidal level of the YRE
   increases and its increase rate decreases gradually upstream along the
   channel; (2) the tidal wave propagates at a faster speed upstream, which
   leads to the advancement of a tidal limit and tidal current limit to the
   upstream; (3) the increases in flood and ebb velocities occur around the
   Nanhui Tidal Flat, the Hengsha Eastern Shoal, the Jiuduansha Shoal, the
   upper reach of the North Branch, the North Channel, the South Channel,
   the South Branch, and the ``South Branch above{''}; the ebb velocity
   decreases in the North Passage and the South Passage; and the flood and
   ebb velocity in shoals have the highest increasing rate; and (4) the ebb
   discharge of the North Branch has the highest increasing rate, with the
   ebb flow split ratio increasing up to almost 5\% under the 2 m SLR
   scenario. Hence, SLR will reduce the protective capacity of embankments
   and may aggravate erosion in shoals, which is not good for maintenance
   of the Deepwater Navigation Channel and formation of potential land
   resources in the IRE.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) was used to measure the infinite
   dilution diffusion coefficients of water in hydroxypropyl xylan (HPX)
   films containing sorbitol, a commonly used plasticizer, and cellulose
   nanocrystals (CNC) at temperatures above their glass transition
   temperatures (T-g). HPX forms transparent but relatively rigid films and
   has the potential to be used for certain food-packaging applications.
   Sorbitol and CNC were added to HPX films to reduce T-g and to reduce the
   water diffusivity, respectively. It was found that almost 40 wt \% of
   sorbitol was needed to yield a HPX film to have the desired flexibility,
   as quantified by its T-g, and that addition of a small amount of CNC
   (1-5 wt \%) while maintaining the total concentration of sorbitol and
   CNC at 40 wt \% (39-35 wt \% of sorbitol) slightly increased the T-g but
   significantly decreased the diffusivity of water. In particular, the
   infinite dilution diffusion coefficient of water for the HPX film with
   35 wt \% of sorbitol and 5 wt \% CNC was comparable to that of the bare
   HPX film. The diffusion data suggest that effects of sorbitol and CNC on
   the water diffusivity follow the free volume theory.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall is the primary driver of basin hydrologic processes. This
   article examines a recently developed rainfall predictive tool that
   combines wavelet principal component analysis (WPCA), an artificial
   neural networks-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA), and statistical
   disaggregation into an integrated framework useful for the management of
   water resources around the upper Blue Nile River basin (UBNB) in
   Ethiopia. From the correlation field between scale-average wavelet
   powers (SAWPs) of the February-May (FMAM) global sea surface temperature
   (SST) and the first wavelet principal component (WPC1) of June-September
   (JJAS) seasonal rainfall over the UBNB, sectors of the Indian, Atlantic,
   and Pacific Oceans where SSTs show a strong teleconnection with JJAS
   rainfall in the UBNB (r >= 0.4) were identified. An ANN-GA model was
   developed to forecast the UBNB seasonal rainfall using the selected SST
   sectors. Results show that ANN-GA forecasted seasonal rainfall amounts
   that agree well with the observed data for the UBNB {[}root-mean-square
   errors (RMSEs) between 0.72 and 0.82, correlation between 0.68 and 0.77,
   and Hanssen-Kuipers (HK) scores between 0.5 and 0.77], but the results
   in the foothills region of the Great Rift Valley (GRV) were poor, which
   is expected since the variability of WPC1 mainly comes from the
   highlands of Ethiopia. The Valencia and Schaake model was used to
   disaggregate the forecasted seasonal rainfall to weekly rainfall, which
   was found to reasonably capture the characteristics of the observed
   weekly rainfall over the UBNB. The ability to forecast the UBNB rainfall
   at a season-long lead time will be useful for an optimal allocation of
   water usage among various competing users in the river basin.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe an apparatus capable of measuring electrical
   resistance and light transmission through a flexible transparent
   conductor (TC) as it is actively deformed. The measurements are
   performed in situ with time resolution on the order of similar to 100
   ms, and the resistance/transmission data is further used to calculate TC
   figures-of-merit in real-time. With this instrument, we are able to
   track and compare the evolution of figures-of-merit for different TCs as
   they are actively deformed. To demonstrate the tool, we evaluate several
   common TCs including indium tin oxide,
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and
   silver nanowires, as well as a more unconventional nanowire/PEDOT:PSS
   hybrid. As expected, indium tin oxide degrades rapidly with strain,
   while the more flexible PEDOT:PSS is far more strain tolerant. The
   nanowire/PEDOT:PSS composite is found to produce an advantageous effect,
   as the silver nanowires generate large figures-of-merit at low strain,
   and the addition of a PEDOT:PSS component vastly improves strain
   tolerance. Crown Copyright (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Price of oil is important for the economies of oil exporting and oil
   importing countries alike. Therefore, insight into the likely future
   behaviour and patterns of oil prices can improve economic planning and
   reduce the impacts of oil market fluctuations. This paper aims to
   improve the application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques to
   prediction of oil price. We develop a dynamic Nonlinear Auto Regressive
   model with exogenous input (NARX) as a form of ANN to account for the
   time factor. We estimate the model using macroeconomic data from OECD
   countries. In order to compare the results, we develop time series and
   ANN static models. We then use the output of time series model to
   develop a NARX model. The NARX model is trained with historical data
   from 1974 to 2004 and the results are verified with data from 2005 to
   2009. The results show that NARX model is more accurate than time series
   and static ANN models in predicting oil prices in general as well as in
   predicting the occurrence of oil price shocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental study on a deeply dewatered sewage
   sludge produced by using a new technique of membrane filter press. The
   experiments involve measurements of sludge composition, basic physical
   properties, shear strength, water permeability, and leaching toxicity.
   The measurements of shear strength and permeability were also performed
   on the sludge specimens soaked in a low acid leachate or distilled water
   for 1 and 2 months. This is to investigate the influence of chemical
   change in pore fluid as a result of rainfall infiltration or leachate
   seepage at landfills. Comparison tests were also carried out on silty
   clay that is commonly used for landfill cover material. The experimental
   results show that the deeply dewatered sludge contains 66 \% organic
   content and 85 \% water content (dry mass basis). The undrained shear
   strength of the sludge is > 25 kPa even after 2-month soaking in the
   leachate and distilled water, meeting the requirement of the Chinese
   standard {[}CJ/T249-2007, Disposal of sludge from municipal wastewater
   treatment plant: sludge quality for co-landfilling. Ministry of Building
   and Construction, P.R. China (in Chinese), 2007]. The measured cohesion
   and friction angle for the sludge are > 20 kPa and 22.3A degrees,
   respectively. The soaking of sludge specimens in either leachate or
   distilled water resulted in an increase in frictional angle by several
   degrees. The water permeability for the sludge ranges from 0.68 x 10(-8)
   to 1.3 x 10(-8) cm/s, and permeability after 2-month soaking is less
   than the minimum requirement for the barrier layer of landfill covers
   (i.e., 1.0 x 10(-7) cm/s). The concentrations of heavy metals leaching
   from the dewatered sludge are lower than the limit values of leaching
   toxicity for the wastewater discharge standard of China. The
   experimental results indicate that deeply dewatered sludge can be used
   as an alternative material for the barrier layer of landfill covers.}},

Abstract = {{The process of planning and scheduling industrial construction
   fabrication (ICF) jobs is difficult because the sequence of operations
   varies considerably from one product to another due to the unique design
   and configuration of products. Traditional critical path method
   (CPM)-related approaches are not effective due to CPM's limitation or
   inability to model the repetition of operations, interactions between
   resources, and what-if scenarios. Discrete event simulation (DES) is
   often used to model processes that are repetitive in nature; however,
   DES has limitations in modeling ICF shops due to considerable
   differences between operation sequences, which means a model can only be
   used once per project. This paper proposes a new
   simulation-model-structuring methodology, which directly addresses
   product uniqueness and complex routing issues in ICF shops and
   significantly simplifies the simulation-model development. This
   methodology fully supports shop scheduling and schedule updating
   essential for ICF shops that operate under highly dynamic project

Abstract = {{Bubble formation from a gas jet in a liquid cross flow inside the mixing

   Though gas-liquid ratio (GLR) and flow velocities dominate bubble

   morphological impact on the bubbly flow. This impact is visible as a
   pressure wave that propagates upstream from the nozzle exit. This pulse
   is found to have a strong influence on bubble formation at the gas
   injection location leading to bubble distortion and breakup. In most

Abstract = {{Modulus-tunable microcantilevers are fabricated from magnetorheological
   elastomers (MREs) consisting of polydimethylsiloxane and carbonyl iron
   particles by using a simple sandwich molding method. Depending on the
   presence or absence of an external magnetic field during curing,
   isotropic or anisotropic MRE cantilevers are obtained. Randomly
   distributed particles are present in the polymer matrix of the isotropic
   microcantilevers, whereas the particles in the anisotropic
   microcantilevers are aligned in the direction of the magnetic field. The
   fractional changes in the resonance frequencies of the MRE cantilevers
   are measured as functions of the magnetic field intensity and the
   quantity of particles in the matrix. The anisotropic microcantilevers
   undergo greater changes in frequency than the isotropic microcantilevers
   when exposed to external magnetic fields, which indicates that larger
   changes in modulus are induced in the anisotropic microcantilevers. In
   addition, the dissipation and damping ratios of the MRE microcantilevers
   are determined by fitting the exponential decays of their deflection
   amplitudes with time.}},

   concentration and morphology on the resulting mechanical properties was
   investigated. At a modifier content of 5 wt\% a more than threefold
   increase in strain energy release rate was observed relative to the
   unfilled epoxy for the block-copolymer/epoxy systems studied. This
   improvement was accompanied by slight reductions in tensile stiffness,
   strength and glass transition temperature of developed epoxy blends.

Abstract = {{Simulation of frictional contact between soils and rigid or deformable
   structure in the framework of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is
   presented in this study. Two algorithms are implemented into the SPH
   code to describe contact behavior, where the contact forces are
   calculated using the law of conservation of momentum based on ideal
   plastic collision or using the criteria of partial penetrating. In both
   algorithms, the problem of boundary deficiency inherited from SPH is
   properly handled so that the particles located at contact boundary can
   have precise acceleration, which is critical for contact detection. And
   the movement and rotation of the rigid structure are taken into account
   so that it is easy to simulate the process of pile driving or movement
   of a retaining wall in geotechnical engineering analysis. Furthermore,
   the capability of modeling deformability of a structure during
   frictional contact simulations broadens the fields of SPH application.
   In contrast to previous work dealing with contact in SPH, which usually
   use particle-to-particle contact or ignoring sliding between particles
   and solid structure, the method proposed here is more efficient and
   accurate, and it is suitable to simulate interaction between soft
   materials and rigid or deformable structures, which are very common in
   geotechnical engineering. A number of numerical tests are carried out to
   verify the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithms, and their
   results are compared with analytical solutions or results from finite
   element method analysis. Good agreement obtained from these comparisons
   suggests that the proposed algorithms are robust and can be applied to
   extend the capability of SPH in solving geotechnical problems. Copyright

Abstract = {{We report on the identification and functional characterization of HMGB1
   of the goldfish. Quantitative analysis indicated the highest expression
   of goldfish HMGB1 in the brain, with lower mRNA levels in spleen,
   intestine, kidney, gill and heart. HMGB1 was also differentially
   expressed in goldfish immune cell populations with highest mRNA levels
   present in splenocytes and neutrophils. We generated and functionally
   characterized the recombinant HMGB1 (rgHMGB1). The rgHMGB1 primed the
   respiratory burst response in monocytes and induced nitric oxide
   production of primary goldfish macrophages. Treatment of goldfish
   macrophages with heat-killed Mycobacterium marinum and Aeromonas
   salmonicida elevated the expression of HMGB1 and resulted in higher
   HMGB1 protein levels. The rgHMGB1 induced a dosedependent production of
   TNFot-2 and IL-1/31 of goldfish macrophages. Furthermore, the dual
   luciferase reporter assay revealed that goldfish HMGB1 induced the
   activation of the NF--KB signaling pathway. Our results indicate that
   goldfish HMGB1 is a critical regulatory cytokine of inflammatory and
   antimicrobial response of the goldfish. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, multi-label classification methods are of increasing interest
   in the areas such as text categorization, image annotation and protein
   function classification. Due to the correlation among the labels,
   traditional single-label classification methods are not directly
   applicable to the multi-label classification problem. This paper
   presents two novel multi-label classification algorithms based on the
   variable precision neighborhood rough sets, called multi-label
   classification using rough sets (MLRS) and MLRS using local correlation
   (MLRS-LC). The proposed algorithms consider two important factors that
   affect the accuracy of prediction, namely the correlation among the
   labels and the uncertainty that exists within the mapping between the
   feature space and the label space. MLRS provides a global view at the
   label correlation while MLRS-LC deals with the label correlation at the
   local level. Given a new instance, MLRS determines its location and then
   computes the probabilities of labels according to its location. The
   MLRS-LC first finds out its topic and then the probabilities of new
   instance belonging to each class is calculated in related topic. A
   series of experiments reported for seven multi-label datasets show that
   MLRS and MLRS-LC achieve promising performance when compared with some
   well-known multi-label learning algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Partitioning the universe of discourse and determining intervals
   containing useful temporal information and coming with better
   interpretability are critical for forecasting in fuzzy time series. In
   the existing literature, researchers seldom consider the effect of time
   variable when they partition the universe of discourse. As a result, and
   there is a lack of interpretability of the resulting temporal intervals.
   In this paper, we take the temporal information into account to
   partition the universe of discourse into intervals with unequal length.
   As a result, the performance improves forecasting quality. First, time
   variable is involved in partitioning the universe through Gath-Geva
   clustering-based time series segmentation and obtain the prototypes of
   data, then determine suitable intervals according to the prototypes by
   means of information granules. An effective method of partitioning and
   determining intervals is proposed. We show that these intervals carry
   well-defined semantics. To verify the effectiveness of the approach, we
   apply the proposed method to forecast enrollment of students of Alabama
   University and the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock
   Index. The experimental results show that the partitioning with temporal
   information can greatly improve accuracy of forecasting. Furthermore,
   the proposed method is not sensitive to its parameters. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{In the consensus reaching processes developed in group decision making
   problems we need to measure the closeness among experts' opinions in
   order to obtain a consensus degree. As it is known, to achieve a full
   and unanimous consensus is often not reachable in practice. An
   alternative approach is to use softer consensus measures, which reflect
   better all possible partial agreements, guiding the consensus process
   until high agreement is achieved among individuals. Consensus models
   based on soft consensus measures have been widely used because these
   measures represent better the human perception of the essence of
   consensus. This paper presents an overview of consensus models based on
   soft consensus measures, showing the pioneering and prominent papers,
   the main existing approaches and the new trends and challenges. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{A correlation equation for the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD)
   of the aerosol emitted by solution metered dose inhalers (MDIs) is
   presented. A content equivalent diameter is defined and used to describe
   aerosols generated by evaporating metered dose inhaler sprays. A large
   set of cascade impaction data is analyzed, and the MMAD and geometric
   standard deviation is calculated for each datum. Using dimensional
   analysis, the mass median content equivalent diameter is correlated with
   formulation variables. Based on this correlation in combination with
   mass balance considerations and the definition of the aerodynamic
   diameter, an equation for prediction of the MMAD of an inhaler given the
   pressure of the propellant in the metering chamber of the MDI valve and
   the surface tension of the propellant is derived. The accuracy of the
   correlation equation is verified by comparison with literature results.
   The equation is applicable to both HFA (hydrofluoroalkane) propellants
   134a and 227ea, with varying levels of co-solvent ethanol. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Diluents composed of H2O and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to
   1-ethy1-3-methylimmidazolium dicyanamide (EMI-DCA), yielding an

   H2O is critical for enhancing both the electrolyte conductivity and
   Zn/Zn(II) redox kinetics, but impairs Zn/Zn(II) redox reversibility and
   cyclability. DMSO has the ability to stabilize the electrolyte from H2O
   decomposition and is beneficial for maintaining Zn/Zn(II) redox
   reversibility and cyclability. Improved Zn/Zn(II) redox kinetics and
   reversibility, together with good cyclability up to 200 cycles, was
   achieved in EMI-DCA + H2O + DMSO in a mole ratio of 1:1.1:2.3. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The tortuosity factor of road infrastructure is an important parameter
   for assessing and designing biofuel facilities. This study focuses on
   the assessment of tortuosity factor considering real road network and
   dispersedly lignocellulosic biomass resources. A methodology is
   developed and applied under this study to estimate the tortuosity factor
   (tau) using GIS software. It is shown that tau varies considerably with
   plant capacity and in different plant locations. The estimated values of
   tau in the case study (Alberta) are in the range of 1-3.16 and average
   values are 2-8\% larger than the theoretical value (1.27). The unit cost
   of transportation is more sensitive to tortuosity factor at larger plant
   capacities. This methodology can be applied for other jurisdictions to
   assess the accurate lignocellulosic biomass delivery cost using the
   actual road network. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A simulation-based approach for material yard laydown planning}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a simulation-based approach for planning material
   laydown yards for steel fabrication projects. The classic approach to
   material placement is the ``reactive approach,{''} whereby as material
   arrives, the yard foreman decides, based on few rules and his/her past
   experience, where to place everything. It's often fraught with
   uncertainty resulting from imprecise and difficult-to-forecast
   construction consumption schedules, resource interactions, and supply
   chain issues, especially in material delivery. This paper outlines an
   approach to optimize reactive placement policy using heuristics, genetic
   algorithms and simulation to model material movement from laydown areas
   to the consumption unit. The novel approach combines analytical tools
   and heuristics to model the dynamic nature of material management. The
   paper compares this integrated approach with commonly-used optimization
   techniques which use weighted target functions based on rule of thumb. A
   case study demonstrates the suitability and efficiency of the proposed
   optimization method in reactive laydown yard management. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Increasing complexity of petro-chemical projects, fast-tracked
   engineering, and tighter schedules pose a challenge for pipe spool
   fabrication shops. To maintain competitiveness, it is necessary to
   improve the shop performance, i.e. fabrication cycle time. Pipe spool
   fabrication sequence is found to have significant impact on cycle time
   and presents an area with potential for improvement. Traditionally,
   fabrication sequences are determined by shop foremen in a heuristic
   manner and optimality is not guaranteed. This paper presents a dynamic
   programming (DP) algorithm to automatically identify the optimal
   fabrication sequences for pipe spools. Simulation experiments are
   conducted to test the effectiveness of the algorithm by comparing the
   cycle times resulting from the algorithm-generated sequences and
   human-planner-designed sequences, respectively. The results show that
   the DP algorithm reduces unnecessary position-welding (9 out of 20
   position-welds) and results in a reduction in the total fabrication
   cycle time by a range of 4.8\% to 12\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Spectral analysis of the heart sounds in children with and without

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{173}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-99}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is difficult to
   recognize clinically. Digital stethoscopes offer an opportunity to
   re-evaluate the diagnosis of PAH. We hypothesized that spectral analysis
   of heart sound frequencies using recordings from a digital stethoscope
   would differ between children with and without PAH.
   Methods: We recorded heart sounds using a digital stethoscope from 27
   subjects (12 males) with a median age of 7 years (3 months to 19 years)
   undergoing simultaneous cardiac catheterization. 13 subjects had a mean
   pulmonary artery pressure (mPAp) < 25 mm Hg (8-24 mm Hg). 14 subjects
   had a mPAp >= 25 mm Hg (25-97 mm Hg). We applied the fast Fourier
   transform, power spectral analysis, separability testing, and linear
   discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation to the heart
   sounds recorded from the cardiac apex and 2nd left intercostal space
   (LICS) to examine the frequency domain. The significance of the results
   was determined using a t-test and rank-sum test.
   Results: The relative power of the frequencies 21-22 Hz of the heart
   sounds recorded at the 2nd LICS was decreased significantly in subjects
   mPAp >= 25 mm Hg versus < 25 mm Hg.
   Conclusions: Heart sound signals of patients with PAH contain
   significantly less relative power in the band 21-22 Hz compared to
   subjects with normal PAp. Information contained in the frequency domain
   may be useful in diagnosing PAH and aid the development of auscultation
   based techniques for diagnosing PAH. In the future, utilizing the
   diagnostic information contained in heart sounds recordings may require
   analysis of both the time and frequency domains. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Intrinsic Disorder in the BK Channel and Its Interactome}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{The large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel is broadly
   expressed in various mammalian cells and tissues such as neurons,
   skeletal and smooth muscles, exocrine cells, and sensory cells of the
   inner ear. Previous studies suggest that BK channels are promiscuous
   binders involved in a multitude of protein-protein interactions. To gain
   a better understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying BK
   interactions, we analyzed the abundance, distribution, and potential
   mechanisms of intrinsic disorder in 27 BK channel variants from mouse
   cochlea, 104 previously reported BK-associated proteins (BKAPS) from
   cytoplasmic and membrane/cytoskeletal regions, plus BK beta- and
   gamma-subunits. Disorder was evaluated using the MFDp algorithm, which
   is a consensus-based predictor that provides a strong and competitive
   predictive quality and PONDR, which can determine long intrinsically
   disordered regions (IDRs). Disorder-based binding sites or molecular
   recognition features (MoRFs) were found using MoRFpred and ANCHOR. BKAP
   functions were categorized based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. The
   analyses revealed that the BK variants contain a number of IDRs.
   Intrinsic disorder is also common in BKAPs, of which similar to 5\% are
   completely disordered. However, intrinsic disorder is very differently
   distributed within BK and its partners. Approximately 65\% of the
   disordered segments in BK channels are long (IDRs) (>50 residues),
   whereas >60\% of the disordered segments in BKAPs are short IDRs that
   range in length from 4 to 30 residues. Both alpha and gamma subunits
   showed various amounts of disorder as did hub proteins of the BK
   interactome. Our analyses suggest that intrinsic disorder is important
   for the function of BK and its BKAPs. Long IDRs in BK are engaged in
   protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, contain multiple
   post-translational modification sites, and are subjected to alternative
   splicing. The disordered structure of BK and its BKAPs suggests one of
   the underlying mechanisms of their interaction.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{6-15}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{A high molecular weight polyacrylamide (PAM) was tested as a potential
   selective depressant in the differential flotation separation of galena
   and chalcopyrite using potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX) as a collector. In
   single mineral flotation, PAM depressed chalcopyrite while galena was
   floatable. Adsorption mechanism study indicated that PAM could adsorb on
   galena through hydrogen bonding, and on chalcopyrite through hydrogen
   bonding as well as ammonium-copper complexation. KEX could only break up
   the galena-PAM bonding. Therefore the combined use of PAM and KEX
   rendered the flotation of the two minerals selective.
   In the flotation of mixtures of the two minerals, galena and
   chalcopyrite could be separated by PAM and KEX only after EDTA treatment
   of the mineral mixtures. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometric
   (ToF-SIMS) measurements indicated that when galena and chalcopyrite were
   present together in the suspension, PAM adsorbed on both galena and
   chalcopyrite. However, after prior treatment of the mineral mixtures by
   EDTA, PAM was found to mainly adsorb on chalcopyrite. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A sensitive calorimetric sensor using a TiO2 microcantilever with
   nanowells patterned on one of its sides is described. This single
   material cantilever is sensitive to temperature change without relying
   on the metal deposition-based bimetallic effect. The thermomechanical
   sensitivity originates from the structure dependent variations in both
   the elastic modulus and thermal expansion coefficient due to the
   presence of ordered nanowells. These cantilever beams offer an alternate
   and efficient chemical sensing route for vapor phase analytes using

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a model to study the microchannel asphaltene
   transport and separation in presence of combined
   electroosmotic-electrophoretic transport and finite asphaltene
   aggregation effects. We invoke a perturbation-based analysis to develop
   analytical expressions for asphaltene band velocity (characterizing
   asphaltene electromigration) and separation resolution (characterizing
   separation of asphaltene species varying in aggregation or
   electrophoretic behaviors). We observe that the extent of the
   aggregation effects in affecting the asphaltene transport is strongly
   dictated by the nature of the electroosmotic-electrophoretic transport,
   and the net separation, too, is dictated by a non-trivial interplay of
   these two effects. Such coupled aggregation-advection-electrophoreting
   dynamics of asphaltene, in context of microfluidic transport, holds the
   key for understanding essential characteristics of asphaltene, relevant
   for its treatment during heavy oil upgrading. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental and theoretical investigation of
   the selective catalytic reduction of NO by propene over two diesel
   oxidation catalysts. Both catalysts were commercial monolith samples of
   400 CPSI with a PGM loading of 95 g/ft(3). In one monolith the catalyst
   was platinum only, and in the other a bimetallic catalyst of 4:1 by mass
   platinum and palladium. Both catalysts showed some activity for the SCR
   reaction, although relatively large amounts of N2O were also formed.
   Global kinetic models for the oxidation of propene, NO and the SCR
   reactions are developed. Several models from the literature were tested
   and compared. New models based on earlier work are proposed. A good

Abstract = {{Microdrop platforms in microfluidic technologies provide developments
   for the study of a variety of systems by means of micrometer sized

   has important applications in biological systems. In our previous work
   we described the thermodynamic equilibrium of this concentrating process
   for two types of solutes, those with limited and unlimited solubility,
   and investigated the role of temperature, the amount of organic phase,
   and the initial concentration of the solutes. It was found that, during
   the concentration process which is accompanied by microdrop shrinkage,
   for specific initial conditions the system may encounter more than one
   equilibrium state. In this work, by means of free energy analysis based
   on Gibbsian surface thermodynamics, we investigate the stability
   behavior of the system to provide more detailed information so that
   these systems can be designed more accurately.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes event detector and controller co-design criteria for

   conditions to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system

   actuators. The transmissions are mediated by event detectors at both
   sensor and controller nodes. For static output feedback control, the
   sufficient condition is given in terms of the feasibility of bilinear
   matrix inequalities (BMIs). The BMI feasibility problem is converted
   into a nonlinear optimisation problem involving linear matrix
   inequalities (LMIs), which is solved via the complementarity
   linearisation algorithm. For dynamic output feedback control, the
   sufficient condition is formulated into an LMI feasibility problem,
   which is readily solved with existing tools. Numerical examples are

Abstract = {{The chemical and mineral processing industries need a nonlinear process
   monitoring method to improve the stability and economy of their
   processes. Techniques that are currently available to these industries
   are often too computationally intensive for an industrial control
   system, or they are too complex to commission. In this paper, we propose
   using supervised locally linear embedding for projection (SLLEP) as a
   new nonlinear process monitoring technique to solve these issues. In
   addition, we suggest using a commonly available tool in modern
   industrial control systems, a model predictive control, to solve the
   quadratic program of SLLEP in real-time and with minimal effort to
   commission. As a case study, we demonstrate that process monitoring with
   SLLEP can detect and diagnose the early onset of a semiautogenous
   grinding (SAG) mill overload. A SAG mill overload is a highly nonlinear
   operating situation, and we show that principal component analysis, the
   best-in-class technique currently used by the industry for monitoring an
   overload, is unable to detect the early onset of an overload.}},

Abstract = {{Proper understanding of the complex geometric shape of the talus bone is
   important for the design of generic talar body prosthetics and
   restoration of the proper ankle joint function after surgery. To date,
   all talus implants have been patient-specific with the limitation that
   complex computer modeling is required to produce a mirrored image from
   the unaffected opposite side followed by machining a patient-specific
   prosthesis. To develop an ``off-the-shelf{''} non-custom talar
   prosthesis, it is important to perform a thorough investigation of the
   geometric shape of the talus bone. This article addresses the
   applicability of a scaling approach for investigating the geometric
   shape and similarity of talus bones. This study used computed tomography
   scan images of the ankle joints of 27 different subjects to perform the
   analysis. Results of the deviation analyses showed that the deviation in
   the articulating surfaces of the talus bones was not excessive in terms
   of talus size. These results suggest that a proposed range of five
   implant sizes is possible. Finally, it is concluded that the talus bones
   of the ankle joints are geometrically similar, and a proposed range of
   five implant sizes will fit a wide range of subjects. This information
   may help to develop generic talus implants that might be applicable to
   patients with a severe talus injury.}},

Abstract = {{Bottom propagating gravity currents resulting from full-and
   partial-depth lock-release experiments are investigated as they approach
   and then propagate up a rising slope. Consistent with the prediction of
   a WKB-like theory, the gravity current front decelerates in a nearly
   uniform manner along the slope as 0.112g's (D/H)(2 - D/H), in which g'
   is the reduced gravity, s is the slope, D is the initial lock-fluid
   height, and H is the ambient fluid height. The shape of the gravity
   current as it decelerates over relatively steep slopes is found to be
   self similar with a nearly linear decrease of the head height between
   the start of the slope and up to 80\% of the distance to the nose. Some
   deviation from self-similar behaviour is found in cases with small s
   because of the comparatively large volume of fluid in the gravity
   current tail that flows downslope while the front continues to advance
   upwards. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Building space heating contributes to high consumption of energy using
   primarily non-renewable energy sources. Usage of renewable energy
   sources is constrained by high initial costs and long-term payback. This
   paper presents an empirical research study to evaluate the design of the
   control system and the performance of an integrated heating system
   utilizing renewable energy sources by means of a geothermal field, solar
   energy, and drain water heat recovery (DWHR) system. Two main challenges
   we attempt to address are: (1) the ground source heat pump (GSHP) system
   is designed to function only as a heating system causing heat loss from
   the geothermal field and (2) high heating load is required in
   cold-climate regions. The proposed integrated space heating system uses
   mainly geothermal energy, which is supported by solar and DWHR systems
   to recover the heat loss from the geothermal field. The framework is
   validated through a residential building under occupancy where, a
   monitoring system is installed to evaluate the coefficient of
   performance of the space heating system. Based on the findings,
   adjustments in the design of the heating system controls are proposed to
   enhance system efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the stability issue for switched nonlinear systems
   with input delay and disturbance. It is assumed that for the nominal
   system an exponential stabilizing controller is predesigned such that
   the switched system is stable under a certain switching signal, and a
   piecewise Lyapunov function for the corresponding closed-loop system is
   known. However, in the presence of input delay and disturbance, the
   system may be unstable under the same switching signal. For this case, a
   new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is firstly constructed based on the
   known Lyapunov function. Then, by employing this new functional, a new
   switching signal satisfying the new average dwell time conditions is
   constructed to guarantee the input-to-state stability of the system
   under a certain delay bound. The bound on the average dwell time is
   closely related to the bound on the input delay. Finally, numerical
   examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new statistical pattern recognition method
   for classifying cytotoxic cellular responses to toxic agents. The
   advantage of the proposed method is to quickly assess the toxicity level
   of an unclassified toxic agent on human health by bringing cytotoxic
   cellular responses with similar patterns (mode of action, MoOA) into the
   same class. The proposed method is a model-based hierarchical
   classification approach incorporating principal component analysis (PCA)
   and functional data analysis (FDA). The cytotoxic cell responses are
   represented by multi-concentration time-dependent cellular response
   profiles (TCRPs) which are dynamically recorded by using the xCELLigence
   real-time cell analysis high-throughput (RTCA HT) system. The
   classification results obtained using our algorithm show satisfactory
   discrimination and are validated using biological facts by examining
   common chemical mechanisms of actions with treatment on human
   hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We define a symbol transition matrix (STM) as a matrix whose entries are
   the symbol transition probabilities of a relay in a decode-and-forward
   (DF) relaying system. Using the STM as a state transition matrix of a
   discrete-time Markov chain, the source-to-destination STM is shown to be
   the product of intermediate STMs in multihop DF relaying systems. We
   show that the probability of correct decision at the destination is the
   trace of the source-to-destination STM divided by the modulation order.
   The symbol error probabilities (SEPs) of multihop DF relaying systems
   with any modulation scheme in any independent and nonidentically
   distributed (ind) channels are derived using the STM. For multihop DF
   relaying systems in independent and identically distributed (iid)
   channels, the eigenvalues of the single link STM are used to simplify
   the calculation of the SEP for any modulation scheme. Also, the SEP of
   multihop DF relaying systems with 16-quadrature amplitude modulation
   (QAM) signals in ind Rayleigh fading channels is derived using the STM.
   A relay advantage criterion is derived for multihop DF relaying systems
   in iid Nakagami-m fading channels with both the total transmitted energy
   and the source-to-destination distance fixed. The relay advantage
   criterion can be used for deciding whether putting more relays between
   the source and the destination increases or decreases the SEP.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of materials is typically perceived to be a negative
   response in service. Many designs, and materials, have been and are
   ruined due to corrosion, fatigue, weathering, ultraviolet light, fungal
   attack, bacterial attack, erosion, wear, electromigration. and on the
   list goes. However, the carefully controlled and purposeful degradation
   of materials is a prerequisite for success for some designs-and such
   ability is a beautiful necessity when it comes to many regenerative
   biomaterials. In other instances, we must seek first to understand the
   degradation mechanisms before we can achieve degradation prevention-and
   the resistance of some materials to degradation is also beautiful.
   Regardless of whether we try to prevent or elicit degradation, our
   dedication to degradation of materials is ever present in materials
   design.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective Laser-induced cell-cell surgical attachment
   using femtosecond laser pulses is reported.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods We have demonstrated the ability to
   attach single cells using sub-10 femtosecond laser pulses, with 800 nm
   central wavelength delivered from a Ti:Sapphire laser. To check that the
   cells did not go through a cell-fusion process, a fluorescent dye
   Calcein AM was used to verify that the fluorescent dye did not migrate
   from a dyed cell to a non-dyed cell. The mechanical integrity of the
   attached joint was assessed using an optical tweezer.
   Results Attachment of cells was performed without the induction of
   cell-cell fusion, with attachment efficiency of 95\%, and while
   preserving the cells' viability. Cell-cell attachment was achieved by
   delivery of one to two trains of femtosecond laser pulses lasting 15 ms
   each.
   Conclusions Laser-induced ionization process led to an ultrafast
   reversible destabilization of the phospholipid layer of the cellular
   membrane. The inner cell membrane remained intact during the attachment
   procedure, and isolation of the cells' cytoplasm from the surrounding
   medium was obtained. A strong physical attachment between the cells was
   obtained due to the bonding of the membranes' ionized phospholipid
   molecules and the formation of a joint cellular membrane at the
   connection point. The cellular attachment technique, femtosecond
   laser-induced cell-cell surgical attachment, can potentially provide a
   platform for the creation of engineered tissue and cell cultures. Lasers

Abstract = {{Properties of metallic materials are intrinsically determined by their

   quantum mechanics is complicated and difficult to be applied in
   materials design. In this article, a simple and general approach is
   proposed to correlate properties of metals with their electron work
   function using the Lennard-Jones potential as a bridge. The approach is
   applied to several properties of metallic materials, including bulk
   modulus, thermal expansion and heat capacity (Debye temperature). The
   established correlations are consistent with reported experimental
   results, verifying the dependence of the properties on electron work
   function. This new methodology may help generate complementary clues for
   advanced material design, element selection and modification of bulk
   materials or phases on a feasible electronic base.}},

Abstract = {{Recent development of flexible/stretchable integrated electronic sensors
   and stimulation systems has the potential to establish an important
   paradigm for implantable electronic devices, where shapes and mechanical
   properties are matched to those of biological tissues and organs.
   Demonstrations of tissue and immune biocompatibility are fundamental
   requirements for application of such kinds of electronics for long-term
   use in the body. Here, a comprehensive set of experiments studies
   biocompatibility on four representative flexible/stretchable device
   platforms, selected on the basis of their versatility and relevance in
   clinical usage. The devices include flexible silicon field effect
   transistors (FETs) on polyimide and stretchable silicon FETs, InGaN
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and AlInGaPAs LEDs, each on low modulus
   silicone substrates. Direct cytotoxicity measured by exposure of a
   surrogate fibroblast line and leachable toxicity by minimum essential
   medium extraction testing reveal that all of these devices are
   non-cytotoxic. In vivo immunologic and tissue biocompatibility testing
   in mice indicate no local inflammation or systemic immunologic responses
   after four weeks of subcutaneous implantation. The results show that
   these new classes of flexible implantable devices are suitable for
   introduction into clinical studies as long-term implantable electronics.}},

Abstract = {{In most cases, fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) contains only one type of

   has the potential to improve the mechanical properties of concrete, and

   hybridization, is investigated in this paper under flexure and direct
   shear. Along with a reference plain concrete mix, several singlefiber
   reinforced concrete mixes and two-fiber reinforced hybrid composite
   mixes were cast using diverse fiber combinations. Two types of
   macro-steel fibers and a micro-cellulose fiber were examined. Flexural
   and direct shear tests were performed and the results were analyzed to
   identify synergy, if any, associated with various fiber combinations.

Abstract = {{Analytical data from the characterization of the liquid products from
   the thermal cracking of n-C-7 Cold Lake asphaltenes were transformed to
   probability density functions (PDFs) that described the molecular weight
   distributions of the asphaltene building blocks. These distributions
   were used for Monte Carlo construction of populations of 10 000
   asphaltene molecules, constrained by an experimental molecular weight
   distribution and the yield of products boiling below 538 degrees C from
   cracking in the presence of hydrogen and iron sulfide. The resulting
   distribution of asphaltene molecules contained between 1 and 15 building
   blocks, with a mode of 4. The mode of the distribution was insensitive
   to the fraction of the asphaltenes that consisted of large building
   blocks, boiling above 538 degrees C. Breakage of the bonds between the
   building blocks, to simulate cracking, gave yields of product fractions
   and boiling curves that were consistent with the experimental data. The
   relatively small number of building blocks in the majority of the
   asphaltene molecules suggests that molecular topology is not significant
   in the cracking reactions. Simulation of the cracking reactions linear
   versus dendritic molecular topology did not show significant differences

Abstract = {{Branch growth is directed along two, three, or four in-plane directions
   in vertically aligned nanowire arrays using vapor-liquid-solid glancing
   angle deposition (VLS-GLAD) flux engineering. In this work, a
   dynamically controlled collimated vapor flux guides branch placement
   during the self-catalyzed epitaxial growth of branched indium tin oxide
   nanowire arrays. The flux is positioned to grow branches on select
   nanowire facets, enabling fabrication of aligned nanotree arrays with
   L-, T-, or X-branching. In addition, a flux motion algorithm is designed
   to selectively elongate branches along one in-plane axis. Nanotrees are
   found to be aligned across large areas by X-ray diffraction pole figure
   analysis and through branch length and orientation measurements
   collected over 140 mu m(2) from scanning electron microscopy images for
   each array. The pathway to guided assembly of nanowire architectures
   with controlled interconnectivity in three-dimensions using VLS-GLAD is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The surface properties and self-adhesion mechanism of self-healing
   poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) copolymers containing comonomers with
   2-ureido-4{[}1H]-pyrimidinone quadruple hydrogen bonding groups (UPy)
   are investigated using a surface forces apparatus (SFA) coupled with a
   top-view optical microscope. The surface energies of PBA-UPy4.0 and
   PBA-UPy7.2 (with mole percentages of UPy 4.0\% and 7.2\%, respectively)
   are estimated to be 45-56 mJ m(-2) under dry condition by contact angle
   measurements using a three probe liquid method and also by contact and
   adhesion mechanics tests, as compared to the reported literature value
   of 31-34 mJ m(-2) for PBA, an increase that is attributed to the strong
   UPy-UPy H-bonding interactions. The adhesion strengths of PBA-UPy
   polymers depend on the UPy content, contact time, temperature and
   humidity level. Fractured PBA-UPy films can fully recover their
   self-adhesion strength to 40, 81, and 100\% in 10 s, 3 h, and 50 h,
   respectively, under almost zero external load. The fracture patterns
   (i.e., viscous fingers and highly self-organized parallel stripe
   patterns) have implications for fabricating patterned surfaces in
   materials science and nanotechnology. These results provide new insights
   into the fundamental understanding of adhesive mechanisms of multiple
   hydrogen-bonding polymers and development of novel self-healing and
   stimuli-responsive materials.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{315-322}},

Abstract = {{Modern proactive control algorithms can perform real-time traffic state
   prediction and help determine control plans for active traffic control
   measures, such as ramp metering (RM) and variable speed limit (VSL). In
   this study, a control algorithm, DynaTAM (Dynamic Analysis Tool for
   Active Traffic Demand Management), is proposed for prediction-based,
   integrated optimization control. DynaTAM considers the correlations
   between the implemented control measures and determines the control plan
   for both RM and VSL at the same stage of optimization. The algorithm
   framework possesses a candidate control plan generator, which reduces
   the computational load of future optimizations and eliminates much of
   the uncertainty in the system performance. A field-data-based simulation
   study with different control scenarios is conducted to evaluate the
   performance of DynaTAM. The DynaTAM control algorithm is shown to not
   only effectively perform integrated and coordinated control using both
   RM and VSL, but also significantly improve the efficiency of traffic
   operations during peak hours.}},

Journal = {{COMBUSTION AND FLAME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1076-1084}},

Abstract = {{The effects of altering the lower thermal boundary condition of a
   methanol pool from -5 degrees C to 50 degrees C was investigated within
   a 90 mm diameter and 12 mm deep quartz burner under steady state burning
   condition in a quiescent air environment. Both the burning rate and the
   flame height were observed to increase by 15\% with increasing bottom
   temperature over this range of bottom boundary conditions. The
   temperature and velocity within the liquid were measured by a single
   thermocouple traversed through the pool and Ply, respectively, in order
   to better understand the transport of mass and energy in the liquid.
   Temperature measurements revealed a distinct two-layer vertical thermal
   structure with the upper layer of the pool being almost uniform and near
   the boiling temperature of the fuel, while the lower layer experienced
   an increasing temperature gradient as the bottom boundary temperature
   was lowered. The thickness of the thermally uniform layer increased as
   the bottom temperature was increased. The measured fluid velocity showed
   a complementary two-layer structure with the upper layer being dominated
   by a pair of counter-rotating vortices that kept this portion of the
   liquid well mixed and transferred heat from the hot pool wall to the
   pool center, while the flow in the lower layer was uniformly low in
   value and vertical. A model was presented to aid in understanding the
   energy transfer within the liquid phase. In the lower layer, the Peclet
   Number was in the order of unity and required that the energy transfer
   throughout the liquid phase to be modeled as a combination of conduction
   and convection. Using this physical model, the change in burning rate
   over the full 55 degrees C change in bottom temperature was predicted
   within 2\%, thereby supporting the proposed mechanism for energy
   transfer into the pool's depth. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute.

Journal = {{FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{353}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{63-68}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Synchronized Escherichia coli cultures were infected with bacteriophage
   T4 at discrete points in the cell growth cycle. The cell cycle had a
   significant impact on the outcome of infection. Cell burst size was
   smallest for newly formed cells and increased dramatically as these
   progressed in the cell cycle. The largest burst sizes were achieved when
   infecting cells immediately prior to cell division. When cells were
   infected during cell division, the burst size was reduced back to its
   initial value. Interestingly, lysis time was longest for young cells,
   reached a minimum at the same point that burst size reached its maximum
   value, and then increased at the commencement of cell division.
   Consequently, phage productivity in cells about to undergo cell division
   was almost three times greater than the productivity of young, newly
   formed cells. The availability of intracellular resources is believed to
   be the major driving force behind phage productivity during infection.
   Indeed, intracellular RNA contents at the time of infection were found
   to correlate strongly with phage productivity. There was no significant
   relationship between cell DNA levels and phage productivity. Finally,
   burst size experiments suggested that the cell cycle also influenced the
   likelihood of a phage to undergo productive infection.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{17-28}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Flooding into underground spaces has become a common threat and caused
   significant damages and casualties in the past decades. To improve the
   understanding of people walking through the flooding staircase, a
   1:2-scale physical model of a staircase with rest platform was
   assembled. An instrument was developed to measure the hydrodynamic
   forces acting on individual vertical circular cylinders, as well as
   cylinder groups arranged side-by-side, in tandem and staggered cylinder
   arrays on the flooding staircase. The results show that the horizontal
   hydrodynamic force on a cylinder increases rapidly with the increasing
   of the inundated depth on the entrance of the staircase. With a
   side-by-side tight cylinder array, the force on the central cylinder is
   always larger than an isolated one. The force on the downstream cylinder
   in tandem cylinder array is always smaller. However, the drag
   coefficients of both cases are much larger than the corresponding ones
   in a horizontal bed channel. For the case of staggered cylinder array,
   the force on the downstream cylinder varies with the change of the
   transverse spacing and the longitudinal distance between cylinders. (C)

Abstract = {{A unique process, which consists of camphene-based freeze-casting and
   reactive sintering, has been developed to fabricate highly porous Cr3C2
   ceramics, which were featured with a well-defined multisize porous
   structure, consisting of large pore channels throughout the sample and
   small pores on the porous struts. The porous structure was found to be
   affected by the solid loading content and the casting temperature.
   Decreasing the solid loading content or increasing the freezing
   temperature increased the size of large pore channels. However, the size
   of small pore was not significantly influenced by the variation in the
   freeze-casting parameters. Compared with other techniques reported for
   the fabrication of porous ceramics, high porosity can easily be achieved
   by this method. The sintering mechanism of the formation of the porous
   structure was also discussed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Although mineral carbon sequestration (MCS) has several advantages over
   other carbon storage techniques, an economic process for MCS has not yet
   been developed. To reduce costs, it is suggested that MCS be combined
   with other processes and that waste products be used as feedstock. A
   process is proposed where ultramafic nickel ores are treated with
   microwave radiation to convert serpentine, the primary gangue mineral,
   to olivine. It is hypothesized the conversion of serpentine to olivine
   in ultramafic nickel ores may improve the mineral processing of these
   ores, and increase the carbon storage capacity of the flotation
   tailings. The microwave heating characteristics of ultramafic nickel
   ores, and the mineralogical changes that occur as a result of microwave
   treatment, are described in this paper. Ultramafic nickel ores were
   found to heat well in response to microwave radiation and the
   temperatures achieved were sufficient to convert serpentine to olivine.
   Microwave treatment was also found to convert pentlandite, the valuable
   nickel mineral, to other Fe-Ni-S minerals. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The mining industry produces fluid fine mineral tailings on the order of
   millions of tonnes each year, with billions of tonnes already stored
   globally. This trend is expected to escalate as demand for mineral
   products continues to grow with increasingly lower grade ores being more
   commonly exploited by hydrometallurgy. Ubiquitous presence and
   enrichment of fine solids such as silt and clays in fluid fine mineral
   tailings prevent efficient solid-liquid separation and timely re-use of
   valuable process water. Long-term storage of such fluid waste materials
   not only incurs a huge operating cost, but also creates substantial
   environmental liabilities of tailings ponds for mining operators. This
   review broadly examines current theoretical understandings and prevalent
   industrial practices on treating fine mineral tailings for greater water
   recovery and reduced environmental footprint of mining operations. (C)

Abstract = {{Although several distance or similarity functions for trees have been
   introduced, their performance is not always satisfactory in many
   applications, ranging from document clustering to natural language
   processing. This research proposes a new similarity function for trees,
   namely Extended Subtree (EST), where a new subtree mapping is proposed.
   EST generalizes the edit base distances by providing new rules for
   subtree mapping. Further, the new approach seeks to resolve the problems
   and limitations of previous approaches. Extensive evaluation frameworks
   are developed to evaluate the performance of the new approach against
   previous proposals. Clustering and classification case studies utilizing
   three real-world and one synthetic labeled data sets are performed to
   provide an unbiased evaluation where different distance functions are
   investigated. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
   performance of the proposed distance function. In addition, an empirical
   runtime analysis demonstrates that the new approach is one of the best
   tree distance functions in terms of runtime efficiency.}},

   the investigation showed that the cutting forces and cutting temperature
   obtained by DCT coated tools were significantly decreased in comparison
   with the uncoated and NCT coated tools, especially at higher cutting
   speeds. Flank wear of the DCT coated inserts was less than that of the
   NCT coated inserts under the same cutting conditions. The DCT coated
   inserts produced a good surface finish and yield a tool life of about 65
   min. The wear mechanisms of the DCT coated carbide tools are mainly

Abstract = {{The rapid solidification of a peritectic alloy is studied. Various 2D
   and 3D characterization techniques were effectively utilized to
   investigate the effect of cooling rate on both the phase fractions and
   the shrinkage porosity. Particles of Al-36 wt pct Ni were produced using
   a drop tube impulse system. Neutron diffraction and Rietveld analysis
   were used to quantify the phases formed during solidification. The
   microstructure of the produced particles was analyzed using SEM and
   X-ray microtomography. It was found that increasing cooling rate
   resulted in decreasing the Al3Ni2 to Al3Ni ratio. Also, quantitative
   analysis of the microtomography images revealed that the volume percent
   of porosity increased with increasing particle size. The distribution of
   porosity was found to be significantly different in small and large
   particles. It was concluded that the extensive growth of Al3Ni2 at lower
   cooling rates followed by the peritectic reaction made the feeding of
   the shrinkages more difficult, and as a result, the volume percent of
   porosity increased. Other findings showed that high cooling rate during
   solidification would result in the formation of a quasicrystalline
   phase, known as D-phase, and suppression of the primary Al3Ni2. Also,
   investigation of the 3D structure of the solidified particles revealed
   that large particles of Al-36 wt pct Ni contain multiple nucleation
   sites, while smaller particles contain only one single nucleation site.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{74-81}},

Abstract = {{Batch and continuous biofilm reactors (BBR and CBR) were operated to
   treat raw and ozone-treated oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). In
   raw OSPW, the BBR removed less (24\% vs. 29\%) chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) than did the CBR. The CBR removed 14\% of the acid-extractable
   fraction (AEF) from raw OSPW and 51\% from ozonated OSPW, whereas the
   BBR had lower AEF removal efficiencies of 6.2\% and 37\% for raw and
   ozonated OSPW, respectively. NAs with low molecular weight were
   preferentially degraded over those with high molecular weight, and
   classical NA degradation was more effective in the CUR than in the BBR.
   CBR operation with ozone-treated OSPW allowed a favorable growth of
   bacteria due to the high bioavailability of low molecular weight
   compounds. Scanning electron micrographs showed that distinct biofilm
   and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were formed under
   continuous flow conditions, and that the biofilm was thicker in the CBR
   than in the BBR. Microbial community analysis using denaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed more bands in BBR biomass samples;
   23 strains were identified in the BBR compared to 21 in the CBR. The
   continuous flow mode removed organic compounds more favorably than the
   batch mode from raw and ozonated OSPW. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Different models of metamaterials have been developed to generate
   negative mass and/or negative modulus. The resulting mass and modulus in
   existing works, however, cannot be independently controlled. The current
   study presents a new representative cell of elastic metamaterials in an
   effort to provide a comprehensive model for generating negative mass
   and/or negative modulus. The current model consists of a series of
   properly arranged rigid bodies and linear springs. By introducing both
   translational and rotational motions in the representative cell,
   negative mass and negative modulus can be obtained in a controlled
   manner. The mechanisms and conditions under which negative mass and/or
   negative modulus can be achieved are studied in detail. Numerical
   examples indicate that by varying the design of the representative cell,
   different properties of the material system can be reliably generated,
   i.e., double negative (mass and modulus) or single negative (mass or
   modulus). The dynamic behaviour of the developed material system under
   different loading frequencies is evaluated and the longitudinal elastic
   wave propagation in such metamaterials is studied. (C) 2014 Published by

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new topology and offer a comprehensive
   design methodology of fuzzy set-based neural networks (FsNNs). The
   proposed architecture of the FsNNs is based on the fuzzy polynomial
   neurons formed through a collection of `if-then' fuzzy rules, fuzzy
   inference, and polynomials with the extended structure of the premise
   and the consequence parts of fuzzy rules being formed within the
   networks. Three different forms of regression polynomials (namely
   constant, linear, and quadratic) are used in the consequence part of the
   rules. In order to build an optimal FsNN, the underlying structural and
   parametric optimization is supported by a dynamic search-based genetic
   algorithm (GA), which forms an optimal solution through successive
   adjustments (refinements) of the search range. The structure
   optimization involves the determination of the input variables included
   in the premise part and the order of the polynomial forming the
   consequence part of the rules. In the study, we explore two types of
   optimization methodologies, namely a simultaneous tuning and a separate
   tuning. GAs are global optimizers; however, when being used in their
   generic version, they often lead to a significant computing overhead
   caused by the need to explore an excessively large search space. To
   eliminate this shortcoming and increase the effectiveness of the
   optimization itself, we introduce a dynamic search-based GA that results
   in a rapid convergence while narrowing down the search to a limited
   region of the search space. We exploit this optimization mechanism to be
   completed both at the structural as well as the parametric level. To
   evaluate the performance of the proposed FsNN, we offer a suite of
   several representative numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{Transforming complex multivariate geological data to a Gaussian
   distribution is an important and challenging problem in geostatistics. A
   variety of transforms are available for this goal, but struggle with
   high dimensional data sets. Projection pursuit density estimation (PPDE)
   is a well-established nonparametric method for estimating the joint
   density of multivariate data. A central component of the PPDE algorithm
   transforms the original data toward a multivariate Gaussian
   distribution. The PPDE approach is modified to map complex data to a
   multivariate Gaussian distribution within a geostatistical modeling
   context. Traditional modeling may then take place on the transformed
   Gaussian data, with a back-transform used to return simulated variables
   to their original units. This approach is referred to as the projection
   pursuit multivariate transform (PPMT). The PPMT shows the potential to
   be an effective means for modeling high dimensional and complex geologic
   data. The PPMT algorithm is developed before discussing considerations
   and limitations. A case study compares modeling results against more
   common techniques to demonstrate the value and place of the PPMT within
   geostatistics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a modified relative time technique is proposed for

Abstract = {{Intrinsic disorder (i.e., lack of a unique 3-D structure) is a common
   phenomenon, and many biologically active proteins are disordered as a
   whole, or contain long disordered regions. These intrinsically
   disordered proteins/regions constitute a significant part of all
   proteomes, and their functional repertoire is complementary to functions
   of ordered proteins. In fact, intrinsic disorder represents an important
   driving force for many specific functions. An illustrative example of
   such disorder-centric functional class is RNA-binding proteins. In this
   study, we present the results of comprehensive bioinformatics analyses
   of the abundance and roles of intrinsic disorder in 3,411 ribosomal
   proteins from 32 species. We show that many ribosomal proteins are
   intrinsically disordered or hybrid proteins that contain ordered and
   disordered domains. Predicted globular domains of many ribosomal
   proteins contain noticeable regions of intrinsic disorder. We also show
   that disorder in ribosomal proteins has different characteristics
   compared to other proteins that interact with RNA and DNA including
   overall abundance, evolutionary conservation, and involvement in
   protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, intrinsic disorder is not
   only abundant in the ribosomal proteins, but we demonstrate that it is
   absolutely necessary for their various functions.}},

Abstract = {{The contributions of Burtron H. Davis to the understanding and

   of the key findings from his work are that the dehydration mechanism

   that weakly basic metal oxides are sensitive to the acidity of the H
   abstracted during dehydration, and that anti-Saytzeff elimination is
   possible with > 80 \% selectivity over weakly basic metal oxides (In2O3,
   Y2O3, ZrO2, Eu2O3 and ThO2). These findings were applied to show how the
   dehydration step of the industrial Fischer-Tropsch based process for
   1-heptene to 1-octene conversion can be improved through the use of a
   weakly basic metal oxide catalyst with low hydration activity. New
   processes were also suggested for the production of 1-octene from more
   commonly available feed materials, such as the C-8 fraction of natural
   gas condensate and petroleum naphtha. These processes employed weakly

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest concerning sustainable, economically

   this study, a large scale wind-hydrogen plant is assessed for the
   production of electrolytic hydrogen, for the servicing of the oil sands
   bitumen upgrading industry in Western Canada. The wind-hydrogen plant
   proposed has a capacity of 563 MW, along with the dual functionality of
   hydrogen production and electricity generation; with the delivery of
   hydrogen to the bitumen upgrader via pipeline. The research carried out
   involved the development of a data intensive techno-economic model in
   tandem with a simulation model of the plant. Several plant
   configurations were assessed to determine the optimum electrolyzer size
   and quantity - which would translate into the minimum hydrogen
   production cost (including delivery). The optimal plant configuration
   consists of 80 units of the 3496 kW (760 Nm(3)/h) electrolyzer, which
   yields a minimum hydrogen production cost of \$8.43 and \$7.84/kg of H-2
   with and without delivery. Therefore, currently, hydrogen production
   from wind energy remains uncompetitive relative to conventional fossil
   fuel hydrogen pathways. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   evidence-based assessment to evaluate staircase elements such as
   handrail and step design. This paper also presents a scenario-based
   rating system that assesses the degree of the risk of falling for
   different types of architectural staircase design. The proposed rating
   system was incorporated into a mathematical model and a Design
   Assessment Tree (DAT) that calculate the degree of risk associated with
   architectural staircase design to facilitate a building information

   (HPDC) and super vacuum die-cast (SVDC) AM60B magnesium alloys were
   investigated in a complex salt solution using slow positron beam

   revealed that a CaCO3 film was formed on the surface of the alloys and
   that the rate of CaCO3 formation for the SVDC alloy with immersion time
   was slower than that of the HPDC alloy. The larger volume fraction of
   beta-phase in the skin layer of the SVDC alloy than that of the HPDC

Abstract = {{Non-oriented electrical steel (NOES) is one of the most common material
   used in electrical motors. Core loss and permeability are the most
   important properties that the motor manufacturers look for Both these
   properties are structure sensitive and depend on several metallurgical
   factors: such as chemistry, grain size, crystallographic texture,
   cleanliness and stress states in non-oriented electrical steels. It has
   been observed in this course of the study that the grain size and Si
   content of NOES are the primary controlling factors to core loss,
   especially at higher frequencies. On the contrary, crystallographic
   texture plays an important role at lower frequencies. At higher
   frequency, core loss increases with increasing grain size and decreasing
   Si content of the steels. Small difference in grain size (similar to 50
   mu m) at lower frequency range has little influence on the magnetic
   properties but has significant adverse effect as frequency reaches high
   enough. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Efficient asset management is of paramount importance, particularly for
   systems with costly downtime and failure. As in energy and
   capital-intensive industries, the economic loss of downtime and failure
   is huge, the need for a low-cost and integrated health monitoring system

   and failures through an efficient prognostics and health management
   (PHM) framework can lead to appropriate maintenance actions to be
   scheduled proactively to avoid catastrophic failures and minimize the
   overall maintenance cost of the systems. This paper aims at practical
   challenges of online diagnostics and prognostics of mechanical systems
   under unobservable degradation. First, the elements of a multistate
   degradation structure are reviewed and then a model selection framework
   is introduced. Important dynamic performance measures are introduced,
   which can be used for online diagnostics and prognostics. The
   effectiveness of the result of this paper is demonstrated with a case

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{The microgrid concept is gaining widespread acceptance in near-term
   future power networks. Medium-voltage (MV) microgrids can be subjected
   to a high penetration level of dynamic loads {[}e. g., induction motor
   (IM) loads]. The highly nonlinear IM dynamics that couple active power,
   reactive power, voltage, and supply frequency dynamics challenge the
   stability of MV droop-controlled microgrids. However, detailed analysis
   and, more importantly, stabilization of MV microgrids with IM loads, are
   not reported in current literature. To fill in this gap, this paper
   presents integrated modeling, analysis, and stabilization of MV
   droop-controlled microgrids with IM load. A detailed small-signal model
   of a typical MV droop-controlled microgrid system, which is based on the
   IEEE Standard 399, with both dynamic and static loads is developed. The
   proposed model accounts for the impact of supply frequency dynamics
   associated with the droop-control scheme to accurately link the
   microgrid frequency dynamics to the motor dynamics. To stabilize the
   microgrid system in the presence of IM loads, a 2-degree-of-freedom
   active damping controller is proposed to stabilize the newly introduced
   oscillatory dynamics. The proposed supplementary active damping
   controller does not interfere with the steady-state performance, and
   yields robust control performance under a wide range of droop parameters
   and robust damping performance at small-and large-signal disturbances. A
   theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental results are presented
   to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.}},

   Probed by a Microcantilever}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Mechanical resonators shaped like microcantilevers have been
   demonstrated as a platform for very sensitive detection of chemical and
   biological analytes. However, their use as an analytical tool requires
   fundamental understanding of the molecular absorption-induced effects in
   the static and dynamic sensor response. The effect of absorption-induced
   surface stress on the microcantilever response is here investigated
   using palladium hydride formation. It is shown that the dynamic and
   static responses of the cantilever monitored simultaneously exhibit
   excellent correlation with the crystalline phases of hydride formation.
   However, the resonance frequency shifts and quasistatic bending are
   observed to be independent during the solid solution phase. Importantly,
   absorption-induced changes in the elastic parameters of the palladium
   film are found to play a dominant role in the static and dynamic
   response. The presented results help in discerning between changes in
   swelling and elastic modulus that control the cantilever response as
   well as the relationships between these parameters.}},

Title = {{NPAS3 variants in schizophrenia: a neuroimaging study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: This research is a one-site neuroimaging component of a
   two-site genetic study involving patients with schizophrenia at early
   and later stages of illness. Studies support a role for the neuronal
   Per-Arnt-Sim 3 (NPAS3) gene in processes that are essential for normal
   brain development. Specific NPAS3 variants have been observed at an
   increased frequency in schizophrenia. In humans, NPAS3 protein was
   detected in the hippocampus from the first trimester of gestation. In
   addition, NPAS3 protein levels were reduced in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex of some patients with schizophrenia. Npas3 knockout
   mice display behavioural, neuroanatomical and structural changes with
   associated severe reductions in neural precursor cell proliferation in
   the hippocampal dentate gyrus. This study will evaluate the hypothesis
   that the severe reductions in neural precursor cell proliferation in the
   dentate gyrus will be present to some degree in patients carrying
   schizophrenia-associated NPAS3 variants and less so in other patients.
   Methods/Design: Patients enrolled in the larger genetic study (n = 150)
   will be invited to participate in this neuroimaging arm. The genetic
   data will be used to ensure a sample size of 45 participants in each
   genetic subgroup of patients (with and without NPAS3 variants). In
   addition, we will recruit 60 healthy controls for acquisition of
   normative data. The following neuroimaging measures will be acquired
   from the medial temporal region: a) an index of the microcellular
   environment; b) a macro- structural volumetric measure of the
   hippocampus; and c) concentration levels of N-acetylaspartate, a marker
   of neuronal health.
   Discussion: This study will help to establish the contribution of the
   NPAS3 gene and its variants to brain tissue abnormalities in
   schizophrenia. Given the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the
   disorder and the large variation in outcomes, the identification of
   biological subgroups may in future support tailoring of treatment
   approaches in order to optimize recovery.}},

Title = {{Quantitative and visual characterization of asphaltenic components of

Abstract = {{Due to inefficiency of steam injection caused by technical, economic,
   and operational reasons, solvent methods have received special attention
   in heavy oil and bitumen recovery recently. Solvent-based recovery
   processes improves crude oil production and quality because underground
   in situ upgrading takes place after heavy oil is diluted with a light
   hydrocarbon solvent. Consequently, crude oil mobility increases due to
   significant reduction in viscosity caused by the asphaltene
   precipitation. However, solvent driven recovery processes are quite
   complex on account of the ``asphaltene destabilization{''} that takes
   place due to changes in temperature, pressure, crude oil composition,
   and solvent dissolved in oil. As a result of this destabilization, the
   asphaltene particles start to flocculate, and eventually may plug the
   pores in the reservoir due to larger asphaltene particle agglomeration
   in the reservoir.
   In this paper, the deasphalting of a heavy oil sample {[}8.67 degrees
   API] was carried out using an optical PVT cell. The experiments were
   undertaken at different temperature ranges {[}122 degrees F (50 degrees
   C)-230 degrees F (110 degrees C)] and pressure ranges (30-500 psig),
   which are the suggested ranges applicable to typical Canadian oilsands
   or similar shallow heavy-oil deposits around the world. Three light
   hydrocarbon solvents (propane, n-hexane, and n-decane) were used to
   break the stability of the as phaltene in the crude oil. An experimental
   methodology for ``asphaltene precipitation fraction{''} was developed in
   order to determine the effect of temperature, pressure, and solvent type
   on the amount of asphaltene precipitation. The experimental methodology
   was complemented through visual observations of asphaltene
   characteristics on the PVT cell as well as using optical microscopy. In
   addition, the refractive index measurements at the onset of
   precipitation were used to evaluate the changes in the oil after
   interacting with the solvent at different temperatures and pressures.
   Overall, the results showed that precipitated asphaltene fraction
   increases when the concentration of the resins goes down after the
   deasphalting of crude oil with solvent. In addition, the aggregation of
   asphaltene particles increases with increasing temperature {[}122
   degrees F (50 degrees C)-230 degrees F (110 degrees C)] and pressure
   (from 30 psig to 500 psig), and decreasing solvent carbon number (from
   C10 to C3). At the end, a comparative analysis of the quantitative and
   qualitative results from the experiments is provided. Based on these
   observations, the characteristics of asphaltene were classified in terms
   of their shape, size, and amount for different oil/solvent types,
   pressure, and temperature. This study will eventually lead to the
   identification of the effects of asphaltene characteristics on pore
   plugging during heavy-oil/bitumen recovery by gravity drainage from
   oilsands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{3024-3033}},

Abstract = {{Drainage kinetics, thickness, and stability of water-in-oil thin liquid
   emulsion films obtained from asphaltenes, heavy oil (bitumen), and
   deasphalted heavy oil (maltenes) diluted in toluene are studied. The
   results show that asphaltenes stabilize thin organic liquid films at
   much lower concentrations than maltenes and bitumen. The drainage of
   thin organic liquid films containing asphaltenes is significantly slower
   than the drainage of the films containing maltenes and bitumen. The
   films stabilized by asphaltenes are much thicker (40-90 nm) than those
   stabilized by maltenes (similar to 10 nm). Such significant variation in
   the film properties points to different stabilization mechanisms of thin
   organic liquid films. Apparent aging effects, including gradual increase
   of film thickness, rigidity of oil/water interface, and formation of
   submicrometer size aggregates, were observed for thin organic liquid
   films containing asphaltenes. No aging effects were observed for films
   containing maltenes and bitumen in toluene. The increasing stability and
   lower drainage dynamics of asphaltene-containing thin liquid films are
   attributed to specific ability of asphaltenes to self-assemble and form
   3D network in the film. The characteristic length of stable films is
   well beyond the size of single asphaltene molecules, nanoaggregates, or
   even clusters of nanoaggregates reported in the literature. Buildup of
   such 3D structure modifies the rheological properties of the liquid film
   to be non-Newtonian with yield stress (gel like). Formation of such
   network structure appears to be responsible for the slower drainage of
   thin asphaltenes in toluene liquid films. The yield stress of liquid
   film as small as similar to 10(-2) Pa is sufficient to stop the drainage
   before the film reaches the critical thickness at which film rupture}},

Title = {{Microbially-accelerated consolidation of oil sands tailings. Pathway I:
   changes in porewater chemistry}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Dispersed clay particles in mine tailings and soft sediments remain
   suspended for decades, hindering consolidation and challenging effective
   management of these aqueous slurries. Current geotechnical engineering
   models of self-weight consolidation of tailings do not consider
   microbial contribution to sediment behavior, however, here we show that
   microorganisms indigenous to oil sands tailings change the porewater
   chemistry and accelerate consolidation of oil sands tailings. A
   companion paper describes the role of microbes in alteration of clay
   chemistry in tailings. Microbial metabolism in mature fine tailings
   (MET) amended with an organic substrate (hydrolyzed canola meal)
   produced methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Dissolution of biogenic
   CO2 lowered the pH of amended MET to pH 6.4 vs. unamended MET (pH 7.7).
   About 12\% more porewater was recovered from amended than unamended MET
   during 2 months of active microbial metabolism, concomitant with
   consolidation of tailings. The lower pH in amended MET dissolved
   carbonate minerals, thereby releasing divalent cations including calcium
   (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) and increasing bicarbonate (HCO3-) in
   porewater. The higher concentrations increased the ionic strength of the
   porewater, in turn reducing the thickness of the diffuse double layer
   (DDL) of clay particles by reducing the surface charge potential
   (repulsive forces) of the clay particles. The combination of these
   processes accelerated consolidation of oil sands tailings. In addition,
   ebullition of biogenic gases created transient physical channels for
   release of porewater. In contrast, saturating the MET with non-biogenic
   CO2 had little effect on consolidation. These results have significant
   implications for management and reclamation of oil sands tailings ponds
   and broad importance in anaerobic environments such as contaminated
   harbors and estuaries containing soft sediments rich in clays and
   organics.}},

Title = {{Inequality constrained parameter estimation using filtering approaches}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{106}},
Pages = {{211-221}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Parameter estimation is usually approached by augmenting parameters to
   the states, leading to the simultaneous estimation of states and
   parameters. In practice, constraints on the values of the parameters can
   often be generated, and the incorporation of these constraints could
   improve the estimation performance. In this paper, we consider the
   inequality constrained parameter estimation problem. A new method of
   constructing inequality parameter constraints from routine operating
   data is introduced. Then, we introduce a framework for constraint
   implementation, based on first solving an unconstrained estimation
   problem and then a constrained problem, with recursive estimators such
   as the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter
   (EnKF); we also show that the same framework is applicable for moving
   horizon estimation (MHE). Then, we develop a method for constraint
   implementation for the UKF and the EnKF that yields faster convergence
   than the conventional projection method. Through simulations of two
   chemical processes, we show that the proposed method is able to provide
   fast recovery of state and parameter estimates from inaccurate initial
   guesses, leading to better estimation and control performance. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Pan-Arctic rivers strongly affect the Arctic Ocean and their vast
   lake-rich deltas. Their discharges may be increasing because of an
   intensifying hydrological cycle driven by warming climate. We show that
   a previously unexplained trend toward earlier ice breakup in the
   Mackenzie River Delta is little affected by winter warming during the
   period of river-ice growth and is unaffected by river discharge, but
   unexpectedly is strongly related to local spring warming during the
   period of river-ice melt. These results are statistically linked to
   declining winter snowfall that was not expected because of an
   intensifying Arctic hydrological cycle. Earlier ice breakup is expected
   to cause declining water level peaks that will reduce off-channel flows
   through the lake-rich delta before river waters enter the ocean. Thus,
   local spring warming with unexpected snowfall declines, rather than
   warmer winters, can drive earlier ice breakup in large Arctic rivers and
   biogeochemical changes in their river-ocean interface.

Title = {{Speed of processing in the primary motor cortex: A continuous theta
   burst stimulation study}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{261}},
Pages = {{177-184}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{`Temporally urgent' reactions are extremely rapid, spatially precise
   movements that are evoked following discrete stimuli. The involvement of
   primary motor cortex (M1) and its relationship to stimulus intensity in
   such reactions is not well understood. Continuous theta burst
   stimulation (cTBS) suppresses focal regions of the cortex and can assess
   the involvement of motor cortex in speed of processing. The primary
   objective of this study was to explore the involvement of M1 in speed of
   processing with respect to stimulus intensity. Thirteen healthy young
   adults participated in this experiment. Behavioral testing consisted of
   a simple button press using the index finger following median nerve
   stimulation of the opposite limb, at either high or low stimulus
   intensity. Reaction time was measured by the onset of electromyographic
   activity from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of each limb.
   Participants completed a 30 min bout of behavioral testing prior to, and
   15 min following, the delivery of cTBS to the motor cortical
   representation of the right FDI. The effect of cTBS on motor cortex was
   measured by recording the average of 30 motor evoked potentials (MEPs)
   just prior to, and 5 min following, cTBS. Paired t-tests revealed that,
   of thirteen participants, five demonstrated a significant attenuation,
   three demonstrated a significant facilitation and five demonstrated no
   significant change in MEP amplitude following cTBS. Of the group that
   demonstrated attenuated MEPs, there was a biologically significant
   interaction between stimulus intensity and effect of cTBS on reaction
   time and amplitude of muscle activation. This study demonstrates the
   variability of potential outcomes associated with the use of cTBS and
   further study on the mechanisms that underscore the methodology is
   required. Importantly, changes in motor cortical excitability may be an
   important determinant of speed of processing following high intensity
   stimulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of H2S and H2O in the methane feed on carbon deposition in a
   La0.4Sr0.5Ba0.1TiO3 (LSBT) anode-based solid oxide fuel cell were
   investigated in this work under different operating conditions.
   Characterization was done using a combination of electrochemical,
   Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), temperature-programmed
   oxidation (TPO) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements.
   As expected, carbon accumulation became more severe with increasing
   exposure time and operating temperature, but less severe in the presence
   of a current and/or steam. Addition of 0.5\% H2S to the feed increased
   carbon accumulation and this carbon could not be removed effectively by
   co-feeding a small amount of steam to the anode. The resulting carbon
   was, however, easier to remove with oxygen as compared to that deposited
   by the H2S-containing dry feed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the coking resistance of anode supported direct ethanol
   solid oxide fuel cell with a Ni-S-x anode was investigated comparatively
   with the conventional cell using pure Ni catalyst. The surface catalytic
   properties of Ni were manipulated via depositing a layer of S atoms. It
   was confirmed that on the surface of Ni, a combination of S monolayer
   and elemental S was formed without producing Ni3S2 phase. The developed
   Ni-S-x cell exhibited a significantly improved coke resistivity in
   ethanol feed while maintaining an adequately high performance. The S
   species on Ni enabled the suppression of the coke formation as well as
   the alleviation of the metal dusting effect of the anode structure.
   After operating in ethanol fuel for identical period of time at 850
   degrees C, a maximum power density of 400 mW cm(-2) was sustained
   whereas the conventional cell performance decreased to less than 40 mW
   cm(-2) from the original 704 mW cm(-2). In an optimized stability test,
   the Ni-S-x cell operated at 750 degrees C for more than 22 h until the
   fuel drained without any degradation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{127}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{In real-world problems we encounter situations where patterns are
   described by blocks (families) of features where each of these groups
   comes with a well-expressed semantics. For instance, in spatiotemporal
   data we are dealing with spatial coordinates of the objects (say, x-y
   coordinates) while the temporal part of the objects forms another
   collection of features. It is apparent that when clustering objects
   being described by families of features, it becomes intuitively
   justifiable to anticipate their different role and contribution to the
   clustering process of the data whereas the clustering is sought to be
   reflective of an overall structure in the data set. To address this
   issue, we introduce an agreement based fuzzy clustering a fuzzy
   clustering with blocks of features. The detailed investigations are
   carried out for the well-known algorithm of fuzzy clustering that is
   fuzzy C-means (FCM). We propose an extended version of the FCM where a
   composite distance function is endowed with adjustable weights
   (parameters) quantifying an impact coming from the blocks of features. A
   global evaluation criterion is used to assess the quality of the
   obtained results. It is treated as a fitness function in the
   optimization of the weights through the use of particle swarm
   optimization (PSO). The behavior of the proposed method is investigated
   in application to synthetic and real-world data as well as a certain
   case study. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{A Regional Climate Model (RCM), MM5 (the Fifth Generation Pennsylvania
   State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research mesoscale
   model), is used to simulate summer precipitation in Central Alberta. MM5
   was set up with a one-way, three-domain nested framework, with domain
   resolutions of 27, 9, and 3 km, respectively, and forced with
   ERA-Interim reanalysis data of ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts). The objective is to develop high resolution,
   grid-based Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves based on the
   simulated annual maximums of precipitation (AMP) data for durations
   ranging from 15-min to 24-h. The performance of MM5 was assessed in
   terms of simulated rainfall intensity, precipitable water, and 2-m air
   temperature. Next, the grid-based IDF curves derived from MM5 were
   compared to IDF curves derived from six RCMs of the North American
   Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) set up with 50-km
   grids, driven with NCEP-DOE (National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction-Department of Energy) Reanalysis II data, and regional IDF
   curves derived from observed rain gauge data (RG-IDF). The analyzed
   results indicate that 6-h simulated precipitable water and 2-m
   temperature agree well with the ERA-Interim reanalysis data. However,
   compared to RG-IDF curves, IDF curves based on simulated precipitation
   data of MM5 are overestimated especially for IDF curves of 2-year return
   period. In contract, IDF curves developed from NARCCAP data suffer from
   under-estimation and differ more from RG-IDF curves than the MM5 IDF
   curves. The over-estimation of IDF curves of MM5 was corrected by a
   quantile-based, bias correction method. By dynamically downscale the
   ERA-Interim and after bias correction, it is possible to develop IDF
   curves useful for regions with limited or no rain gauge data. This
   estimation process can be further extended to predict future grid-based
   IDF curves subjected to possible climate change impacts based on climate
   change projections of GCMs (general circulation models) of IPCC
   (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Temperature-responsive hyperbranched polymers containing primary amines
   as pendent groups have been synthesized for solid liquid separation of
   kaolinite clay suspension. The effects of temperature, polymer charge
   density, and polymer architecture on particle flocculation have been
   investigated. Suspensions treated with the temperature-responsive
   amine-based hyperbranched polymers showed remarkable separation of the
   fine particles at a low polymer dosage of 10 ppm and at testing
   temperatures of 40 degrees C. In comparison to other polymers studied
   (linear and hyperbranched homopolymers and copolymers), the
   temperature-responsive amine-based hyperbranched copolymers showed
   better particle flocculation at 40 degrees C, as evidenced by the
   formation of a thinner sediment bed without compromising the amount of
   clay particles being flocculated. This superior solid liquid separation
   performance can be explained by the hydrophobic interaction of PNIPAM
   segments on particle surfaces or the capture of additional free
   particles or small floc due to the exposure of buried positive charges
   (because of the phase separation of the hydrophilic amines and
   hydrophobic PNIPAM part) at temperatures above the lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST).}},

Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{The evaluation of engineered nanomaterial safety has been hindered by
   conflicting reports demonstrating differential degrees of toxicity with
   the same nanoparticles. The unique properties of these materials
   increase the likelihood that they will interfere with analytical
   techniques, which may contribute to this phenomenon. We tested the
   potential for: 1) nanoparticle intrinsic fluorescence/absorbance, 2)
   interactions between nanoparticles and assay components, and 3) the
   effects of adding both nanoparticles and analytes to an assay, to
   interfere with the accurate assessment of toxicity. Silicon, cadmium
   selenide, titanium dioxide, and helical rosette nanotubes each affected
   at least one of the six assays tested, resulting in either substantial
   over-or under-estimations of toxicity. Simulation of realistic assay
   conditions revealed that interference could not be predicted solely by
   interactions between nanoparticles and assay components. Moreover, the
   nature and degree of interference cannot be predicted solely based on
   our current understanding of nanomaterial behaviour. A literature survey
   indicated that ca. 95\% of papers from 2010 using biochemical techniques
   to assess nanotoxicity did not account for potential interference of
   nanoparticles, and this number had not substantially improved in 2012.
   We provide guidance on avoiding and/or controlling for such interference
   to improve the accuracy of nanotoxicity assessments.}},

Pages = {{48-56}},
Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{Chemical modification of chitosan to generate new bio-functional
   materials can bring more desirable properties depending on the nature of
   the groups introduced. Phosphorylated chitosan has attracted interests
   in recent years. The literature has reported that the phosphorylation of
   chitosan could be achieved through three different reaction routes,
   namely, in the presence of H3PO4/urea, H3PO4/Et3PO4/P2O5, or
   P2O5/CH3SO3H. However, the exact chemical structure of phosphorylated
   chitosan synthesized by different reaction routes has not been
   systematically studied and compared. Meanwhile, the most common opinion
   is that the hydroxyl group in chitosan is the main substitution site. In
   this work, phosphorylated chitosan was synthesized using three different
   reaction routes, and the chemical structures of the products were
   studied by infrared, X-ray photoelectron and C-13 NMR spectroscopic
   characterization. It was observed that in the reaction routes using
   H3PO4/urea and H3PO4/Et3PO4/P2O5, the amino groups were substituted
   instead of the hydroxyl groups. In the reaction route using
   P2O5/CH3SO3H, the amino groups were shielded by the ionic binding with
   CH3SO3H, and the C-6 hydroxyl groups were phosphorylated. Different
   structures of the phosphorylated chitosan were proposed based on the
   characterization results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Processing of oil sands using water-based extraction processes requires
   selective aeration of liberated bitumen droplets to facilitate transport
   of aerated bitumen to the top of the slurry where it is recovered.
   Colloidal forces between bubble and bitumen or silica control the
   selective attachment of bitumen to air bubbles as desired. In this
   study, interaction forces between bubble and bitumen or silica were
   measured in various aqueous solutions using atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). The wettability of the silica particles was found to play a
   significant role in controlling bubble-silica interactions. There exists
   a long-range repulsive force and zero adhesion between air bubbles and
   hydrophilic silica spheres, in contrast to strong attractive force and
   large adhesion force between the air bubble and hydrophobic silica
   spheres. The results suggest the potential of unwanted aeration of
   hydrophobic solids, leading to a poor froth quality. Study on
   bitumen-bubble interaction shows that the types of surfactants have a
   great effect on the long-range interaction due to their adsorption on
   the bubble surface, which could cause the bubble surface either
   positively or negatively charged, leading to different electrostatic
   forces. In the plant process water or in the anionic surfactant
   solution, the bitumen-coated silica sphere could penetrate into the
   bubble to form a three-phase contact (TPC) line when the external
   loading force exceeds a threshold value. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Availability of computational methods that predict disorder from protein
   sequences fuels rapid advancements in the protein disorder field. The
   most accurate predictions are usually obtained with consensus-based
   approaches. However, their design is performed in an ad hoc manner. We
   perform first-of-its-kind rational design where we empirically search
   for an optimal mixture of base methods, selected out of a comprehensive
   set of 20 modern predictors, and we explore several novel ways to build
   the consensus. Our method for the prediction of disorder based on
   Consensus of Predictors (disCoP) combines seven base methods, utilizes
   custom-designed set of selected 11 features that aggregate base
   predictions over a sequence window and uses binomial deviance loss-based
   regression to implement the consensus. Empirical tests performed on an
   independent benchmark set (with low-sequence similarity compared with
   proteins used to design disCoP), shows that disCoP provides
   statistically significant improvements with at least moderate magnitude
   of differences. disCoP outperforms 28 predictors, including other
   state-of-the-art consensuses, and achieves Area Under the ROC Curve of
   .85 and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of .5 compared with .83 and .48
   of the best considered approach, respectively. Our consensus provides
   high rate of correct disorder predictions, especially when low rate of
   incorrect disorder predictions is desired. We are first to
   comprehensively assess predictions in the context of several functional
   types of disorder and we demonstrate that disCoP generates accurate
   predictions of disorder located at the post-translational modification
   sites (in particular phosphorylation sites) and in autoregulatory and
   flexible linker regions. disCoP is available at

Title = {{Modelling of Cold Heavy-Oil Production With Sand For Subsequent
   Thermal/Solvent Injection Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-108}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Although proved beneficial and economic for thin reservoirs, the cold
   heavy-oil production with sand (CHOPS) method has several limitations.
   The sand produced during CHOPS changes the geomechanical and
   petrophysical properties continuously and results in open channels in
   the reservoir known as wormholes. Also, the CHOPS method results in a
   low oil recovery (8-10\% original oil in place). This entails a
   follow-up enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) process, which is always an option
   for further exploitation, referred to as post-CHOPS.
   Assessment of such a process through numerical simulation, as the most
   inexpensive yet most powerful tool, necessitates a comprehensive
   modelling approach to capture its dynamic physical nature. Only through
   such a realistic model can one obtain reasonably reliable reservoir
   characteristics after CHOPS that are critically important to assess
   post-CHOPS applications. To this end, we implemented a fractal pattern
   of different kinds by use of a diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)
   algorithm as wormhole domain with a partial dual-porosity approach and a
   step-by-step simulation technique, taking advantage of a simple
   mathematical model to integrate the sand-production data with fractal
   patterns. The wormhole network is assumed to grow with more sand
   production, respecting geological conditions and well perforation.
   Moreover, its effective properties and the contained fluid can be
   controlled along its length and pattern at different steps. Such an
   option is of great assistance in the history-matching process. The model
   was validated successfully with available Alberta field data. As a
   preliminary step to post-CHOPS, several thermal, solvent, and hybrid
   combinations of both scenarios were considered.
   The proposed method for CHOPS modelling is a useful approach to initiate
   a quick post-CHOPS study in practice if sand-production history is
   provided. One may also take advantage of its compatibility with any
   black-oil, compositional, or thermal simulators.}},

Abstract = {{Block model estimates are commonly calculated by the well-established
   technique of kriging. The mathematics are well established, but
   implementation details require site-specific considerations. Checking
   and measuring the performance of the estimates is important to ensure
   the block model is suitable for its intended purpose. There are
   different criteria for long-term planning and short-term planning. The
   implementation of kriging should be checked with cross-validation and
   assessed for conditional bias and departure from theoretical optimality
   with the calculation of kriging efficiency. A new expression of kriging
   efficiency, which compares the kriging variance with the theoretically
   optimal kriging variance, is developed to aid in this assessment. The
   assessment tools presented here can be applied in a number of
   situations; however, ordinary kriging with a reasonably large search
   performs well in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of 120 recent NI 43-101 technical reports was conducted to
   evaluate the current state of practice regarding resource classification
   techniques. The most common classification techniques are based on
   search neighbourhoods (50\% of recent reports), drill-hole spacing (30\%
   of recent reports), and/or kriging variance (6\% of recent reports). Two
   new techniques are proposed. The first is based on kriging variance and
   involves removing one or more drill-holes with the highest weights while
   performing kriging and using the resultant kriging variance for
   classification. This technique has the advantages of variance-based
   techniques and reduces artifacts. The second technique is based on
   conditional simulation and uses a moving window approach for
   classification at the desired selective mining unit resolution based on
   larger production volume criteria. This technique has the advantage of
   accounting for heteroscedasticity, which is a common characteristic in
   mineral deposits, and also reduces artifacts since a production volume
   scale is considered for the actual classification. The drill-hole
   spacing, search neighborhood, kriging variance, and simulation-based
   techniques are described and compared for 2D and 3D examples with
   regular and irregular drilling patterns to highlight the advantages and
   disadvantages of each method.}},

Abstract = {{Modular construction is a common practice for building industrial
   plants, particularly in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada. Each
   module is a project with its own activities and constraints. These
   modules are prefabricated offsite, at a location called the module
   assembly yard, and then shipped to the site. Effective scheduling of
   modules of an industrial plant involves developing a realistic schedule
   that makes best use of limited resources in the yard while satisfying
   the constraints and uncertainties of the entire project. Scheduling such
   large-scale, multiunit projects using commercial CPM-based scheduling
   applications (e.g.,Primavera, Microsoft Project) is not effective. In
   previous work, we have introduced a hybrid framework, called
   simulation-based auction protocol (SBAP), for effective resource
   scheduling in large-scale projects. The present study employs the SBAP
   framework for effective allocation of resources (e.g.,space, skilled
   crew) and for satisfaction of various constraints. This system pulls
   data from a comprehensive database, runs the simulation model behind the
   scenes, and generates various graphical reports to aid superintendents
   and project managers in pertinent project decisions. The developed
   system is also capable of scheduling the fast-track modular construction
   projects with limited data available, doing effective resource leveling,
   and scheduling resources (e.g.,space, crew) effectively based on various
   shifts and calendars. The described case study in this paper
   demonstrates the capabilities of the developed system for planning the
   module assembly yards.}},

Abstract = {{Curling of concrete remains a major concern in flatwork and its
   mitigation is critical for crack control, durability, and mechanical
   performance, not to mention the aesthetics. This report describes a
   study on concrete slabs that were subjected to a controlled environment
   of sustained heat and humidity. The resultant curling was evaluated by
   means of strain gauges placed along the length and breadth of the slab.
   In addition to the reference plain concrete mix, three fiber reinforced
   mixes were cast with cellulose microfibers incorporated at a volume
   fraction up to 0.3\%. The results show that plain concrete will crack
   and thereby ease the amount of curl whereas the addition of fibers at
   low dosage rates (<=0.2 \%) leads to crack control and consequently, a
   visible increase in curling. However, at 0.3 \% volume fraction,
   cellulose fibers were able to arrest cracking and also reduce the curl
   with respect to the reference plain mix.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Spherical particles immersed in liquids were observed in their descent
   along a glass wall inclined at various angles a, over a range of
   particle-based Reynolds numbers (Re-p) extending to high values (15 <
   Re-p < 50 000), rarely reported in such flows. Plastic, ceramic, and
   metal spheres were used, characterized as to surface roughness and their
   friction coefficients against the glass. Liquids were selected to
   achieve a viscosity variation by a factor of 300, as well as having
   widely differing chemical natures. A drag coefficient (C-p) used to
   correlate sphere velocity data was found to define a near-universal
   curve C-p (Re-p) over the entire Re-p-range, provided that spheres
   rolled down the wall without slipping, and here there was no need to
   accommodate roughness effects of solid-to-solid friction explicitly.
   This correlation was especially good for Re-p > 10(3). For lower Re-p,
   deviations appeared in systematic fashion, falling below the universal
   curve when slip was present. Several unexpected features were observed:
   (a) a threshold angle, alpha(0), needed before sphere motion could
   begin; (b) spheres lifting off from the wall at high Re-p, but always at
   the same maximum angle alpha(m) = 74 degrees; and (c) prior to lift-off,
   a buzzing sound (not reported previously) for which explanations are
   offered. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{A comparative study of flowback rate and pressure transient behavior in
   multifractured horizontal wells completed in tight gas and oil
   reservoirs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{82-93}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Tight reservoirs stimulated by multistage hydraulic fracturing are
   commonly characterized by analyzing the hydrocarbon production data.
   However, analyzing the available hydrocarbon production data can best be
   applied to estimate the effective fracture matrix interface, and is not
   enough for a full characterization of the induced hydraulic fractures.
   Before putting the well on flowback, the induced fractures are filled
   with the compressed fracturing fluid. Therefore, analyzing the
   early-time rate and pressure of fracturing water and gas/oil should in
   principle be able to partly characterize the induced fractures, and
   complement the conventional production data analysis.
   We construct basic diagnostic plots by using two-phase flowback data of
   three multifractured horizontal wells to understand the physics of
   flowback. Analysis of flow rate plots suggests three separate flowback
   regions based on the relative values of water and gas/oil flow rate. In
   the first region, water production dominates while in the third region
   gas/oil production dominates. In the second region, water production
   drops and gas/oil production ramps up. The cumulative water production
   (CWP) plots show two distinct water recovery periods. Before gas/oil
   breakthrough, CWP linearly increases with time. After breakthrough, CWP
   increases with a slower rate, and reaches to a plateau for the oil well.
   We also develop a simple analytical model to compare the pressure/rate
   transient behavior of the three flowback cases. This work demonstrates
   that rate and pressure, carefully measured during the flowback
   operations, can be interpreted to evaluate the fracturing operations and
   to complement the conventional production data analysis for a more
   comprehensive fracture characterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In various scenarios of fuzzy decision-making we encounter a collection
   of sources of knowledge - local models describing decision pursuits
   undertaken by individual decision-makers. These sources have to be
   agreed upon. The reconciliation mechanisms are present quite vividly in
   any collective pursuit including distributed modeling, time series
   characterization and classification. There is an interesting and
   practically pertinent task of reconciling decisions coming from the
   decision models and construct a decision of a holistic character. In
   this study, we introduce a concept of a granular fuzzy decision built on
   a basis of decisions formed by individual decision models. Here the term
   ``granular{''} pertains to a wealth of possible realizations of such
   decision thus giving rise to fuzzy fuzzy (namely, fuzzy(2)),
   interval-valued, probabilistic-fuzzy and rough-fuzzy representations of
   information granules. Information granularity plays a pivotal role in
   reconciling differences among existing decisions, quantifying their
   diversity and associating it with the overall fuzzy decision. We exploit
   a principle of justifiable granularity to develop and articulate a
   granular fuzzy decision of a holistic nature. Along with the passive way
   of forming the granular fuzzy decisions, we introduce an active form of
   design in which established is a feedback loop using which on a basis of
   the holistic view adjusted are the individual decisions. Detailed
   optimization schemes are discussed along with compelling examples of
   forming type-2 and type-3 fuzzy sets.(C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{SYSTEMS \& CONTROL LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we consider the reduction of information transmission
   frequency of distributed moving horizon estimation (DMHE) for a class of
   nonlinear systems in which interacting subsystems exchange information
   with each other through a shared communication network. Specifically,
   algorithms based on two event-triggered methods are proposed to reduce
   the number of information transmissions between the subsystems in a DMHE
   scheme. In the first algorithm, a subsystem sends out its current
   information when a triggering condition based on the difference between
   the current state estimate and a previously transmitted one is
   satisfied; in the second algorithm, the transmission of information from
   a subsystem to other subsystems is triggered by the difference between
   the current measurement of the output and its derivatives and a
   previously transmitted measurement. In order to ensure the convergence
   and ultimate boundedness of the estimation error, we also propose to
   redesign the local moving horizon estimator of a subsystem to account
   for the possible lack of state updates from other subsystems explicitly.
   A chemical process is utilized to demonstrate the applicability and
   performance of the proposed approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This article reviews the properties of a novel class of molecules: the
   tetrameric acids. These molecules have brought a large interest in
   petroleum science since the discovery of the family of molecules named
   ARN in 2004. ARN, which is naturally present in oil, is responsible, by
   reaction with calcium ion, of the formation of calcium naphthenate
   deposits; organic deposits that cause irregularities in crude oil
   production and processing. In order to study the properties of ARN, a
   model tetrameric acid molecule mimicking some of its properties named
   BP-10 has been developed in 2008 by Nordgard and Sjoblom and has been
   extensively used since then. After presenting the experimental
   techniques used to study the tetrameric acids, this review describes in
   detail the structure, preparation, detection and the bulk and
   interfacial properties of tetrameric acids ARN and BP-10. Finally the
   prediction of the operational problems with calcium naphthenate
   precipitation in new fields is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Partitioning of 15 proteins in dextran-70-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000
   aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) in the presence of 0.01 M sodium
   phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 was studied. The effect of salt additives
   (NaCl, CsCl, Na2SO4, NaClO4 and NaSCN) at different concentrations on
   the protein partition behavior was examined. The salt effects on protein
   partitioning were analyzed by using the Collander solvent regression
   relationship between the protein partition coefficients in ATPSs with
   and without salt additives. The results obtained show that the presence
   and concentration of salt additives affect the protein partition
   behavior. Analysis of ATPSs in terms of the differences between the
   relative hydrophobicity and electrostatic properties of the phases does
   not explain the protein partition behavior. The differences between
   protein partitioning could not be explained by the protein size. The
   structural signatures for the proteins were constructed from partition
   coefficient values in four ATPSs with different salt additives, and the
   structural distances were calculated using cytochrome c as the reference
   structure. The structural distances for all the examined proteins
   (except lysozyme) were found to be interrelated. Analysis of about 50
   different descriptors of the protein structures revealed that the
   partition behavior of proteins is determined by the peculiarities of
   their surfaces (e.g., the number of water-filled cavities and the
   averaged hydrophobicity of the surface residues) and by the intrinsic
   flexibility of the protein structure measured in terms of the B-factor
   (or temperature factor). (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{92}},

Abstract = {{Design specifications for solids suspension (just suspended speed-N-js)
   in stirred tanks are currently based on the original form of the
   Zwietering correlation. There are several limitations of this
   correlation which can lead to poor predictions. The limitations,
   however, are not clearly defined. In this paper we review the reported
   limitations of applicability of the Zwietering correlation in detail,
   and propose ways to predict N-js which extend some of these limits. New
   data is reported and a detailed analysis of the effects of off-bottom
   clearance and solids concentration is presented. These results show two
   things: first that the effect of off-bottom clearance cannot be
   explicitly accounted for using the Zwietering equation form. S values
   that exactly match the geometry of the system must be used. Second, the
   current exponent on solids concentration is applicable only up to 2 wt\%
   solids (X = 2). Three new exponents are proposed based on the particle
   type: 0.17, 0.23, and 0.32. Using a modified exponent of 0.23, which
   represents the entire data set with some scatter, N-js can be predicted
   up to 35 wt\% solids (X = 54). A new correlation that is a combination
   of Zwietering and Baldi, and is robust in scale-up based on constant
   power/mass is proposed. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3, 2}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the influence of rotor structure on fault diagnosis
   indices variations is studied for switched reluctance motors (SRMs). To
   achieve this aim, two novel SRMs, namely a slanted-rotor SRM (SL-SRM)
   and stepped-rotor SRM (ST-SRM), are analyzed and tested, accompanied
   with a conventional SRM. Accordingly, three popular indices, mutual
   inductance index (MII), radial force index (RFI), and torque index (TI),
   variations are offered to diagnose the eccentricity fault occurrence
   evaluation in different structures. To assess motor characteristics, the
   variations of flux linkage, flux density, and inductance as some of the
   electromagnetic traits of SRM, SL-SRM, and ST-SRM are obtained and
   analyzed utilizing 3-D transient finite element method (3-D-TFEM).
   Afterward, all three motors are subjected to eccentricity fault and the
   fault diagnosis indices are obtained individually in various levels of
   fault severities. Briefly speaking, the effect of rotor structure on all
   three of these indices is analyzed first. Second, the most robust and
   fault tolerant index independent of the motor's structure is introduced
   for a specific application. To verify the simulation results,
   experimental findings are also included.}},

   sample preparation method}},
Journal = {{MICRON}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{25-31}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The atomic diffusion mechanisms associated with metallurgical failure of
   TaRhx diffusion barriers for Cu metallizations were studied by in situ
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The issues related to in situ
   heating of focused ion beam (FIB) prepared cross-sectional TEM samples
   that contain Cu thin films are discussed. The Cu layer in Si/(13
   nm)TaRhx/Cu stacks showed grain growth and formation of voids at
   temperatures exceeding 550 degrees C. For Si/(43 nm)TaRhx/Cu stacks,
   grain growth of Cu was delayed to higher temperatures, i.e., 700 degrees
   C, and void formation was not observed. Extensive surface diffusion of
   Cu, however, preceded bulk diffusion. Therefore, a 10 nm film of
   electron beam evaporated C was deposited on both sides of the TEM
   lamellae to limit surface diffusion. This processing technique allowed
   for direct observation of atomic diffusion and reaction mechanisms
   across the TaRhx interface. Failure occurred by nucleation of
   orthorhombic RhSi particles at the Si/TaRhx interface. Subsequently, the
   barrier at areas adjacent to RhSi particles was depleted in Rh. This
   created lower density areas in the barrier, which facilitated diffusion
   of Cu to the Si substrate to form Cu3Si. The morphology of an in situ
   annealed lamella was compared with an ex situ bulk annealed sample,
   which showed similar reaction morphology. The sample preparation method
   developed in this study successfully prevented surface
   diffusion/delamination of the Cu layer and can be employed to understand
   the metallurgical failure of other potential diffusion barriers. (C)

Abstract = {{The effects of binary interactions on the coke yield and cracking
   kinetics in mixtures of model compounds were examined to understand the
   interactions present in multi-component mixtures, such as petroleum
   residues. Eight model compounds were selected with molecular weights in
   the range of 398-623 g/mol and structural elements to represent
   components of vacuum residues, including a pyrene substituted with four
   alkyl groups and pyrene derivatives tethered to various heterocycles via
   an ethano bridge. Thermogravimetric analysis of the binary mixtures
   showed evidence of three distinct modes of behavior with respect to the
   additive sum of the mass-weighted component contributions: the coke
   yield was (1) equal to the additive sum, (2) less than the additive sum,
   or (3) greater than the additive sum. The individual behavior correlated
   well with the type of compounds present in the specific mixtures and can
   be explained in terms of three types of interactions between the mixture
   components: radical stability or kinetic factors, association forces
   between the mixture components, and matrix effects. The apparent
   activation energies of cracking for the mixtures, on the other hand,
   showed complex behavior that sometimes followed the additivity
   contributions of the components but, on other occasions, was outside the
   bounds of activation energies of the pure compounds.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the center of
   pressure (COP) velocity reflects the center of mass (COM) acceleration
   due to a large derivative gain in the neural control system during quiet
   standing. Twenty-seven young (27.2 +/- 4.5 years) and twenty-three
   elderly (66.2 +/- 5.0 years) subjects participated in this study. Each
   subject was requested to stand quietly on a force plate for five trials,
   each 90 s long. The COP and COM displacements, the COP and COM
   velocities, and the COM acceleration were acquired via a force plate and
   a laser displacement sensor. The amount of fluctuation of each variable
   was quantified using the root mean square. Following the experimental
   study, a simulation study was executed to investigate the experimental
   findings. The experimental results revealed that the COP velocity was
   correlated with the COM velocity, but more highly correlated with the
   COM acceleration. The equation of motion of the inverted pendulum model,
   however, accounts only for the correlation between the COP and COM
   velocities. These experimental results can be meaningfully explained by
   the simulation study, which indicated that the neural motor command
   presumably contains a significant portion that is proportional to body
   velocity. In conclusion, the COP velocity fluctuation reflects the COM
   acceleration fluctuation rather than the COM velocity fluctuation,
   implying that the neural motor command controlling quiet standing
   posture contains a significant portion that is proportional to body
   velocity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The count of mitotic cells is a critical factor in most cancer grading
   systems. Extracting the mitotic cell from the histopathological image is
   a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an efficient
   technique for detecting and segmenting the mitotic cells in the
   high-resolution multispectral image. The proposed technique consists of
   three main modules: discriminative image generation, mitotic cell
   candidate detection and segmentation, and mitotic cell candidate
   classification. In the first module, a discriminative image is obtained
   by linear discriminant analysis using ten different spectral band
   images. A set of mitotic cell candidate regions is then detected and
   segmented by the Bayesian modeling and local-region threshold method. In
   the third module, a 226 dimension feature is extracted from the mitotic
   cell candidates and their surrounding regions. An imbalanced
   classification framework is then applied to perform the classification
   for the mitotic cell candidates in order to detect the real mitotic
   cells. The proposed technique has been evaluated on a publicly available
   dataset of 35 x 10 multispectral images, in which 224 mitotic cells are
   manually labeled by experts. The proposed technique is able to provide
   superior performance compared to the existing technique, 81.5\%
   sensitivity rate and 33.9\% precision rate in terms of detection
   performance, and 89.3\% sensitivity rate and 87.5\% precision rate in
   terms of segmentation performance.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) can directly take digital images in the
   gastrointestinal tract of a patient. It has opened a new chapter in
   small intestine examination. However, a major problem associated with
   this technology is that too many images need to be manually examined by
   clinicians. Currently, there is no standard for capsule endoscopy image
   interpretation and classification. Most state-of-the-art CAD methods
   often suffer from poor performance, high computational cost, or multiple
   empirical thresholds. In this paper, a new method for rapid bleeding
   detection in theWCE video is proposed. We group pixels through
   superpixel segmentation to reduce the computational complexity while
   maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Feature of each superpixel is
   extracted using the red ratio in RGB space and fed into support vector
   machine for classification. Also, the influence of edge pixels has been
   removed in this paper. Comparative experiments show that our algorithm
   is superior to the existing methods in terms of sensitivity,
   specificity, and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of transmit beamspace design for
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar with colocated antennas in
   application to direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. A new method for
   designing the transmit beamspace matrix that enables the use of
   search-free DOA estimation techniques at the receiver is introduced. The
   essence of the proposed method is to design the transmit beamspace
   matrix based on minimizing the difference between a desired transmit
   beampattern and the actual one while enforcing the constraint of uniform
   power distribution across the transmit array elements. The desired
   transmit beampattern can be of arbitrary shape and is allowed to consist
   of one or more spatial sectors. The number of transmit waveforms is even
   but otherwise arbitrary. To allow for simple search-free DOA estimation
   algorithms at the receive array, the rotational invariance property is
   established at the transmit array by imposing a specific structure on
   the beamspace matrix. Semidefinite programming relaxation is used to
   approximate the proposed formulation by a convex problem that can be
   solved efficiently. We also propose a spatial-division based design
   (SDD) by dividing the spatial domain into several subsectors and
   assigning a subset of the transmit beams to each subsector. The transmit
   beams associated with each subsector are designed separately. Simulation
   results demonstrate the improvement in the DOA estimation performance
   offered by using the proposed joint and SDD transmit beamspace design
   methods as compared to the traditional MIMO radar technique.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are treated with levodopa (l-dopa) to
   help stabilize their impaired motor abilities; however, l-dopa leads to
   increased homocysteine (Hcy) levels, which may have a deleterious effect
   on brain structure and function. The purpose of this study was to
   examine the impact of increased Hcy concentration on global brain
   atrophy as determined by magnetic resonance imaging in PD patients and
   controls. The effect of high Hcy level on ventricular dilatation
   (percentage of intracranial volume {[}\%ICV]) and total tissue volume
   (\%ICV) was examined at baseline and longitudinally at 36 months. Age,
   sex, education, and l-dopa duration (in PD patients) were included as
   covariates. Elevated Hcy levels correlated positively with ventricular
   dilatation (\%ICV) in the whole sample (P=0.004) and in the PD group
   (P=0.008). At baseline, adults with a high Hcy level (>14 mol/L) had
   higher ventricular volume (\%ICV) than adults with a low Hcy level (14
   mol/L) in the whole sample (P=0.006) and in the PD group (P=0.03), which
   persisted over 36 months in both the whole sample (P=0.004) and the PD
   group (P=0.03). PD patients with high Hcy concentrations had a greater
   rate of ventricular enlargement (\%ICV) over time compared with those
   with low Hcy concentration (P=0.02). Elevated Hcy concentration was
   associated with increased ventricular dilatation (\%ICV) in PD patients.
   A larger sample with a broader age range and longer follow-up is needed
   to establish the consequences of high Hcy level, including interactions
   with genetic and environmental risk factors, in PD. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The occupational indoor air quality during construction plays a role in
   determining workers' health as construction activities frequently
   generate airborne pollutants. This paper presents a methodology to
   predict the concentration of air pollutants during construction
   activities using building information modeling (BIM) and schedule the
   activities to limit the pollutant concentration within acceptable
   limits. This method allows the stakeholders to determine and predict the
   indoor air quality at the construction site before actual construction
   work. The proposed method was applied to predict the concentration of
   PM10 during dry wall sanding in a new residence as a case study. Using
   BIM technology PM10 concentration was predicted during drywall sanding,
   which ranged from 12.8 to 29.5 mg/m(3). Also the hourly PM10
   concentration level and the production rate of the drywall activity was
   adjusted to reduce the concentration level from 20 mg/m(3) to the
   applicable standard of 10 mg/m(3). The unique contribution of this
   research compared to previous research on indoor air quality and BIM is
   the development of a new method that integrates occupational indoor air
   quality with building information modeling for the assessment of the
   occupational environment for construction workers. More specifically,
   this paper uses BIM to assess the occupational indoor air quality and
   schedule construction activities to limit the exposure of workers to

Abstract = {{The need for high-speed multi-function protective relays in both
   traditional transmission systems and the new emerging paradigm of the
   smart grid is growing. As a widely used protective scheme for
   transmission lines, a distance relay's high speed and reliable operation
   to clear faults is essential. This paper proposes a real-time
   low-latency hardware digital distance protective relay on the field
   programmable gate array (FPGA). Taking advantage of inherent hard-wired
   architecture of the FPGA, the proposed hardware distance relay design is
   paralleled and fully pipelined to achieve low latencies in various relay
   modules which are developed in textual VHDL language. This low-latency
   feature allows fast operating and data throughput so that the relay can
   handle high-frequency sampled data and reach higher computational
   efficiency. In addition, the parallelism and hardwired architecture of
   the FPGA makes the design more reliable in computation than the
   sequential software-based numeric relay. The FPGA-based distance relay
   can operate on both phasor-based signals and instantaneous signals with
   2.09 mu s and 0.35 mu s latency respectively based on the clock
   frequency of 100 MHz. The hardware relay is tested in real-time by
   feeding it with generated faulted current and voltage data for typical
   faults and the relay response recorded. The results demonstrate the
   speed and effectiveness of the hardware distance relay.}},

Abstract = {{Data semantics plays a fundamental role in computer science, in general,
   and in computing With words, in particular. The semantics of words
   arises as a sophisticated problem, since words being actually vague
   linguistic terms are pieces of information characterized by
   impreciseness, incompleteness, uncertainty and/or vagueness. The
   qualitative semantics and the quantitative semantics are two aspects of
   vague linguistic information, which are closely related. However, the
   qualitative semantics of linguistic terms, and even the qualitative
   semantics of the symbolic approaches, seem to be not elaborated on
   directly in the literature. In this study, we propose an interpretation
   of the inherent order-based semantics of terms through their qualitative
   semantics modeled by hedge algebra structures. The quantitative
   semantics of terms are developed based on the quantification of hedge
   algebras. With this explicit approach, we propose two concepts of
   assessment scales to address decision problems: linguistic scales used
   for representing expert linguistic assessments and semantic linguistic
   scales based on 4-tuple linguistic representation model, which forms a
   formalized structure useful for computing with words. An example of a
   simple multi-criteria decision problem is examined by running a
   comparative study. We also analyze the main advantages of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new control topology to enable effective
   integration of voltage source converters (VSCs) in weak grids. The
   controller has two main parts. The first part is a linear power-damping
   and synchronizing controller which automatically synchronizes a VSC to a
   grid by providing damping and synchronizing power components, and
   enables effective full power injection even under very weak grid
   conditions. The controller adopts cascaded angle, frequency and power
   loops for frequency and angle regulation. The controller emulates the
   dynamic performance of synchronous machines, which eases grid
   integration and provides a virtual inertia control framework for VSCs to
   damp power and frequency oscillations. Although the linear controller
   offers stable and smooth operation in many cases, it cannot ensure
   system stability in weak grids, where sudden large disturbances rapidly
   drift system dynamics to the nonlinear region. To overcome this
   difficulty, a supplementary nonlinear controller is developed to assist
   the linear controller and enhance system performance under large-signal
   nonlinear disturbances, such as self-synchronization, disturbances in
   grid frequency and angle, high power injection in very weak grids and
   fault-ride-through conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new control strategy for voltage-source converters
   (VSCs) in the frequency-angle domain which enables dc-link voltage
   regulation via frequency and load angle adjustment. A major advantage of
   the proposed controller is emulating the behavior of synchronous
   machines (SMs) with proper regulation of dc-link voltage which eases
   integration of VSCs interfacing distributed and renewable generation
   units into ac systems in the presence of conventional SMs. A cascaded
   frequency, angle and virtual torque control topology is developed to
   emulate the mechanical behavior of an SM which offers synchronization
   power to eliminate the need for a phase-locked-loop after initial
   converter synchronization, and damping power dynamics to damp power
   oscillations; and presents frequency dynamics similar to SMs, thus it
   introduces some inertia to the grid. The controller presents high
   stability margin and fast dc-link voltage regulation, whereas it can
   provide frequency support in the ac-side during contingencies. Frequency
   and voltage amplitude are adjusted by two separate loops. Two different
   variants are proposed for dc-link voltage control; namely direct dc-link
   voltage control and indirect dc-link voltage control via a dc-link
   voltage controller. Small-signal dynamics, analysis, and design process
   are presented. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to
   validate the controller effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Several crystallization-based techniques are used to measure the
   chemical-composition distribution of polyolefins, but they are limited
   to semicrystalline polyolefins. Recently, high-temperature thermal
   gradient interaction chromatography (HT-TGIC) has been developed to
   quantify the chemical-composition distribution of semicrystalline and
   amorphous polyolefins, thus broadening the range of techniques available
   for the analysis of polyolefin chemical-composition distribution. In
   HT-TGIC, the fractionation mechanism relies on the interaction of
   polyolefin chains with a graphite surface upon temperature change in an
   isocratic solvent. In the present investigation, a series of
   ethylene/1-octene copolymers having approximately the same molecular
   weight average and different comonomer fractions (up to 25\% of
   1-octene) is synthesized using a metallocene catalyst to investigate the
   fractionation mechanism of HT-TGIC. Three copolymer samples and their
   blends are also studied to determine which operation parameters
   influence the HT-TGIC peak shape and position. The cooling rate has no
   significant effect on the desorption temperature and the broadness of
   the HT-TGIC chromatograms. On the other hand, the heating rate and the
   elution flow rate substantially influence the peak temperature and

Abstract = {{PurposeTo introduce a new method for removing background artifacts in
   field maps and apply it to enhance the accuracy of susceptibility
   mapping.
   MethodsA field artifact removal method is introduced that is based on
   the sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data (SHARP)
   method exploiting the harmonic mean value property. The new method uses
   Tikhonov regularization at the deconvolution stage and is referred to as
   regularization enabled SHARP (RESHARP). RESHARP was compared with SHARP
   in a field-forward susceptibility simulation and in human brain
   experiments, considering effects on both field maps and the resulting
   susceptibility maps.
   ResultsFrom the simulation, RESHARP was able to reduce error in the
   field map by 17.4\% as compared with SHARP, resulting in a more accurate
   single-angle susceptibility map with 6.5\% relative error (compared with
   48.5\% using SHARP). Using RESHARP in vivo, field and susceptibility
   maps of the brain displayed fewer artifacts particularly at the brain
   boundaries, and susceptibility measurements of iron-rich deep gray
   matter were also more consistent than SHARP across healthy subjects of
   similar age.
   ConclusionCompared with SHARP, RESHARP removes background field artifact
   more effectively, leading to more accurate susceptibility measurements
   in iron-rich deep gray matter. Magn Reson Med 71:1151-1157, 2014. (c)

Abstract = {{We examined the immunotoxic effects of acute and subchronic exposures of
   goldfish to aged, fresh, and ozonated oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW) using a flow-through exposure apparatus. We measured the
   expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes, the antimicrobial
   responses of primary macrophages isolated from OSPW-exposed fish, and
   the ability of the goldfish to control infection with a protozoan
   parasite, Trypanosoma carassii. After acute (1 week) exposure to aged
   OSPW, we observed upregulation in the expression of interferon gamma
   (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor alpha-2 (TNF-2) in the kidney and spleen
   but not in gills of the fish. After subchronic (12 weeks) exposure to
   aged OSPW, we observed significant increases in mRNA levels of
   proinflammatory genes in the gill (IFN-, interleukin-1 beta 1 {[}IL1-1],
   TNF-2), kidney (IL1-1, TNF-2), and spleen (IL1-1). An upregulation of
   immune gene expression in the gill and kidney (IFN-, IL1-1, TNF-2) and
   spleen (IL1-1, TNF-2) was observed after acute exposure of fish to
   diluted fresh OSPW. Following subchronic exposure to diluted fresh OSPW,
   we observed high mRNA levels of IL1-1 in all tissues examined. However,
   there were significant decreases in the mRNA levels of IFN- and TNF-2 in
   the kidney and spleen and gill and spleen (IL-12p35 and IL-12p40) of
   exposed fish. There were no changes in the expression of
   anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 after both acute and subchronic
   exposures to diluted fresh OSPW. In fish exposed to ozonated fresh OSPW,
   immune gene expression was similar to nonexposed control fish in all
   organs examined, with exception of IL1-1. The ability of primary kidney
   macrophages to generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates was
   significantly reduced in fish exposed to fresh OSPW. The enhanced
   proinflammatory response after acute exposure to diluted fresh OSPW was
   confirmed by the parasite challenge experiments, where OSPW-exposed fish
   controlled the infection better than nonexposed fish.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note proposes a general class of nonlinear protocols in
   the form of continuous state feedbacks for finite-time consensus in
   networks of integrator-like dynamic agents with directional link
   failure. These protocols, with adjustable terms, are applicable in a
   wide range of situations, such as with input saturation restrictions and
   with convergence rate constraints. Based on the assumption of a common
   positive dwell time for all active information links, it is shown that
   if the union of the interaction topology over some fixed length of time
   always contains a spanning tree, then the system will solve an
   asymptotical consensus problem; in addition, if the length sum of time
   intervals, over which the interaction topology contains a spanning tree,
   is larger than a threshold, determined by the state differences between
   agents, then the system will solve a finite-time consensus problem. The
   validity of the protocols is proven in the case with external reference
   inputs. Finally, simulations are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the theoretical results.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the underlying reasons and quantifies the

   model files show that equivalent dimensioned devices are capable of
   producing similar on-state modes of operation, and achieve similar
   effective mobility at equivalent larger electric fields. However, during
   sub-threshold operation, the GaN MOSFET is shown to contain a much lower
   carrier concentration than the GaN HFET. This prolongs the breakdown
   avalanche effect in the GaN MOSFET (3500 V) by roughly five times larger
   than the GaN HFET (600 V) for devices of similar dimensions.
   Implementing the MOS structure can potentially resolve fundamental
   constraints for high voltage power applications caused by current device

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Polymer based MEMS and microfluidic devices have the advantages of
   mechanical flexibility, lower fabrication cost and faster processing
   over silicon based ones. Also, many polymer materials are considered
   biocompatible and can be used in biological applications. A valuable
   class of polymers for microfabricated devices is piezoelectric
   functional polymers. In addition to the normal advantages of polymers,
   piezoelectric polymers can be directly used as an active material in
   different transduction applications. This paper gives an overview of
   piezoelectric polymers based on their operating principle. This includes
   three main categories: bulk piezoelectric polymers, piezocomposites and
   voided charged polymers. State-of-the-art piezopolymers of each category
   are presented with a focus on fabrication techniques and material
   properties. A comparison between the different piezoelectric polymers
   and common inorganic piezoelectric materials (PZT, ZnO, AlN and PMN-PT)
   is also provided in terms of piezoelectric properties. The use of
   piezopolymers in different electromechanical devices is also presented.
   This includes tactile sensors, energy harvesters, acoustic transducers
   and inertial sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The well known Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model can be extended in
   different ways including the polynomial fuzzy model, whose consequent
   parts are polynomial sub-systems. Compared with the traditional T-S
   fuzzy model, the polynomial fuzzy model can represent a nonlinear system
   more accurately with a smaller number of fuzzy logic rules. It is worth
   emphasizing that the stability analysis and controller design of
   polynomial fuzzy model-based (PFMB) control systems are not based on the
   linear matrix inequalities but the recently developed sum-of-squares
   decompositions. In this paper, based on an existing result for
   traditional fuzzy control systems, we propose a new stability condition
   for the stability analysis of PFMB control systems. Furthermore, the
   stability of PFMB control systems with parameter uncertainties is
   investigated. The popular inverted pendulum and an unstable nonlinear
   system are employed to demonstrate the quality of the proposed stability
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Fast and robust control of combustion phasing is an important challenge
   for real-time model-based control of Homogenous Charge Compression
   Ignition (HCCI). In this paper a new discrete Control Oriented Model
   (COM) for predicting HCCI combustion phasing on a cycle-to-cycle basis
   is outlined and validated against experimental data from a single
   cylinder Ricardo engine. The COM has sufficient accuracy for real-time
   HCCI control and can be implemented in real-time.
   A Discrete Sliding Mode Controller (DSMC) coupled with a Kalman filter
   is designed to control combustion phasing by adjusting the ratio of two
   Primary Reference Fuels (PRFs). The results indicate the DSMC maintains
   the stability of the engine operation in a wide range of loads and
   speeds. The DSMC is compared with an empirical Proportional Integral
   (PI) controller. The results show the SMC outperforms a PI controller
   particularly in rejecting disturbances while maintaining HCCI combustion
   phasing in its desired range. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The mass transfer behavior of oxygen and ferricyanide in dilute aqueous
   solutions was investigated using a rotating cylinder electrode under
   bulk boiling condition. A correlation was developed for predicting the
   mass transfer behavior using the reaction of dissolved oxygen below

   transfer behavior for ferricyanide reaction from room temperature to
   just below boiling point (i.e. 99 degrees C) for the rotating speeds
   between 100 and 3300 rpm. These results indicated that the ferricyanide
   reaction could be used as a model to predict the electrochemical
   behavior of dissolved oxygen at the elevated electrolyte temperatures.
   However, the correlation could not predict the experimental data
   obtained under boiling conditions very well. The experimentally
   determined mass transfer coefficients under boiling condition were on
   the average 38\% higher than those obtained just below boiling point due
   to the generation and rupture of boiling bubbles in bulk solution. (C)

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Porous titanium alloy-bioactive glass composite coatings were
   manufactured via the flame spray deposition process. The porous
   coatings, targeted for orthodontic and bone-fixation applications, were
   made from bioactive glass (45S5) powder blended with either commercially
   pure titanium (Cp-Ti) or Ti-6Al-4V alloy powder. Two sets of spray
   conditions, two metallic particle size distributions, and two glass
   particle size distributions were used for this study. Negative control
   coatings consisting of pure Ti-6Al-4V alloy or Cp-Ti were sprayed under
   both conditions. The as-sprayed coatings were characterized through
   quantitative optical cross-sectional metallography, X-ray diffraction
   (XRD), and ASTM Standard C633 tensile adhesion testing. Determination of
   the porosity and glassy phase distribution was achieved by using image
   analysis in accordance with ASTM Standard E2109. Theoretical
   thermodynamic and heat transfer modeling was conducted to explain
   experimental observations. Thermodynamic modeling was performed to
   estimate the flame temperature and chemical environment for each spray
   condition and a lumped capacitance heat transfer model was developed to
   estimate the temperatures attained by each particle. These models were
   used to establish trends among the choice of alloy, spray condition, and
   particle size distribution. The deposition parameters, alloy
   composition, and alteration of the feedstock powder size distribution
   had a significant effect on the coating microstructure, porosity, phases
   present, mechanical response, and theoretical particle temperatures that
   were attained. The most promising coatings were the Ti-6Al-4V-based
   composite coatings, which had bond strength of 20 +/- 2 MPa (n = 5) and
   received reinforcement and strengthening from the inclusion of a glassy
   phase. It was shown that the use of the Ti-6Al-4V-bioactive glass
   composite coatings may be a superior choice due to the possible
   osteoproductivity from the bioactive glass, the potential ability to
   support tissue ingrowth and vascular tissue, and the comparable strength
   to similar coatings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Truncated plurigaussian (TPG) simulation is a flexible method for
   simulating rock types in deposits with complicated ordering structures.
   The truncation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution controls the
   proportions and ordering of rock types in the simulation while the
   variogram for each Gaussian variable controls rock type continuity. The
   determination of a truncation procedure for complicated geological
   environments is not trivial. A method for determining the truncation and
   fitting variograms applicable to any number of rock types and
   multivariate Gaussian distribution is developed here to address this
   problem. Multidimensional scaling is applied to place dissimilar
   categories far apart and similar categories close together. The
   multivariate space is then mapped using a Voronoi decomposition and
   rotated to optimize variogram reproduction. A case study simulating
   geologic layers at a large mineral deposit demonstrates the potential of
   this method and compares the results with sequential indicator
   simulation (SIS). Input proportion and transition probability
   reproduction with TPG is demonstrated to be better than SIS. Variogram
   reproduction is comparable for both techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Compensating the grid background harmonics in a grid-interfacing
   converter system, such as a drive system's active-front-end rectifier or
   a grid-connected inverter in a distributed generation system, is an
   effective method of reducing line side current harmonics. However, this
   harmonic compensation is particularly challenging in medium-voltage
   high-power applications (>1 MVA). This is mainly due to the
   low-switching frequency operation of high-power converters (300-800 Hz)
   to maintain low power loss. Therefore, the traditional tasks of active
   power filters with relatively high-switching frequency cannot be easily
   realized here. This paper proposes a new pulse width modulation
   technique, named selective harmonic compensation (SHC), which actively
   compensates the power system background harmonics, but still operates at
   very low-switching frequencies. Details of the proposed SHC are
   presented. An SHC application example on a high-power current-source
   rectifier is provided in this paper. The simulations and experiments
   show that the proposed SHC scheme can effectively compensate the system
   background harmonics and improve the line current harmonic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of naphthenic acids in water has been traditionally
   performed after extraction with organic solvents followed by analytic
   methods that are complex and costly for preliminary research or for
   continuous monitoring purposes. This study examines the application of
   fluorescence in organic solvents as an effective alternative, and the
   role of organic solvents on quantification results. Nine organic
   solvents were used: three polar protic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and
   propanol), three polar aprotic (dichloromethane, acetone, and
   acetonitrile) and three non-polar (hexane, toluene, and diethyl ether).
   The calibration curves of the polar protic solvents performed the best;
   they had lower light scattering and higher method sensitivity than polar
   aprotic and non-polar. Methanol was selected for further experiments
   having a strong linearity for concentrations lower than 250mg/L (R-2 >
   0.99), and a low relative standard deviation (< 10\%). The method
   sensitivity was improved by 70\% using a methanol-deionized water
   mixture (50:50) as a solvent. The synchronous fluorescence mode with a
   reduced offset value of = 10nm demonstrated potential for
   fingerprinting. The fluorescence technique for quantifying total
   naphthenic acids directly in organic solvents is a cost-effective
   analytical method compatible with the solid phase extraction of the
   sample.}},

Abstract = {{Congestion can restrict access to construction activities both on and
   close to a freeway, reducing construction efficiency, especially by
   delaying the delivery of materials. Although previous studies have
   investigated the impact of work-zone capacities on traffic flow, most
   did not consider interactions with construction resources. There is
   currently no mature standard or acceptable model that can be used for
   this purpose, and that would benefit both traffic and construction in an
   integrated framework; however, well-established, powerful simulation
   systems exist unique to each domain. To this end, in this paper, a
   construction-traffic interdisciplinary simulation (CTISIM) framework
   based on high level architecture is proposed to combine the power of
   each domain's simulation systems. A ready-mixed concrete production and
   delivery problem is adopted to demonstrate the benefit of the CTISIM,
   which optimizes construction resource arrangement and a concrete
   production schedule based on the real-time traffic conditions in a
   work-zone.}},

Title = {{Fuzzy Radial Basis Function Neural Networks with information granulation
   and its parallel genetic optimization}},
Journal = {{FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{96-117}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Fuzzy modeling of complex systems is a challenging task, which involves
   important problems of dimensionality reduction and calls for various
   ways of improving the accuracy of modeling. The IG-FRBFNN, a hybrid
   architecture of the IG-FIS (Fuzzy Inference System) and FRBFNN (Fuzzy
   Radial Basis Function Neural Networks), is proposed to address these
   problems. The paper is concerned with the analysis and design of
   IG-FRBFNNs and their optimization by means of the Hierarchical Fair
   Competition-based Parallel Genetic Algorithm (HFC-PGA). In the proposed
   network, the membership functions of the premise part of the fuzzy rules
   of the IG-based FRBFNN model directly rely on the computation of the
   relevant distance between data points and the use of four types of
   polynomials such as constant, linear, quadratic and modified quadratic
   are considered for the consequent part of fuzzy rules. Moreover, the
   weighted Least Square (WLS) learning is exploited to estimate the
   coefficients of the polynomial forming the conclusion part of the rules.
   Since the performance of the IG-RBFNN model is affected by some key
   design parameters, such as a specific subset of input variables, the
   fuzzification coefficient of the FCM, the number of rules, and the order
   of polynomial of the consequent part of fuzzy rules, it becomes
   beneficial to carry out both structural as well as parametric
   optimization of the network. In this study, the HFC-PGA is used as a
   comprehensive optimization vehicle. The performance of the proposed
   model is illustrated by means of several representative numerical
   examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.Y. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: Gaussian network model (GNM) is widely adopted to analyze
   and understand protein dynamics, function and conformational changes.
   The existing GNM-based approaches require atomic coordinates of the
   corresponding protein and cannot be used when only the sequence is
   known.
   Results: We report, first of its kind, GNM model that allows modeling
   using the sequence. Our linear regression-based, parameter-free,
   sequence-derived GNM (L-pfSeqGNM) uses contact maps predicted from the
   sequence and models local, in the sequence, contact neighborhoods with
   the linear regression. Empirical benchmarking shows relatively high
   correlations between the native and the predicted with L-pfSeqGNM
   B-factors and between the cross-correlations of residue fluctuations
   derived from the structure- and the sequence-based GNM models. Our
   results demonstrate that L-pfSeqGNM is an attractive platform to explore
   protein dynamics. In contrast to the highly used GNMs that require
   protein structures that number in thousands, our model can be used to
   study motions for the millions of the readily available sequences, which
   finds applications in modeling conformational changes, protein-protein
   interactions and protein functions.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the performance of 1 kDa ceramic ultrafiltration
   membrane for the removal of inorganic and organic compounds from oil
   sands process-affected water (OSPW) generated after thermal operations
   of heavy oil recovery in Alberta, Canada. The OSPW was pretreated with
   alum coagulant, and the effect of operating conditions on subsequent
   membrane filtration was studied. While permeate flux increased with
   increasing trans-membrane pressure (TMP) from 1.4 bar to 3.5 bar,
   greater permeate flux decline was observed at TMP of 3.5 bar due to
   increased accumulation of foulants at the membrane surface. The membrane
   filtration performed at cross-flow velocity (CFV) of 0.2 L/min was
   characterized by the lowest initial and steady-state permeate fluxes and
   by the highest normalized flux decline compared to higher CFVs. This
   effect was attributed to lower turbulence at the membrane surface which
   might have promoted the buildup of contaminants. According to the
   resistance-in-series model, no irreversible membrane fouling was
   observed when OSPW was pretreated with
   coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation. The pore blocking and cake layer
   formation dominated at the beginning of filtration, whereas cake layer
   formation was the primary fouling mechanism at later stages. The final
   membrane permeates met the requirements for the high pressure-driven
   membrane processes (i.e., nanofiltration and reverse osmosis) with
   respect to turbidity and silt density index (SDI15) values. Up to 38.6
   +/- 2.7\% (depending on TMP and CFV values) of chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) was removed, and the removal percentages of the acid extractable
   fraction (AEF) and naphthenic acids (NAs) were less because of the small
   sizes of NAs and other organic compounds contributing to the AEF as
   compared to the membrane pore sizes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights
