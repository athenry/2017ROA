Title = {{Oligomerization of Fischer-Tropsch Tail Gas over H-ZSM-5}},

Abstract = {{Fischer-Tropsch synthesis produces a product that invariably contains
   C-4 and lighter material. The C-2-C-4 fraction has a high olefin
   content. The light hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch tail gas can be
   separated from the unconverted synthesis gas, but the added cost and
   complexity of doing so by pressure distillation is often considered
   unjustified. In this study the possibility of reactive recovery of the
   C-2-C-4 olefins from the Fischer Tropsch tail gas by oligomerization
   over H-ZSM-5 was investigated. Two specific issues were investigated for
   this unconventional application of this industrially practiced
   technology, namely, to determine the impact of low olefin partial
   pressure on productivity and to determine whether acid catalyzed CO
   reactions, such as the Koch reaction, were taking place. Catalyst and
   reactor system performance was evaluated using model propylene
   oligomerization. A catalyst productivity of 0.42 g.(g(cat))(-1).h(-1)
   was achieved with a 39\% C3H6 feed at 190 degrees C, 3 MPa, and weight
   hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.9 h(-1). These results were comparable
   to previous reports in the literature. The same catalyst was employed to
   evaluate conversion of a model Fischer Tropsch tail gas mixture
   containing 17.4\% H-2, 7.5\% CO, 68.0\% CH4, 0.65\% C2H4, and 6.45\%
   C3H6. The operating range 205-278 degrees C, 3 MPa, and WHSV 1-1.5 h(-1)
   was investigated. At 237-278 degrees C and WHSV 1.5 h(-1), catalyst
   productivity remained around 0.32-0.36 g.(gcat)(-1).h(-1). Despite an
   olefin partial pressure of only 0.22 MPa, better than 85\% olefin
   conversion was achieved. The liquid product was olefinic and contained
   70-80\% naphtha and 20-30\% distillate. No evidence was found that CO
   reacted with the olefins in the feed, either by the Koch reaction to
   produce carboxylic acids, or to form ketones. Deposits formed on the
   catalyst and deactivation was observed over a period of 240 h. The
   nature of the deposits varied from top to bottom in the packed bed.
   Analysis of the spent catalyst indicated that liquid filled pores
   preceded hydrogen transfer and aromatization to form coke-like deposits
   over time.}},

Title = {{Criterion for determining crossover phenomenon in volume translated

Journal = {{FLUID PHASE EQUILIBRIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{430}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Volume translation is widely adopted in cubic equation of state (CEOS)
   to achieve more accurate density predictions for pure compounds and
   mixtures. Previous research reveals that a temperature-dependent
   volume-translated EOS could result in crossing of pressure-volume
   isotherms for a pure compound, which leads to an anomalous behavior that
   the predicted molar volume for a pure component can possibly be lower at
   a higher temperature at an isobaric condition. Such crossover phenomenon
   fails to consistently predict the thermodynamic properties of a pure
   compound, e.g., giving a negative isobaric thermal expansivity. In this
   study, we develop a concise criterion to judge whether a
   volume-translated EOS will result in crossover issues, and if so, the
   extent of the temperature and pressure range over which the crossover
   phenomenon occurs. The recently proposed volume translations are
   evaluated on the basis of the developed criterion. For the various types
   of temperature-dependent volume translations, we obtain the specific
   temperature/pressure conditions over which there is certainly no
   crossover phenomenon. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The early-stage competitive co-adsorption of interfacially active
   naphthenic acids (NAs) and polyaromatic (PA) molecules to a toluene
   water interface from the bulk toluene phase was studied using molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulation. The NA molecules studied had the same polar
   functional group but different cycloaliphatic nonpolar tails, and a
   perylene bisimide (PBI)-based molecule was used as a representative PA
   compound. The results from our simulations suggest that the size and
   structural features of NA molecules greatly influence the interfacial
   activity of PA molecules and partitioning of NA molecules at the toluene
   water interface. At low concentrations of PA (similar to 2.3 wt \%) and
   NA (similar to 0.4 wt \%) molecules, NA molecules containing large
   cycloaliphatic rings (e.g., four rings) or with a very long aliphatic
   tail (e.g., carbon chain length of 14) were observed to impede the
   migration of PA molecules to the interface, whereas small NA. molecules
   containing two ``cycloaliphatic ``rings had little effect on the
   adsorption of PA molecules at the toluene water interface. At high NA
   concentrations, the adsorption of PA molecules (similar to 6.75-17.25 wt
   \%) was greatly hindered by the presence of small NA molecules (similar
   to 4.6-4.8 wt \%) due to the solvation of PA nanoaggregates in the bulk.
   Adsorption mechanisms of PA and NA molecules at toluene water interfaces
   were clarified through a detailed analysis on the interactions among
   different species in the system. The results obtained from this work
   provide insights into designing appropriate chemical demulsifiers or
   co-demulsifiers for breaking water-in-oil emulsions of great industrial
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{This study systematically assessed intracellular electron transfer (IET)
   and extracellular electron transfer (EET) kinetics with respect to anode
   potential (E-anode) in a mixed-culture biofilm anode enriched with
   Geobacter spp. High biofilm conductivity (0.96-1.24 mS cm(-1)) was
   maintained during E-anode changes from -0.2 to +0.2 V versus the
   standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), although the steady-state current
   density significantly decreased from 2.05 to 0.35 Am-2 in a microbial
   electrochemical cell. Substantial increase of the Treponema population
   was observed in the biofilm anode at E-anode = +0.2 V, which reduced
   intracellular electron-transfer kinetics associated with the maximum
   specific substrate-utilization rate by a factor of ten. This result
   suggests that fast EET kinetics can be maintained under dynamic E-anode
   conditions in a highly conductive biofilm anode as a result of shift of
   main EET players in the biofilm anode, although E-anode changes can
   influence IET kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{The most engineering application for the molecular self-assembly of
   sulfydryl compounds on solid surfaces is froth flotation. In this work,
   the hydrophobic mechanism of 3-hexyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione
   (HATT) on chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) was first investigated by in situ atomic
   force microscopy (AFM), in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy
   (SECM), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle and flotation tests. In
   situ AFM imaging elucidated that HATT might aggregate on chalcopyrite
   surface to form self-assembled monolayers. In situ SECM images confirmed
   the weakened tip current of chalcopyrite region after HATT adsorption.
   On the self-assembly layers, HATT bound overwhelmingly with copper atoms
   to form a five-membered ring Cu(I)-HATT surface complex, accompanying
   with the reduction of cupric to cuprous. HATT anchored on chalcopyrite
   surfaces through its exocyclic S and N atoms of
   4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione group and left its hexyl group towards
   aqueous solutions, resulting in an enhanced surface hydrophobicity to
   improve the flotation recovery of copper minerals. This fundamental
   understanding inspired by in situ approaches will promote the innovation
   and development of novel flotation surfactants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Pectic-Oligosaccharides (POS) have a growing potential in food and feed
   industries. To satisfy the demand of worldwide markets from POS and
   avoid the shortcomings of currently applied methodologies encountered in
   their preparation, the present study highlights a novel robust approach
   for POS biosynthesis. In the current approach, Aspergillus sp.section
   Flavi strain EGY1 DSM 101520 was grown on citrus pectin-based medium as
   a core POS production medium. POS' levels accumulated in the fungal
   fermentation broth were optimized through a three step sequential
   statistical mathematical methodology; Plackett-Burman design (PBD),
   Box-Behnken design (BBD) and canonical analysis. Three key determinants
   namely citrus pectin, peptone and NaH2PO4 were pointed out by PBD to
   impose significant consequences (P<0.05) on the process outcome (POS'
   levels). Optimal levels of these key determinants along with maximal of
   POS' levels were set by BBD and canonical analysis to be 2.28\% (w/v)
   citrus pectin, 0.026\% (w/v) peptone and 0.28\% (w/v) NaH2PO4 to achieve
   a net amount of 1.3 g POS /2.28 g citrus pectin. Through this approach,
   a yield of 57\% (w/w) POS of the total citrus pectin was obtained after
   24 h of fungal growth on optimized citrus pectin based medium. A fold
   enhancement of 13 times in POS' levels released in the fermentation
   fungal broth was realized by the end of the optimization strategy. This
   novel robust approach is considered a new insight towards POS
   biosynthesis via efficient, rapid and non-cumbersome procedure. To the
   best of authors' knowledge, the present work is the first article
   underlining detailed POS production from the fermentation broth of a
   fungus growing on citrus pectin-based medium.}},

   samples was determined by the development of a three-dimensional finite
   element model. The velocity of the impacting particles was determined by
   a model based on the principles of supersonic fluid flow through a
   converging-diverging nozzle. Four polyurethane elastomers with Shore A
   hardness values of 55-85 were tested. The stress-strain behavior of the
   polyurethane elastomers was characterized at room and elevated
   temperatures by conducting tensile tests and cyclic loadings. The
   obtained results showed the substantial effect of testing temperature on
   erosion resistance of PU elastomers. Comparison of stress-strain
   behavior of the studied polyurethanes with their erosion resistance at
   controlled temperatures revealed that the residual strain as a result of
   plastic deformation and final elongation at break were the key
   parameters affecting the wear resistance of polyurethane elastomers.
   Evaluation of the surface morphology of the worn samples confirmed the
   importance of the residual strain on the erosion resistance of
   polyurethane elastomers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of uncertainty in the well-to-tank and combustion greenhouse
   gas emissions of various transportation fuels}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Growing concern over climate change has created pressure on the oil and
   gas industry to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). There have
   been multiple well-to-tank + combustion (WTT + C) studies that have
   examined various crude oils in an attempt to determine their GHG
   emission intensities. The majority of these studies published
   deterministic point estimates with a limited sensitivity analysis. Due
   to the variation in results between studies and the lack of uncertainty
   analysis the usefulness of these studies to policy makers and industry
   representatives is limited. The goal of this study is to expand on the
   previous literature by identifying a range of WIT + C emissions for
   crude oils from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Iran. First, the previously
   published FUNdamental ENgineering PrinciplEs-based ModeL for Estimation
   of GreenHouse Gases in Conventional Crude Oils (FUNNEL-GHG-CCO) was used
   to perform a WIT + C analysis of the crudes GHG emissions. Then a Monte
   Carlo simulation was carried out using existing literature to define
   input distributions for the key inputs. The resulting gasoline WTT + C
   GHG emission ranges are 113.6-138.5 (Venezuela High Steam), 101.6-109.9
   (Venezuela Low Steam), 101.1-109.2 (Sirri, Iran), and 95.3-99.9
   gCO(2)eq/Mj (Saudi Arabia). This result indicates that even when
   uncertainty is taken into account the Venezuelan high steam crude
   clearly has higher emissions than the Saudi Arabia crude. The results of
   this study will give policy makers and industry representatives a better
   understanding of how the wrr + C GHG emissions vary between various
   crude oils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   dose as a performance indicator}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{306}},
Pages = {{1-8}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics is a powerful tool for ultraviolet (UV)
   reactor performance evaluation, since it allows the reactor
   configuration optimization by comparing the performance indicator
   {[}e.g., reduction equivalent dose (RED)] of various UV reactors. In
   this study, a new performance indicator independent of the microbial UV
   dose-response curve, namely particle minimum UV dose (D-min), was
   introduced, and its feasibility was evaluated in the configuration
   optimization of 3-lamp UV reactors for water disinfection. Results
   indicate that the D-min could serve as an alternative to the RED in
   characterizing the UV reactor performance. In general, reactors with a
   normal (NOR) lamp position pattern (i.e., with one lamp on the top and
   two at the bottom) had larger D-min values (110-193 mW cm(-2)) than
   those with a reverse (REV) lamp position pattern (i.e., with two lamps
   on the top and one at the bottom) (98-160 mW cm(-2)). The largest D-min
   (193 mW cm(-2)) was obtained in an UV reactor with a lamp relative
   distance (i.e., the ratio of the distance between the lamp and reactor
   axes to the reactor radius) of 0.4 and an inlet internal diameter of 75
   mm, which could be ascribed to a well-mixed flow resulting from an
   optimal dispersion of the influent flow by the lamp array. The maximum
   disinfection flow rate of the UV reactor with the optimal configuration
   was elevated by 47-100\% compared to those of the non-optimally designed
   reactors, which led to an energy saving efficiency of 32-50\%. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This study is concerned with a design of a face recognition algorithm
   realized based on feature extraction with the aid of the 2-directional
   2-dimensional linear discriminant analysis referred to as (2D)(2)LDA.
   The 2DLDA algorithm yields high accuracy, but comes with an unresolved
   problem of handling large feature matrices present in face recognition
   problems. The proposed (2D)(2)LDA algorithm is computationally more
   efficient and produces more powerful discrimination decision. The
   proposed P-RBF NNs is used as a recognition module. The architecture of
   this module consists of three functional components. The coefficients of
   the P-RBF NNs model are obtained by fuzzy inference method forming the
   inference part of fuzzy rules. The essential design parameters
   (including learning rate, momentum, fuzzification coefficient, and the
   feature selection mechanism) of the networks are optimized by means of
   differential evolution (DE). The experimental results reported for
   benchmark face datasets - the Yale, ORL database, and IC\&CI dataset
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of (2D)(2)LDA algorithm
   compared with other pre- processing approaches such as LPP, 2D-PCA,
   2D-LPP, SR, PCA, (2D)(2)PCA and fusion of PCA-LDA. The experimental
   results show that (2D)(2)LDA based P-RBF NNs achieves higher performance
   than being reported by other methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In froth flotation the molecular interaction between reagents and
   mineral surfaces take place at the solid liquid interface. In this
   paper, the effect of water molecule on the three typical thiol
   collectors (xanthate, dithiocarbomate and dithiophosphate) interactions
   at the galena (PbS) and sphalerite (ZnS) surfaces has been studied
   adopting density functional theory (DFT). The results suggests that the
   presence of water molecule shows a greater influence on the electron
   distribution of ZnS surface than PbS surface, and reduce the reactivity
   of ZnS surface atoms but improves the reactivity of PbS surface atoms
   during the reaction with xanthate. Water adsorption could also reduce
   the covalent binding between Zn and S atoms but have little influence on
   Pb-S bond. In the presence of water, xanthate, dithiocarbomate (DTC) and
   dithiophosphate (DTP) could not adsorb on the sphalerite surface. And
   for galena (PbS) surface, the interaction of DTP is the strongest, then
   the DTC and the interaction of xanthate is the weakest. These results
   agree well with the flotation practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Texture evolution and deformation activity of an extruded Mg-Zn-Mn
   (ZM31) alloy containing different amounts of yttrium subjected to hot
   compression along the extrusion direction at 200 degrees C and 300
   degrees C were studied via electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and
   X-ray diffraction (XRD). A typical basal texture with (0001) planes and
   < 01 (1) over bar0 > directions of most grains oriented parallel to the
   extrusion direction was observed. With increasing Y content, the basal
   texture was weakened and grain orientations became more random. The
   occurrence of extension twinning was characterized by the formation of
   \{(1) over bar2 (1) over bar0\}< 0001 > and \{01 (1) over bar0\}< 0001 >
   textures, indicating that the c-axes in most grains were rotated towards
   the anti-compression direction. The maximum intensity of twinned
   textures decreased with increasing deformation temperature, and the
   extent of decrease was less significant in the alloy with a higher
   amount of Y. Visco-plastic self-consistent simulation, along with EBSD
   and XRD analyses, revealed that with increasing deformation temperature
   the relative contribution of non-basal slip increased and the relative
   contribution of extension twinning decreased. With increasing Y content
   the relative contribution of pyramidal slip increased, while the
   relative contribution of basal slip decreased. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   Firstly, the most dominant intrinsic mode function (IMF) is identified
   using EMD of a raw signal, which contains all the necessary information
   about the faults. The envelope of this IMF is often modulated with
   multiple vibration sources and noise. A second level decomposition is
   performed by applying pseudo-fault signal (PFS) assisted EMD on the
   envelope. A pseudo-fault signal is constructed based on the known fault
   characteristic frequency of the particular machine. The objective of
   using external (pseudo-fault) signal is to isolate different fault
   frequencies, present in the envelope. The pseudo-fault signal serves
   dual purposes: (i) it solves the mode mixing problem inherent in EMD,
   (ii) it isolates and quantifies a particular fault frequency component.
   The proposed technique is suitable for real-time implementation, which
   has also been validated on simulated fault and experimental data
   corresponding to a bearing and a gear-box setup, respectively. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{(RADA)(4) self-assembling peptides (SAPs) are promising for neural
   nanoscaffolds with on-demand drug delivery capabilities due to their
   automated synthesis, in-situ assembly, and potential for interaction
   with and release of biomolecules. Neuroinflammation cued on-demand drug
   release, due to up-regulated proteases, may well be vital in the
   treatment of several neurological diseases. In these conditions,
   releasing neurotrophic growth factors (NTFs) could potentially lead to
   neuroprotection and neurogenesis. As such, (RADA)(4) was made with the
   high and low activity matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) cleaved
   sequences, GPQG+IASQ (CP1) and GPQG+PAGQ (CP2), the brain-derived NTF
   secretion stimulating peptide MVG (DP1) and the ciliary NTF analogue
   DGGL (DP2). PC-12 cell culture was performed to assess bioactive
   substrate cell adhesion and NTF specific neuronal differentiation. The
   laminin-derived IKVAV peptide, known for neural cell attachment and
   interaction, was tethered to (RADA)(4)-IKVAV and mixed in increasing
   increments with (RADA)(4) for this purpose. With 1 nanomolar MMP-2
   treatment, product formation was observed to increase over a three day
   period, with (RADA)(4)/(RADA)(4)-CP1/CP2 mixture, however there was
   little difference between groups. Smaller CP1/CP2 concentrations
   displayed comparable (RADA)(4) nanoscale morphology to higher
   concentrations. Acetylcholine esterase and neural differentiation was
   observed over 3 days with 1 nM MMP-2 treatment according to the
   following makeup: 8/1/1
   (RADA)(4)/(RADA)(4)-IKVAV/(RADA)(4)-CP1/CP2-DP1/DP2. Signalling
   gradually increased in all groups, and neurite outgrowth was visible
   after three days. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{THERMOCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{645}},
Pages = {{31-42}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Oxidative ring-opening is a potential alternative to
   hydrodearomatization and cracking for the conversion of multinuclear
   aromatic compounds to lighter products. Oxidation of multinuclear
   aromatics produces quinonoids that can be ring-opened by forming
   carboxylic acids, which can be decarboxylated to produce lighter
   oxygen-free hydrocarbons. The efficiency of this reaction depends on the
   thermochemistry of the metal carboxylate intermediate. Undesirable
   side-reactions compete with decarboxylation. Using metal carboxylates as
   catalytic surrogates is a convenient strategy to investigate the
   catalytic decomposition of carboxylic acids. The thermal behavior of
   sodium, potassium and magnesium biphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylates was
   investigated, over the temperature range 25 to 600 degrees C, to
   evaluate the suitability of these metals as catalytic materials for
   decarboxylation, as well as to gain an understanding of the steps
   involved in the decomposition. In all cases, thermal analysis revealed
   quite complex behavior. Thermal events including the loss of lattice
   water, phase transitions and decomposition were observed. The strong
   basic properties of alkali and alkaline earth metals resulted in the
   formation of thermally stable carboxylates with decomposition
   temperatures above 400 degrees C. Infrared spectroscopy indicated that
   the Na, K and Mg carboxylates all existed in ionic (or bridging)
   configuration, but a bidentate type of interaction was additionally
   observed for the magnesium carboxylate. Formic acid was also identified
   during the initial stages of sodium biphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylate
   decomposition suggesting the formation of an ester intermediate (not
   confirmed). The thermal stability of the biphenyl-2,2'-dicarboxylates
   increased in the order Na < K < Mg, which differed from thermal
   stability sequence of the alkanoates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{46}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The addition of a small amount of high molecular weight polymer to a
   solvent can substantially decrease friction losses by approximately
   80\%. This phenomenon known as drag reduction (DR) is used extensively
   in oil recovery during hydraulic fracturing and in many other
   applications to reduce the pumping costs. However, because of long chain
   length, these polymers get adsorbed on the surface of reservoir,
   diminishing the effectiveness of fracking. In the current study, a
   thermo-responsive polymer, i.e., poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is
   investigated as a drag reducing agent (DRA), which collapses reversibly
   above 33 degrees C known as lower critical solution temperature (LCST),
   thereby preventing it from getting adsorbed beyond this temperature.
   Free radical polymerization was used to synthesize the PNIPAM and a
   Taylor-Couette (TC) setup with a rotating inner cylinder was utilized
   for measuring the DR. The effect of concentration, Reynolds number (Re),
   and temperature on DR were studied and a maximum of 50\% DR was observed
   at 400 PPM concentration. PNIPAM demonstrated significant decrease in DR
   beyond LCST, validating its thermo-responsive nature that could be
   beneficial for DR in oil recovery or in providing a control modality to
   DR technologies.DR versus temperature for PNIPAM solution (500 PPM) at

Abstract = {{Supercritical CO2 injection is a promising way to hydraulically fracture
   tight/shale gas formations as well as enhance gas recovery from these
   formations. Understanding of phase behavior and interfacial tension
   (IFT) of CO2/CH4/brine (NaCl) systems is important, because they affect
   the performance of such a process in tight/shale gas formations. In this
   study, we employ the axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) method to
   measure the IFT between CO2/CH4 mixtures and brine over the temperature
   range from 77.0 to 257.0 degrees F and the pressure range from 15 to
   5027 psia. Test results show that the presence of CO2 decreases the IFT
   of CH4/H2O or CH4/brine (NaCl) systems, while the degree of reduction
   depends on the molar fraction of CO2 in the gas mixture. Salinity tends
   to cause an increase in IFT of CO2/CH4/brine (NaCl) systems; a higher
   salinity leads to an increased IFT for a given system. On the basis of
   the Parachor model (Weinaug and Katz J. Ind. Eng. Chem. 1943, 35, 239)
   and Firoozabadi's model (Firoozabadi and Ramey J. Can. Pet. Technol.
   1988, 27, 41), we propose an improved IFT model to represent the
   measured IFT data for CO2/CH4/brine systems. The new IFT model preserves
   the principle of zero IFT at a critical point. Comparison of the new IFT
   model with four commonly used IFT correlations presented in the
   literature shows the superiority of the new model.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticle suspensions in liquids have received great attention, as
   they may offer an approach to enhance thermophysical properties of base
   fluids. A good variety of applications in engineering and biomedicine
   has been investigated with the aim of exploiting the above potential.
   However, the multiscale nature of nanosuspensions raises several issues
   in defining a comprehensive modelling framework, incorporating relevant
   molecular details and much larger scale phenomena, such as particle
   aggregation and their dynamics. The objectives of the present topical
   review is to report and discuss the main heat and mass transport
   phenomena ruling macroscopic behaviour of nanosuspensions, arising from
   molecular details. Relevant experimental results are included and
   properly put in the context of recent observations and theoretical
   studies, which solved long-standing debates about thermophysical
   properties enhancement. Major transport phenomena are discussed and
   in-depth analysis is carried out for highlighting the role of
   geometrical (nanoparticle shape, size, aggregation, concentration),
   chemical (pH, surfactants, functionalization) and physical parameters
   (temperature, density). We finally overview several computational
   techniques available at different scales with the aim of drawing the
   attention on the need for truly multiscale predictive models. This may
   help the development of next-generation nanoparticle suspensions and
   their rational use in thermal applications.}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{We present the evidence of universality in conical tip formation during
   the freezing of arbitrary-shaped sessile droplets. The focus is to
   demonstrate the relationship between this universality and the liquid
   drop shape. We observe that, in the case of asymmetric drops, this
   universal shape is achieved when the tip reconfigures by changing its
   location, which subsequently alters the frozen drop shape. The proposed
   ``two-triangle{''} model quantifies the change in the tip configuration
   as a function of the asymmetry of the drop that shows a good agreement
   with the experimental evidence. Finally, based on the experimental and
   theoretical exercise, we propose the scaling dependence between the
   variations in the tip configuration and the asymmetry of the drop.

Abstract = {{In this study, the influence of solutionizing and aging treatments on
   the microstructure and mechanical properties of alloy 625 superalloy
   samples produced by powder bed binder jet printing was investigated.
   Vacuum melted argon atomized 625 superalloy powder was used to fabricate
   green parts. Samples vacuum sintered at 1280 degrees C for 4 h to
   optimize density to 99.6\% were subjected to solution and aging
   treatments at 1150 degrees C for 2 h and 745 degrees C for 20 h and 60
   h, respectively, in order to improve microstructure and mechanical
   properties. Elemental analysis, phase formation and microstructure of
   the sintered, solution treated and aged samples were investigated by
   using optical, scanning/transmission electron microscopy with electron
   dispersive spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results indicate
   that the aging treatment resulted in the formation of intermetallic
   phases such as Ni3Nb and Ni-2(Cr,Mo) as well as carbides such as
   NbC,Cr23C6 in the microstructure. While the microhardness and tensile
   strength of the aged specimen increased due to these phases, the
   ductility value decreased. This study shows that alloy 625 produced by
   binder jet printing subjected to aging treatments has comparable
   properties to cast alloy 625. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Catalytic co-aromatization of ethanol and methane}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{198}},
Pages = {{480-492}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of simultaneously
   converting ethanol and methane into liquid hydrocarbons at mild reaction
   conditions (400 degrees C and 1 atm) over silver and/or zinc modified
   zeolite catalysts. After GC-MS analysis, it is worth noting that
   aromatics are the major compounds contained in the liquid product
   collected from the run when 1\%Ag/ZSM-5, particularly after H-2
   pretreatment, is charged. Compared to the performance exhibited from the
   run with pure HZSM-5 support engaged, Ag addition into the HZSM-5
   framework favors aromatics formation, which might be closely associated
   with better Ag dispersion and more abundance of strong surface acidic
   sites where aromatization might take place while Zn loading exerts a
   detrimental effect on the production of aromatics but promotes the ether
   generation possibly through dehydration reaction. Referred to that from
   its N-2 counterpart, the increased aromatics formation of the collected
   liquid product when methane is present indicates that methane existence
   might facilitate ethanol aromatization. Moreover, combined with the
   increased carbon number in the formed aromatics from CH4 run when H-2
   run is referred and zero liquid formation from CH4-alone test as well as
   more prominent endothermic feature of methane run and more importantly
   the notably increased C-13 signals in C-13 NMR spectra of the liquid
   product collected during ethanol conversion under (CH4)-C-13
   environment, all the observations suggest that methane might be
   activated nonoxidadvely and converted into higher hydrocarbons,
   preferentially into aromatics if suitable catalyst is charged under the
   assistance of co-existing oxygenated hydrocarbon. The reported
   synergetic effect could potentially lead to the more economic
   utilization of abundant natural gas and cellulosic ethanol. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, we offer a general view at the area of fuzzy modeling and
   fuzzy models, identify the visible development phases and elaborate on a
   new and promising directions of system modeling by introducing a concept
   of granular models. Granular models, especially granular fuzzy models
   constitute an important generalization of existing fuzzy models and, in
   contrast to the existing models, generate results in the form of
   information granules (such as intervals, fuzzy sets, rough sets and
   others). We present a rationale and deliver some key motivating
   arguments behind the emergence of granular models and discuss their
   underlying design process. Central to the development of granular models
   are granular spaces, namely a granular space of parameters of the models
   and a granular input space. The development of the granular model is
   completed through an optimal allocation of information granularity,
   which optimizes criteria of coverage and specificity of granular
   information. The emergence of granular models of type-2 and type-n, in
   general, is discussed along with an elaboration on their formation. It
   is shown that achieving a sound coverage-specificity tradeoff
   (compromise) is of paramount relevance in the realization of the
   granular models.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogels containing sugar and oxaborole residues with remarkable
   self-healing properties were synthesized by free-radical polymerization
   in a facile and one pot process. The strong covalent interactions
   between the oxaborole residues and free adjacent hydroxyl groups of the
   pendent sugar residues of the glycopolymer allowed the in situ formation
   of hydrogels achievable under either neutral or alkaline conditions.
   These hydrogels showed excellent self-healing and injectability
   behaviors in aqueous conditions and were found to be responsive to both
   pH and the presence of free sugars (such as glucose) in solution.
   Furthermore, these hydrogels can easily be reconstructed from their
   lyophilized powder into any desired three-dimensional scaffold.
   Additionally, the hydrogels can be designed to have very low
   cytotoxicity and hence can be used as a scaffold for cell encapsulation.
   With these unique properties, these biocompatible, biodegradable,
   rebuildable, and self-healable hydrogels offer great potential in many
   biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel dual-band microstrip patch antenna that
   employs a metamaterial-based electromagnetic bandgap (MTM-EBG)
   integrated into its radiating edges to support two distinct operating
   frequencies. The resulting antenna is compact, uniplanar, completely
   printable, and via-free. Dispersion engineering of the MTM-EBG unit cell
   through a rigorous multiconductor transmission-line analysis allows
   simple, systematic design for two or more arbitrary frequencies.
   Additionally, a novel approach is taken to employ the same MTM-EBG to
   impedance-match the antenna to an inset microstrip feed at both
   operating frequencies. A dual-band MTM-EBG antenna designed to radiate
   at 2.4 and 5.0 GHz is simulated and tested, and experimental results
   demonstrate radiation performance comparable to the corresponding
   conventional patch antennas in excellent agreement with simulations,
   while also affording some degree of miniaturization at lower
   frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the superluminal behavior of a radiated pulse in the
   near-field of an ideal dipole and an ultrawideband antenna is explained
   and demonstrated through simulations and measurements. The deformation
   of the radiated pulse in the near-field is illustrated using the ideal
   dipole antenna radiation as well as by a Vivaldi antenna through
   full-wave simulations and measurements. The apparent superluminal pulse
   velocity is due to the pulse reshaping of the radiated pulse in the
   near-field of the antenna. The pulse velocity is measured by tracking
   pulse peak, pulse envelope peak, and also calculating the pulse
   centrovelocity. The superluminal pulse peak velocity of the radiated
   pulse from a miniaturized Vivaldi antenna is confirmed through
   measurements in face-to-face and quasi-monostatic radar configurations.
   The effect of different values of pulse velocities on the quality of
   reconstructed images using synthetic aperture radar processing is
   demonstrated as well.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the effectiveness of using externally bonded carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets to enhance the seismic
   performance of nonductile reinforced concrete shear wall specimens
   representative of low aspect ratio walls. The specimens were designed to
   replicate structural deficiencies typically found in older concrete
   structures constructed during the 1960s and 1970s. The nonductile
   reinforcement details included insufficient shear reinforcement, lack of
   boundary elements, and low concrete compressive strength. The specimens
   were repaired or strengthened using vertical and horizontal CFRP sheets
   and then cyclically tested to simulate seismic loading. A tube anchor
   system was used to transfer the tensile force carried by the CFRP sheet
   to the foundation of the specimens. Experimental results showed that the
   CFRP retrofitting system was able to restore the original strength and
   initial stiffness of severely damaged specimens and significantly
   increase the flexural strength, ductility, and energy dissipation
   capacity in strengthening applications. (C) 2016 American Society of

Abstract = {{Mobile users typically have high demand on localized and location-based
   information services. To always retrieve the localized data from the
   remote cloud, however, tends to be inefficient, which motivates fog
   computing. The fog computing, also known as edge computing, extends
   cloud computing by deploying localized computing facilities at the
   premise of users, which prestores cloud data and distributes to mobile
   users with fast-rate local connections. As such, fog computing
   introduces an intermediate fog layer between mobile users and cloud, and
   complements cloud computing toward low-latency high-rate services to
   mobile users. In this fundamental framework, it is important to study
   the interplay and cooperation between the edge (fog) and the core
   (cloud). In this paper, the tradeoff between power consumption and
   transmission delay in the fog-cloud computing system is investigated. We
   formulate a workload allocation problem which suggests the optimal
   workload allocations between fog and cloud toward the minimal power
   consumption with the constrained service delay. The problem is then
   tackled using an approximate approach by decomposing the primal problem
   into three subproblems of corresponding subsystems, which can be,
   respectively, solved. Finally, based on simulations and numerical
   results, we show that by sacrificing modest computation resources to
   save communication bandwidth and reduce transmission latency, fog
   computing can significantly improve the performance of cloud computing.}},

Abstract = {{Uniformly distributed uncertainty exists in industrial process; additive
   error introduced by quantization is an example. To be able to handle
   additive uniform and Gaussian measurement uncertainty simultaneously in
   system identification, the Flat-topped Gaussian distribution is
   considered in this paper as an alternative to the Gaussian distribution.
   To incorporate this type of uncertainty in the maximum likelihood
   estimation framework, the explicit form of its density function is of
   necessity. This work proposes an approach for obtaining both the
   functional structure and corresponding parameter estimation of
   Flat-topped Gaussian distribution by a moment fitting strategy. The
   performance of the proposed approximation function is verified by
   comparison to the Flat-topped Gaussian distributed random variable with
   different Gaussian and uniform components. Results of numerical
   simulations and industrial applications in system identification are
   presented to verify the effectiveness of the Flat-topped Gaussian
   distribution for noise distribution in handling additional uniform
   uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Difficulty in making low noise magnetic measurements is a significant
   challenge to the use of cube-satellite (CubeSat) platforms for
   scientific constellation class missions to study the magnetosphere.
   Sufficient resolution is required to resolve three-dimensional
   spatiotemporal structures of the magnetic field variations accompanying
   both waves and current systems of the nonuniform plasmas controlling
   dynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. This paper describes the
   design, validation, and test of a flight-ready, miniature, low-mass,
   low-power, and low-magnetic noise boom-mounted fluxgate magnetometer for
   CubeSat applications. The miniature instrument achieves a magnetic noise
   floor of 150-200 pT/root Hz at 1 Hz, consumes 400mW of power, has a mass
   of 121 g (sensor and boom), stows on the hull, and deploys on a 60 cm
   boom from a three-unit CubeSat reducing the noise from the onboard
   reaction wheel to less than 1.5 nT at the sensor. The instrument's
   capabilities will be demonstrated and validated in space in late 2016
   following the launch of the University of Alberta Ex-Alta 1 CubeSat,
   part of the QB50 constellation mission. We illustrate the potential
   scientific returns and utility of using a CubeSats carrying such
   fluxgate magnetometers to constitute a magnetospheric constellation
   using example data from the low-Earth orbit European Space Agency Swarm
   mission. Swarm data reveal significant changes in the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of the magnetic fields in the coupled
   magnetosphere-ionosphere system, even when the spacecraft are separated
   by only approximately 10 s along track and approximately 1.4 degrees in
   longitude.}},

   categories: pipe condition and configuration, pre-installation,
   challenges during installation, post-installation, and environmental
   challenges. In addition, this paper discusses relevant measures adopted
   in the current practices to mitigate these challenges. The main purpose
   of this paper is to provide a concise but comprehensive summary of all
   information needed by researchers and engineers to understand the
   obstacles and challenges that may arise during CIPP rehabilitation work.
   Meanwhile, much effort is made to identify future research needed to
   better understand how the current practice deals with such issues and to

Abstract = {{The dynamics of a gravity-driven injection process for heavy-oil

   of residual oil saturation (ROS) were investigated. The 10 x 15-cm and 5
   x 5-cm 2D visual sandpack models (a single layer of sintered microscale
   glass beads) were prepared and placed into a transparent vacuum chamber
   to prevent heat loss. The processes were recorded with a high-speed

   the lateral spreading of the steam chamber (half symmetric chamber
   growth) during steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) for heavy-oil
   recovery.
   Oil-trapping mechanisms yielding to the formation of ROS were described
   and analyzed because of (1) lateral expansion, (2) simultaneous vertical
   and lateral expansion, (3) pore and particle size, (4) heterogeneities
   (pore-and particle-size distribution), and (5) wettability. Attention

Title = {{A Theory for Relative Permeability of Unconventional Rocks With
   Dual-Wettability Pore Network}},
Journal = {{SPE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1970-1980}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies show that the pore network of unconventional rocks, such
   as gas shales, generally consists of inorganic and organic parts. The
   organic part is strongly oil-wet and preferentially imbibes the oleic
   phase. In contrast, the inorganic part is usually hydrophilic and
   preferentially imbibes the aqueous phase. Conventional theories of
   relative permeability, which are based on uniform wettability, cannot be
   applied to determine phase permeability in unconventional rocks with
   dual-wettability behavior. The objective of this paper is to extend the
   previous theories to model relative permeability of dual-wettability
   systems in which oleic and aqueous phases can both act as wetting phases
   in hydrophobic and hydrophilic pore networks, respectively.
   In the first part of the paper, we review and discuss the results of
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM), organic petrography, mercury
   injection capillary pressure (MICP), and comparative water/oil
   imbibition experiments conducted on several samples from the Triassic
   Montney tight gas siltstone play of the Western Canadian Sedimentary
   Basin. We also discuss various crossplots to understand the reasons
   behind the observed dual-wettability behavior, and to investigate the
   spatial distribution and morphology of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
   pores. In the second part, Purcell's model (Purcell 1949) is extended to
   develop a conceptual model for relative permeability of gas and water in
   a dual-wettability system such as the Montney tight gas formation.
   Finally, the proposed model is compared with measured relative
   permeability data.
   The results suggest that the submicron pores within solid
   bitumen/pyrobitumen are strongly water-repellant; therefore, they prefer
   gas over water under different saturation conditions. This part of the
   pore network is usually represented by a long tail at the lower end of
   the pore-throat-size distribution determined from MICP. The proposed
   relative permeability model describes single-phase flow of gas through
   the tail part, and two-phase flow of gas and water through the remaining
   bell-shaped part of the pore-throat-size distribution, which dominantly
   represents inorganic micropores. On the basis of our model, by
   increasing the fraction of water-repellant submicron pores, gas relative
   permeability decreases for a fixed water saturation. This decrease is
   ascribed to the reduction of the average size of flow conduits for the
   gas phase.}},

Abstract = {{Image analysis and numerical simulation algorithms are introduced to
   analyze the micro-structure, transport, and electrochemical performance
   of thin, low platinum loading inkjet printed electrodes. A local
   thresholding algorithm is used to extract the catalyst layer pore
   morphology from focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)
   images. n-point correlation functions, such as auto-correlation, chord
   length, and pore-size distribution are computed to interpret the
   micro-structure variations between different images of the same catalyst
   layer. Pore size distributions are in agreement with experimental
   results. The catalyst layer exhibits anisotropy in the through-plane
   direction, and artificial anisotropy in the FIB direction due to low
   slicing resolution. Microscale numerical mass transport simulations show
   that transport predictions are affected by image resolution and that a
   minimum domain size of 200 nm is needed to estimate transport
   properties. A micro-scale electrochemical model that includes a
   description of the ionomer film resistance and a multi-step
   electrochemical reaction model for the oxygen reduction reaction is also
   presented. Results show that the interfacial mass transport resistance
   in the ionomer film has the largest effect on the electrochemical

Abstract = {{To detect significant interannual and interdecadal oscillations and
   their teleconnections to large-scale climate anomalies such as El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and
   North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), monthly and seasonal maximum daily
   precipitation (MMDP and SMDP) from 131 stations across Canada were
   analyzed by using variants of wavelet analysis. Interannual (1-8 years)
   oscillations were found to be more significant than interdecadal (8-30
   years) oscillations for all selected stations, and the oscillations are
   both spatial and time-dependent. Similarly, the significant wavelet
   coherence and the phase difference between leading principal components
   of monthly precipitation extremes and climate indices were highly
   variable in time and in periodicity, and a single climate index explains
   less than 40\% of the total variability. Partial wavelet coherence
   analysis shows that both ENSO and PDO modulated the interannual
   variability and PDO modulated the interdecadal variability, of MMDP over
   Canada. NAO is correlated with the western MMDP at interdecadal scale
   and the eastern MMDP at interannual scale. The composite analysis shows
   that precipitation extremes at about three fourths of the stations have
   been significantly influenced by ENSO and PDO patterns, while about one
   half of the stations by the NAO patterns. The magnitude of SMDP in
   extreme El Nino years, and extreme PDO event of positive phase, was
   mostly lower (higher) over the Canadian Prairies in summer and winter
   (spring and autumn) than in extreme La Nina years. Overall, the degree
   of influence of large-scale climate patterns on Canadian precipitation
   extremes varies by season and by region.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{A short stack composed of six micro-tubular fuel cells was fabricated in
   order to study its electrochemical performance under different
   electrical connection configurations (parallel, series and
   parallel-series) at intermediate temperatures. Two cells were in the
   Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Pr2NiO4-YSZ system and four were in the
   Ni-YSZ/YSZ/Nd2NiO4-YSZ configuration, of which one failed following
   testing at 600 degrees C. Overall, individual cells had similar
   performance delivering 202, 302 and 340 mW/cm(2) at 600, 650 and 700
   degrees C, respectively. The stack delivered a maximum of 7.40, 1032 and
   11.56 W at these temperatures. No significant differences were found
   among different arrangements. However, as expected, the stack
   performance was most affected by the malfunctioning cell under a series
   arrangement at 600 degrees C. Since the parallel-series configuration
   delivers an intermediate voltage and current and similar power to the
   parallel or series connections, it can be more suitable for stack
   assembly. Such an arrangement also offers the possibility of replacement
   of a stack module in case a cell fails in that module during operation.
   A repairable fuel cell stack eliminates the negative economic impacts
   caused by a malfunctioning cell which, in extreme cases, can lead to the
   complete loss of the valuable energy conversion device. (C) 2016

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{1256-1269}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Software reliability growth models attempt to forecast the future
   reliability of a software system, based on observations of the
   historical occurrences of failures. This allows management to estimate
   the failure rate of the system in field use, and to set release criteria
   based on these forecasts. However, the current software reliability
   growth models have never proven to be accurate enough for widespread
   industry use. One possible reason is that the model forms themselves may
   not accurately capture the underlying process of fault injection in
   software; it has been suggested that fault injection is better modeled
   as a chaotic process rather than a random one. This possibility, while
   intriguing, has not yet been evaluated in large-scale, modern software
   reliability growth datasets.
   We report on an analysis of four software reliability growth datasets,
   including ones drawn from the Android and Mozilla open-source software
   communities. These are the four largest software reliability growth
   datasets we are aware of in the public domain, ranging from 1200 to over
   86,000 observations. We employ the methods of nonlinear time series
   analysis to test for chaotic behavior in these time series; we find that
   three of the four do show evidence of such behavior (specifically, a
   multifractal attractor). Finally, we compare a deterministic time series
   forecasting algorithm against a statistical one on both datasets, to
   evaluate whether exploiting the apparent chaotic behavior might lead to
   more accurate reliability forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a concept of fuzzy semientropy is proposed to quantify
   the downside uncertainty. Several properties of fuzzy semientropy are
   identified and interpreted. By quantifying the downside risk with the
   use of semientropy, two mean-semi-entropy portfolio selection models are
   formulated, and a fuzzy simulation-based genetic algorithm is designed
   to solve the models to optimality. We carry out comparative analyses
   among the fuzzy mean-entropy models and the fuzzy mean-semi-entropy
   models and demonstrate that the mean-semi-entropy models can
   significantly improve the dispersion of investment. Several illustrative
   examples using stock dataset from the real-world financial market (China
   Shanghai Stock Exchange) also show the effectiveness of the models.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Internal Pressure on the Tensile Strain Capacity of X52
   Pipelines With Circumferential Flaws}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wide plate testing has been traditionally applied to evaluate the
   tensile strain capacity (TSC) of pipelines with girth weld flaws. These
   wide plate tests cannot incorporate the effect of internal pressure,
   however, numerical analysis in recent studies showed that the TSC is
   affected by the level of internal pressure inside the pipeline (Wang et
   al. 2007, ``Strain Based Design of High Strength Pipelines,{''} 17th
   International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference (ISOPE), Lisbon,
   Portugal, Vol. 4, pp. 3186-3193). Moreover, most of the past studies
   focused on the effect of circumferential flaws on the TSC for pipelines
   of steel grade X65 or higher. The current Oil and Gas Pipeline System
   Code CSA Z662-11 provides equations to predict the TSC as a function of
   geometry and material properties of the pipelines. These equations were
   based on extensive studies on pipes having grades X65 or higher without
   considering the effect of internal pressure. This paper investigates the
   TSC for pipelines obtained using an experimental technique considering
   the effect of internal pressure and flaw size. Eight full-scale tests of
   X52 NPS 12 in. pipes with 6.91 mm wall thickness were conducted in order
   to investigate the effect of circumferential flaws close to a girth weld
   on the TSC for vintage pipelines subjected to eccentric tensile forces
   and internal pressure. The tensile strains along the pipe length and on
   the outer circumference of the pipe were measured using biaxial strain
   gauges and a digital image correlation (DIC) system. Postfailure
   macrofractography analysis was used to confirm the original size of the
   machined flaw and to identify areas of plastic deformation and
   brittle/ductile fracture surfaces. From the experimental and numerical
   results, the effect of internal pressure and flaw size on the TSC and
   the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) at failure were investigated
   and presented.}},

   found to be consistent with the Bethe-Heitler mechanism, where the
   number of positrons emitted into a 1 steradian cone angle from the

   Neyriz marble mine, Iran}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The expansion of the Neyriz marble mine into deeper levels caused an
   unexpected failure particularly in the toes of lower benches. This
   phenomenon can impact the overall stability of the quarry and results in
   undesirable environmental and technical consequences. To understand the
   failure mechanism, a comprehensive study including-laboratory testing,
   in situ field testing and theoretical analyses are carried out. The
   theory of the brittle failure which was mainly developed based on the
   experiences gained during excavation in granite rocks is adopted and
   augmented in this study to explain the governing mechanism of failure.
   Mechanical properties of the marble are determined using conventional
   rock mechanics tests, and the in situ stress field was evaluated using a
   modified under coring test. Analyzing the laboratory and field data with
   the available empirical criteria for brittle failure shows that the
   level of stress in the lower bench is high enough to initiate the
   brittle failure. Finally, constitutive models developed for this failure
   mode are adopted in conjunction with numerical modeling to investigate
   the observed failure in the quarry. Two modeling strategies, based on
   elastic and elastic-plastic analyses, are considered. Comparing the
   predicted failure surface with the observed failure profile, it can be
   concluded that the brittle failure criteria can very well capture the
   failure mechanism in this marble quarry. This shows that the criteria
   proposed to describe spalling failure around underground excavation in
   granite can be effectively employed for assessing the brittle failure in
   deep open cast and quarry mines in good quality rocks such as marble.}},

   The recent interest in catchbasins is to improve their effectiveness in

Abstract = {{We present the design and theoretical characterization of a
   magnetoplasmonic Faraday rotator for active polarization control in
   integrated plasmonics. By incorporating bismuth-substituted yttrium iron
   garnet (Bi:YIG) into a unique hybrid ridge plasmonic waveguide
   structure, we effectively overcome the phase-matching limitations
   between photonic TE and plasmonic TM modes, and hence attain efficient
   Faraday rotation within a plasmonic device. The device provides 99.4\%
   polarization conversion within a length of 830 pm, while the two modes
   exhibit propagation lengths in excess of 1 mm. This versatile optical
   building block can be operated with either a TE or TM input, making it
   ideal for polarization switching and polarization division multiplexing.
   Additionally, a buried Ag transmission line under the waveguide
   facilitates high-speed active polarization modulation by generating
   transient magnetic fields and modulating the Bi:YIG magnetization. We
   show that with these transient fields and an external static biasing
   field one can operate the device in either a pulsed-input pulsed-output
   mode, to produce a polarization switch, or a pulsed-input
   continuous-output mode, to produce a polarization oscillator. Such a
   device is shown to be capable of polarization modulation of 10 GHz and
   will be vital in realizing plasmonic circuits employing polarization
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The protocol described here is designed as an extension of existing
   techniques for creating elastin-like polypeptides. It allows for the
   expression and purification of elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) constructs
   that are poorly expressed or have very low transition temperatures. DNA
   concatemerization has been modified to reduce issues caused by
   methylation sensitivity and inefficient cloning. Linearization of the
   modified expression vector has been altered to greatly increase cleavage
   efficiency. The purification regimen is based upon using denaturing
   metal affinity chromatography to fully solubilize and, if necessary,
   pre-concentrate the target peptide before purification by inverse
   temperature cycling (ITC). This protocol has been used to express
   multiple leucine-containing elastin-like polypeptides, with final yields
   of 250-660 mg per liter of cells, depending on the specific construct.
   This was considerably greater than previously reported yields for
   similar ELPs. Due to the relative hydrophobicity of the tested
   constructs, even compared with commonly employed ELPs, conventional
   methods would not have been able to be purify these peptides.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical contact-separation mode triboelectric generator (TEG) based on
   lead-free perovskite, zinc stannate (ZnSnO3)-polyvinylidene fluoride
   (PVDF) composite and polyamide-6 (PA6) membrane is demonstrated. For the
   5 wt\% PVDF-ZnSnO3 nanocomposites, the facile phase-inversion method
   provides a simple route to achieve high crystallinity and beta-phase
   with a piezoelectric coefficient d(33) of -65 pm V-1, as compared to -44
   pm V-1 for pristine PVDF membranes. Consequently, at a cyclic excitation
   impact of 490 N/3 Hz, the PVDF-ZnSnO3/PA6 based TEGs provide a
   significantly higher voltage of 520 V and a current density of 2.7 mA
   m(-2) (corresponding charge density of 62.0 mu C m(-2)), as compared to
   the pristine PVDF-PA6 TEG which provides up to 300 V with a current
   density of 0.91 mA m(-2) (corresponding to a charge density of 55.0 mu C
   m(-2)). This increase in the electrical output can be attributed to not
   only the enhanced polarisation of PVDF by ZnSnO3 leading to an increase
   in the beta-phase content, but also to the surface charge density
   increase by stress induced polarisation of ZnSnO3, leading to the
   generation of stronger piezoelectric potential. The work thus introduces
   a novel method of enhancing the surface charge density via the addition
   of suitable high polarisation piezoelectric materials thus eliminating
   the need for prior charge injection for fluoropolymer membranes.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Li-rich layered oxides (LLOs) are promising cathode candidates for next
   generation Li-ion batteries, as they exhibit a higher reversible
   capacity (> 250 mA h/g), enhanced safety and much lower cost. However,
   LLOs generally suffer from high first cycle irreversible capacity (IRC)
   loss, poor rate capability, and a substantial voltage decay over
   prolonged cycling. These major challenges are closely dependent on the
   surface structure and chemistry of LLO cathodes and, thus, different
   surfaces induce different irreversible reactions resulting in various
   levels of battery performance. This review presents the current
   understanding, as well as recent highlights, on the roles and
   fundamentals of surface structure in LLO cathodes, from a materials
   science perspective, concerning surface structural disorder in pristine
   LLO (antisites, composition segregation and crystallographic facets),
   the roles of surface structures on redox processes (oxygen evolution,
   cation activation and reversible anion redox reactions), surface
   structural evolution during the first cycle and long-term
   electrochemical operation, and surface modification strategies to
   stabilize the surface structure and to mitigate the performance
   degradation of LLOs. However, some fundamental problems remain yet
   ambiguous, especially with regard to characterization and understanding
   of the surface structure and chemistry in relation to synthesis
   conditions and composition, and charge transfer and ionic transport of
   the interfacial processes within LLOs. In order to exploit the potential
   of LLO cathodes, a clear understanding of these fundamental questions
   are essential to optimize the synthesis parameters and material
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes are a poorly defined class of self-assembling and surface
   active molecules present in crude oils. The nature and structure of the
   nanoaggregates they form remain subjects of debate and speculation. In
   this exploratory work, the surface properties of asphaltene
   nanoaggregates are probed using electrically neutral 5 nm diameter
   gold-core nanoparticles with alkyl, aromatic, and alkanol
   functionalities on their surfaces. These custom synthesized
   nanoparticles are characterized, and their enthalpies of solution at
   near infinite dilution and the interfacial tensions of solutions
   containing these nanoparticles are compared with the corresponding
   values for Athabasca pentane asphaltenes. The enthalpies of solution of
   these asphaltenes in toluene, heptane, pyridine, ethanol, and water are
   consistent with the behavior of gold-alkyl nanoparticles. The
   interfacial tension values of these asphaltenes at toluene water and
   (toluene + heptane) water interfaces are consistent with the behavior of
   gold biphenyl nanoparticles as are the tendencies for these asphaltenes
   and gold-biphenyl nanoparticles to ``precipitate{''} in toluene +
   heptane mixtures. Gold-alkyl nanoparticles are minimally surface active
   at toluene water and (toluene + heptane) water interfaces and remain
   dispersed in all toluene + heptane mixtures. The behavior of these
   asphaltenes in solution and at interfaces is inconsistent with the
   behavior of gold-n-alkanol nanoparticles. The outcomes of this formative
   work indicate potential roles for aromatic submolecular motifs on
   aggregate surfaces as a basis for interpreting asphaltene nanoparticle
   flocculation and interfacial properties, while alkyl submolecular motifs
   on aggregate surfaces appear to provide a basis for interpreting other
   aspects of asphaltene solution behavior. A number of lines of inquiry
   for future work are suggested.}},

Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{A surface forces apparatus (SFA) was used to measure the intermolecular
   forces between a biodegradable demulsifier (ethyl cellulose, EC) and
   asphaltenes immobilized individually on molecularly smooth mica surfaces
   in an organic solvent. A steric repulsion on approach between the
   immobilized EC layers and asphaltenes was measured despite strong
   adhesion (F-ad/R approximate to -2 mN/m; W-ad = 0.42 mJ/m(2)) during
   retraction. The measured adhesion was attributed to the interpenetration
   and tangling of aliphatic branches of swollen asphaltenes and solvated
   chains of EC macromolecules. Competitive adsorption of EC on/in
   immobilized asphaltene layers was confirmed by combining SFA force
   measurements and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Following the
   injection of EC-in-toluene solution, an immediate (<5 min) increase in
   the confined layer thickness of the immobilized asphaltene layers was
   measured. Irreversibly adsorbed asphaltenes were displaced by EC
   macromolecules through binding with unoccupied surface sites on mica,
   followed by the spreading of EC across the mica substrate due to
   increased surface activity governed by the higher number of hydroxyl
   groups per EC molecule. AFM imaging confirmed that the increase in
   confined layer thickness resulted from the formation of larger
   asphaltene aggregates/clusters protruding from the mica substrate.
   Molecular level topographical images showed that the asphaltenes were
   not resolvated in the organic phase but self-associated as the EC
   macromolecules spread across the hydrophilic mica substrate. The results
   from this study provide not only fundamental insights into the basic
   interaction mechanisms of asphaltenes with EC macromolecules as a
   demulsifier in organic media but also directions toward enhancing
   demulsification of water-in-oil emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a series of pendant drop measurements and molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the effects of
   temperature and salinity on the interfacial tension (IFT) of
   water/toluene binary systems. Both experimental measurements and
   theoretical simulations demonstrated that elevating temperature
   decreased the IFT, while adding salts resulted in an increment of IFT.
   Furthermore, it was found that the presence of model asphaltene compound
   could alleviate the effects of temperature and salinity on the IFTs.
   That is, in the presence of the model asphaltene compound, the decrement
   effect of elevating temperature as well as the increment effect of
   adding salts was reduced. Through detailed analysis of the simulated
   systems, the underlying mechanisms for the effects of temperature and
   salinity on the IFTs were clarified for cases with and without the
   presence of the model asphaltene. The results reported here can help to
   modulate the IFT values of oil/water interfaces in petroleum processing.}},

Abstract = {{Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) produced water (PW) consists of
   oil, solids, clays, petroleum-derived compounds, and other dissolved
   organic matters (DOMs), which make the SAGD PW highly stable and,
   therefore, very hard to treat. Developing a correlation between SAGD PW
   properties and dynamics of interfacial tension (IFT) between dispersed
   and continuous phases is important to understand the coalescence of
   dispersed phase droplets, which, in turn, leads to demulsifications of
   these difficult emulsions produced during SAGD operations. This work
   sheds light on the interfacial activity of SAGD PW endogenous
   surfactants, humic acids (HAs), as well as the interaction dynamics of
   these compounds with naphtha diluted Alberta oil sand bitumen (AOSB)
   present in a model SAGD PW. We quantify the dynamics of the IFT of a
   naphtha diluted AOSB oil drop in pure water as well as SAGD synthetic
   brine. Our results pinpoint the distinctive influence of the percentage
   weight composition of the naphtha-diluted AOSB and the surrounding model
   SAGD PW pH on the dynamics of this oil-water IFT. We anticipate that the
   results of this study will bring about a better understanding of
   interfacial film properties, leading to a predictable coalescence
   mechanism in SAGD PW emulsions, facilitating the design of
   next-generation SAGD deoiling unit operations.}},

Abstract = {{Oilsands bitumen production facilities need heat, water, and hydrogen to
   recover and upgrade bitumen. Hydrogen is usually derived from synthesis
   gas, which also provides an opportunity for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.
   Heat, process, and product integration benefits were pointed out in the
   literature, and the literature was reviewed. New integration
   opportunities were identified, as well as technical aspects that should
   be considered in such integration. Heat integration of air separation
   and the impact of Fischer-Tropsch technology selection on the quality of
   heat integration were discussed. Integration of water management and the
   potential use of the Fischer-Tropsch aqueous products for bitumen
   recovery, demetalation, viscosity reduction, and pH management were
   described. Limited opportunity for integration of gas cleaning was
   found. Process integration during primary product separation, as well as
   various strategies to derive more benefit from gaseous products, was
   outlined. Gaseous product processing strategies that were described
   include the use of tail gas olefin oligomerization, improved hydrogen
   recovery, and opportunities related to froth treatment, such as
   deasphalting, that were of a more speculative nature. The lack of
   current understanding related to coprocessing Fischer-Tropsch wax with
   bitumen was highlighted. Lastly, an improvement was shown in the
   distillation profile of diluted bitumen produced with Fischer-Tropsch
   products when compared to typical industrial dilution with naphtha or
   natural gas condensate.}},

Abstract = {{A passive fully inkjet-printed circuit on a plastic based flexible
   substrate for increasing the communication read range of an NFC based
   system is proposed. Two parallel coils resonating at 13.56 MHz are used
   for the improvement of coupling between the transmitter and receiver.
   The proposed system behaves like a lens by concentrating the absorbed
   magnetic energy from a wide area in a small focal region. Being a
   passive circuit, fully inkjet-printed and having only one discrete
   component made this circuit a very low-cost and tempting solution for
   improving the magnetic link between transmitter and receiver. Another
   advantage of this circuit is its operability in proximity of metal
   asset. Functionality of ordinary systems is severely affected by close
   metallic objects; hence, having a system that can operate in both
   conditions is favorable. The measured boosted power after the
   exploitation of the booster in proximity of the metal asset at 13.56 MHz
   is 15 dB.}},

Abstract = {{With exponential increase in the number of users and available data,
   service providers are facing hard times to satisfy and improve end user
   experience. Researchers have come up with the idea of exploiting
   increasing number of routers in a network, and it leads to the
   development of information-centric networking (ICN). Efficient usage of
   the in-network caches and content forwarding methodology are the key
   issues in an ICN architecture. ICN reduces average hop count and
   correspondingly average content download delay because the intra-domain
   routers in ICN have storage capacity and they can act as temporary
   content provider. In this paper, we address the content management issue
   in a cache with finite storage capability and propose an efficient
   content management policy that changes a router to a self-sustained
   cache. We propose a novel methodology to process content packets in the
   buffer of a cache and correspondingly reduce the propagation delay
   through a cache. We simulate our proposed algorithm over real-life
   network environment and evaluate the performance of different user
   experience metrics, e.g. average latency, throughput, goodput, and link
   load. Simulation results suggest that our proposed model outperforms the
   existing state-of-the-art on-path caching strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerating dewatering of fluid fine tailings (FFT) to facilitate land
   reclamation is a major challenge to the oil sands industry in Canada. A
   new method was tested, addition of Tubifex to FFT. Tubifex is an
   indigenous earthworm in Canada. The survival rate tests showed that
   Tubifex can survive in oil sands tailings and penetrate to 42 cm depth
   (maximum depth tested). Columns (5 L of FFT) were set-up with tailings
   alone, Tubifex treated tailings and polymer-Tubifex treated tailings.
   Test results showed that (a) the final mud-water interface of tailings
   alone was 26\% higher than that of Tubifex treated tailings; (b) solids
   content of Tubifex treated tailings was 21\% more than that of tailings
   alone; (c) Tubifex was capable to accelerate the dewatering process of
   both cationic and anionic polymer treated tailings; (d) anionic polymer
   was superior in facilitating long-term dewatering and its coupled
   effects with Tubifex were better than the cationic polymer.}},

Abstract = {{This note is concerned with the network-based resilient estimation
   problem. Multiple communication channels are considered to coexist in
   the networked surroundings, in contrast with the existing studies in
   which only one channel is used. In addition, it is supposed that the
   number of channels is not fixed, which consequently causes the
   communication capability vary among a finite set of modes. The
   regularity of the variation is considered to be of the modal persistent
   dwell time (MPDT) property. By constructing a quasi-time-dependent (QTD)
   Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions on the existence of resilient
   estimator have been obtained, which have been also shown to be less
   conservative than the non-QTD approach. An example of suspension system
   is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed

Abstract = {{This paper investigates amorphous phase formation and rapid
   solidification characteristics of a CoCr alloy. High cooling rate and
   high undercooling-induced rapid solidification of the alloy was achieved
   by impulse atomization in helium atmosphere. Two atomization experiments
   were carried out to generate powders of a wide size range from liquid
   CoCr at two different temperatures. Amorphous fraction and kinetic
   crystallization properties of impulse atomized powders were
   systematically quantified by means of differential scanning calorimetry.
   In addition, different but complementary characterization tools were
   used to analyze the powders microstructures. The fraction of amorphous
   phase within the investigated powders is found to be promoted by high
   cooling rate or smaller powder size. The critical cooling rate for
   amorphous phase formation, which is influenced by the oxygen content in
   the melt, is found to be similar to 3 x 10(4) K s(-1) and corresponds to
   a 160-mu m-diameter powder atomized in helium. Hardness of the powders
   is found to follow a trend that is described by the Hall-Petch relation
   when a relatively high fraction of crystalline structures is present and
   decreases with the fraction of amorphous phase. (C) The Minerals, Metals

Abstract = {{Microstructure and texture evolution of as-extruded ZM31 magnesium
   alloys with different amounts of yttrium (Y) during pre- and
   post-deformation annealing were examined with special attention given to
   the effect of Y on recrystallization. It was observed that the extruded
   ZM31 alloys exhibited a basal texture with the basal planes parallel to
   the extrusion direction (ED). The compression of the extruded alloys in
   the ED to a strain amount of 10 pct resulted in c-axes of hcp unit cells
   rotating toward the anti-compression direction due to the occurrence of
   extension twinning. Annealing of the extruded alloys altered the
   microstructure and texture, and the subsequent compression after
   annealing showed a relatively weak texture and a lower degree of
   twinning. A reverse procedure of pre-compression and subsequent
   annealing was found to further weaken the texture with a more scattered
   distribution of orientations and to lead to the vanishing of the
   original basal texture. With increasing Y content, both the extent of
   extension twinning during compression and the fraction of
   recrystallization during annealing decreased due to the role of Y
   present in the substitutional solid solution and in the second-phase
   particles, leading to a significant increase in the compressive yield
   strength. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials Society and ASM

Abstract = {{Cancer cells are known to be heterogeneous and plastic, which imparts
   innate and acquired abilities to resist molecular targeting by short
   interfering RNA (siRNA). Not all cancer cells in a population would show
   a similar responsiveness to targeting of genes critical for their
   survival and even the responders could quickly transform and switch to
   alternative mechanism(s) for their survival. This study was designed to
   look at this phenomenon by analyzing the effect of siRNA silencing of
   selected protein mRNAs involved in cell survival and proliferation on
   other protein mRNAs that could contribute to cell survival. We compared
   the gene expression profile of the initial population after siRNA
   silencing to the subpopulation that survived the siRNA silencing, to
   identify potential overexpressions that might explain the cell survival.
   Our studies show that silencing well-selected protein mRNAs
   simultaneously could offer advantages compared to individual siRNA
   silencing due to an additional impact on the expression level of certain
   protein mRNAs. We also demonstrate that overexpression of certain
   protein mRNAs could explain the innate unresponsiveness of a
   subpopulation of cells. These observations could be a stepping stone for
   further investigation of the possibility of significant synergistic
   effect for this combinational RNA interference strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Optical tomographic reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale
   specimen is hindered by the axial diffraction limit, which is 2-3 times
   worse than the focal plane resolution. We propose and experimentally
   demonstrate an axial super-resolution evanescent wave tomography method
   that enables the use of regular evanescent wave microscopes like the
   total internal reflection fluorescence microscope beyond surface imaging
   and achieve a tomographic reconstruction with axial super-resolution.
   Our proposed method based on Fourier reconstruction achieves axial
   super-resolution by extracting information from multiple sets of 3D
   fluorescence images when the sample is illuminated by an evanescent
   wave. We propose a procedure to extract super-resolution features from
   the incremental penetration of an evanescent wave and support our theory
   by one-dimensional (along the optical axis) and 3D simulations. We
   validate our claims by experimentally demonstrating tomographic
   reconstruction of microtubules in HeLa cells with an axial resolution of
   similar to 130 nm. Our method does not require any additional optical
   components or sample preparation. The proposed method can be combined
   with focal plane super-resolution techniques like stochastic optical
   reconstruction microscopy and can also be adapted for THz and microwave
   near-field tomography. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Tissue loading created during spinal manipulation in comparison to
   loading created by passive spinal movements}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) creates health benefits for some while
   for others, no benefit or even adverse events. Understanding these
   differential responses is important to optimize patient care and safety.
   Toward this, characterizing how loads created by SMT relate to those
   created by typical motions is fundamental. Using robotic testing, it is
   now possible to make these comparisons to determine if SMT generates
   unique loading scenarios. In 12 porcine cadavers, SMT and passive
   motions were applied to the L3/L4 segment and the resulting kinematics
   tracked. The L3/L4 segment was removed, mounted in a parallel robot and
   kinematics of SMT and passive movements replayed robotically. The
   resulting forces experienced by L3/L4 were collected. Overall, SMT
   created both significantly greater and smaller loads compared to passive
   motions, with SMT generating greater anterioposterior peak force (the
   direction of force application) compared to all passive motions. In some
   comparisons, SMT did not create significantly different loads in the
   intact specimen, but did so in specific spinal tissues. Despite
   methodological differences between studies, SMT forces and loading rates
   fell below published injury values. Future studies are warranted to
   understand if loading scenarios unique to SMT confer its differential
   therapeutic effects.}},

   their ability to identify soft subgrades. Two analyses were conducted to
   this end. First, the statistical distribution of peak deflections
   recorded by the FWD was investigated for different types of subgrade
   material. Second, the properties of track substructure were studied by
   characterizing the deflection time histories using a dynamic model of a
   single mass on a viscoelastic foundation and least-squares curve
   fitting. Four characteristic types of deflection time histories were
   identified for differing substructure conditions. Simplified dynamic
   modelling of railway track substructure showed that where relatively
   thick embankment exists over subgrade, the response of track is
   overdamped behavior.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a real-time estimator for needle tip deflection and
   needle shape during needle insertion into soft tissue. The estimator is
   based on an adaptive quasi-static mechanics-based model for
   needle-tissue interactions. The model uses Euler-Bernoulli beam theory
   to model the needle as a cantilever beam that experiences loads imposed
   by the tissue. The modeled needle-tissue interactions consist of a
   distributed load along the inserted needle portion and tissue
   cutting-related point load at the needle tip. We propose a closed-form
   solution to quantify the magnitude of these needle-tissue interaction
   loads based on force and torque measured at the needle base. The model
   adaptively adjusts the shape of the distributed load as the needle is
   inserted. Experiments are carried out into gelatin phantom and porcine
   tissue to validate the deflection estimate's performance. The newly
   proposed model's performance is compared against a previously proposed
   quasi-static model for needle-deflection estimation. It is shown that
   the novel model outperforms the previously proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{A variational Bayesian approach to robust identification of switched

   formulating the problem of interest under a full Bayesian identification
   framework, the number of local-models can be determined automatically,

   overall identification procedure. A set of significance coefficients is
   used to assign proper importance weights to local-models. By maximizing
   the marginal likelihood of the identification data, insignificant
   local-models will be suppressed and the optimal number of local-models
   can be determined. Considering the fact that the identification data may
   be contaminated with outliers, t distributions with adjustable tails are
   utilized to model the contaminating noise so that the proposed
   identification algorithm is robust. The effectiveness of the proposed

   fibrous materials and to simulate multi-phase flow. PTM is a fast,
   algorithmically simple method that reduces the complexity of the 3-D
   void space geometry to its topologically consistent medial surface and
   uses it as a solution domain for single- and multi-phase flow
   simulations. Our results in permeability calculations, pore size
   distribution, and quasi-static drainage and imbibition simulations are
   in very good agreement with other numerical methods and analytical
   solutions. We expect that incorporating detailed spatial information
   about the porous media structure into the medial surface will enable a
   more accurate representation of the void space structure and of physical
   phenomena involved in multi-phase flow, thus expanding the applicability
   of PTM to a broader range of porous media, including non-fibrous

Abstract = {{An accurate wrench model is significant for the simulation, manufacture,
   and control of the commutated magnetically levitated planar actuator
   (CMLPA). With plenty of coils and permanent magnets employed in the coil
   set and magnet array of CMLPA, the computational burden of the
   corresponding wrench model can be substantial. This paper proposes an
   accurate, universal, and robust parallel massive-thread wrench model
   (PMWM) for the CMLPA. In PMWM, the magnetic node, Gaussian quadrature,
   and coordinate transformation are employed to express the interaction
   between magnet array and coil set. All of these calculation modules are
   implemented on the graphics processing unit in a massively parallel
   framework by CUDA. In order to highlight the performance of this PMWM,
   the wrench model of three different CMLPAs is computed. The computation
   accuracy and efficiency of proposed PMWM are compared with the
   finite-element method software Ansys Maxwell and a boundary
   elementmethod software package named Radia, respectively. The same
   wrench model is also implemented on a multicore CPU through OpenMP and
   the comparative results are presented to show significant acceleration
   of the proposed massive-thread model.}},

Title = {{Fuzzy Arithmetic Risk Analysis Approach to Determine Construction
   Project Contingency}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of proper risk analysis techniques and contingency determination
   procedures in construction projects improves project efficiency and
   effectiveness. However, the uncertainty inherent in risk and the lack of
   sufficient related historical data on risks make it difficult to
   precisely assess a project's degree of risk exposure using classical
   deterministic or probabilistic risk analysis techniques. This paper
   provides an alternative to these techniques that uses fuzzy logic and
   expert judgment. It proposes a fuzzy contingency determination model
   (FCDM) that utilizes a novel and transparent fuzzy arithmetic procedure
   to determine construction project contingency using the -cut method and
   the extension principle, based on t-norms. Linguistic scales,
   represented by fuzzy numbers, enable experts to use natural language to
   assess the probability and impact of risk and opportunity events instead
   of depending on historical data. The model expresses contingency either
   as confidence intervals at different levels of confidence, or as a
   single crisp value resulting from defuzzification. A software tool, the
   Fuzzy Contingency Determinator (FCD), has been developed to implement
   the FCDM's fuzzy arithmetic procedure. The model is validated by
   comparing its resultswork package and project contingenciesto those of a
   Monte Carlo simulation model, using actual project data. The main
   contributions of this paper are (1)providing a systematic, transparent,
   and flexible methodology to identify and assess risk and opportunity
   events and determine construction project contingency, using a novel and
   highly flexible fuzzy arithmetic procedure based on the -cut method and
   the extension principle, the latter of which uses different t-normsan
   approach that has not been previously applied in the construction domain
   to determine project contingency; (2)offering an alternative to
   traditional deterministic and probabilistic risk analysis approaches by
   using expert judgment, linguistic scales, and fuzzy numbers to overcome
   their limitations; (3)incorporating opportunity in its assessment
   procedure, which has been rarely applied in other risk assessment
   models; and (4)implementing the fuzzy arithmetic procedure of the FCDM
   using a simple, flexible, and user-friendly software tool: FCD. The
   ability to explore the effect of different fuzzy arithmetic procedures
   on contingency determination provides a generalizable approach that can
   be applied to different cases of risk analysis.}},

   Applications: Improving the Simulation Time Advancement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Discrete event simulation (DES) has been widely used for scheduling and
   analysis of construction projects. Integration of DES with fuzzy logic
   enhances the capabilities of DES by capturing imprecise, subjective, and
   linguistically expressed knowledge in the simulation inputs using fuzzy
   numbers. However, available fuzzy discrete event simulation (FDES)
   methodologies have significant shortcomings in handling fuzzy ranking
   and updating of the simulation time. These limitations often result in
   the inaccurate estimation of the start and completion times for
   individual activities and the whole project. This paper presents a new
   approach for calculating the event times to increase the accuracy of
   simulation time estimation in FDES. The major contributions of this
   paper are in integrating DES with fuzzy logic to increase its
   applicability in the construction domain and increasing the accuracy of
   FDES results. The proposed FDES approach was implemented in a
   construction project scheduling example, which confirms the higher
   accuracy of the proposed methodology compared to existing FDES
   methodologies.}},

Title = {{Continuous Vertical Track Deflection Measurements to Map Subgrade
   Condition along a Railway Line: Methodology and Case Studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the methodology developed for the use of continuous
   vertical track deflection measurements from a moving loaded rail car to
   map the subgrade condition along a railway line. This analysis of
   deflection data was developed following the collection of more than
   12,000km of measurements. It was evident from the collected data that
   unprocessed deflection measurements are heavily effected by the track
   surface condition such as joints and geometry irregularities so as to
   obscure the deflections because of poor subgrade support. A filtering
   method was employed to minimize the influence of the surface condition
   which occur at short wavelengths and show the variations in track
   deflections because of changes in subgrade conditions which occur at
   longer wavelengths. The resulting processed data are compared with the
   geology over two study railway subdivisions to demonstrate that the
   processed vertical track deflection measurements are representative of
   the subgrade conditions. The filtering process, examples of the effect
   of track surface on the deflection measurements, and the limitations of
   the resulting data are also discussed.}},

Title = {{Implementation of Variable Speed Limits: Preliminary Test on Whitemud
   Drive, Edmonton, Canada}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Congestion has become highly recognized as a worldwide traffic problem,
   as traffic demand has grown steadily over the past few decades. Variable
   speed limits (VSLs) are an intelligent transportation system (ITS)
   measure that limits mainline flow to mitigate bottleneck congestion.
   Currently, VSLs have become proactive based on short-term prediction.
   Proactive VSLs succeed in simulation evaluations, but few have been
   deployed in the field and their real-world effectiveness has not been
   proven. Various factors may lead to this limitation, such as the absence
   of reliable field application software, accuracy of prediction models,
   and high computation time for proactive control. To address this
   research gap, this study reports a preliminary VSL test and details its
   implementation results on Whitemud Drive, Edmonton, Canada. First, based
   on field traffic measurements before VSL control, recurrent bottleneck
   locations are identified. Second, the proactive control algorithm is
   briefly introduced. Then, a software application is designed to realize
   all necessary functions for VSL field implementation. With all these in
   hand, the preliminary field test was conducted and the VSL control
   performance and reliability are evaluated. Finally, the results for
   before and after VSL control implementation are analyzed in depth. The
   analysis compares average traffic speed, standard deviation of speed,
   total travel time, and total travel distance. The results from this
   study confirm that proactive VSL can relieve recurrent traffic
   congestion effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Recently synthesized small molecule tellurophenes containing
   ring-appended pinacolboronate (BPin) side groups possess remarkable
   guest-free air-stable solid-state phosphorescence, structure-based
   colortunability and aggregation induced enhanced emission. The charge
   transport, doping and luminescence behavior of thin transparent films of
   a tellurophene with BPin groups positioned at the 2,5-positions
   (B-Te-6-B) was investigated. Film formation played a critical role in
   determining the hole mobility and the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime.
   Drop-coated films showed the strongest crystallinity, the highest PL
   quantum yields and a hole mobility (pp) of 1.1 x 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1),
   which places tellurophenes in a select group of high mobility
   phosphorescent emitters. B-Te-6-B was also found to spontaneously form
   high aspect-ratio microwires upon drop-casting from supersaturated
   solutions. Oxidative doping in solution by a
   N(C6H4Br)(3){[}SbCl6]/LiNTf2 reagent combination (Tf = SO2CF3) increased
   conductivity by 2-4 orders of magnitude without inducing a color change
   in the films, while exposure to iodine vapor induced a dramatic change
   in color together with a 4-6 order of magnitude change in the
   conductivity. The optical transparency, facile electrical doping and
   relatively high hole mobilities of B-Te-6-B in solution processed thin
   films offer promise for the use of tellurophenes as host-free emissive
   layers and hole transport layers in organic optoelectronic devices. (C)

   of the mechanical, electric and magnetic fields in the matrix, the

   the method of complex potentials. The electromagnetic fields inside the
   elliptical cavity have been taken into consideration, and explicit
   solutions for a mode Ill crack, either impermeable or permeable, are
   obtained when the elliptical cavity is reduced to a crack. The change of
   energy due to the presence of the cavity and reinforcement layer has
   been derived. Some special cases, such as the elliptical cavity problem
   and crack problem are discussed in detail to illustrate the validity and

Abstract = {{A discrete element model is presented to study slip-induced microseismic
   events along weak planes and crack-induced microseismic events within
   the intact rock for a representative elementary volume, REV, in the
   caprock of Weyburn reservoir. Also, the effect of varying factors such
   as orientation, coefficient of friction and elasticity of the weak plane
   on release of microseismic energies is studied. According to the
   results, for the conditions studied in this paper, the magnitudes of
   slip-induced events range from similar to-1 to -6, while crack-induced
   events range from similar to-7 to -11. Considering the capability of
   geophones, this suggests that events ``recorded{''} in the caprock are
   more likely to have slip origins along weak planes than having crack
   origins within the intact rock. In order to show the applicability of
   the model in practice, the events recorded in the caprock of Weyburn
   from September to November of 2010 are analyzed. Also, a simple model is
   presented that correlates the amount of consumed energy per volume of
   the REV with the seismic energy released due to stick-slips along a weak
   plane. The results show that weak planes can be emissive even long
   before the failure of their surrounding is reached, and therefore, there
   can be a level of tolerance for the observed microseismic events in the
   caprock.}},

Abstract = {{Mining frequent weighted itemsets (FWIs) from weighted-item transaction
   databases has recently received research interest. In real-world
   applications, sparse weighted-item transaction databases (SWITDs) are
   common. For example, supermarkets have many items, but each transaction
   has a small number of items. In this paper, we propose an interval word
   segment (IWS) structure to store and process tidsets for enhancing the
   effectiveness of mining FWIs from SWITDs. The IWS structure allows the
   intersection of tidsets between two itemsets to be performed very fast.
   A map array is proposed for storing a 1-bit index for words. From the
   map array, 1-bits are mapped to create the tidset of an itemset for
   faster calculation of the weighted support of itemsets. Experimental
   results for a number of SWITDs show that the method based on IWS
   structure outperforms existing methods.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{70-80}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a minimum void length scale control method for
   structural topology optimization. Void length scale control has been
   actively investigated for decades, which intends to ensure the topology
   design manufacturable given the machining tool access. However, only a
   single lower bound has been applied in existing methods, which does not
   fit the multi-stage rough-to-finish machining. To fix this issue, the
   proposed minimum void length scale control method employs double lower
   bounds which corresponds to the rough and finish machining operations,
   respectively. This method has been implemented under the level set
   framework. For technical details, the rough machining lower bound is
   satisfied by developing a signed distance-related constraint, which
   ensures enough space for the rough machining tool movement and thus,
   guarantees the machining efficiency. The finish machining lower bound is
   addressed through the curvature flow control, which ensures the small
   features manufacturable and also a good finish dimension and surface.
   Through a few numerical case studies, it is proven that the minimum void
   length scale can be effectively controlled without sacrificing much of
   the structural performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sand response changes with intensity of cementation bonds between sand

   anisotropy. First a critical state bounding surface plasticity model is
   presented in this paper. In this constitutive model, the loading surface
   always passes through the current stress state regardless of location or
   position of the stress path. Second to simulate hollow cylinder tests
   which represent different modes of shearing including triaxial
   compression and triaxial extension, the fabric anisotropy and
   b-parameter are incorporated in the model. Simultaneous integration of
   cohesion, non-associated flow rule, fabric anisotropy, kinematic
   hardening, critical state and state parameter makes the proposed model
   unique compared to previous proposed bounding surface models. Comparison
   of model outcomes and hollow cylinder experimental tests shows great
   predictive capability of the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis also
   suggests that triaxial compression and triaxial extension are
   respectively strongest and weakest modes of shearing. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The availability and low cost of natural gas in North America open the
   possibility of transporting it to places where there is significant
   demand. Natural gas can be transported long distances as liquefied
   natural gas (LNG). In this paper, data-intensive techno-economic models
   were developed to assess LNG production costs in Western Canada. A
   two-train (each with an annual natural gas liquefaction capacity of 5
   million tons) LNG plant is designed in the context of anticipated LNG
   export facilities in British Columbia, Canada. The plant equipment
   parameters and costs were estimated using a data-intensive bottom-up
   cost calculation methodology. Cost correlations linking the equipment's
   design parameters to the equipment's installed cost were developed and
   overall costs assessed. The total installed cost of the plant equipment
   is about US\$1.9 billion. Considering a \$1200/tpa capital expenditure,
   a 12\% discount rate, and a 25-year plant life, the total product (LNG)
   cost is \$7.8/GJ, if the gas supply source is Montney, and \$9.1/GJ, if
   the gas supply source is Horn River. The delivery cost of Canadian LNG
   to Asia was estimated and a sensitivity analysis conducted. Total
   liquefaction cost is influenced most by the LNG facility capital
   expenditure, gas supply cost, and the discount rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   exchange the information. Each subsystem estimator takes the advantage
   of a predictor accounting for the delays and data losses simultaneously.
   The predictor of each subsystem is used to generate state predictions of
   interacting subsystems for interaction compensation. To get a reliable
   prediction, the predictors are designed based on a prediction-update
   algorithm. The convergence of the proposed distributed state estimation
   is ensured under sufficient conditions handling communication delays and
   data losses. Finally, a chemical process example is used to evaluate the
   applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors (SCs) are increasingly used in energy storage system to
   tackle the fast power transients. They can be used individually or
   together with other energy storage units like batteries. In a microgrid,
   multiple SCs could be installed at different locations without
   communications among them. This paper focuses on the energy management
   strategy (EMS) of multiple SCs in a dc microgrid, where the distributed
   generation units and energy storage units are controlled with the
   plug-and-play feature. A novel EMS is proposed, which uses the
   state-of-charge-based adaptive virtual impedance to facilitate the
   transient power sharing among the parallel SCs without physical
   communications. The detailed analysis and design procedure are explained
   based on an example microgrid system with two SCs and one battery energy
   storage connected in parallel through the dc/dc converters. The
   effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by both simulation and
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{A universal controller for three-phase inverters (called UC3) is
   proposed to operate converters of a microgrid (MG) in grid connected
   (GC) and islanded modes and ensure seamless transition between these
   modes without reconfiguration of the control structure. These are
   desirable features for the flexible MG applications. UC3 provides
   control over real and reactive powers while offering voltage and
   frequency support. It emulates an inertia behavior that is grid
   supporting and stabilizing. Additional features of the proposed
   controller are summarized as follows: 1) it can be used in inverters
   with different output filters and is robust against their changes and
   uncertainties as well as the grid parameters; 2) it integrates the
   synchronization, which offers agile and smooth responses without causing
   stability issues; and 3) its structure is well suited for digital
   implementations. UC3 is the extension of the original single-phase work
   to three-phase. This paper presents the following contributions: 1)
   development of UC3 equations in a 2-D stationary domain; 2) derivation
   of a new quasi-linear model for UC3 in a GC operation; 3) a comparative
   stability analysis of the UC3-operated GC inverters using the developed
   quasi-linear model and the conventional method; 4) initial development
   of a new mathematical framework for the modeling and stability analysis
   of UC3-operated islanded inverters; and 5) comparative simulation and

Abstract = {{Strategic power-flow control using a Sen transformer ( ST) can be a
   robust and cost-effective solution to relieve grid congestion due to
   increased installation of renewables. The ST consists of a multiwinding
   transformer and tap changer that can regulate the power flow through a
   transmission line by injecting a series-connected controllable voltage.
   This paper develops a realtime high-fidelity magnetic equivalent
   circuit-based electromagnetic transient model for the ST on the
   field-programmable gate array ( FPGA) for hardware-in-the-loop
   applications. This geometry-based model was developed to depict the
   major flux paths in the transformer core, and complex nonlinear
   phenomena, such as saturation, hysteresis, and eddy currents. The entire
   real-time ST model and other power system components are emulated by
   hardware description language, employing the 32-b floating point
   precision on the FPGA chip. A fully paralleled and pipelined hardware
   architecture is developed to achieve accurate real-time emulation as
   well as the lowest latency and smallest hardware resource consumption.
   The real-time results are validated against 3-D finite-element
   simulation using JMAG software.}},

Abstract = {{A new class of modular multilevel dc/dc converters has recently emerged
   that eliminates the traditional full-rated intermediate ac stage
   inherent to two-stage dc/dc converter structures, that is, two cascaded
   dc/ac modular multilevel converters ( MMCs). This paper introduces the
   first averaged dynamic state-space model for this new class of
   single-stage dc/dc converter, called the DC-MMC, which captures all
   input and output terminal dynamics as well as internal capacitor
   dynamics. Based on the developed analytical model, a dynamic phasor
   model is derived to accommodate the multifrequency components that exist
   at steady state. The phasor model enables: 1) solving for the full
   steady-state solution of the DC-MMC under arbitrary loading and 2)
   evaluation of DC-MMC open-loop stability via eigenvalue analysis. These
   analyses are not possible with existing DC-MMC models. Simulations of a
   comprehensive switched model verify the accuracy of the presented
   analytical models, which represent valuable study tools for the analysis
   of emerging modular multilevel dc/dc converters containing multiple
   frequency components.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the anti-plane shear of a composite containing a periodic
   array of circular inclusions which incorporate separate interface
   effects in the presence of uniform remote loading. Using complex
   variable methods, the corresponding stress distributions and effective
   shear modulus of the composite are obtained by analyzing a
   representative unit cell subjected to periodic boundary conditions
   imposed on its edge. We present several examples to illustrate the
   interfacial stress field and effective shear modulus relative to the
   interface parameter and volume fraction of the inclusions. We show that
   when the volume fraction of the inclusions falls below approximately 9
   \%, the interfacial stress recovers effectively to that of a single
   inclusion with the same interface parameter in an infinite plane. We
   find also that when the shear modulus of the inclusions exceeds twice
   the shear modulus of the matrix, we can essentially treat each
   inclusion-matrix interface as being perfectly bonded without inducing
   significant errors in the effective shear modulus of the composite.
   Finally, we show that the use of effective medium theories may induce
   significant errors in the determination of the effective shear modulus
   of the composite when the inclusions are much softer than the matrix and
   simultaneously the volume fraction of the inclusions exceeds 50 \%.}},

Abstract = {{We study the contribution of surface elasticity to the two-dimensional

   deformation using an anisotropic version of the continuum-based
   surface/interface model of Gurtin and Murdoch. Full-field analytic
   solutions are obtained in terms of exponential integrals for an
   anisotropic half-space when the contact surface is subjected to two
   particular types of loading: first, we consider the case of a uniform
   load (shearing and pressure) applied to an infinitely long strip of the
   contact surface and second, by reducing the strip to zero width, we
   deduce the corresponding result for a concentrated line force acting on
   the contact surface. The analysis indicates that the surface deformation
   gradient is finite in the first case of uniform loading of the strip and
   exhibits a weak logarithmic singularity at the location of the applied
   concentrated line force in the second case.}},

Title = {{Lifetime-weighted photoacoustic imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has been utilized to quantify the lifetime
   profile of exogenous agents using a series of pump-probe pulses with a
   varying time delay; however, current techniques typically lead to long
   acquisition times which are sensitive to motion and cause absorption or
   photobleaching. We introduce a technique called lifetime-weighted
   imaging, which uses only three laser pulses to preferentially weight
   signals from chromophores with long lifetimes (including exogenous
   contrast agents with triplet excited states such as methylene blue and
   porphyrins) while nulling chromophores with short picosecond-to
   nanosecond-scale lifetimes (including hemoglobin). This technique
   detects the PA signal from a probe pulse either with or without a pump
   pulse. By subtracting the probe-only signal from the pump-present probe
   signal, we effectively eliminate signals from chromophores with short
   lifetimes while preserving PA signals from chromophores with
   long-lifetimes. We demonstrate the oxygen-dependent lifetime of both
   methylene blue and porphyrin-lipids and demonstrate both ground-state
   recovery and excited-state lifetime-weighted imaging. Lifetime-weighted
   PA imaging may have applications in many molecular imaging application
   including: photodynamic therapy dosimetry guidance and oxygen sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional breast cancer therapies have significant limitations that
   warrant a search for alternative therapies. Short-interfering RNA
   (siRNA), delivered by polymeric biomaterials and capable of silencing
   specific genes critical for growth of cancer cells, holds great promise
   as an effective, and more specific therapy. Here, we employed
   amphiphilic polymers and silenced the expression of two cell cycle
   proteins, TTK and CDC20, and the anti-apoptosis protein survivin to
   determine the efficacy of polymer-mediated siRNA treatment in breast
   cancer cells as well as side effects in nonmalignant cells in vitro. We
   first identified effective siRNA carriers by screening a library of
   lipid-substituted polyethylenimines (PEI), and PEI substituted with
   linoleic acid (LA) emerged as the most effective carrier for selected
   siRNAs. Combinations of TTK/CDC20 and CDC20/Survivin siRNAs decreased
   the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells significantly, while only TTK/CDC20
   combination inhibited MCF7 cell growth. The effects of combinational
   siRNA therapy was higher when complexes were formulated at lower
   siRNA:polymer ratio (1:2) compared to higher ratio (1:8) in nonmalignant
   cells. The lead polymer (1.2PEI-LA6) showed differential transfection
   efficiency based on the cell-type transfected. We conclude that the
   lipid-substituted polymers could serve as a viable platform for delivery
   of multiple siRNAs against critical targets in breast cancer therapy.

Abstract = {{A wireless power transmission system with a dynamic, real-time feedback
   for impedance matching is presented. The AC signal at the receiver node
   is rectified, the resulting DC signal is passed to a voltage controlled
   oscillator which drives a high-frequency analog switch. When in the ON
   state, the switch shorts the terminals of the receiver coil,
   dramatically changing the impedance seen by the transmitter coil. This
   change is detected on the transmitter side as the backscattered signal.
   Variation on the frequency of the backscattered signal can then be used
   to affect changes in the power source amplitude or the transmission side
   matching network to optimize the transmission power efficiency. The
   proposed feedback system is implemented with planar spiral coils on
   PCBs, and the effect of distance variation between the coils and as a
   consequence, DC voltage variation on the rectifier output is measured
   using voltage signal spectrum in the transmitter node at 1 MHz. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{This work investigated the oxidative transformation of the organic
   species in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) using Fourier
   transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and ultra
   performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (UPLC-TOF-MS) in both negative and positive electrospray ionization
   (ESI) modes. This is the first time to apply FTICR-MS to investigate
   species transformation in OSPW treatments by ferrate (VI), UV/H2O2, and
   molecular ozone, and also this is the first preliminary study to use
   positive ESI to investigate organic species in addition to naphthenic
   acids (NAs) in these treatment processes. The oxidation processes with
   potassium ferrate (VI), UV/H2O2, and ozone transformed the distribution
   profiles of O-x, OxSy, and OxNy organic fractions (i.e., species
   containing oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, with x, y specifying the oxygen
   number and sulfur/nitrogen number, respectively), with OxSy distribution
   profiles showing the most sensitive responses to the oxidation extent
   and can be used as a signature fraction to evaluate the oxidation
   effectiveness. Negative mode UPLC-TOF-MS confirmed the transformation
   pattern of O-x species observed with FTICR-MS, but positive mode
   UPLC-TOF-MS results showed severe discrepancies with FTICR-MS results
   and should be subjected for future further investigation, regarding the
   relatively low mass resolution of UPLC-TOF-MS. The investigation of the
   transformation patterns of different organic species using two
   ionization modes was a preliminary study to enhance the understanding of
   the efficiency, selectivity, and mechanism of different oxidation
   processes in OSPW remediation for both NAs and non-NA species. (C) 2016

Journal = {{PATTERN RECOGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{875-889}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many classification problems encountered in real-world applications
   exhibit a profile of imbalanced data. Current methods depend on data
   resampling. In fact, if the feature set provides a clear decision
   boundary, resampling may not be needed to solve the imbalanced
   classification problem. Therefore, this work proposes a feature learning
   method based on the autoencoder to learn a set of features with better
   classification capabilities of the minority and the majority classes to
   address the imbalanced classification problems. Two sets of features are
   learned by two stacked autoencoders with different activation functions
   to capture different characteristics of the data and they are combined
   to form the Dual Autoencoding Features. Samples are then classified in
   the new feature space learned in this manner instead of the original
   input space. Experimental results show that the proposed method
   outperforms current resampling-based methods with statistical
   significance for imbalanced pattern classification problems. (C) 2016

Title = {{Understanding the stability mechanisms of lentil legumin-like protein
   and polysaccharide foams}},
Journal = {{FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{903-913}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Foaming properties of lentil legumin-like protein were investigated in
   the presence of guar gum, xanthan gum and pectin at different
   environmental pH conditions (3.0, 5.0, and 7.0). The protein foaming
   capacity was not significantly impacted by adding polysaccharides,
   whereas foam stability was greatly enhanced at pH 3.0 and 5.0, leading
   to formation of long-life foams in most samples with the highest mean
   life value of 275 min at pH 5.0 in the presence of pectin. Investigation
   of the stability mechanisms revealed that at pH 3.0, the presence of the
   coacervates stabilized the foams against collapse due to the formation
   of an electrostatically cross-linked gel-like interfacial network. At pH
   5.0, aggregates were formed that adsorbed to the interface to form stiff
   and thick interfacial network, avoiding foam coarsening. Aggregates also
   plugged the junctions of the Plateau borders, slowing down the drainage
   by a jamming effect, and dramatically increased apparent viscosity of
   the foams, thus favoring the immobilization of the lamellar water
   surrounding the gas bubbles. The thermodynamic incompatibility at pH 7.0
   resulted in a phase separation of protein and polysaccharide in the
   interfacial protein membrane. This induced a disruption of the protein
   layer around the bubbles making it weaker and easier to break, leading
   to reduced foaming stability. The findings revealed that guar, xanthan,
   and pectin can improve the stability of lentil legumin-like protein
   foams at mild acidic pH, creating long-life foams, which would be
   particularly useful in the food industry where aerated structures must
   be preserved for a long period of time before solidifying or gelling.

   the single cracked tooth may be very weak. This study aims to develop a
   windowing and mapping strategy to interpret the vibration signal of a
   planetary gear at the tooth level. The fault symptoms generated by a
   single cracked tooth of the planet gear of interest can be extracted.
   The health condition of the planet gear can be assessed by comparing the
   differences among the signals of all teeth of the planet gear. The
   proposed windowing and mapping strategy is tested with both simulated
   vibration signals and experimental vibration signals. The tooth signals
   can be successfully decomposed and a single tooth fault on a planet gear
   can be effectively detected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mass transport of oxygen through an ionomer contained within the cathode
   catalyst layer in an anion exchange membrane fuel cell is critical for a
   functioning fuel cell, yet is relatively unexplored. Moreover, because
   water is a reactant in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline
   media, an adequate supply of water is required. In this work, ORR mass
   transport behavior is reported for methylated hexamethyl-p-terphenyl
   polymethylbenzimidazoles (HMT-PMBI), charge balanced by hydroxide ions
   (IEC from 2.1 to 2.5 mequiv/g), and commercial Fumatec FAA-3 membranes.
   Electrochemical mass transport parameters are determined by potential
   step chronoamperometry using a Pt microdisk solid-state electrochemical
   cell, in air at 60 degrees C, with relative humidity controlled between
   70\% and 98\%. The oxygen diffusion coefficient (D-bO2), oxygen
   concentration (c(bO2)), and oxygen permeability (D-bO2 center dot
   c(bO2)) were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting of the current
   transients using the Shoup-Szabo equation. Mass transport parameters are
   correlated to water content of the ionomer membrane. It is found that
   the oxygen diffusion coefficients decreased by 2 orders of magnitude
   upon reducing the water content of the ionomer membrane by lowering the
   relative humidity. The limitation of the Shoup-Szabo equation for
   extracting ORR mass transport parameters using thin ionomer films was
   evaluated by numerical modeling of the current transients, which
   revealed that a significant discrepancy (up to 29\% under present
   conditions) was evident for highly hydrated membranes for which the
   oxygen diffusion coefficient was largest, and in which the oxygen
   depletion region reached the ionomer/gas interface during the
   chronoamperometric analysis.}},

Volume = {{428}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{The Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT)
   equation of state correctly predicts Type I phase behavior for binary
   n-alkane + aromatic and naphthenic mixtures, while cubic equations of
   state (Peng-Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK)) predict a
   transition from Type I to Type II phase behavior within these families
   of mixtures, unless unconventional large and negative interaction
   parameters (k(ij)) are used. In this work, bubble pressures and L = V
   critical loci are evaluated for 13 binary n-alkane + benzene mixtures,
   including new data obtained for benzene + n-C-20, n-C-24, n-C-28 and
   n-C-36 binary mixtures. Computed bubble pressures for the Peng-Robinson
   (PR), Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and Perturbed-Chain Statistical
   Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) equations of state are compared with
   one another and with experimental measurements. The PC-SAFT EOS, with
   pure component parameters rescaled to conform with critical temperatures
   and pressures following the recommendation of Alfradique and Castier
   (2007), and interaction parameter values set to zero, yield accurate
   bubble pressures and critical loci for all benzene + n-alkane mixtures.
   By contrast, the PR and SRK EOS require mixture specific k(ij) values in
   order to provide quantitative bubble pressure and critical loci
   estimates, and best-fit let values exhibit significant temperature
   dependence. In the absence of experimental bubble pressures, options for
   estimating interaction parameters for cubic EOS for binary benzene +
   n-alkane mixtures, and for aromatic or naphthenic + alkane mixtures more
   broadly are discussed. While subject to further testing, selection of
   interaction parameter values for cubic EOS such that computed bubble
   pressures closely mimic bubble pressures predicted by the scaled PC-SAFT
   EOS is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption behavior of mixed cationic dodecylamine (DDA)/anionic
   sodium oleate (NaOL) at different molar ratios at the air/water
   interface were investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
   Some parameters such as the distribution of headgroups, carbon chains,
   counterions and water, as well as the headgroups-water radial
   distribution function, were calculated. The simulation results show that
   compared to pure DDA and NaOL, their mixtures are more compact and can
   form a tight monolayer at the air/water interface, indicating higher
   surface activity. The polar groups of surfactants are tilted into the
   liquid phase because of strong interactions with water; meanwhile, the
   hydrophobic carbon chains stretch towards the air phase at a smaller
   angle than pure surfactant. Water molecules can gather easily and
   aggregate around the headgroups in the mixed surfactants system. The
   order of the surface activity is as follows: DDA/NaOL=1/3 > DDA/NaOL=1/1
   > DDA/NaOL=3/1. These results demonstrate a strong synergistic
   interaction between DDA and NaOL at the air/water interface. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The outstanding water wettability and the capability of polyelectrolyte
   surfaces to spontaneously clean oil fouling are determined by their
   wetting mechanism in the surrounding medium. Here, we have quantified
   the nanomechanics between three types of polyelectrolyte surfaces (i.e.
   zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic) and water or oil drops using an
   atomic force microscope (AFM) drop probe technique, and elucidated the
   intrinsic wetting mechanisms of the polyelectrolyte surfaces in oil and
   water media. The measured forces between oil drops and polyelectrolyte
   surfaces in water can be described by the
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Surprisingly, strong
   long-range attraction was discovered between polyelectrolyte surfaces
   and water drops in oil, and the strongest interaction was measured for
   the polyzwitterion. This unexpected long-range ``hydrophilic{''}
   attraction in oil could be attributed to a strong dipolar interaction
   because of the large dipole moment of the polyelectrolytes. Our results
   provide new nanomechanical insights into the development of novel
   polyelectrolyte-based materials and coatings for a wide range of
   engineering, bioengineering, and environmental applications.}},

   from an Osmohaler(TM) by healthy human volunteers at 50-70L/min peak
   inhalation flow rate (PIFR) using both a low and high resistance
   Osmohaler(TM), and 110-130 L/min PIFR using the low resistance
   Osmohaler(TM) (n = 9). At 50-70 L/min PIFR, the resistance of the
   Osmohaler(TM) did not significantly affect the total and peripheral lung
   deposition of inhaled mannitol {[} for low resistance Osmohaler(TM),
   20\% total lung deposition (TLD), 0.3 penetration index (PI); for high
   resistance Osmohaler(TM), 17\% TLD, 0.23 PI]. Increasing the PIFR 50-70
   L/min to 110-130 L/min (low resistance Osmohaler(TM)) significantly
   reduced the total lung deposition (10\% TLD) and the peripheral lung
   deposition (PI 0.21). The total lung deposition showed dependency on the
   in vitro FPF (R-2 = 1.0). On the other hand, the PI had a stronger
   association with the MMAD (R-2 = 1.0) than the FPF (R-2 = 0.7). In
   conclusion the resistance of Osmohaler(TM) did not significantly affect
   the total and regional lung deposition at 50-70 L/min PIFR. Instead, the
   total and regional lung depositions are dependent on the particle size
   of the aerosol and inhalation flow rate, the latter itself affecting the

   the measurements by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM), two kinds of
   precipitates (colloidal precipitates and crystallized precipitates) were
   observed on the molybdenite surface which was immersed in the simulated
   sea water during flotation. It was found that the colloidal precipitates
   overspread on the surface while the crystallized precipitates randomly
   scatted on the surface. With the detection by auger electron spectrum
   (AES), it was found that magnesium and calcium were the main components
   in the colloidal precipitates and crystallized precipitates,
   respectively. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) tests,
   it was testified that the colloidal precipitates were Mg(OH)(2) and the
   crystallized precipitates were CaCO3, which was confirmed by ToF-SIMS
   results. These precipitated Mg(OH)(2) and CaCO3 particles on the
   molybdenite surfaces play an important role in inhibiting the flotation
   of molybdenite in the simulated sea water. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{The effects of polyethylene oxide (PEO) molecular weight (Mv), and
   volume fraction (phi) on the morphology of electrospun sulfur free
   softwood lignin nanofibers were investigated. Small amounts of PEO were
   used during preparations of the solutions to aid the electrospinning
   process. It was found that tripling the PEO volume fraction resulted in
   a transition from semi-dilute unentangled to semi-dilute entangled
   solutions. Conversely, the solution remained in the semi-dilute
   un-entangled regime as the molecular weight was increased by five times.
   The effects of molecular weight and volume fraction of PEO both on
   entanglement density and fiber morphology were unified by scaling PEO
   viscosities as a function of (phi 1.3 Mv)(polymer). We investigated and
   discussed conditions that would produce smooth fibers and conditions
   that would produce fibers with beads. In the case of beads-on-a-string
   formation, bead widths remained constant regardless of the molecular
   weight and concentration of PEO, but the bead length changed.
   Additionally, we observed a decrease in the diameter of the fibers and
   the dimension of beads (length and width of beads) with an increase in
   the electric field used for electrospinning. The aspect ratio of beads
   increased with increases to both the electric field and the PEO
   molecular weight or concentration. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a compact monopole antenna along with Bluetooth band and
   a band notched characteristic for ultra wideband (UWB) applications is
   designed. The antenna consists of a triangular shaped patch, an L-shaped
   ground plane and a tapered microstrip feedline to obtain UWB operation.
   An additional resonance is excited for the Bluetooth band (2.4-2.48GHz)
   by attaching an L-shaped strip to the radiator. Further, a C-shaped slit
   is etched in the radiator to restrict electromagnetic interference at
   IEEE INSAT/Super-Extended C-band from 6.7-7.1 GHz. The size of the
   antenna is only 13 x 24 x 1.6 mm(3). A prototype of the proposed design
   is fabricated to validate the performance of the antenna. Measured
   results show that the antenna successfully operates over Bluetooth and
   entire UWB bands except the IEEE INSAT/Super-Extended C-band. A large
   bandwidth of 21.4 GHz from 3.1 to 24.5 GHz for UWB band is obtained.
   Current distribution on the antenna is used to develop design equations,
   and analysed the effect of L-shaped strip and C-shaped slit on the
   antenna operation. The simple structure and small size of the antenna
   makes it suitable for most of the wireless communication systems.}},

Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Electrokinetic effects adjacent to charge-selective interfaces (CSI)

   Particle tracking obtained under chronoamperometric measurements show
   the development of vortices in the microchannel adjacent to the
   nanochannels. We found that the direction of the electric field and the
   potential drop inside the microchannel has a large influence on the ion
   transport through the interface, for example by inducing immediate wall
   electroosmotic flow. In microfluidic devices, the electric field may not
   be directed normal to the interface, which can result in an inefficient
   use of the CSI. Multiple vortices are observed adjacent to the CSI,
   growing in size and velocity as a function of time and dependent on
   their location in the microfluidic device. Local velocities inside the
   vortices are measured to be more than 1.5 mm/s. Vortex speed, as well as
   flow speed in the channel, are dependent on the geometry of the CSI and

Abstract = {{Autoencoders (AEs) are an effective means for nonlinear feature
   extraction and dimension reduction. Variant autoencoders are an
   improvement over traditional AEs in terms of robustness. This paper
   proposes a novel nonlinear and robust process-monitoring approach based
   on variant autoencoders (variant AEs), which include denoising
   autoencoders (DAE) and contractive autoencoders (CAE). The CAE and DAE
   are powerful for extracting robust and nonlinear feature representations
   or manifold structures underlying data from industrial processes. Next,
   an online monitoring model is built through constructing new test
   statistic H-2 based on the robust feature representations. The control
   limits are determined by kernel density estimation. The proposed method
   was applied to the Tennessee Eastman process (TE process) to evaluate
   its monitoring performance, and it demonstrated outstanding
   process-monitoring performance through the experimental results,
   especially for the barely detectable faults, such as 3, 5, 9, 10, 11,
   15, 19, 20 and 21. Variant AEs monitoring provides a simple and very
   effective process-monitoring method for industrial processes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The demand for hydrogen in conventional and unconventional oil refining
   industries is considerable. Currently, the predominant source of
   hydrogen is from fossil fuel production pathways, in particular, steam
   methane reforming (SMR), which incurs a significant greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions footprint. Thus, alternative environmentally benign sources of
   hydrogen will be needed in oil refinery complexes the world over, if
   their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint is to be reduced
   materially. In this paper, an integrated data-intensive techno-economic
   model is developed to provide a credible estimate of hydropower-hydrogen
   production costs in Western Canada. The minimum hydrogen production cost
   for the hydropower-hydrogen plant amounts to \$2.43/kg H-2 this
   corresponds to an electrolyser farm with 90 units of a 3496 kW (760
   Nm(3)/h) rated electrolyser. This cost is competitive with SMR/SMR
   coupled with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) production costs,
   which vary from \$1.87/kg H-2 to \$2.60/kg H-2. This point is buttressed
   by the fact that if existing hydropower plants are used (hence negating
   hydropower capital costs), the minimum production cost amounts to
   \$1.18/kg H-2. Hydrogen from hydro power, under the techno-economic
   conditions considered here, is competitive compared to SMR. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A novel wireless high-resolution resonant-based microwave sensor is
   presented for chemical sensing applications. A combination of antenna
   with a planar microstrip resonator increases the flexibility,

   sensor to areas with limited access and harsh environments. The main
   core of this sensor is a passive planar resonator, which operates at
   1.41 GHz and is reinforced by a regenerative active feedback circuitry.
   The regenerative active feedback loop compensates the power loss of the
   sensor and, as a result, provides an extremely high-quality factors.
   Four bow-tie slot antennas of the moderate gain of 5 dB, linearly
   polarized over the frequency span of 1.35-2 GHz is used to communicate
   in short range. The sensor model is implemented using the finite-element
   method and a complete set of simulation is presented. The simulation
   results are confirmed by the measurements for resonant profile variation
   in material sensing. The initial quality factor of the fabricated
   sensor, considering the antennas and resonator loss is Q approximate to
   22000, which broadens the range of sensing platforms into classification

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{Two identical anoxic-aerobic membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were operated
   in parallel for 742 consecutive days for raw and ozonated oil sands
   process-affected water (OSPW) treatment. The MBRs not only substantially
   degraded OSPW classical and oxidized NAs, but also demonstrated
   outstanding membrane fouling control performance (the MBR receiving raw
   OSPW experienced its first severe fouling with a transmembrane pressure
   (TMP) of -35 kPa on Day 433). The mild ozonation (30 mg O-3/L)
   pretreatment of OSPW remarkably enhanced OSPW NA degradation, and
   improved the MBR's fouling control in terms of prolonged long-term slow
   TMP growth phase and reduced TMP jump frequency. Ozonation substantially
   altered the feed water organic composition, reshaped the microbial
   community (e.g., reduced growth of extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPS) producers and biofilm formation facilitators), and lowered EPS
   production and EPS protein/polysaccharides (PN/PS) ratio, consequently
   leading to the better fouling control. Examination on fouling behaviors
   at different HRTs of the raw OSPW MBR indicates that HRT also played a
   role in determining the dominating fouling mechanism during the sharp
   TMP rise phase. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that the

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are reported to be the main species responsible
   for the oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) toxicity. In this study,
   the degradation of cyclohexanoic acid (CHA) as a model compound for NAs
   by an ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS)-modified Fenton
   process was investigated at pH 8. Optimum dose for Fe-EDDS (EDDS:Fe
   =2:1) was 0.45 mM, and 2.94 mM for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The time
   profiles of the main species in the process were studied, including CHA,
   H2O2, Fe(II), total Fe, and Fe-EDDS (in the main form of
   (FeEDDS)-E-III). The second-order rate constant between EDDS and
   hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) at pH 8 was obtained as 2.48 +/-
   0.43 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). (OH)-O-center dot was proved to be the main
   species responsible for the CHA degradation, while superoxide radical
   (O-2(center dot-)) played a minor role. The consecutive addition of H2O2
   and Fe-EDDS led to a higher removal of CHA compared to that achieved by
   adding the reagents at a time. The half-wave potential of
   (FeEDDS)-E-III/II was measured at pH 7-9. The EDDS-modified Fenton
   process is a promising alternative to degrade NAs. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Oil removal of spent hydrotreating catalyst CoMo/Al2O3 via a facile

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{318}},

Abstract = {{Deoiling process is a key issue for recovering metal values from spent
   hydrotreating catalysts. The oils can be removed with organic solvents,
   but the industrialized application of this method is greatly hampered by
   the high cost and complex processes. Despite the roasting method is
   simple and low-cost, it generates hardest-to-recycle impurities (CoMoO4
   or NiMoO4) and enormous toxic gases. In this study, a novel and facile
   approach to remove oils from the spent hydrotreating catalysts is
   developed. Firstly, surface properties of spent catalysts are
   characterized to reveal the possibility of oil removal. And then, oils
   are removed with water solution under the conditions of 90 degrees C,
   0.1 wt\% SDS, 2.0 wt\% NaOH and 10 ml/g L/S ratio for 4 h. Finally,
   thermal treatment and leaching tests are carried out to further explore
   the advantages of oil removal. The results show that no
   hardest-to-recycle impurity CoMoO4 is found in XPS spectra of thermally
   treated samples after deoiling and molybdenum is leached completely with
   sodium carbonate solution. It means that the proposed deoiling method
   can not only remove oils simply and without enormous harmful gases
   generating, but also avoid the generation of detrimental impurity and
   promote recycling of valuable metals from spent hydrotreating catalysts.

Abstract = {{Guiding public opinions toward a pre-set target by informed agents can
   be a strategy adopted in some practical applications. The informed
   agents are common agents who are employed or chosen to spread the
   pre-set opinion. In this work, we propose a social judgment based
   opinion (SJBO) dynamics model to explore the opinion evolution under the
   influence of informed agents. The SJBO model distinguishes between inner
   opinions and observable choices, and incorporates both the compromise
   between similar opinions and the repulsion between dissimilar opinions.
   Three choices (support, opposition, and remaining undecided) are
   considered in the SJBO model. Using the SJBO model, both the inner
   opinions and the observable choices can be tracked during the opinion
   evolution process. The simulation results indicate that if the exchanges
   of inner opinions among agents are not available, the effect of informed
   agents is mainly dependent on the characteristics of regular agents,
   including the assimilation threshold, decay threshold, and initial
   opinions. Increasing the assimilation threshold and decay threshold can
   improve the guiding effectiveness of informed agents. Moreover, if the
   initial opinions of regular agents are close to null, the full and
   unanimous consensus at the pre-set opinion can be realized, indicating
   that, to maximize the influence of informed agents, the guidance should
   be started when regular agents have little knowledge about a subject
   under consideration. If the regular agents have had clear opinions, the
   full and unanimous consensus at the preset opinion cannot be achieved.
   However, the introduction of informed agents can make the majority of
   agents choose the pre-set opinion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Streaming current magnetic fields in a charged nanopore}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic fields induced by currents created in pressure driven flows
   inside a solid-state charged nanopore were modeled by numerically
   solving a system of steady state continuum partial differential
   equations, i.e., Poisson, Nernst-Planck, Ampere and Navier-Stokes
   equations (PNPANS). This analysis was based on non-dimensional transport
   governing equations that were scaled using Debye length as the
   characteristic length scale, and applied to a finite length cylindrical
   nano-channel. The comparison of numerical and analytical studies shows
   an excellent agreement and verified the magnetic fields density both
   inside and outside the nanopore. The radially non-uniform currents
   resulted in highly nonuniform magnetic fields within the nanopore that
   decay as 1/r outside the nanopore. It is worth noting that for either
   streaming currents or streaming potential cases, the maximum magnetic
   field occurred inside the pore in the vicinity of nanopore wall, as
   opposed to a cylindrical conductor that carries a steady electric
   current where the maximum magnetic fields occur at the perimeter of
   conductor. Based on these results, it is suggested and envisaged that
   non-invasive external magnetic fields readouts generated by
   streaming/ionic currents may be viewed as secondary electronic
   signatures of biomolecules to complement and enhance current DNA
   nanopore sequencing techniques.}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The vibration signals of planet bearings feature more complex amplitude
   modulation and frequency modulation (AM-FM) than those of fixed-axis
   bearings, due to the effects of time-varying vibration transfer path,
   load zone passing and time-varying angles between gear pair mesh lines
   of action and impact force vector, in addition to that of bearing fault.
   Their Fourier spectra have a complex sideband structure, leading to
   difficulty in feature extraction and fault diagnosis. In order to
   address this issue, a joint amplitude and frequency demodulation
   analysis method is proposed to reveal the fault features, by considering
   the modulation characteristics. To thoroughly understand planet bearing
   vibration characteristics, the explicit equations for amplitude and
   frequency demodulated spectra of outer race, rolling element and inner
   race fault cases are derived, and the fault symptoms are summarized
   respectively. The signal is firstly decomposed into intrinsic mode
   functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD), thus meeting the
   mono component requirement by instantaneous frequency calculation. Then
   a sensitive component with the instantaneous frequency fluctuating
   around the resonance frequency is chosen for further frequency
   demodulation analysis. Finally, planet bearing fault can be diagnosed by
   matching the peaks identified in amplitude and frequency demodulated
   spectra with the theoretical fault characteristic frequencies. The
   proposed method is validated with both numerical simulated and lab
   experimental signal analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Cell response to exogenous cues is the result of a complex integration
   of multiple biochemical/biophysical signals, which might occur
   simultaneously and might be characterized by specific spatial and
   temporal patterns. Among these signals, surface topography plays an
   important role in affecting cell functions and fate. However, the
   current understanding of the interplay between cells and topography
   relies on static environment. Here the intrinsic light-responsive
   properties of azopolymers and the versatility of laser-based confocal
   microscope technique is exploited, aiming to induce spatio-temporal
   dynamic topographic changes in situ during cell culture. Diverse
   patterns can be designed on cell-populated azopolymer films with high
   control on time, space, and on-off signal modification. The technique
   proposed in this study enables the development of synthetic platforms
   that finely control cell orientation and migration both in time and
   space. The results may pave the way to unravel complex processes
   involved in cell-topography interactions, thus allowing to define the
   spatio-temporal features that most effectively influence cell functions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, poly(2-lactobionamidoethyl methacrylamide) of various
   molecular weights (MWs) was synthesized using conventional free-radical
   polymerization. The effect of MW and Oil polymer dosage on the settling
   rate of kaolin particles, turbidity of the supernatant, mud-line
   position, and solid content was investigated to determine the
   flocculation performance. The interaction forces, polymer conformation,
   particle sizes, and MWs were determined using several techniques,
   including surface forces apparatus, atomic force microscopy (AFM),
   dynamic light scattering, and gel permeation chromatography. Our results
   reveal that the initial settling rate of kaolin particles and the
   clarity of supernatants increase with increasing MW of the
   glycopolymers. Surface force measurements and AFM imaging of the
   adsorbed polymer surfaces show strong polymer particle adhesion and
   bridging attraction between the glycopolymers and clay surfaces, which
   increase with increasing MW of the glycopolymer. The strengthened
   bridging attraction with the polymer MW is attributed to the formation
   of stronger adhesion (e.g., via hydrogen bonding) between the fine
   particles and the abundant hydroxyl groups in the glycopolymers of
   higher MW, thus contributing to enhanced flocculation behaviors. Our
   results provide new insights into the development of eco-friendly
   polymer flocculants based on glycopolymers for an efficient solid liquid
   separation in tailing treatment and into the fundamental understanding
   of associated intermolecular interactions and flocculation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the Advanced System for Implant Stability Testing
   (ASIST) which provides a non-invasive, quantitative measure of the
   stability of percutaneous implants used for craniofacial rehabilitation
   such as bone anchored hearing aids or dental implants. The ASIST uses an
   impact technique coupled with an analytical model which allows the
   measure to be independent of the system components. This paper presents
   a laboratory evaluation of the ASIST for the Oticon Medical Ponto and
   the Cochlear Baha Connect bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) systems.
   There is minimal effect of abutment length on the ASIST Stability
   Coefficient (ASC) value, indicating that the method is able to isolate
   the interface properties from the overall system and the measurement is
   independent of attached components. Additionally, the ASIST was able to
   detect differences between different implant installations suggesting
   that it may be sensitive to changes in interface stiffness. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to determine the contribution of surface
   oxygen groups to irreversible adsorption (aka heel formation) during
   cyclic adsorption/regeneration of organic vapors commonly found in
   industrial systems, including vehicle-painting operations. For this
   purpose, three chemically modified activated carbon samples, including
   two oxygen-deficient (hydrogen-treated and heat-treated) and one
   oxygen-rich sample (nitric acid-treated) were prepared. The samples were
   tested for 5 adsorption/regeneration cycles using a mixture of nine
   organic compounds. For the different samples, mass balance cumulative
   heel was 14 and 20\% higher for oxygen functionalized and
   hydrogen-treated samples, respectively, relative to heat-treated sample.
   Thermal analysis results showed heel formation due to physisorption for
   the oxygen-deficient samples, and weakened physisorption combined with
   chemisorption for the oxygen-rich sample. Chemisorption was attributed
   to consumption of surface oxygen groups by adsorbed species, resulting
   in formation of high boiling point oxidation byproducts or bonding
   between the adsorbates and the surface groups. Pore size distributions
   indicated that different pore sizes contributed to heel formation -
   narrow micropores (<7 angstrom) in the oxygen-deficient samples and
   midsize micropores (7-12 angstrom) in the oxygen-rich sample. The
   results from this study help explain the heel formation mechanism and
   how it relates to chemically tailored adsorbent materials. (C) 2016

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Formation of bacterial colonies as biofilm on the surface/interface of
   various objects has the potential to impact not only human health and
   disease but also energy and environmental considerations. Biofilms can
   be regarded as soft materials, and comprehension of their shear response
   to external forces is a key element to the fundamental understanding. A
   mesoscale model has been presented in this article based on digitization
   of a biofilm microstructure. Its response under externally applied shear
   load is analyzed. Strain stiffening type behavior is readily observed
   under high strain loads due to the unfolding of chains within soft
   polymeric substrate. Sustained shear loading of the biofilm network
   results in strain localization along the diagonal direction. Rupture of
   the soft polymeric matrix can potentially reduce the intercellular
   interaction between the bacterial cells. Evolution of stiffness within
   the biofilm network under shear reveals two regimes: a) initial increase
   in stiffness due to strain stiffening of polymer matrix, and b) eventual
   reduction in stiffness because of tear in polymeric substrate.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing can be used for stimulating low-permeability
   heavy-oil reservoirs. It is challenging to achieve a high degree of
   fracturing-fluid flowback, as well as a low degree of formation damage,
   in low-permeability heavy-oil reservoirs. This research investigates the
   application of a novel hyperbranched-polymer fracturing fluid in
   low-permeability heavy-oil reservoirs. Such hyperbranched polymer is
   characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry. It
   has numerous end groups and possesses a 3D spherical molecular structure
   with many branches. Laboratory tests are conducted to evaluate the
   thermal stability and shearing resistance, reversible-crosslinking
   performance, salinity tolerance, static-filtration performance,
   gel-breaking performance, and sand-carrying performance. The degrees of
   core damage are evaluated through conducting coreflooding experiments,
   where the cores are treated with two kinds of gel-breaking fluids formed
   by hyperbranched-polymer fracturing fluid and guar fracturing fluid,
   respectively.
   Laboratory tests show that the hyperbranched-polymer fracturing fluid
   has good rheological characteristics, a high swelling ratio, a high
   proppant-carrying performance, and good thermal stability and shearing
   resistance. After being sheared for 90 minutes under 170 s(-1) at 150
   degrees C, it can still reverse to gel with high strength because of its
   good reversible-crosslinking performance. This fracturing fluid exhibits
   a high-salinity tolerance. Furthermore, the hyperbranched polymer has a
   high swelling ratio. Field applications in some wells in China show that
   the friction loss of this fracturing fluid during fracturing is
   approximately 30 to 50\% of that of the normal guar fracturing fluid.
   Thus, it has an ultralow frictionloss feature. As for the same
   reservoir, hyperbranched-polymer fracturing fluid has a higher flowback
   ratio compared with the guar fracturing fluid. Besides, its cost is
   approximately 75\% of that of normal guar fracturing fluid, making it a
   clean and cost-effective system. The fracturing fluid prepared with
   hyperbranched polymer possesses outstanding technical advantages and
   good cost effectiveness, implying a promising application in the
   large-scale fracturing stimulation of low-permeability heavy-oil
   reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of evaluating well productivity after hydraulic
   fracturing cannot be overemphasized. This has necessitated the
   improvement in the quality of rate and pressure measurements during
   flowback of multistage-fractured wells. Similarly, there have been
   corresponding improvements in the ability of existing transient models
   to interpret multiphase flowback data. However, the complexity of these
   models introduces high uncertainty in the estimates of resulting
   parameters, such as fracture pore volume (PV), half-length, and
   permeability. This paper proposes a twophase tank model for reducing
   parameter uncertainty and estimating fracture PV independent of fracture
   geometry.
   This study starts by use of rate-normalized-pressure (RNP) plots to
   observe changes in fluid-flow mechanisms from multistage- fractured
   wells. The fracture ``pressure-supercharge{''} observations form the
   basis for developing the proposed two-phase tank model. This model is a
   linear relationship between RNP and time, useful for interpreting
   flowback data in wells that show pseudosteady-state behavior (unit slope
   on log-log RNP plots). The linear relationship is implemented on a
   simple Monte Carlo spreadsheet. This is then used to estimate and
   conduct uncertainty analysis on effective fracture PV by use of
   probabilistic distributions of average fracture compressibility and
   gas/water saturations. Also, the proposed model investigates the
   contributions of various drive mechanisms during flowback (fracture
   closure, gas expansion, and water depletion) by use of quantitative
   drive indices similar to those used in conventional reservoir
   engineering.
   Application of the proposed tank model to flowback data from 15
   shale-gas and tight-oil wells estimates the effective fracture PV and
   initial average gas saturation in the active fracture network. The
   results show that fracture-PV estimation is most sensitive to fracture
   closure compared with gas expansion and water depletion, making fracture
   closure the primary drive mechanism during early-flowback periods. Also,
   the initial average gas saturation for all wells is less than 20\%. The
   parameters estimated from the proposed model could be used as input
   guides for morecomplex studies (such as discrete-fracture-network
   modeling and transient-flowback simulation). This reduces the number of
   unknown parameters and uncertainty in output results from complex
   models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents comprehensive rock/fluid experiments, by use of
   reservoir rock and fluids, to investigate wetting affinity of the
   Montney (MT) tight oil play in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.
   Wettability characterization is essential for selecting optimum
   fracturing and treatment fluids by completion engineers and for
   selecting appropriate relative permeability and capillary pressure
   curves by reservoir engineers. Application of the conventional
   techniques for wettability evaluation of tight rocks is challenging
   primarily because of their extremely low permeability and complex pore
   structure. The objective of this paper is to develop an alternative
   laboratory protocol for evaluating the wettability of tight oil rocks
   reliably.
   First, we conducted systematic spontaneous-imbibition tests on fresh
   core samples from two different wells drilled in the MT formation. We
   measured the air/brine, air/oil, and brine/oil contact angles for all
   samples. We used the end pieces of the samples to conduct scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM) and analysis of the elemental mapping, or
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Finally, we investigated the
   spontaneous imbibition of brine (or oil) into the samples partly
   saturated with oil (or brine). Both oil and brine spontaneously imbibe
   into the fresh samples, composed of quartz, carbonates
   (dolomite/calcite), clay minerals, feldspars, and organic matter. The
   results indicate that the effective pore network exhibits a mixed-wet
   behavior. Moreover, brine spontaneously imbibes into and forces the oil
   out of the oil-saturated samples, whereas oil cannot imbibe into the
   brine-saturated samples. This indicates that in the presence of both oil
   and brine, the rock affinity to brine is higher than that to oil.}},

Abstract = {{Foamy-oil flow is encountered not only during the primary stage of the
   cold-heavy-oil-production (CHOP) process through evolving methane
   originally in the oil but also in the post-CHOP enhanced-oil-recovery
   (EOR) applications in which different gases are injected and dissolved
   in heavy oil. Despite remarkable efforts on the physics of foamy oil
   flow, the mechanics of its flow through porous media is not properly
   understood yet. This is mainly because of lack of detailed experimental
   studies at the core scale to clarify the physics of the process and to
   support numerical- modeling studies. One also should test foamy-oil flow
   for different types of EOR gases dissolved and evolved at different
   conditions under pressure depletion.
   The objective of the present work is to perform detailed laboratory
   experiments on foamy-oil flow through porous media.
   Pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) studies were conducted to determine
   the actual pressure ranges in the coreflooding experiments in the
   beginning. After dissolving different gases in dead oil at 400 psi for
   methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and 112 psi for propane, the oil
   was injected into a sandpack to saturate it. The solution-gas-drive test
   was started by opening the outlet valve of the coreholder after reaching
   equilibrium. To mimic typical post-CHOP EOR conditions with methane,
   propane, or CO2 injection, the pressure was kept high (400 psi for CO2
   and CH4 and 112 psi for propane). The produced oil by solution-gas drive
   and the gas evolved were monitored by collecting them in a graduated
   cylinder and a gas cylinder, respectively, while the pressure was
   recorded by an automatic data-acquisition system. The experimental data
   provided information about the effect of initial pressure of the
   depletion test in the amount of oil and gas measured as well as the
   visual observations of bubble characteristics of the foamy oil. Results
   showed that, among the three gases, CO2 is a good candidate for foamy
   oil. Maximum oil recovery {[}more than 50\% of original oil in place
   (OIP) (OOIP)] was obtained in case of CO2.}},

Title = {{Solvent-Selection Criteria Based on Diffusion Rate and Mixing Quality
   for Steam/Solvent Applications in Heavy-Oil and Bitumen Recovery}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Heavy-oil and bitumen recovery requires high recovery factors to offset
   the extreme high cost of investments and operations. Attention has been
   given to solvent injection for this purpose, and it has been observed
   that high recoveries are achievable when it is combined with steam
   injection. Heavier ({''}liquid{''}) solvents (liquid at ambient
   conditions) are especially becoming more popular because of availability
   and transportation. High oil prices will allow the application of this
   kind of technique if a proper design is made to retrieve the injected
   solvent efficiently. ``Liquid{''}solvents are advantageous because they
   yield a better-quality mixing (especially with very heavy oils and
   bitumen) but a lower diffusion rate than lighter solvents such as
   propane or butane. Despite this understanding, there still is not a
   clear screening criterion for solvent selection to mitigate both
   diffusion rate and the quality of the mixture.
   In this study, two main solvent-selection-criteria parametersdiffusion
   rate and mixing quality-were considered to evaluate solvent-injection
   efficiency at different temperatures. An optical method under static
   conditions and image-processing techniques were proposed to determine 1D
   diffusivity of liquid solvent into a wide range of oil samples in a
   capillary tube. This sampling range varies from 40-cp oil to 250-cp oil,
   for which digital-image treatment was developed. X-ray computerized
   tomography (CT) was applied for heavier (and darker) oils (viscosity
   range of 20,000 cp to 400,000 cp). The diffusion coefficients were then
   computed through nonlinear curve fitting on the basis of an optimization
   algorithm to ensure that the obtained values were in agreement with
   available analytical solutions. Next, viscosity measurements and
   asphaltene precipitation for the same heavy-oil/solvent mixtures were
   performed to determine the mixing quality. The ideal solvent types for
   different oil types were determined by using the results from the
   diffusion-rate and mixing-quality experiments.
   The experimental and semianalytical outcome of this research would be
   useful in the determination of the best solvent type for a given oil and
   in understanding the key factors that influence the quality of mixtures
   including viscosity reduction and probable asphaltene precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Solvent injection is an effective way to lower the viscosity of heavy
   oil and is considered when thermal techniques are not practically
   applicable. However, for the economic success of the method, large
   fractions of the injected solvent must be recovered. This requires
   further treatments of the reservoir, including water injection with
   chemicals to penetrate into the oil-wet matrix by changing the
   wettability. In this paper, we investigate the effect of wettability
   alteration of the oil-wet rock on solvent as well as oil recovery.
   Different wettability-alteration agents were tested, including cationic
   and anionic surfactants, ionic liquids, nanofluids, high-pH solutions,
   and low-salinity water. The potential of these materials to modify the
   wettability of aged sandstone and limestone samples was evaluated by use
   of imbibition tests. After conducting a total of 35 experiments, the
   most-promising wettability- alteration agents were identified to be
   anionic surfactants and high-pH solutions in addition to low-salinity
   water for the sandstone cases. Ion-pair interaction in sandstone and the
   dissolution of mixed-wet clay particles in carbonate are the main
   mechanisms of wettability alteration by those chemicals. Cationic
   surfactants and high-pH solutions were identified as the best
   wettability modifiers for the limestone samples. Although cationic
   surfactant changes the wettability by the ion-pair-interaction
   mechanism, the pH solution is believed to restore the water-wetness by
   decreasing the attraction forces between calcite and organic components.
   Ionic liquid at low concentration is able to alter the wettability of
   carbonate better than other conventional wettability modifiers. One
   important finding of this work is that solvent injection in
   heavy-oil-containing reservoirs is essential to condition the reservoir
   (i. e., to dilute the heavy oil before any wettability-alteration
   treatment can take place).}},

Abstract = {{Implicit solvent methods for classical molecular modeling are frequently
   used to provide fast, physics-based hydration free energies of
   macromolecules. Less commonly considered is the transferability of these
   methods to other solvents. The Statistical Assessment of Modeling of
   Proteins and Ligands 5 (SAMPL5) distribution coefficient dataset and the
   accompanying explicit solvent partition coefficient reference
   calculations provide a direct test of solvent model transferability.
   Here we use the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM)
   statistical-mechanical solvation theory, with a well tested water model
   and a new united atom cyclohexane model, to calculate partition
   coefficients for the SAMPL5 dataset. The cyclohexane model performed
   well in training and testing ( for amino acid neutral side chain
   analogues) but only if a parameterized solvation free energy correction
   was used. In contrast, the same protocol, using single solute
   conformations, performed poorly on the SAMPL5 dataset, obtaining
   compared to the reference partition coefficients, likely due to the much
   larger solute sizes. Including solute conformational sampling through
   molecular dynamics coupled with 3D-RISM (MD/3D-RISM) improved agreement
   with the reference calculation to . Since our initial calculations only
   considered partition coefficients and not distribution coefficients,
   solute sampling provided little benefit comparing against experiment,
   where ionized and tautomer states are more important. Applying a simple
   correction improved agreement with experiment from to , despite a small
   number of outliers. Better agreement is possible by accounting for
   tautomers and improving the ionization correction.}},

Abstract = {{The information extracted from monitoring of rotary blasthole drills
   helps to optimize the overall mining operation. Rock hardness,
   drillability, blastability and specific energy of drilling are examples
   of parameters that have been estimated in the past using measurement

   measurement while drilling techniques, it is important to properly
   collect, analyze and interpret extracted data. This paper deals with
   processing of measurement while drilling data such as rate of
   penetration, rotary speed, rotary torque and pulldown force collected
   from rotary blasthole drills. Different methods are discussed to
   calculate a true rate of penetration which is the most important
   monitored drill variable for use in rock mass characterization. Then
   specific energy of drilling is defined and calculated based on
   electrical and mechanical inputs and the results are compared. The
   results show that specific energy of drilling can be estimated using the
   drill's primary drive systems' electrical responses with good accuracy

Abstract = {{Near-surface deposits that extend to considerable depths are often
   amenable to both open pit mining and/or underground mining. This paper
   investigates the strategy of mining options for an orebody using a Mixed

   formulation maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of the reserve when
   extracted with (i) open pit mining, (ii) underground mining, and (iii)
   concurrent open pit and underground mining. Comparatively, implementing
   open pit mining generates a higher NPV than underground mining. However
   considering the investment required for these mining options,
   underground mining generates a better return on investment than open pit
   mining. Also, in the concurrent open pit and underground mining
   scenario, the optimizer prefers extracting blocks using open pit mining.
   Although the underground mine could access ore sooner, the mining cost
   differential for open pit mining is more than compensated for by the
   discounting benefits associated with earlier underground mining. (C)

Abstract = {{Reliability is an important feature in the design and maintenance of a
   large-scale network. In this article, the reliability of information
   transmission between a transmitter and a receiver (i.e., a two-terminal
   network) is considered as a generalized connectivity framework of
   terminal nodes. As network complexity increases, existing approaches to
   reliability analysis are encountering significant challenges. In this
   article, stochastic computational models are presented to efficiently
   analyze the reliability and criticality of a two-terminal network.
   Non-Bernoulli sequences with fixed numbers of 1s and 0s are utilized to
   encode the signal probabilities, and improve computational efficiency
   and accuracy. Both unidirectional and bidirectional links are considered
   for the probabilistic information transition process by imperfect links.
   Imperfect nodes are also modeled by the stochastic model of an imperfect
   unidirectional link. Non-exponential failure distributions and
   correlated signals in a two-terminal network are readily handled by the
   stochastic approach. The reliability of a system with external
   deterministic failures on a link is compared to that of the system prior
   to the occurrence of the failures. The difference in reliability is
   referred to as the criticality of the link. An analysis is pursued for
   the critical links based on the value of criticality. The proposed
   approach can be used to analyze and improve network reliability when
   utilizing limited redundancy for protecting the links.}},

Journal = {{POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The development of stimuli responsive polymers has progressed
   significantly with novel preparation techniques, which has allowed
   access to new materials with unique properties. Dual thermoresponsive
   (double temperature responsive) block copolymers are particularly of
   interest as their properties can change depending on the lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST) or upper critical solution temperature
   (UCST) of each segment. For instance, these block copolymers can change
   from being hydrophilic, to amphiphilic or to hydrophobic simply by
   changing the solution temperature without any additional chemicals and
   the block copolymers can change from being fully solubilized to
   self-assembled structures to macroscopic aggregation/precipitation.
   Based on the unique solution properties, these dual thermo-responsive
   block copolymers are expected to be suitable for biomedical
   applications. This review is divided into three parts; LCST-LCST types
   of block copolymers, UCST-LCST types of block copolymers, and their
   potential as biomedical applications.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{193-206}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Environmentally-powered wireless sensors use ambient energy from their
   environment to support their own energy needs. As such, they must
   operate without significant maintenance or user supervision. Due to the
   stochastic availability of ambient energy, its harvesting, storage and
   consumption must be managed by an efficient and robust controller that
   maintains data collection and transmission rates at desired levels,
   while maximizing the useful operational time of the system. To
   accomplish this task, the control system must observe the state of
   charge of an internal energy storage device, and consider the amount of
   energy available for harvest in the future. At the same time, the
   complexity of the controller must be limited so that it can be
   implemented on the simple embedded system of the sensor hardware. This
   paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of desired behavior of such
   controllers, and describes procedures for their design and optimization
   through an evolutionary fuzzy approach. The main contribution is the
   formalization of design objectives and development of the fitness
   function that drives the optimization process. Additional contributions
   include a comprehensive evaluation of several soft computing
   optimization approaches, thorough analysis of the optimized controller,
   its comparison to baseline control strategies, and validation of its
   operation with real energy availability forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{An area-based shape distance measure of time series}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{650-659}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{For any two one-dimensional time series of equal or non-equal length, we
   propose a new method to determine their shape distance. Each of the
   original time series is represented by a sequence of linear segments
   which are produced by l trend filtering. As the dimensionality of this
   representation ranges between time series, dynamic time warping (DTW)
   method is used to calculate the distance between time series. In
   contrast to the standard dynamic time warping method, here the element
   of the new distance matrix concerns the distance between two linear
   segments instead of two elements of the original time series. More
   specifically, the distance between the two linear segments is calculated
   as the area of a triangle which is formed by the two linear segments
   after their translation and connection. In brief, the new measure can be
   regarded as the dynamic time warping distance computed in a piecewise
   linear space. Furthermore, we show that new distance measure
   quantitatively reflects the shape's difference between two
   one-dimensional time series. The simulation experiments presented in
   this paper illustrate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an automated method to reconstruct the
   three-dimensional (3-D) needle shape during needle insertion procedures
   using only 2-D transverse ultrasound (US) images. Using a set of
   transverse US images, image processing and random sample consensus are
   used to locate the needle within each image and estimate the needle
   shape. The method is validated with an in vitro needle insertion setup
   and a transparent tissue phantom, where two orthogonal cameras are used
   to capture the true 3-D needle shape for verification. Results showed
   that the use of at least three images obtained at 75\% of the maximum
   insertion depth or greater allows for maximum needle shape estimation
   errors of less than 2 mm. In addition, the needle shape can be
   calculated consistently as long as the needle can be identified in 30\%
   of the transverse US images obtained. Application to permanent prostate
   brachytherapy is also presented, where the estimated needle shape is
   compared to manual segmentation and sagittal US images. Our method is
   intended to help to assess needle placement during manual or
   robot-assisted needle insertion procedures after the needle has been

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Time series modeling has great potential as a tool for damage detection.
   However, there are still a number of issues that need to be addressed
   before it can be effectively used for damage detection in the context of
   structural health monitoring (SHM). This paper presents a novel time
   series method directly derived from equation of motion (EOM) for damage
   detection. One of the unique advantages of the proposed method is that
   the order of the time series model is determined from the EOM, and thus,
   it is fixed, which could facilitate an easier automation and improve the
   computational efficiency. For the proposed method, fixed-order time
   series models are created for different sensor clusters using the output
   only vibration data from baseline and unknown states of the structure.
   Then, two different damage features (DFs) are developed from these
   models to identify the existence and location of the damage. To verify
   this method, an experimental steel grid structure with different damage
   cases applied is utilized. Two different DFs using fit ratios and
   coefficients are used to detect damage, and the results are compared. It
   is shown that the proposed method could identify the existence and
   location of damage and assess the relative severity successfully in most
   cases using either fit ratios or coefficients as DFs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the channel selection and slot time
   configuration in a cognitive radio network with a number of potential
   channels. Each channel alternates between ON state (i.e., the primary
   user is using the channel) and OFF state (i.e., the primary user does
   not use the channel), and the state evolution process is modeled as a
   continuous-time Markov process. The traffic parameters (the transition
   rates) of the Markov process also evolve with time, modeled as a
   discrete-time Markov process. A secondary user adopts a slotted
   structure with dynamic slot length. At each slot, the secondary user
   needs to determine which channel to sense and, if the channel is sensed
   idle, how long the slot length should be. Considering both the amount of
   data that the secondary user can transmit and the duration when the
   secondary user interferes with primary activities, a reward definition
   is given. Based on the reward definition, an adaptive channel selection
   and slot length configuration method is proposed, which includes a
   reward maximization procedure to maximize the achieved reward and an
   update procedure for the channel state belief vector and traffic
   parameter state belief vector. Numerical results are given to
   demonstrate the effectiveness and features of the proposed method.

Abstract = {{Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) are renewable, sustainable, and non-toxic
   nanomaterials with high surface area, low density, and strength
   properties several times higher than many metals and polymers. Cellulose
   nanocrystals, however, are polar and hard to disperse in nonpolar
   polymers such as polyethylene. Considering that polyethylene is one of
   the most important commodity polymers today, a significant sector of the
   polymer market has not benefited yet from the remarkable properties of
   CNCs. In this article we present a novel method to overcome this
   difficulty. Our approach was to modify the surface of CNCs with
   bifunctional organic molecules having terminal vinyl groups that
   copolymerize, in-situ, with ethylene using a constrained geometry
   catalyst. These hybrid materials compatibilize the hydrophilic CNC and
   the hydrophobic polyolefin phases, leading to good dispersion of the CNC
   phase in the polyethylene matrix.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the oil extraction efficiency using Moringa oleifera
   seed and pressurized propane, new experimental data for phase transition
   of the binary system \{n-propane+Moringa oleifera oil\}, and the profile
   of fatty acid compositions of the extracted Moringa oil. During the
   present study, the knowledge of the phase behaviour proved to be of
   great importance to optimize supercritical extraction using pressurized
   fluid. This project also compares the classical Soxhlet method including
   mathematical modelling of kinetic curves of extraction. The extraction
   experiments were performed in the temperature and pressure ranges of
   303-333K and 2.5-12MPa, respectively, at a constant flow rate of
   1.0cm(3)/min of n-propane. All the conditions applied during the
   n-propane extraction process provided similar or higher yields (32.8 to
   42.1\%) compared to extractions using n-hexane (42.6\%) and
   supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) (37.8\%). In addition, phase
   transition study for the \{Propane (1)+Moringa oleifera oil (2)\} system
   was performed using a variable volume cell and the static synthetic
   method in a temperature range of 303-343K, pressures up to 3.23MPa, and
   n-propane mass fraction between 0.2 and 0.8. Vapour-liquid (VLE),
   liquid-liquid (LLE), and vapour-liquid-liquid (VLLE) phase transitions
   were observed at relatively low pressures. The fatty acid profiles of
   the extracted Moringa oils were evaluated using gas chromatography. They
   all have very close composition regardless of the solvent used and oleic
   acid as the major component (approximate to 76\%). The Sovova
   mathematical model indicated a good fit for all the conditions
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Disk membranes generated from high-purity natural clinoptilolite mineral
   rock have shown promising hydrogen separation performance. To scale up
   production of these types of membranes for industrial gas separation, a
   coating strategy was devised. A mixture of natural clinoptilolite and
   aluminum silicate was deposited on the inner surface of porous stainless
   steel tubes by the slip casting technique. Phase composition and
   morphology of the coating materials were investigated using X-ray
   diffraction. The performance was evaluated for a range of gases using
   single gas permeation tests at different temperatures and pressures.
   Introduction of the second layer significantly improved the performance
   of the membrane system. The experiments on the double-layered membranes
   measured a hydrogen permeance of 1.65x10(-7)molm(-2)s(-1)Pa(-1) at 300
   degrees C. H-2/CO2 and H-2/C2H6 single gas selectivity was 10.2 and 8.45
   respectively at 25 degrees C and feed pressure of 110kPa. These results

Pages = {{8941-8951}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of bitumen with ozone should in principle lead to
   oxidative degradation, as opposed to the increase in viscosity found
   during the reaction with oxygen because ozonation can lead to C=C
   scission by ozonolysis. However, when bitumen was reacted with ozonated
   air at 140-160 degrees C, the viscosity increased compared to conversion
   with air under the same conditions. To explain these observations, the
   ozonation of model compounds of various hydrocarbon and heterocyclic
   compound classes was studied. The selectivity and nature of the
   oxidation products from ozonation were different from that of
   autoxidation. Ozonolysis that led to the ring opening of aromatics was
   observed. At low conversion (<10\%), the addition product selectivity of
   the five -membered cyclic hydrocarbons, indane and indene, was less
   after reaction with ozonated air than with air. It appears that the
   observed increase in bitumen viscosity was due to the increased free
   radical addition product selectivity of heterocyclic compounds, which
   was higher after reaction with ozonated air than with air. It was also
   found that at higher conversion (>10\%), the increase in oxidized
   material caused a dramatic increase in addition product selectivity
   during ozonation. A plausible reaction pathway for addition product
   formation was proposed on the basis of the Criegee mechanism. The nature
   of unique addition products from ozonation that were not observed after
   autoxidation could be explained in terms of the decomposition of the
   ozonide and recombination of the free radical fragments.}},

Title = {{Laboratory Measurements and Numerical Simulation of Cyclic Solvent
   Stimulation with a Thermally Aided Solvent Retrieval Phase in the
   Presence of Wormholes after Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an experimental setup consisting of a sand pack with
   different configurations of complexity of wormhole patterns was
   designed. These different configurations have the same wormhole coverage
   index (WCI) determined by our earlier field-scale history match studies.
   After saturation of the model with heavy oil, three different solvents
   (CO2, heptane, and diluents) were introduced into the wormhole structure
   inside the sand pack (injection phase) and then left for a period of
   time (soaking phase). Next, the resulted mixture (solvent and oil) was
   allowed to be produced (production phase). The experiment was aimed to
   mimic cyclic solvent stimulation at reservoir conditions, and several
   cycles were run for each experiment. At each cycle, the amount of
   collected oil and solvent was determined, and the resulting mixture was
   analyzed through gas chromatography and refractometry. It was observed
   that some of the injected solvent was trapped inside the sand pack.
   Therefore, in the final step, a solvent retrieval attempt was made by
   injecting different low-temperature hot water based on the solvent type.
   The aim was to observe how much additional solvent could be retrieved
   from the sand pack at reservoir conditions. Next, the sand-pack
   experiments were numerically simulated, and effective diffusion
   coefficients were obtained through history matching. To generate
   accurate predictions in field-scale simulation, an upscaling procedure
   from laboratory results of the cyclic solvent injection process was
   suggested. In this study, we observed that the use of light solvents
   (CO2) could maintain the sand-pack pressure for a longer period
   (attributed to foamy oil phenomenon) compared to liquid solvent during
   the production phase. However, the oil recovery from sole application of
   light solvent was not as considerable as with the heavier solvents of
   heptane and diluents. These observations suggest that an improved heavy
   oil recovery could be achieved using a hybrid application of solvents
   and hot water in cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) reservoirs.
   A post-flush hot water was found to play a positive role in solvent
   retrieval; however, the scale dependency of solvent retrieval behavior
   needs to be investigated. The findings of this paper can be used in a
   later study to optimize the field-scale solvent injection schemes
   considering the economics of the process tested.}},

Abstract = {{Mixing conditions were explored as a possible avenue for improvement of
   demulsifier performance in the solvent diluted bitumen dewatering
   process. The effects of demulsifier bulk concentration, demulsifier
   injection concentration, and mixing energy on water and solids removal

   in a confined impeller stirred tank, which provides well-characterized
   mixing conditions and relatively uniform flow and turbulence. Results
   showed that lowering the injection concentration and increasing the
   mixing energy both improve demulsifier performance, allowing a 50\% drop
   in the bulk concentration of demulsifier. This result agrees well with
   an earlier study by Laplante et al.(1) in which a different demulsifier
   was investigated. In that study, it was shown that the product of mixing
   time and energy dissipation rate at the feed point (the mixing energy =
   J) provides an alternate mixing variable.}},

Abstract = {{High reliability and low latency are critical performance targets in the
   fifth-generation cellular networks. How does a full-duplex
   decode-forward relay fare in this context? To answer this question, we
   analyze the outage and (average) decoding-delay for both joint and
   sequential sliding window decoding. For comparison, we also analyze
   decoding delay of backward decoding and consider its existing outage
   analysis. In our analysis, we consider a block fading channel with full
   channel state information (CSI) availability at receivers and with
   limited CSI at transmitters and outage events at both relay and
   destination and channel variation over different blocks in sliding
   window decoding. Moreover, by analyzing the asymptotic performance at
   high SNR, we prove that both joint and sequential decoding achieve a
   full diversity order of two and derive the coding gain gaps between
   backward decoding and joint and sequential sliding window decoding. To
   see the benefits of full-duplex relaying, we also include the
   performance of half-duplex schemes and conclude that the preferred
   scheme depends on the rate, outage, and delay requirements for a
   specific service.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient backscatter technology that utilizes the ambient radio frequency
   signals to enable the communications of battery-free devices has
   attracted much attention recently. In this paper, we study the problem
   of signal detection for an ambient backscatter communication system that
   adopts the differential encoding to eliminate the necessity of channel
   estimation. Specifically, we formulate a new transmission model, design
   the data detection algorithm, and derive two closed-form detection
   thresholds. One threshold is used to approximately achieve the minimum
   sum bit error rate (BER), while the other yields balanced error
   probabilities for ``0{''} bit and ``1{''} bit. The corresponding BER
   expressions are derived to fully characterize the detection performance.
   In addition, the lower and the upper bounds of BER at high
   signal-to-noise ratio regions are also examined to simplify a
   performance analysis. Simulation results are then provided to
   corroborate the theoretical studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a precise comprehensive analysis of the
   aggregate interference I generated from an underlay network of cognitive
   radio ( CR) nodes employing several transmit power control and receiver
   association schemes. Importantly, we consider spatial randomness by
   modeling CR transmitter nodes and receiver nodes as two independent
   Poisson point processes ( PPPs). For the cognitive nodes, we investigate
   receiver association based on the distance or the instantaneous received
   power and power control based on the maximum possible
   transmitter-receiver distance, fixed or location-dependent cutoff power
   levels, feedback from the primary system, or the maximum number of
   available receivers. For each of these schemes, the exact moment
   generating function ( mgf) and mean of aggregate I power are derived for
   links with Rayleigh fading and exponential path loss. The resulting
   primary outage and the probability of secondary transmitter cutoff are
   also derived. Numerical results show that the secondary power thresholds
   and node densities significantly affect the aggregate I, the primary
   receiver ( PR) outage, and the secondary transmitter cutoff arising from
   the different schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The miniaturization of microwave and millimeterwave components is
   necessary to meet demand for increasingly smaller integrated circuits.
   This paper explores the technique of capacitively loading the open side
   of a half-mode substrate-integrated waveguide (HMSIW) with a continuous
   ridge in order to lower the first-mode cutoff frequency and allow for
   substantial miniaturization. The full analytical calculation for the
   design of the first-mode cutoff frequency is presented, along with the
   extraction of the complex propagation constant and the analysis of the
   tradeoff between radiation and conductor losses. A comparison between
   the performance of the ridged HMSIW (RHMSIW) and HMSIW is simulated and
   measured, where the insertion loss of the RHMSIW is shown to be lower
   for frequencies up to 1.45 times the cutoff frequency f(c), with a total
   width approximately 0.45 times the width of the HMSIW. The near-field
   radiation pattern is also measured, clearly illustrating the reduced
   radiation loss of the RHMSIW. A 3-dB coupler using the RHMSIW technology
   is designed, fabricated, and measured. The RHMSIW coupler's performance
   is shown to be comparable to similar HMSIW and SIW designs in the
   literature, but with substantially improved miniaturization. The
   isolation of two parallel RHMSIWs in different configurations is also
   studied and compared with the HMSIW for use in applications requiring
   high-density routing or interconnection. It is shown that the capacitive
   ridge helps to reduce the crosstalk between neighboring transmission
   lines, allowing for the possibility of greater circuit densities, and
   further improving the miniaturization of microwave systems using the
   RHMSIW technology. To the best of our knowledge, the RHMSIW is the
   smallest waveguide-based transmission line with respect to wavelength
   presently in the literature.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{56-67}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a model for the investigation of sandstone
   degradation and sand production mechanisms coupled with fluid flow
   analysis using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The model was used to
   investigate the effects of in-situ stresses and flow rate on sand
   production.
   We developed a linked DEM-fluid flow model for sanding analysis. The
   model calculates seepage forces and applies them on solid particles in
   the DEM model. The model accounts for permeability and porosity changes
   due to sandstone deformation and sand production. The DEM model was
   verified against poro-elastoplastic analytical solutions. Subsequently,
   the model was used for sanding simulation from a block-shaped sample
   under different far-field stress and pressure conditions. The boundary
   stresses and fluid pressures were varied to study their influence on
   sandstone degradation and sand production.
   The creation of a borehole in a solid block resulted in the development
   of uniform or V-shape breakouts around the borehole. The failure zone
   around the borehole expanded after the application of fluid flow and
   sand grain detachments. Fluid flow was observed to influence the size
   and mode of failure in the breakout zone and sand production. Boundary
   stress dominated the sanding response at higher boundary stress
   conditions. However, much lower sanding occurred under higher boundary
   stresses but low boundary fluid pressures. High tangential stresses
   around the borehole caused by high confining stress resulted in strong
   frictional interlocking that alleviated sand production. Massive sanding
   was observed at lower far-field stress but higher boundary pore
   pressure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{80-89}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Existing fatigued driving analysis methods mainly focus on lateral
   driving performance by using the measurements related to the steering
   wheel or lane position. There is a lack of research on longitudinal car
   following behavior. In this study, 40 professional drivers are invited
   to participate in field expressway driving experiment, lasting at least
   for 6 h. During the test, their performance is measured in terms of
   their self-reported fatigued driving level according to the Karolinska
   Sleepiness Scale (KSS), the PERcentage of eye CLOSures (PERCLOS) and the
   Time Headway (THW). Then the effects of the fatigued driving level on
   car following behavior are evaluated. The results indicate that the
   fatigue level (for both KSS and PERCLOS) has significantly impact on THW
   parameters, including the mean, standard deviation and minimum THW. An
   increase in KSS and PERCLOS leads to a lower mean and minimum THW.
   Meanwhile, the standard deviation of THW increases with the increase of
   KSS and PERCLOS. In conclusion, this study found that a higher fatigue
   level leads to the driver keeping a smaller THW when following another
   vehicle and choosing shorter THW to make lane change. More deviation of
   car following performance was also found with the increase of fatigue
   level. Therefore, the findings of this study can be used to explain
   fatigue as one of the major reasons for rear-end collisions. Also, the
   research findings demonstrate the impact of fatigue on driving behavior
   in terms of car following performance, which can be used as a
   measurement for monitoring fatigued drivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Purpose: Indices from 3-D ultrasound may have a role in developmental
   dysplasia of the hip (DDH) assessment, but require a way to determine
   spatial orientation relative to body axes. The lateral iliac wall angle
   is a potentially suitable reference axis in 3-D ultrasound. We sought to
   quantify normal values and variations of the infant iliac wall angle on
   radiography, and compare with computed tomography (CT).
   Methods: Acetabular and lateral iliac angles were measured on frontal
   pelvic radiographs of 200 patients (400 hips, 183 with DDH) and coronal
   CT of 20 patients (40 hips) aged 0-12 months. Relationships among
   morphologic indices and demographics were assessed using linear
   regression, Welch's t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and
   coefficients of variance (CoV). Reliability was assessed using
   intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC).
   Results: The radiographic iliac angle averaged 53.0 degrees +/- 7.7
   degrees (mean +/- standard deviation; 95\% CI, 38 degrees-68 degrees) in
   DDH vs. 56.2 degrees +/- 6.7 degrees (95\% CI, 43 degrees-69 degrees) in
   normal hips (p<0.001), correlated weakly with age (r = 0.25), and showed
   no inter-sex differences (p = 0.79). Inter-reader and intra-reader
   reliability were ICC = 0.946 and 0.965. CT iliac angle had mean
   difference 5.8 degrees +/- 6.2 degrees (p<0.01), CoV = 10\% and r = 0.68
   vs. corresponding radiographs.
   Conclusions: The radiographic infant lateral iliac wall angle has mean
   value 53-56 degrees in dysplastic and normal hips with consistent range
   of variation approximately +/- 15 degrees, was measured with high
   reliability, does not differ by sex, and is only slightly lower in the
   youngest infants. The iliac wall angle is an unbiased reference axis
   that may be suitable to establish general spatial orientation of 3-D hip
   ultrasound images.}},

   terminations through a passivity observer and a passivity controller at
   the environment termination. The teleoperation controllers are then
   simply constrained by Llewellyn's absolute stability criterion for

Abstract = {{To enable scalable MOSFET technology in III-V semiconductor platforms,
   high quality semiconductor-oxide interfaces are essential. In this
   paper, a novel low-temperature plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition
   (PEALD) technique was applied to deposit nanoscale high-k dielectrics on
   several III-V substrates, including InP, GaAs, InAs, and GaN.
   Approximately 7 nm of ZrO2 was grown and patterned to form MOSCAP
   structures, which were subsequently analyzed through electrical
   characterization to evaluate dielectric and interface quality. The oxide
   films fabricated were found to have interface trap densities ranging
   from 10(10) - 10(13) eV(-1) cm(-2), and showed high capacitance
   densities (similar to 2.5 mu F/cm(2)). GaN and InP MOSCAPs with ZrO2
   dielectric layers were found to have gate currents in line with direct
   tunneling phenomena and MOS mobilities approaching that of doped bulk
   semiconductors. Scaled InP MOSFET devices using these experimental
   values were also simulated using an optimized device structure.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of microstructure and material properties on the mechanical
   behavior of hot-pressed boron carbide are presented. The microstructure
   and intrinsic microstructural inhomogeneities have been characterized
   using scanning electron microscopy characterization techniques
   (SEM/EDS/EBSD). In situ mechanical characterizations of the boron
   carbide microstructure and its larger inhomogeneities have been
   performed by nanoindentation. Macroscopic dynamic and quasi-static
   compressive responses have been studied in two characteristic
   orientations (parallel and perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction)
   using a modified compression Kolsky bar setup (strain rates of 10(2) -
   10(3)/s). The microstructure characterization showed that boron carbide
   has a fine-grained microstructure with a complex superposition of
   nonmetallic inclusions, such as free carbon, AlN, and BN.
   Nanoindentation tests conducted in three principal planes of the plate
   revealed an anisotropy of the mechanical properties. The compression
   tests revealed that the strength of this hot-pressed boron carbide is
   orientation dependent. Detailed SEM analysis indicated transgranular
   fracture and microcracking originating at large carbon inclusions.
   Influences of microstructural anisotropy on the mechanical response of
   the material are discussed.}},

Pages = {{35-45}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the minimum variance (MV) benchmark
   estimation without a prior knowledge of time-delay. The idea is to use a
   small high-frequency test signal in order to obtain the accurate
   time-delay estimation (TDE) result, then the MV benchmark can be
   calculated from the closed-loop data. Based on the analysis, a well
   designed test signal for control performance monitoring (CPM) is not
   only possible but also necessary, as it increases the identifiability of
   the closed-loop data without having a large effect on routine operation.
   A new TDE algorithm by using high-order auto regressive exogenous (ARX)
   model is proposed as well as the multivariable issue is investigated.
   Simulation examples of performance monitoring with low signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{98-110}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In heavy-duty diesel exhaust systems, selective catalytic reduction
   (SCR) is used to reduce NOx to nitrogen to meet environmental
   regulations. Diesel exhaust after-treatment involves a set of components
   that are best characterized as distributed parameter systems. Thus, the
   optimal ammonia dosage in the SCR is an important and challenging
   problem in diesel exhaust treatment. In this work, we propose a method
   to synthesize an optimal controller for the SCR section of the diesel
   exhaust after-treatment system, which is based on a system model
   consisting of coupled hyperbolic and parabolic partial differential
   equations (PDEs). This results in a boundary control problem; where the
   control objectives are to reduce the amount of NOx emissions and ammonia
   slip to the fullest extent possible using the inlet concentration of
   ammonia as the manipulated variable and assuming that the concentrations
   of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide and ammonia, are measured at the
   SCR inlet and outlet. The proposed method combines the method of
   characteristics, spectral decomposition and the model predictive control
   (MPC) approach. For performance comparison purposes, the open-loop
   dynamic optimization problem is solved via Direct transcription (DT) to
   compute the upper performance limit for the optimal SCR problem. The
   results show that the proposed approach is able to achieve a very high
   level of control performance in terms of NO and ammonia slip reduction.

Abstract = {{The interactions between air bubbles and hydrophobic polymer surfaces in
   aqueous media play important roles in many industrial and engineering
   processes. In this work, the interaction forces between air bubble and a
   model hydrophobic polymer-polystyrene (PS) in NaCl solutions (1 mM to
   1000 mM) were directly measured using a bubble probe atomic force
   microscope (AFM) technique, and the measured forces were analyzed by a
   theoretical model based on Reynolds lubrication theory and augmented
   Young-Laplace equation including the influence of disjoining pressure.
   It was found that the theoretical analysis, by assuming that the PS
   surface was a pristine and bare polymer surface in aqueous solutions,
   could not fully agree with the experimental force measurements at
   intermedium salinity condition (i.e., 100 mM NaCl), and the discrepancy
   could not be described by the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek
   (DLVO) theory even including the effects of non-DLVO interactions such
   as hydrophobic interaction. Atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging
   demonstrated that the above discrepancy was caused by the presence of
   interfacial nanobubbles (INBs) on the hydrophobic PS surface. The
   solution salinity was found to significantly affect the size and surface
   coverage of INBs on the PS surface, thereby influencing the surface
   forces. At high NaCl concentration (e.g., 500 and 1000 mM), the INB
   formation (and its impact on the surface interactions) and electric
   double layer repulsion were highly suppressed, and the bubble-PS
   attachment was observed attributing to their hydrophobic attraction with
   a decay length of similar to 0.75 +/- 0.05 nm. The results agree with
   our previous surface force measurements between two PS surfaces using a
   surface forces apparatus. This work provides useful insights into the
   interaction mechanism between air bubbles and hydrophobic polymer
   surfaces, as well as the influence of solution salinity and interfacial
   nanobubbles on the bubble-polymer interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the microwettability of anisotropic molybdenum disulfide
   crystal is critically important in separation and processing of this
   material in liquid. In this work, static microwetting properties of MoS2
   face (MF) and MoS2 edge (ME) surfaces in water are revealed by the
   morphology of femtoliter interfacial droplets. The oil droplets with
   different size distribution were produced from heterogeneous nucleation
   and growth of nanodroplets during the solvent exchange under controlled
   flow and solution conditions, and were polymerized for droplet
   morphology characterization to reveal the relative wettability of the
   droplets on surfaces. We first demonstrate that the shape of the
   nanodroplets is responsive to the surface charges on a model pH
   sensitive substrate of gold coated with a self-assembled monolayer of
   two types of thiol. The experimental results on MoS2 substrates indicate
   that (1) oil contact angle of the droplets on ME surface is much larger
   than that on MF surface at pH 3.0, suggesting that the ME surface is
   more hydrophilic than MF; (2) the droplets are pinned by the layered

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic stability of surface
   nanobubbles. The appropriate free energy is defined for the system of
   nanobubbles on a solid surface submerged in a supersaturated liquid
   solution at constant pressure and temperature, under conditions where an
   individual nanobubble is not in diffusive contact with a gas phase
   outside of the system or with other nanobubbles on the time scale of the
   experiment. The conditions under which plots of free energy versus the
   radius of curvature of the nanobubbles show a global minimum, which
   denotes the stable equilibrium state, are explored. Our investigation
   shows that supersaturation and an anomalously high contact angle
   (measured through the liquid) are required to have stable surface
   nanobubbles. In addition, the anomalously high contact angle of surface
   nanobubbles is discussed from the standpoint of a framework recently
   proposed by Koch, Amirfazli, and Elliott that relates advancing and
   receding contact angles to thermodynamic equilibrium contact angles,
   combined with the existence of a gas enrichment layer.}},

Abstract = {{Surface texturing-plasma nitriding duplex treatment was conducted on
   AISI 316 stainless steel to improve its tribological performance.
   Tribological behaviors of ground 316 substrates, plasma-nitrided 316
   (PN-316), surface-textured 316 (ST-316), and duplex-treated 316 (DT-316)
   in air and under grease lubrication were investigated using a
   pin-on-disc rotary tribometer against counterparts of high carbon
   chromium bearing steel GCr15 and silicon nitride Si3N4 balls. The
   variations in friction coefficient, mass loss, and worn trace morphology
   of the tested samples were systemically investigated and analyzed. The
   results showed that a textured surface was formed on 316 after
   electrochemical processing in a 15 wt \% NaCl solution. Grooves and
   dimples were found on the textured surface. As plasma nitriding was
   conducted on a 316 substrate and ST-316, continuous and uniform
   nitriding layers were successfully fabricated on the surfaces of the 316
   substrate and ST-316. Both of the obtained nitriding layers presented
   thickness values of more than 30 mu m. The nitriding layers were
   composed of iron nitrides and chromium nitride. The 316 substrate and
   ST-316 received improved surface hardness after plasma nitriding. When
   the tribological tests were carried out under dry sliding and grease
   lubrication conditions, the tested samples showed different tribological
   behaviors. As expected, the DT-316 samples revealed the most promising
   tribological properties, reflected by the lowest mass loss and worn
   morphologies. The DT-316 received the slightest damage, and its
   excellent tribological performance was attributed to the following
   aspects: firstly, the nitriding layer had high surface hardness;
   secondly, the surface texture was able to capture wear debris, store up
   grease, and then provide continuous lubrication.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the muscle response to functional electrical stimulation (FES)
   is an essential step in the design of closed-loop controlled
   neuroprostheses. This study was aimed at identifying the dynamic
   response of ankle plantar-flexors to FES during quiet standing. Thirteen
   healthy subjects stood in a standing frame that locked the knee and hip
   joints. The ankle plantar-flexors were stimulated bilaterally through
   surface electrodes and the generated ankle torque was measured. The
   pulse amplitude was sinusoidally modulated at five different
   frequencies. The pulse amplitude and the measured ankle torque fitted by
   a sine function were considered as input and output, respectively.
   First-order and critically-damped second order linear models were fitted
   to the experimental data. Both models fitted similarly well to the
   experimental data. The coefficient of variation of the time constant
   among subjects was smaller in the case of the second-order model
   compared to the first-order model (18.1\% vs. 79.9\%, p < 0.001). We
   concluded that the critically-damped second-order model more
   consistently described the relationship between isometric ankle torque
   and surface FES pulse amplitude, which was applied to the ankle
   plantar-flexors during quiet standing. (C) 2016 IPEM. Published by

   internal hydrostatic stress in an elastic plane subjected to uniform
   remote in-plane loading. The method is based on two particular conformal
   mappings which lead to a system of nonlinear equations from which the
   inclusion shapes are determined. We illustrate our results with several
   examples. In particular, we show that the ratio of the inclusion size to
   the period of the inclusion-matrix system changes with the inclusion
   aspect ratio and, in the specific case of uniform remote shear loading,
   the orientation of the inclusions is also altered. Finally, we show that
   if the period of the inclusion-matrix system exceeds roughly six times
   the inclusion size, such periodic inclusions can be treated
   approximately as periodic elliptical inclusions with specific aspect
   ratio and orientation determined by the corresponding elastic constants
   and uniform remote loading. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA,

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A trilateral teleoperation system facilitates the collaboration of two
   users to share control of a single robot in a remote environment. While
   various applications of shared-control trilateral haptic teleoperation
   systems have recently emerged, they have mostly been studied in the
   context of single-DOF, LTI robotic systems. On the other hand, robotic
   manipulators with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) and therefore
   nonlinear dynamics have recently found many applications such as in
   robotic-assisted surgery and therapy, space exploration and navigation
   systems. In this paper, considering the full nonlinear dynamical models
   of multi-DOF robots, stability analysis of a dual-user haptic
   teleoperation system is considered over a communication network
   subjected to asymmetrical time varying delays and through a dominance
   factor suitable for trainer trainee applications. Stability in free
   motion and contact motion and asymptotic position tracking of the
   trilateral haptic teleoperation system in free motion are proven via
   Lyapunov stability analysis and Barbalat's lemma where operators and the
   environment are assumed to be passive. Simulation and experimental
   results concerning robot position tracking and user-perceived forces for
   three 2-DOF robots and experimental analysis of user-perceived
   stiffnesses for three 3-DOF robots validate the theoretical findings
   pertaining to the system stability and demonstrate the efficiency of the
   proposed controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A technique to visualize miscible displacement in porous media is
   introduced in this paper. After saturating the model made of different
   sized glass beads with oil, solvent was introduced to mix and displace
   it. The refractive indices of saturated and injected fluids were made
   the same by mixing them with lower and higher indices of refraction.
   Refractive index matching made the model transparent. Fluorescent dyes
   that were only visible with excitation of laser were dissolved in the
   solvent. A laser sheet scanned the model while synchronous pictures were
   taken by two high speed cameras from two sides of the model. Two groups
   of models representing diffusive (no injection) and convective
   (injection of solvent) interaction, respectively, were considered to
   test the visualization system: (1) solvent diffusion under purely static
   conditions, and (2) injection/production through a pair of horizontal
   wells. Visual data were analyzed and the limitations of the
   visualization technique introduced were presented.}},

Abstract = {{Nanowire sensors based on variations of their electrical properties show
   great potential for real-time, in situ monitoring of molecular
   adsorption and desorption. Although the molecular adsorption-induced
   change in the electronic work function is very sensitive, it does not
   have any specificity. However, the temperature dependency of the
   adsorption-induced work function variation can provide limited
   selectivity based on the desorption temperature. In this study, we
   report the in situ probing of molecular desorption by monitoring the
   work function variations of a single Pt nanowire as a function of
   temperature. The work function of a clean Pt nanowire shows a
   significant variation due to vapor adsorption at room temperature.
   Increasing the temperature of the nanowire results in a variation of the
   work function due to molecular desorption. Experimentally measured
   differential work function as a function of temperature shows desorption
   peaks at 36 and 44 A degrees C for methanol and ethanol molecules
   respectively. Adsorption-induced variation of the Pt nanowire work
   function was further confirmed using ultraviolet photoelectron
   spectroscopy before and after exposure to methanol vapor. These results
   show that the molecular adsorption/desorption-induced variation of the
   work function and its temperature dependency can be used for developing
   nanoscale electro-calorimetric sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Metal nanoparticle (NP) co-catalysts on metal oxide semiconductor
   supports are attracting attention as photocatalysts for a variety of
   chemical reactions. Related efforts seek to make and use Pt-free
   catalysts. In this regard, we report here enhanced CH4 formation rates
   of 25 and 60 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1) by photocatalytic
   CO2 reduction using hitherto unused ZnPd NPs as well as Au and Ru NPs.
   The NPs are formed by colloidal synthesis and grafted onto short n-type
   anatase TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs), grown anodically on transparent
   glass substrates. The interfacial electric fields in the NP-grafted TiO2
   nanotubes were probed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).
   Au NP-grafted TiO2 nanotubes (Au-TNAs) showed no band bending, but a
   depletion region was detected in Ru NP-grafted TNAs (Ru-TNAs) and an
   accumulation layer was observed in ZnPd NP-grafted TNAs (ZnPd-TNAs).
   Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments showed significantly
   greater CO2 adsorption on NP-grafted TNAs. TNAs with grafted NPs exhibit
   broader and more intense UV-visible absorption bands than bare TNAs. We
   found that CO2 photoreduction by nanoparticle-grafted TNAs was driven
   not only by ultraviolet photons with energies greater than the TiO2 band
   gap, but also by blue photons close to and below the anatase band edge.
   The enhanced rate of CO2 reduction is attributed to superior use of blue
   photons in the solar spectrum, excellent reactant adsorption, efficient
   charge transfer to adsorbates, and low recombination losses.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports the effects of recycled material percentage,
   annealing conditions, and glass fiber percentage on the mechanical
   behavior of injection molded polypropylene samples. Specimens were
   prepared with different percentages of recycled material ranging from 0
   to 100\%. Two groups of samples, i.e., non-annealed and annealed at 150
   degrees C, were tested to investigate annealing effects. The effects of
   adding fiber (0-7.5\%) to specimens was also investigated. It was found
   that increasing the amount of recycled material improves the material
   properties in a non-linear trend. Annealing had a significant positive
   effect on both non-fiber-added and fiber-added samples: it improved the
   yield stress of non-reinforced polypropylene samples by more than 10\%
   and their Young's modulus by about 50\%. Fiber-added materials showed
   more variability, and adding fiber also improved the Young's modulus and
   the yield stress of the samples by about 50\%. The results indicate that
   the three factors investigated improved toughness of the injected
   polypropylene samples; however the effects are not significant. The
   study findings reveal that using recycled polypropylene has no
   significant effect on the material properties of polypropylene. POLYM.

Abstract = {{Background Extreme preterm birth confers risk of long-term impairments
   in lung function and exercise capacity. There are limited data on the
   factors contributing to exercise limitation following extreme preterm
   birth. This study examined respiratory mechanics and ventilatory
   response during exercise in a large cohort of children born extremely
   preterm (EP).
   Methods This cohort study included children 812 years of age who were
   born EP (<= 28 weeks gestation) between 1997 and 2004 and treated in a
   large regionalised neonatal intensive care unit in western Canada. EP
   children were divided into no/mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (ie,
   supplementary oxygen or ventilation ceased before 36 weeks gestational
   age; n=53) and moderate/severe BPD (ie, continued supplementary oxygen
   or ventilation at 36 weeks gestational age; n=50). Age-matched control
   children (n=65) were born at full term. All children attempted lung
   function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing measurements.
   Results Compared with control children, EP children had lower airway
   flows and diffusion capacity but preserved total lung capacity. Children
   with moderate/severe BPD had evidence of gas trapping relative to other
   groups. The mean difference in exercise capacity (as measured by oxygen
   uptake (VO2)\% predicted) in children with moderate/severe BPD was
   -18+/-5\% and -14 +/- 5.0\% below children with no/mild BPD and control
   children, respectively. Children with moderate/severe BPD demonstrated a
   potentiated ventilatory response and greater prevalence of expiratory
   flow limitation during exercise compared with other groups. Resting lung
   function did not correlate with exercise capacity.
   Conclusions Expiratory flow limitation and an exaggerated ventilatory
   response contribute to respiratory limitation to exercise in children
   born EP with moderate/severe BPD.}},

Abstract = {{The Guided Boring Method (GBM), also referred to as Pilot Tube
   Microtunneling (PTMT), is a widely used trenchless technology for

   first pipeline installation project performed with the MGBM, and the
   case study results confirm that this technology can successfully install
   pipelines with grade precision in hard ground conditions. This study
   also assesses the MGBM's economic performance using the project's

Title = {{Selective Removal of Particles and Shifting of Particle-Size
   Distribution during Pipeline Transport of Sediment Deposits under
   Turbulent Flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to investigate selective removal of
   particles and shifting in particle-size distribution during a pipeline
   transportation of sediment deposits under turbulent flow of water.
   Presence of sediment deposits is encountered in various pipeline
   transportation operations (e.g.,transport of oil, gas, oil sands, and
   slurry). Effectively removing solids from pipelines is an important part
   of the pipeline transportation-operation design process. Mechanisms of
   particle removal from sediment deposits in pipelines could vary
   depending on the particle size. Understanding how the transport
   mechanisms are related to particles sizes would help in designing better
   operational practices. Four different particle-size ranges were selected
   for experiments: (1)small particles (d(p) < 60 mu m),
   (2)intermediate-size particles (50 mu m < d(p) < 150 mu m), (3)coarse
   particles (d(p) > 150 mu m), and (4)poly-dispersed particles (mixed
   range). Experiments were performed at three different flow rates, all
   ensuring turbulent flow conditions, but velocities well below the
   critical velocity for particle removal (i.e.,suspension from the bed).
   Samples from sediment deposits were taken during the transport
   experiments using custom-designed bottom extractors at different time
   intervals. The particle-size distributions (PSDs) of the samples were
   analyzed using an automated image analyzer equipped with specialized
   software. Results showed that interparticle attractive forces were
   dominant among small-size particles, which makes removal of smaller
   particles within the group more difficult; as a result, concentration of
   smaller particles within the group increased over the time. For
   intermediate-size particles, interparticle attractive forces became
   insignificant. With intermediate-size particles, the turbulent burst
   forces were able to lift the smaller particles within the group from the
   interface of the sediment deposits into the main flow. Consequently, the
   concentration of larger particles increased at the bed, whereas the
   concentration of the smaller particles, which can be lifted by the
   bursting force (velocity dependent), was reduced. For large-size
   particles, the hydrodynamic drag was the major force mobilizing the

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this investigation, analyses of pressure fluctuations during oil and
   gas pipeline operations are performed. The analyses are performed in a
   way to capture all the variables of pressure fluctuations and their
   magnitudes in terms of crack growth rate. It is found that pipeline
   spectra can be categorized into three main types: underload-dominant,
   mean load-dominant, and overload-dominant spectra, depending on their
   locations with respect to a compressor or pump station. The underload
   spectra-typical of pressure fluctuations at the discharging sites-are
   the most severe in terms of crack growth as these spectra are subjected
   to the highest pressure level and the largest magnitude and frequency of
   pressure fluctuations. The underload spectra are further analyzed in
   terms of loading and unloading frequency, maximum stress-intensity
   factor, stress-intensity factor range, numbers of minor cycles between
   two adjacent underloads, and their potential for crack growth. Special
   attention is paid to the difference between oil and gas pipeline
   spectra. The frequency of pressure fluctuations is found to vary over a
   much wider range during oil pipeline operation than during gas pipeline
   operation, and the occurrence of crack growth contributing loading
   events is significantly more frequent in oil pipeline spectra than in
   gas pipeline spectra. It is recommended that the supervisory control and
   data acquisition (SCADA data) is recorded at a minute rate for gas
   pipelines and at a second rate for oil pipelines in order to capture
   most crack-growth-contributing events of pressure fluctuations during
   pipeline operation. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Adsorption behavior of mixed cationic/anionic surfactants and their
   depression mechanism on the flotation of quartz}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{302}},
Pages = {{15-20}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mixed cationic/anionic surfactants are generating increasing attention
   as effective collectors during the flotation of muscovite, feldspar and
   spodumene ores. Many papers have been published focusing on the
   flotation mechanisms of these valuable minerals. However, the depression
   mechanisms on gangue minerals such as quartz have rarely been reported.
   In this study, mixed dodecylamine (DDA)/sodium oleate (NaOL) surfactants
   were used in the flotation separation of muscovite and quartz, and their
   depression mechanisms on quartz were investigated. Compared to DDA
   alone, the use of mixed surfactants resulted in a significantly higher
   adsorption amount of surfactants on the quartz but a lower flotation
   recovery and contact angle with the quartz. This is attributed to the
   different molecular self-assembly mechanisms between solely DDA and
   mixed surfactants at the quartz/water interface, as revealed by
   molecular dynamics simulations. A hydrophobic monolayer coating forms
   for solely DDA, with the head groups adsorbing on the quartz via
   electrostatic interactions. In the case of mixed surfactants, DDA
   preferentially interacts with NaOL via electrostatic interaction through
   the oppositely charged head groups and hydrophobic interactions between
   their carbon chains. As a result, most DDA and NaOL molecules form
   hydrophilic spherical-like micelles near quartz, whereas only a few DDA
   molecules adsorb directly on the quartz via hydrogen bonding. These act
   as a bridge linking the rest of the surfactants, leading to a relatively
   lower flotation recovery and contact angle for the quartz. This study is
   beneficial for complementing the flotation theories and mechanisms of
   mixed cationic/anionic surfactants on minerals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider economic model predictive control (EMPC) with
   extended horizon based on an auxiliary controller. The extension of the
   horizon is realized by employing a terminal cost which characterizes the
   economic performance of the auxiliary controller over a finite terminal
   horizon. The proposed EMPC design is easy to construct and
   computationally efficient. We analyze the stability and performance of
   the proposed EMPC design with special attention paid to the impact of
   the terminal horizon. It is shown that for strictly dissipative systems
   satisfying mild assumptions, a finite terminal horizon is sufficient to
   guarantee the convergence and performance of the EMPC to be
   approximately upper-bounded by that of the auxiliary controller. (C)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Variable and unpredictable ice cover conditions present a serious safety
   concern for winter recreational activities on urban stormwater ponds.
   Ice cover formation and decay are largely controlled by thermal and
   hydrodynamic factors; however, stormwater ponds receiving salt-laden
   runoff can have altered chemical properties, which may also affect ice
   processes. To identify the causal factors of variable ice cover
   conditions, water sampling and continuous water quality monitoring were
   conducted over two winters on four stormwater ponds located in Edmonton,
   Alberta, Canada. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the
   freezing point temperatures of the water samples. It was found that the
   freezing point temperature correlates strongly with specific
   conductivity and closely to the chloride concentration in the ponds. The
   magnitude of freezing point depression varied from pond to pond with a
   maximum magnitude of 0.353 degrees C. The freezing point depression was
   also determined for the pond ice by measuring the specific conductivity
   of thawed ice cores, and was found to be significantly smaller than that
   of the pond water. A calculation of the heat transfer in a layer of ice
   showed that the ice growth and melting processes were not significantly
   affected by freezing point depression of this magnitude. Therefore, it
   was concluded that salt-laden runoff from nearby roads does not have a
   significant influence on ice formation or thawing in stormwater ponds.

Title = {{Soft set based association rule mining}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{268-282}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Association rules, one of the most useful constructs in data mining, can
   be exerted to capture interesting dependencies between variables in
   large datasets. Herawan and Dens initiated the investigation of mining
   association rules from transactional datasets using soft set theory.
   Unfortunately, some existing concepts in the literature were unable to
   realize properly Herawan and Deris's initial idea. This paper aims to
   offer further detailed insights into soft set based association rule
   mining. With regard to regular association rule mining using soft sets,
   we refine several existing concepts to improve the generality and
   clarity of former definitions. Regarding maximal association rule mining
   based on soft sets, we point out the drawbacks of some existing
   definitions and offer some way to rectify the problem. A number of new
   notions, such as transactional data soft sets, parameter-taxonomic soft
   sets, parameter cosets, realizations and M-realizations of parameter
   sets are proposed to facilitate soft set based association rule mining.
   Several algorithms are designed to find M-realizations of parameter sets
   or extract sigma-M-strong and gamma-M-reliable maximal association rules
   in parameter-taxonomic soft sets. We also present an example to
   illustrate potential applications of our method in clinical diagnosis.
   Moreover, two case studies are conducted to highlight the essentials of
   soft set based association rule mining approach. (C) 2016 Elievier B.V.

Abstract = {{Temporary haul road plays a pivotal part in achieving cost-efficiency
   and successful project delivery in heavy civil and industrial
   construction. Temporary haul road layout design has been empirically
   performed by field managers, superintendents or even truck drivers
   largely based on experience instead of science. Previous research
   endeavors in earthmoving research devised analytical algorithms to
   minimize the total earthmoving cost and developed simulation models to
   optimize earthmoving resources and processes. In the same domain, this
   research introduces an optimization methodology for temporary haul road
   layout design in order to facilitate mass earthmoving operations and
   improve construction performances on a typical rough-grading site. A
   Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model, integrated with a cutting plane
   method, is established for the identified problem. In particular, the
   cutting plane method is introduced to refine the optimization
   formulation by maintaining field accessibility and haul road continuity,
   thus ensuring practical feasibility of the analytical solution.
   Performances of the newly devised algorithms were benchmarked against
   genetic algorithms in solving ten test cases. Further, feasibility of
   the proposed methodology was evaluated based on a real-world case study.
   In conclusion, the proposed methodology is capable of tackling the
   temporary haul road layout design problem with high computing efficiency
   and delivering optimal results that are ready for field implementation.

Abstract = {{This paper develops a systematic simulation-based multi-attribute
   decision approach to route choice planning, in which uncertainties and
   dynamics underlying pedestrian behaviors during an evacuation are
   modeled given the complex interaction between pedestrians and the
   traffic is taken into account. Three factors, namely the length of
   evacuation route, time of evacuation process and density of pedestrian
   flow, are identified to have significant impacts on the efficiency of
   the evacuation process, especially at peak hours in a metro station. Two
   route planning strategies, as specified in Scenarios I and II,
   respectively, are proposed to simulate the pedestrian evacuation
   performance. Four key performance indicators (KPIs), namely average
   pedestrian density, average evacuation length, average evacuation time
   and average evacuation capacity, are put forward to assess the
   evacuation performance within different route planning strategies. The
   values of these KPIs on a metro station in the Wuhan metro system,
   China, are measured and compared in different scenarios. Results
   indicate that the performance of the evacuation efficiency can be
   significantly improved when the route planning strategy (that is
   specified in Scenario II) is implemented during the pedestrian
   evacuation. The developed approach can provide valuable theoretic and
   practical insight into a deep understanding of route planning strategies
   during the pedestrian evacuation, and thus, the improvement of safety
   and economic objectives can further be achieved in the design or
   re-design of metro evacuation systems. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Due to the labour-intensiveness of the construction industry, accurate
   estimation of cycle time of manual activities is essential for reliable
   planning and scheduling of operations. Labour productivity study is used
   in current practice to obtain the required cycle time of manual tasks.
   However, the reliability of labour productivity study in estimating
   durations of manual activities is inhibited by its dependence on various
   factors which change with the different working conditions of
   construction jobsites and the difficulties associated with measuring
   productivity. This study thus investigates the use of a predetermined
   motion time system (PMTS) for modelling manual construction operations
   for cycle time estimation and efficiency evaluation. A motion-level
   simulation approach is developed by integrating PMTS into discrete-event
   simulation (DES) modelling, providing an automated and simple-to-use
   method of analysing manual tasks. As a case study, manual construction
   operations from a construction jobsite with different levels of
   repetitiveness are modelled, and the actual and simulated cycle times
   are compared and analysed. The results confirm the effectiveness of a
   PMTS-based simulation approach to modelling manual construction
   operations and its reliability in estimating the duration of manual
   tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIODEGRADATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{247-264}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Batch experiments were performed to evaluate biodegradation of raw and
   ozonated oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) under denitrifying
   anoxic and nitrifying aerobic conditions for 33 days. The results showed
   both the anoxic and aerobic conditions are effective in degrading OSPW
   classical and oxidized naphthenic acids (NAs) with the aerobic
   conditions demonstrating higher removal efficiency. The reactors under
   nitrifying aerobic condition reduced the total classical NAs of raw OSPW
   by 69.1 \%, with better efficiency for species of higher hydrophobicity.
   Compared with conventional aerobic reactor, nitrifying aerobic condition
   substantially shortened the NA degradation half-life to 16 days. The
   mild-dose ozonation remarkably accelerated the subsequent aerobic
   biodegradation of classical NAs within the first 14 days, especially for
   those with long carbon chains. Moreover, the ozone pretreatment enhanced
   the biological removal of OSPW classical NAs by leaving a considerably
   lower final residual concentration of 10.4 mg/L under anoxic conditions,
   and 5.7 mg/L under aerobic conditions. The combination of ozonation and
   nitrifying aerobic biodegradation removed total classical NAs by 76.5 \%
   and total oxy-NAs (O3-O6) by 23.6 \%. 454 Pyrosequencing revealed that
   microbial species capable of degrading recalcitrant hydrocarbons were
   dominant in all reactors. The most abundant genus in the raw and
   ozonated anoxic reactors was Thauera (similar to 56 \% in the raw OSPW
   anoxic reactor, and similar to 65 \% in the ozonated OSPW anoxic
   reactor); whereas Rhodanobacter (similar to 40 \%) and Pseudomonas
   (similar to 40 \%) dominated the raw and ozonated aerobic reactors,
   respectively. Therefore, the combination of mild-dose ozone pretreatment
   and subsequent biological process could be a competent choice for OSPW
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional geostatistical simulation methods are implemented in a way
   that is inherently gridded and sequence dependent. A variant of spectral
   simulation method is revisited from a linear model of regionalization
   standpoint to simulate realizations of coregionalized variables that are
   expressed as a function of the coordinates of the simulation locations,
   data values, and imposed spatial structure. The resulting grid-free
   simulation (GFS) methodology expresses a realization at any set of
   regularly or irregularly distributed nodes. GFS consists of two main
   steps: unconditional grid-free simulation and dual cokriging-based
   conditioning. The unconditional multivariate simulation is represented
   by a linear model of coregionalization, where weights are derived from
   the covariance function of the modeled system, and random factors are
   computed as a sum of equally weighted line processes within a turning
   bands paradigm. These stochastic line processes are expressed as a
   linear model of regionalization, weights are from the Fourier series
   decomposition of line covariance functions, and random factors have a
   cosine function form requiring coordinates of simulation locations and
   the random phases. The resulting conditionally simulated values are
   uniquely tied to simulation locations by an analytical form. Newly
   assimilated data change current realizations only locally within the
   correlation range. The GFS parameters are carefully chosen from a series
   of examples, and the associated theory is illustrated with a
   three-dimensional case study.}},

Abstract = {{We consider time-dependent plane strain deformations of a nanosized
   circular elastic in homogeneity embedded in an infinite elastic matrix
   subjected to uniform remote stresses. The inhomogeneity and the matrix
   are each endowed with separate and distinct Gurtin-Murdoch surface
   elasticities. In addition, both rate-dependent slip and mass transport
   resulting from stress-driven diffusion occur concurrently on the
   inhomogeneity/matrix interface. A simple yet effective method is
   proposed to derive a closed-form solution. The stress distributions in
   the composite are size-dependent and evolve with two relaxation times.
   Explicit expressions for the relaxation times depend on four
   size-dependent parameters: two arising from interface slip and diffusion
   and two from surface elasticities. The stress field inside the
   inhomogeneity is spatially non-uniform and time-dependent when the
   remote loading is non-hydrostatic; conversely, it is uniform,
   hydrostatic and time independent when the remote loading is hydrostatic.

Abstract = {{Understanding the surface interactions between elemental selenium (Se-0)
   and solid substrates is of both fundamental and practical importance in
   biological systems, water treatment processes, and microelectro
   mechanical/nanoelectromechanical systems where Se is present. In this
   work, for the first time, surface interactions between a Se-0 sphere and
   substrates of varying hydrophobicity, including silica,
   octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified silica, and electrodeposited
   Se-0 film, were directly measured in aqueous solutions at different pH
   and salinity conditions using an atomic force microscope (AFM). In 1 mM
   NaCl, electrical double layer forces and van der Waals forces dominated
   the interactions between Se sphere and hydrophilic silica, and the
   force-distance profiles could be well fitted by classic
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Additional hydrophobic
   attraction was found to play a role in the interactions between Se-0
   sphere and hydrophobic surfaces (i.e., OTS modified silica, and
   electrode posited Se film), with Se-0-OTS showing relatively larger
   hydrophobic decay length (D-0 similar to 1.3 nm) than Se-0-Se-0 (D-0
   similar to 1 nm). In 0.5 M NaCl, the electrical double layer interaction
   was significantly compressed. The change of zeta potentials of Se-0, OTS
   and silica surfaces with pH showed good agreement and same trend as that
   of the fitted surface potentials based on the force measurements. This
   work provides useful information regarding the interaction mechanism of
   Se-0 and surfaces of varying hydrophobicity in aqueous solutions. (C)

Abstract = {{The displacement discontinuity method is developed to analyze an
   arbitrarily shaped planar interfacial crack in a three-dimensional
   isotropic thermal elastic bi-material under combined thermo-mechanical
   loadings. The fundamental solutions for uniformly distributed
   displacement and temperature discontinuities applied over a triangular
   element are obtained via the displacement and temperature discontinuity
   boundary integral-differential equation method. In order to eliminate
   the oscillatory singularity near the crack front, the Delta function in
   the fundamental solutions is approximated by the Gaussian distribution
   function, and accordingly, the unit Heaviside step function is replaced
   by the Error function. The stress and heat flux intensity factors
   without the oscillatory singularity as well as the Energy release rate
   are presented. An elliptical interface crack is analyzed as an example
   to validate the fundamental solutions and the proposed numerical method.
   The influences of thermal loading and material-mismatch on the
   thermo-mechanical response are studied, the difference between the
   homogeneous material and bi-material is also analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Analysis of syngas cooler fouling from asphaltene gasification}},
Journal = {{FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{7-14}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) are the most abundant and troublesome
   metals present in Athabasca oil sands asphaltenes which are formed
   during the primary upgrading of bitumen. Asphaltenes consist of iron,
   phosphorus, calcium, sodium, and aluminum in noticeable amounts in
   addition to poly aromatic hydrocarbons, sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen.
   During gasification of asphaltene, a small amount of carbon in the form
   of soot, along with some of the inorganic components in the feed, exits
   the gasifier as particulates with the syngas. If these V, Ni or any
   other metal species do not get encapsulated by soot, these would create
   fouling/erosion issues at the downstream of the gasifier as the syngas
   is cooled down in the syngas cooler tubes. The present study focuses on
   the analysis of the ash deposits collected from an industrial syngas
   cooler attached to an asphaltene gasifier. First half of the tube length
   was affected by high temperature corrosion, whereas the second half was
   covered with fouling deposits of different layers. Fouling deposits from
   three different locations along the second half of the syngas cooler
   were collected as samples for the purpose of examination. At first the
   morphological and composition analysis of the deposits were done for the
   as received tube sections after stabilizing the deposit with epoxy with
   SEM-EDX to identify the different layers. TG/DSC analyses were carried
   out to investigate the thermal behavior of the scratched samples from
   three locations. The heated samples after TG/DSC were examined again for
   the crystal structure change and morphology change. Finally evolved gas
   analyses of the deposits were done to identify which species act as the
   binding agent to cause the fouling deposit. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we present an approach to multi-criteria decision-making
   modeling inspired by human cognitive processes. The proposed model
   exploits the ideas of fuzzy sets, balanced fuzzy sets and their
   connectives, namely t-norms, t-conorms and derived connectives. Balanced
   connectives are compared and contrasted with unipolar fuzzy connectives.
   Our objective is to capture complex aspects of decision-making
   processes. We consider imperfect bipolar information that engages
   positive and negative aspects and leads to decisions. Furthermore, we
   investigate behavioral biases. This allows us to provide a detailed
   insight into decision-making processes realized by human beings and
   their biases: impact of arguments ordering on the decision, risk
   aversion, and impact of input arguments fading with time. We investigate
   and describe the suitability of selected triangular and balanced
   connectives for decision-making modeling inspired by cognitive
   processes. We compare different pairs of standard t-norms, t-conorms and
   balanced counterparts, and discuss their abilities to model various,
   also irrational, aspects of human behavior. The developed two-step
   procedure is applied to decision-making modeling presented as a case
   study and compared with a method known in the literature. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Here we report the thermomechanical response of a bimaterial
   microchannel cantilever (BMC) subjected to periodic heating by IR
   radiation. A detailed theoretical and experimental study was performed
   considering the BMC as a thermal sensor. Experiments were conducted to
   find out the thermal sensitivity and power sensitivity of various BMC
   designs. The thermal sensitivity of the BMC was found by monitoring the
   response of the BMC to external heating while the power sensitivity was
   measured by observing its behavior to varying incident IR power. We
   report a minimum measurement of 60 W of power, an energy resolution of
   240 nJ and a temperature resolution of 4 mK using the BMC. The optimum
   BMC design was chosen to demonstrate a spectroscopy application to
   detect a minimum of 1.15 ng of ethanol in ethanol water binary mixture.
   The purpose of this paper is to add molecular selectivity to the
   ultra-sensitive, novel design of microchannel cantilevers using
   photothermal spectroscopy techniques for biosensing applications. (C)

Abstract = {{We report on a flow-through optical sensor consisting of a
   microcapillary with mirrored channels. Illuminating the structure from
   the side results in a complicated spectral interference pattern due to
   the different cavities formed between the inner and outer capillary
   walls. Using a Fourier transform technique to isolate the desired
   channel modes and measure their resonance shift, we obtain a
   refractometric detection limit of (6.3 +/- 1.1) x 10(-6) RIU near a
   center wavelength of 600 nm. This simple device demonstrates
   experimental refractometric sensitivities up to (5.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(2)
   nm/RIU in the visible spectrum, and it is calculated to reach 1540
   nm/RIU with a detection limit of 2.3 x 10(-6) RIU at a wavelength of
   1.55 mu m. These values are comparable to or exceed some of the best
   Fabry-Perot sensors reported to date. Furthermore, the device can
   function as a gas or liquid sensor or even as a pressure sensor owing to
   its high refractometric sensitivity and simple operation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this work, a microwave planar resonator sensor with boosted quality
   factor is proposed for the non-contact detection and classification of
   particles of different diameters in gaseous and aquatic environments.
   This approach can be applied to rapid particle counting, particle size
   sensing and classification in lossy and non-lossy medium. The presented
   sensor operates based on variations in the dielectric properties of
   materials in the vicinity of a planar open-ended microstrip resonator
   device. Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis is performed to study the
   effect of particle size on the transmission response profile of the
   sensor. Verification of the established FEM model and the functionality
   of the sensor are investigated by experiment. The resolution of the
   sensor may be adjusted by changing the quality factor of the resonator,
   which is directly related to the direct current bias voltage of the
   active device in the local feedback loop. The initial results show the
   sensor to be capable of detecting the resonant frequency variations of 1
   kHz over 1.5 GHz, which corresponds to a detectable frequency resolution
   better than 1 part per million (PPM). The reported sensor operates at
   1.42 GHz and demonstrates particle classification capability within an
   overall 500 kHz resonant-frequency shift for different bead-diameter
   sizes (40-400 mu m) at a distance of 5 mm, in both air and water
   (epsilon' = 78 and tan delta=0.15) using petroleum coke beads as a test

Abstract = {{Lankacidin group antibiotics show strong antimicrobial activity against
   various Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, they were shown to have
   considerable antitumor activity against certain cell line models. For
   decades, the antitumor activity of lankacidin was associated with the
   mechanism of its antimicrobial action, which is interference with
   peptide bond formation during protein synthesis. This, however, was
   never confirmed experimentally. Due to significant similarity to
   paclitaxel-like hits in a previous computational virtual screening
   study, we suggested that the cytotoxic effect of lankacidin is due to a
   paclitaxel-like action. In this study, we tested this hypothesis
   computationally and experimentally and confirmed that lankacidin is a
   microtubule stabilizer that enhances tubulin assembly and displaces
   taxoids from their binding site. This study serves as a starting point
   for optimization of lankacidin derivatives for better antitumor
   activities. It also highlights the power of computational predictions
   and their aid in guiding experiments and formulating rigorous
   hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a modelling study of the rich combustion of heavy
   fuel oil in a reactor packed with an inert porous medium. Decalin is
   used as a model compound to represent the heavy fuel oil. A
   computational model is developed for the reactor, based on a two space
   dimensional transient heterogeneous description, and a kinetic global
   model for partial oxidation reforming of decalin is proposed. Also,
   equilibrium calculations were performed for the experimental conditions
   of the study. The experimental and simulation results show that heavy
   fuel oil is a potential fuel to produce hydrogen. It is concluded that
   notable characteristics of the process can be observed by simulation:
   the presence of an axial maximum in the production of H-2, and positive
   effects of the equivalence ratio and filtration velocity increase and
   heat losses reduction on the fuel conversion to H-2. (C) 2016 Hydrogen

Abstract = {{In order to increase the resistance of electrogalvanized steel to
   corrosive wear, nanocrystalline zinc coating was electrodeposited onto
   the steel substrate using a sulfate bath with polyacrylamide as grain
   refiner. Corrosive wear tests were performed in a simulated seawater
   solution to evaluate the performance of the nanocrystalline zinc coating
   with its grain size around 40 nm, in comparison with that of
   coarse-grained zinc coating (grain size similar to 5 mu m). It was
   demonstrated that material loss of the coarse-grained zinc coating was
   39 times as large as that of the nanocrystalline one. The considerably
   higher corrosive wear resistance of the nanocrystalline zinc coating
   largely benefited from its increased mechanical strength due to
   nanocrystallization and higher surface activity, which improved the
   passivation capability with the formation of a more protective oxide
   scale. Detailed analyses were conducted to clarify the mechanism
   responsible for the improvements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Neural tissue engineering: Bioresponsive nanoscaffolds using engineered
   self-assembling peptides}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{2-15}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Rescuing or repairing neural tissues is of utmost importance to the
   patient's quality of life after an injury. To remedy this, many novel
   biomaterials are being developed that are, ideally, non-invasive and
   directly facilitate neural wound healing. As such, this review surveys
   the recent approaches and applications of self-assembling peptides and
   peptide amphiphiles, for building multi-faceted nanoscaffolds for direct
   application to neural injury. Specifically, methods enabling cellular
   interactions with the nanoscaffold and controlling the release of
   bioactive molecules from the nanoscaffold for the express purpose of
   directing endogenous cells in damaged or diseased neural tissues is
   presented. An extensive overview of recently derived self-assembling
   peptide-based materials and their use as neural nanoscaffolds is
   presented. In addition, an overview of potential bioactive peptides and
   ligands that could be used to direct behaviour of endogenous cells are
   categorized with their biological effects. Finally, a number of
   neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory drugs are described and discussed.
   Smaller therapeutic molecules are emphasized, as they are thought to be
   able to have less potential effect on the overall peptide self assembly
   mechanism. Options for potential nanoscaffolds and drug delivery systems
   are suggested.
   Statement of Significance
   Self-assembling nanoscaffolds have many inherent properties making them
   amenable to tissue engineering applications: ease of synthesis, ease of
   customization with bioactive moieties, and amenable for in situ
   nanoscaffold formation. The combination of the existing knowledge on
   bioactive motifs for neural engineering and the self-assembling
   propensity of peptides is discussed in specific reference to neural
   tissue engineering. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Acta

Abstract = {{Li2MSiO4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, et al.) has received great attention
   because of the theoretical possibility to reversibly deintercalate two
   Li+ ions from the structure. However, the silicates still suffer from
   low electronic conductivity, sluggish lithium ion diffusion and
   structural instability upon deep cycling. In order to solve these
   problems, a ``hard-soft{''} templating method has been developed to
   synthesize three dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) Li2FeSiO4/C
   composites. The 3DOM Li2FeSiO4/C composites show a high reversible
   capacity (239 mAh g(-1)) with similar to 1.50 lithium ion
   insertion/extraction, a capacity retention of nearly 100\% after 420
   cycles and excellent rate capability. The enhanced electrochemical
   performance is ascribed to the interconnected carbon framework that
   improves the electronic conductivity and the 3DOM structure that offers
   short Li ion diffusion pathways and restrains volumetric changes. (C)

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchical monodisperse and poly-disperse rutile TiO2 aggregates
   featuring excellent light scattering properties were synthesized by a
   simple hydrolysis route at low temperature using sucrose as the
   structure directing agent. Various characterization techniques revealed
   that sucrose played a key role in controlling the shape and size
   distribution of hierarchical aggregates. The aggregates are formed by
   nano-sized crystallites and, therefore, are able to offer both a large
   specific surface area and strong light scattering behaviour. Films
   composed of monodisperse 465 nm rutile spheres coupled to a layer of
   commercial P25 anatase nanoparticles manifested a large photonic
   strength through the combination of a high haze ratio and a large back
   scattering-to-forward scattering ratio. The hierarchical rutile TiO2
   aggregates when employed as the sole working electrode in DSSCs,
   achieved a 5.16\% power conversion efficiency which is higher than that
   of commercial P25 (5.04\%) with same thickness. In addition, the overall
   conversion efficiency of 7.26\% was achieved when hierarchical
   aggregates were used as the light scattering overlayer of photoanode.
   The significant enhancement in overall conversion efficiency was
   attributed to the large photon absorption by increasing path length of
   photons due to the multiple scattering by hierarchical aggregates. (C)

Abstract = {{Collisions of charged droplets in the shear flow of an electrolyte were
   simulated to investigate the effects of surface charges and double
   layers on the critical conditions for coalescence. A lattice Boltzmann
   method phase field flow solver was coupled with an iterative
   finite-difference solver for the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation
   describing electric double layers. The simulations resolve both the
   phase field diffuse interface and electric double layer. The critical
   capillary numbers for coalescence were determined under varying
   strengths of the electric interactions. Critical capillary numbers
   between 0.03 and 0.2 were found for droplet radii spanning 25-50 lattice
   nodes (12.5-25 times the characteristic interface thickness), with lower
   critical values for larger droplets. The droplet interfaces had a
   constant potential. Once electric repulsion becomes comparable to the
   viscous shear force on the drops, the critical capillary numbers
   decrease, and the decrease is smaller for longer Debye lengths. Though
   the ratio of droplet size and Debye length that can be achieved in the
   simulations is constrained by high computational demands, the
   simulations provide insight into the effects of surface charge on the
   interactions between interfaces in multiphase flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Treatment of oil sands process-affected water using membrane bioreactor
   coupled with ozonation: A comparative study}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{302}},
Pages = {{485-497}},

Abstract = {{The huge amount of toxic oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) stored
   in northern Alberta is of great concern to the public health and aquatic
   life. Therefore, cost-effective and more efficient approaches for OSPW
   treatment are urgently needed. In this study, mild ozonation followed by
   a modified Luzack-Ettinger membrane bioreactor (MLE-MBR) were employed
   for the treatment of OSPW. It was shown that with a utilized ozone dose
   of 30 mg/L, 42.5-47.4\% of classical naphthenic acids (NAs) were removed
   with toxicity reduction towards Vibrio fischeri. While ozonation
   targeted the heteroatomic NAs and classical NAs with high cyclicity and
   carbon number, MBR showed its advantages in removing oxidized NAs and
   classical NAs with less hydrogen deficiency. With excellent
   nitrification and denitrification performance, MBR achieved the removal
   of 46\% for classical NAs, indicating the success of sludge acclimation
   in the MBR. Thauera became the most dominating bacterial genus in MBR,.
   revealing its potentials in OSPW treatment. Compared with MBR treating
   raw OSPW, ozone pretreatment contributed to improved denitrification and
   NA removal in MBR. Moreover, it altered microbial community structure,
   thus delaying the occurrence of membrane fouling. During 426 days of
   continuous operation, no severe membrane fouling was observed as the
   transmembrane pressure (TMP) of the MLE-MBR never exceeded-12 kPa. With
   a reduction of classical NAs by around 70\%, our results indicated that
   the MLE-MBR coupled with ozonation, is a promising approach for removing
   recalcitrant organics in OSPW. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This article reports a systematic study on a highly CO2-responsive
   superamphiphile (D-OA) in preparation of CO2-switchable oil-in-water
   emulsions. The D-OA was assembled with Jeffamine D 230 and oleic acid
   (HOA) via electrostatic interaction, which was characterized using
   FT-IR, H-1 NMR, surface tension, and interfacial tension techniques. The
   assembled gemini-like superamphiphile D-OA was shown to have a low cmc
   value and adsorb quickly at the paraffin oil/water interface, decreasing
   the interfacial tension effectively. Highly stable O/W emulsions were
   obtained by mixing D-OA aqueous solution and paraffin oil. After
   bubbling CO2 through the stable emulsions for just 20 s, quick phase
   separation was observed; while upon removal of CO2 by bubbling N-2 at 60
   degrees C, stable emulsions were recreated. The reversible assembly and
   disassembly of the D-OA superamphiphile by adding or removing CO2 were
   considered as the cause of demulsification and re-emulsification
   processes. The rapid and complete demulsification of the system in
   response to CO2 addition and removal may have potential applications in
   emulsion based fabrication/separation and enhanced oil recovery
   processes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal stability governed by various surface interactions finds wide
   application in many engineering processes, such as mineral froth
   flotation. In this work, electrochemical atomic force microscopy
   (EC-AFM) was employed to modulate the interfacial chemical reaction and
   simultaneously probe the evolution of surface characteristics (i.e.,
   morphological changes and surface interactions) of electrochemically
   active galena mineral surface at the nanoscale. Successive potentials
   (i.e., -0.7, -0.3, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.45 V), referred to the
   Ag/AgCl/3.4 M KCl reference electrode (0.206 V vs standard hydrogen
   electrode), were respectively held for 20 s on the galena surface. The
   in-situ topographic imaging demonstrates homogeneous electrochemical
   oxidation across the mineral surface, leading to slight surface
   roughening at the potential of 0 V and more pronounced surface
   roughening at higher potentials (e.g., 0.3 and 0.45 V). The direct force
   measurements with an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-functionalized AFM
   tip show that the magnitude of attractive hydrophobic interaction
   increased with increasing the applied potential from -0.7 to 0.45 V due
   to the enhanced surface hydrophobicity, which agrees well with contact
   angle measurements. Fitted with the extended
   Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory by including the effect
   of hydrophobic interaction, the decay length of hydrophobic interaction
   was found to rise from 0.8 to 1.3 nm with increasing the applied
   potential from -0.7 to 0.45 V. The electrochemical oxidation at 0 V is
   believed to be the formation of metal-deficient lead sulfide, while the
   oxidation at 0.45 V arises from the formation of elemental sulfur that
   is further confirmed by cryo-XPS. The results provide insights into the
   basic understanding of the interfacial properties and surface
   interaction mechanisms on electrochemically polarized mineral surface at
   nanoscale, and the methodology can be extended to many other interfacial
   electrochemical processes.}},

   Systematic Approach}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Cryopreservation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
   facilitated their commercial availability for use in vascular biology,
   tissue engineering and drug delivery research; however, the key
   variables in HUVEC cryopreservation have not been comprehensively
   studied. HUVECs are typically cryopreserved by cooling at 1 degrees
   C/min in the presence of 10\% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). We applied
   interrupted slow cooling (graded freezing) and interrupted rapid cooling
   with a hold time (two-step freezing) to identify where in the cooling
   process cryoinjury to HUVECs occurs. We found that linear cooling at 1
   degrees C/min resulted in higher membrane integrities than linear
   cooling at 0.2 degrees C/min or nonlinear two-step freezing. DMSO
   addition procedures and compositions were also investigated. By
   combining hydroxyethyl starch with DMSO, HUVEC viability after
   cryopreservation was improved compared to measured viabilities of
   commercially available cryopreserved HUVECs and viabilities for HUVEC
   cryopreservation studies reported in the literature. Furthermore, HUVECs
   cryopreserved using our improved procedure showed high tube forming
   capability in a post-thaw angiogenesis assay, a standard indicator of
   endothelial cell function. As well as presenting superior
   cryopreservation procedures for HUVECs, the methods developed here can
   serve as a model to optimize the cryopreservation of other cells.}},

   microparticles in a diameter range of 0.7-17 mu m Droplets were composed
   of sodium nitrate and deionized water. Initial conditions of the process
   differed in temperature of the external environment, from 50 to 150
   degrees C, and in solution concentration, from 5 to 5.10(-4) mg/mL. By
   varying these initial conditions, microparticles with different diameter
   and morphology were generated. Their root mean squared roughness was in
   a range from 2 to 6.10(-5) mu m. Pull-off forces between particles of
   the same morphology and of different morphology were determined using
   colloidal probe microscopy. A wide range of cohesion forces was measured

   susceptibility to antibiotics in small confined volumes}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{In the fight against drug-resistant bacteria, accurate and
   high-throughput detection is essential. Here, a bimaterial
   microcantilever with an embedded microfluidic channel with internal
   surfaces chemically or physically functionalized with receptors
   selectively captures the bacteria passing through the channel. Bacterial
   adsorption inside the cantilever results in changes in the resonance
   frequency (mass) and cantilever deflection (adsorption stress). The
   excitation of trapped bacteria using infrared radiation (IR) causes the
   cantilever to deflect in proportion to the infrared absorption of the
   bacteria, providing a nanomechanical infrared spectrum for selective
   identification. We demonstrate the in situ detection and discrimination
   of Listeria monocytogenes at a concentration of single cell per mu l.
   Trapped Escherichia coli in the microchannel shows a distinct
   nanomechanical response when exposed to antibiotics. This approach,
   which combines enrichment with three different modes of detection, can
   serve as a platform for the development of a portable, high-throughput
   device for use in the real-time detection of bacteria and their response
   to antibiotics.}},

Title = {{Differential Responses of Post-Exercise Recovery of Leg Blood Flow and
   Oxygen Uptake Kinetics in HFpEF versus HFrEF}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{The goals of the current study were to compare leg blood flow, oxygen
   extraction and oxygen uptake (VO2) after constant load sub-maximal
   unilateral knee extension (ULKE) exercise in patients with heart failure
   with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) compared to those with preserved
   ejection fraction (HFpEF). Previously, it has been shown that prolonged
   whole body VO2 recovery kinetics are directly related to disease
   severity and all-cause mortality in HFrEF patients. To date, no study
   has simultaneously measured muscle-specific blood flow and oxygen
   extraction post exercise recovery kinetics in HFrEF or HFpEF patients;
   therefore it is unknown if muscle VO2 recovery kinetics, and more
   specifically, the recovery kinetics of blood flow and oxygen extraction
   at the level of the muscle, differ between HF phenotypes. Ten older (68
   +/- 10yrs) HFrEF (n = 5) and HFpEF (n = 5) patients performed
   sub-maximal (85\% of maximal weight lifted during an incremental test)
   ULKE exercise for 4 minutes. Femoral venous blood flow and venous O-2
   saturation were measured continuously from the onset of end-exercise,
   using a novel MRI method, to determine off-kinetics (mean response
   times, MRT) for leg VO2 and its determinants. HFpEF and HFrEF patients
   had similar end-exercise leg blood flow (1.1 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.6
   L/min, p>0.05), venous saturation (42 +/- 12 vs. 41 +/- 11\%, p>0.05)
   and VO2 (0.13 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.11 +/- 0.05 L/min, p>0.05); however HFrEF
   had significantly delayed recovery MRT for flow (292 +/- 135sec. vs 105
   +/- 63sec., p = 0.004) and VO2 (95 +/- 37sec. vs. 47 +/- 15sec., p =
   0.005) compared to HFpEF. Impaired muscle VO2 recovery kinetics
   following ULKE exercise differentiated HFrEF from HFpEF patients and
   suggests distinct underlying pathology and potential therapeutic
   approaches in these populations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a highly sensitive and selective, remote chemical
   sensing platform for surface-adsorbed trace chemicals by using infrared
   (IR)-sensitive hydrogel microcantilevers. Poly(ethylene glycol)
   diacrylate (PEG-DA) hydrogel microcantilevers are fabricated by
   ultraviolet (UV) curing of PEG-DA prepolymer introduced into a
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) mold. The resonance frequency of a PEG-DA
   microcantilever exhibits high thermal sensitivity due to IR
   irradiation/absorption. When a tunable IR laser beam is reflected off a
   surface coated with target chemical onto a PEG-DA microcantilever, the
   resonance frequency of the cantilever shifts in proportion to the
   chemical nature of the target molecules. Dynamic responses of the PEG-DA
   microcantilever can be obtained in a range of IR wavelengths using a
   tunable quantum cascade laser that can form the basis for the standoff
   mechanical resonance spectroscopy (SMRS). Using this SMRS technique, we
   have selectively detected three compounds, dimethyl methyl phosphonate
   (DMMP), cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), and pentaerythritol
   tetranitrate (PETN), located 4 m away from the PEG-DA microcantilever
   detector. The experimentally measured limit of detection for PETN trace
   using the PEG-DA microcantilever was 40 ng/cm(2). Overall, the PEG-DA
   microcantilever is a promising candidate for further exploration and
   optimization of standoff detection methods.}},

   Fe(III/II)NTA and Fe(III/II)EDDS and the UV photolysis of the complexes
   in Milli-Q water and OSPW were compared. Under optimum conditions, UV
   NTA Fenton exhibited higher efficiency than UV-EDDS-Fenton in the
   removal of acid extractable organic fraction (66.8\% for the former and
   50.0\% for the latter) and aromatics (93.5\% for the former and 74.2\%

   NAs with one additional oxygen atom), and NAs + 2O (oxidized NAs with

   UV-EDDS-Fenton processes presented promoting effect on the acute
   toxicity of OSPW toward Vibrio fischeri. No significant change of the
   NTA toxicity occurred during the photolysis of Fe(III)NTA; however, the
   acute toxicity of EDDS increased as the photolysis of Fe(III)EDDS
   proceeded: NTA is a much better agent than EDDS for the application of

Title = {{Multi-Pass Adaptive Voting for Nuclei Detection in Histopathological
   Images}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Nuclei detection is often a critical initial step in the development of
   computer aided diagnosis and prognosis schemes in the context of digital
   pathology images. While over the last few years, a number of nuclei
   detection methods have been proposed, most of these approaches make
   idealistic assumptions about the staining quality of the tissue. In this
   paper, we present a new Multi-Pass Adaptive Voting (MPAV) for nuclei
   detection which is specifically geared towards images with poor quality
   staining and noise on account of tissue preparation artifacts. The MPAV
   utilizes the symmetric property of nuclear boundary and adaptively
   selects gradient from edge fragments to perform voting for a potential
   nucleus location. The MPAV was evaluated in three cohorts with different
   staining methods: Hematoxylin \& Eosin, CD31 \& Hematoxylin, and Ki-67
   and where most of the nuclei were unevenly and imprecisely stained.
   Across a total of 47 images and nearly 17,700 manually labeled nuclei
   serving as the ground truth, MPAV was able to achieve a superior
   performance, with an area under the precision-recall curve (AUC) of
   0.73. Additionally, MPAV also outperformed three state-of-the-art nuclei
   detection methods, a single pass voting method, a multi-pass voting
   method, and a deep learning based method.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a combined analytical and empirical model for
   predicting the signal loss effects of metallic drilling rig structures
   on radio-frequency electromagnetic waves used by wireless sensor
   networks (WSNs) installed on a drilling rig. The model is based on the
   combination of free space path loss and the excess loss caused by the
   metallic structure separately. The authors combine both losses to
   predict the overall loss of signal strength. The model has been
   validated against field data collected from multiple drilling rigs.
   Further modification of the model to include the effects of different
   signal frequencies is under way. They present simulation results from
   OMNeT++ based on their model, to establish the packet loss and energy
   consumption expected for a real WSN. They also present a novel dynamic
   multi-hop routing protocol, which improves network performance by
   removing the constraints of single-hop forwarding. The algorithm directs
   packets to their destination via a selected node within a routing
   `cluster'. By combining their channel model and routing protocol, they
   are able to achieve 100\% packet success, while setting transmit power
   levels appropriately to achieve the longest possible network lifetime.}},

Title = {{A monochromatic x-ray irradiation system for in vitro studies at
   synchrotron beamlines}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS \& ENGINEERING EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The use of synchrotron light in radiobiological keV x-ray in vitro
   studies has been accompanied by compromises in culture conditions and
   sample handling procedures. The presented monochromatic x-ray system
   bridges the gap between synchrotron science and cell biology by
   facilitating the irradiation of adherent cells uninterruptedly
   maintained under cell type-specific conditions throughout the entire
   experiment. The system for horizontal irradiations consists of a single
   crystal Laue monochromator, a beam monitor, and a scanning sample stage.
   As implemented at the BMITBM beamline, the system enables homogeneous
   cell culture irradiations with intense and purely monochromatic x-ray
   beams (10-30 keV). The first MCF-7 dose-response study demonstrates how
   the establishment of a stress-minimized experimental procedure leads to
   accurate and precise in vitro irradiation results. The cell survival as
   a function of the surface dose is well described by a first-order
   exponential decay, indicating that the cellular damage induced by 11.9
   keV x-rays is comparable to the lethal effects caused by high linear
   energy transfer particles. The system design opens up the pathway for
   combined live-cell imaging and monochromatic keV x-ray applications,

Abstract = {{A system identification strategy to identify the parameters of a
   small-scale unmanned helicopter's nonlinear physics-based model suitable
   for nonlinear control design applications is described. A time-domain
   technique, which allows for the identification of a nonlinear model of

   ground and flight-test data is used to parameterize the model. The
   ground test data are used to identify the physical parameters of the
   main and tail rotors such as the lift and drag coefficients using an
   aerodynamic force measurement test bed. The unknown parameters of the
   rotor dynamics and empennage drag are identified using flight-test data
   and applying a nonlinear least-squares method. A 10-degree-of-freedom
   nonlinear physics-based model including rotor and stabilizer bar
   dynamics is developed and validated using flight-test data. The results
   indicate that the overall response of the identified nonlinear model of

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a major infrastructure risk assessment framework

   assessment model, and applies it to a cross-sea route project that is
   expected to connect Guangdong Province and Hainan Island. Two
   alternative schemes for the cross-sea route namely the tunnel scheme and
   the bridge scheme, are compared in terms of risks during their different
   project time spans. Results indicate that the risk of the bridge scheme
   is larger than that of the tunnel scheme, and that the risk will
   increase over time. Several risk factors, including damage to commercial
   interests of local fishermen, damage to habitat for rare and endangered
   animals, financial crisis and sea storm surge, are identified as
   significant factors during the implementation of the tunnel scheme. This
   approach can be used as a decision tool to identify, analyze and assess
   the risks existing in the major infrastructure projects. (C) 2015

Title = {{New Insight on Carbonate-Heavy-Oil Recovery: Pore-Scale Mechanisms of
   Post-Solvent Carbon Dioxide Foam/Polymer-Enhanced-Foam Flooding}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Carbonate reservoirs, deposited in the Western Canadian Sedimentary
   Basin (WCSB), hold significant reserves of heavy crude oil that can be
   recovered by nonthermal processes. Solvent, gas, water, and
   water-alternating-gas (WAG) injections are the main methods for
   carbonate-heavy-oil recovery in the WCSB. Because of the fractured
   nature of carbonate formations, many advantages of these production
   methods are usually in contrast with their low recovery factor.
   Alternative processes are therefore needed to increase oil-sweep
   efficiency from carbonate reservoirs. Foam/polymer-enhanced-foam (PEF)
   injection has gained interest in conventional heavy-oil recovery in
   recent times. However, the oil-recovery process by foam, especially PEF,
   in conjunction with solvent injection is less understood in fractured
   heavy-oil-carbonate reservoirs. The challenge is to understand how the
   combination of surfactant, gas, and polymer allows us to better access
   the matrix and efficiently sweep the oil.
   This study introduces a new approach to access the unrecovered heavy oil
   in fractured-carbonate reservoirs. Carbon dioxide (CO2) foam and CO2 PEF
   were used to decrease oil saturation after solvent injection, and their
   performance was compared with gas injection. A specially designed
   fractured micromodel was used to visualize the pore-scale phenomena
   during CO2-foam/PEF injection. In addition, the static bulk performances
   of CO2 foam/PEF were analyzed in the presence of heavy crude oil. A
   high-definition camera was used to capture high-quality images.
   The results showed that in both static and dynamic studies the PEF had
   high stability. Unlike CO2 PEF, CO2 foam lamella broke much faster and
   resulted in the collapse of the foam during heavy-oil recovery after
   solvent flooding. It appeared that foam played a greater role than just
   gas-mobility control. Foam showed outstanding improvement in heavy-oil
   recovery over gas injection. The presence of foam bubbles was the main
   reason to improve heavy-oil-sweep efficiency in heterogeneous porous
   media. When the foam bubbles advanced through pore throats, the local
   capillary number increased enough to displace the emulsified oil. PEF
   bubbles generated an additional force to divert surfactant/polymer into
   the matrix. Overall, CO2 foam and PEF remarkably increased heavy-oil
   recovery after solvent injection into the fractured reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the initial geometric imperfections on the buckling
   response of grade X-100 UOE manufactured pipes are studied through
   finite element analysis (FEA). The initial geometric imperfections had
   been previously measured and quantified in terms of deviations in
   outside radius (OR) and wall thickness. The measurement results are used
   to develop imperfection models to be incorporated into buckling
   analysis. The OR deviation is seen to have insignificant effects on the
   buckling behavior, while the effects of thickness deviation are seen to
   be profound for both unpressurized and pressurized pipes. The geometric
   imperfection models are further investigated through a sensitivity study
   to isolate the most influential imperfection aspects on the buckling
   resistance of UOE pipes. A parametric study is carried out using these
   models and shows that excluding geometric imperfections will always
   result in overprediction of buckling capacity irrespective of D/t
   ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic radiation emitted from hot objects represents a sizable
   source of energy, one that in most applications is not harvested
   efficiently. Even for a blackbody at 800 degrees C, the radiation
   intensity peaks near 2.7 mu m wavelength, and this requires a
   semiconductor absorber having a band gap in the short-wavelength
   infrared and beyond to enable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) heat recovery.
   Here we report the first solution-processed TPV device to harvest
   efficiently 800 degrees C heat. The active layer consists of colloidal
   quantum dots (CQDs), infrared-absorbing nanoparticles synthesized using
   a scalable solution-based method, having 0.75 eV band gap. We construct
   rectifying junction devices based on controllably p- and n-doped CQD
   solids that benefit from a gradient in electron affinity that extends
   over the devices' thickness. The gradient doped architecture relies on
   engineered charge carrier drift and overcomes the existing limitations
   of small band gap CQD solids. The devices provide 2.7\% efficiency in
   the conversion of optical power from above-band gap photons from a
   blackbody source at 800 +/- 20 degrees C into electrical power. The
   cells were thermally stable up to 140 degrees C, increasing the promise
   of CQD solids for TPV applications.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing trend in adoption of plug-in hybrid and plug-in
   electric vehicles, they will play a prominent role in the future
   electric energy market by acting as responsive loads to increase the
   grid stability and facilitate the integration of renewables. However,
   due to the large number of controllable devices in the future grid,
   central vehicle to grid (V2G) management would be challenging and
   vulnerable to single points of failure. This paper introduces a novel
   distributed approach for optimal management of unidirectional V2G
   considering multiple energy suppliers. Each charging station as well as
   each energy supplier is equipped with a local price regulator to control
   the price paid to the energy suppliers and the price paid by the
   vehicles through coordination with their neighbors. In response to the
   updated prices, the vehicles adjust their charging rates and energy
   suppliers adjust their production to maximize their benefit. The main
   advantages of the proposed approach are that it manages unidirectional
   V2G in a fully distributed way considering multiple energy suppliers and
   vehicles, and it converges to the global optimum despite the greedy
   behavior of the individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses an important problem of integrating structural
   optimization into a traditional CAx system and therefore, realizes an
   integrated product design-optimization system. Specifically, structural
   optimization has been embedded as an independent module of most
   commercial CAx systems. It mainly communicates with CAD but can only
   have the STL-based CAD geometry as input. The knowledge-level
   information transfer is not supported which causes the optimization
   intent not fully captured. The consequence could be quite negative that
   the optimization process generates unsatisfactory or even useless design
   solutions and tedious manual efforts are required to modify or even
   redesign the immature solutions, which reduces the overall design
   efficiency and quality. To fix this issue, this paper proposes an
   integrated product design-optimization system by enabling the complete
   information transfer between CAD and structural optimization modules.
   Interfacing rules have been defined to enable the complete information
   transfer and the associative optimization feature concept is proposed to
   manage the transferred information for the structural optimization
   module. Furthermore, knowledge based reasoning is performed to capture
   the full optimization intent in order to create a fit-for-purpose
   optimization model, including both the optimization problem formulation
   and the solution strategy. For technical merits, this integrated product
   design-optimization system robustly ensures the timely and high-quality
   product design delivery which is superior to the existing commercial
   systems. Effectiveness of this proposed system has been proven through a
   few case studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the
   transport properties of gases (oxygen, nitrogen, and methane) in
   amorphous cis-1,4-polyisoprene over a wide range of temperatures. The
   COMPASS force field was used as the molecular mechanics force field in
   the simulations. Experimental values of density and glass transition
   temperature were successfully reproduced using the atomistic potentials
   determined by COMPASS. Diffusion coefficients were determined from long
   NVT simulation times (up to 3 or 1.5 ns) in the temperature range of
   278-378 K. The diffusion coefficients calculated from the Einstein
   relationship agree well with available experimental data. Further
   studies on the temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients indicate
   that curvature is observed in the Arrhenius plot of diffusivity versus
   inverse temperature for methane, but the plots are linear over the
   investigated temperature range for oxygen and nitrogen. These simulation
   results are useful to understand the temperature dependence of diffusion
   coefficients, and provide a basis for the determination of diffusion
   coefficients at high temperatures and the modeling of thermo-oxidative
   degradation of polyisoprene.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed resource allocation and sharing can often be formulated as a
   utility maximization problem, with the objective being the sum of user
   utilities minus a coupled cost. A traditional distributed solution to
   such problems, called ``consistency pricing,{''} decouples the objective
   function via dual decomposition, which is then iteratively solved by the
   subgradient method. However, such gradient-based approaches may require
   many iterations of message passing to converge, which may not be
   sufficient in large-scale real-time applications. In this paper, we
   propose a new fixed-point-like distributed solution to resource sharing
   problems with coupled objective functions. While preserving the simple
   pricing interpretation, our approach speeds up convergence by exploiting
   the structural difference between user utilities and the coupled cost
   function. We theoretically analyze the asynchronous algorithm
   convergence conditions based on contraction mapping. Through a detailed
   case study of cloud bandwidth reservation based on real-world workload
   traces, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm over
   state-of-the-art distributed optimization techniques including gradient
   descent, dual decomposition, and ADMM. In addition, we also extend the
   proposed algorithm to approach a more general class of consensus
   optimization problems with not only a coupled objective function, but
   also a certain class of coupled constraints.}},

Title = {{Effect of Swelling Clay Minerals (Montmorillonite and Illite-Smectite)
   on Nonaqueous Bitumen Extraction from Alberta Oil Sands}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Two natural clay standards, dominated by montmorillonite (SWy-2) and
   Illite-smectite (ISCz-1), were mixed with bitumen and reacted for 8
   days. The clay-bitumen mixtures were then washed three times each with
   cyclohexane to extract bitumen from the clays. The aim was to better
   understand the role of swelling clay minerals on nonaqueous solvent
   bitumen extraction. The experimental results showed that montmorillonite
   and Mite-smectite contained 4.6 to 8.2 wt \% and 7.1 to 8.2 wt \% of
   carbon after cyclohexane bitumen extraction, respectively. The residual
   organic material-after cyclohexane bitumen extraction was retained on
   the outer and inner (interlayer space) surfaces of the swelling clay
   mineral particles in the form of patchy rather than continuous coating.
   Cation exchange capacity (CEC), specific surface area (SSA), and layer
   charge density (LCD) were all reduced by the reaction with bitumen due
   to organic coatings on the clay mineral surfaces and/or due to gluing of
   clay particles to aggregates. Comparison of the present study with our
   recent paper revealed that swelling and nonswelling clay minerals
   reacted differently with bitumen. These differences are reported and
   discussed in the present study. Overall, the results indicate that clays
   with, larger SSAs retain more residual organic matter after nonaqueous
   solvent bitumen extraction within the studied experimental conditions.
   In the case of montmorillonite SWy-2, the amount of carbon after
   nonaqueous solvent bitumen extraction was heavily affected by different
   relative humidity (RH) conditions. The pretreatment of SWy-2 at higher
   RH conditions dramatically increased the amount of residual organic
   matter. This is likely related to the opening of the interlayer space
   (i.e., swelling) of montmorillonite upon exposure to higher RH and
   subsequent retention of a larger amount of organic material.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of 3-D integration, Cu electroplating has become the most
   popular method to metallize the through silicon via, due to the higher
   conductivity of Cu compared to W and doped poly-silicon and the good
   compatibility with other microfabrication procedures. However, many
   problems embedded in this technique, such as long deposition time,
   relatively high complexity, and environmental pollution, are still
   unsolved. In this paper, we utilized the Ag-based epoxy to fill the vias
   with the assistance of vacuum pressure to solve all these problems. It
   was found that the vacuum level played a more important role than the
   suction time in this process, as the filling depth for the vias with a
   diameter of 100 mu m and a depth of 500 mu m grew more visibly in a
   fixed lifespan when the vacuum pressure elevated from 0.2 to 1.6 kPa,
   and to realize a 100\% filling ratio, 1.6 kPa and 3 s would be needed at
   least. By running the basic two-point probe test for two times without
   any printed circuit board, the volume resistance of fully filled vias
   was measured, and the results indicated that the average resistance was
   similar to 25 Omega. During the temperature increase from room
   temperature to 120 degrees C, this material established good stability
   in resistivity as the change in via resistance was negligible. The
   adhesion quality between this material and Cu-based bonding pad was
   tested as well, and the result was acceptable.}},

Abstract = {{Complex fuzzy logic is a new multivalued logic system that has emerged
   in the last decade. At this time, there are a limited number of known
   instances of complex fuzzy logic, and only a partial exploration of
   their properties. There has also been relatively little progress in
   developing interpretations of complex-valued membership grades. In this
   paper, we address both problems by examining the recently developed
   Pythagorean fuzzy sets (a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets).
   We first characterize two lattices that have been suggested for
   Pythagorean fuzzy sets and then extend these results to the unit disc of
   the complex plane. We thereby identify two new complete, distributive
   lattices over the unit disc, and explore interpretations of them based
   on fuzzy antonyms and negations.}},

Abstract = {{Granulation of information by using type-2 fuzzy sets is receiving more
   attention nowadays. This is due to the superior capability of type-2
   fuzzy sets in handling the data uncertainty. From a theoretical
   perspective, a set containing type-2 fuzzy sets has no trivial geometric
   structure; therefore, a proper metric cannot be easily defined. As a
   consequence, common pattern recognition systems, which in one way or
   another rely on some (geo)metric structure of the input space, are not
   easily applicable to a space of type-2 fuzzy sets. In this paper, we
   study the problem of designing a classifier in the input space of type-2
   fuzzy sets. Type-2 fuzzy sets are hence interpreted as (granular)
   patterns forming a given input dataset. By decomposing a type-2 fuzzy
   set into a sequence of simpler (lower type) fuzzy sets, we explore the
   possibility of defining and building dissimilarity and kernel-based
   classification systems on input spaces of type-2 fuzzy sets. Such an
   interpretation provided in terms of sequences allows us to conceive an
   effective sequence matching strategy, which can be suitably embedded
   into well-established pattern recognition systems. We support the
   methodological developments by performing experiments on synthetically
   generated classification problems for datasets composed of type-2 fuzzy
   sets, with adjustable and controlled level of difficulty. Results are
   promising and suggest to further investigate on the possibility of
   interpreting type-2 fuzzy sets as input patterns of a given data-driven
   inference system.}},

Abstract = {{Serious labor shortages in the construction industry have emerged in
   China in recent years. This has led to a significant need for the
   industry to improve the poor accommodations and inferior conditions of
   living quarters for migrant workers by applying both technical and
   management methods. In order to address the problem of improving the
   accommodations for rural migrant construction workers in urban China,
   this paper uses modular construction technology to develop an innovative
   integrated prefabricated (prefab) accommodation system for construction
   workers on site. The current status of the traditional construction
   workers' quarters is investigated to reveal the most urgent problems in
   terms of health, safety, and environmental considerations. By analyzing
   barriers that block innovation to improved workers' quarters, the
   integrated prefab accommodation system is proposed in detail, with the
   quarters' design and operational management mode taken into account. The
   developed system can provide more comfortable accommodations and living
   conditions for migrant on-site workers, with a lower residential density
   and a cleaner, safer, and higher-quality lifestyle. A case study of a
   real-world pilot project in China is studied to validate the economic
   feasibility and applicability of the innovative integrated prefab
   quarters system. Results indicate that migrant workers should only pay
   about 2-3 Yuan per day, which is 1-1.5\% of their daily income, for the
   use of the integrated prefab quarter system. The developed system
   provides a novel construction management mode for practitioners in the
   industry and can further increase the productivity of a project due to
   reduced physical and mental health problems of migrant workers. It is
   suggested that the developed system and the business mode are promoted
   in regions where there are large numbers of migrant construction
   workers.}},

   Characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
   scanning/transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive
   spectroscopy, and fast Fourier transformation were employed on the oxide
   scales. The elemental and phase analyses indicated that long term
   exposure to the SCW resulted in the formation of scales identified as
   Fe3O4 (outer layer), Fe-Cr spinel (inner layer), Cr2O3 (transition
   layer) on the substrate, and Ni-enrichment (chrome depleted region) in
   the alloy 310S. It was found that the layer thickness and weight gain
   vs. exposure time followed parabolic law. The oxidation mechanism and
   scales grown on the alloy 310S stainless steel exposed to SCW are

   solution for flow in a straight rectangular channel and the full 3D
   numerical COMSOL Navier-Stokes solver for flow in a T-channel.
   Comparable accuracy to the full 3D numerical solution was achieved by
   using only three Fourier terms with a significant decrease in
   computation time. The quasi-3D model was used to model flows in a
   micro-flow cytometer chip on a desktop computer and good agreement
   between the simulation and the experimental results was found.}},

Abstract = {{The paper addresses the challenge of measuring water content and
   evaporative fluxes from oil sands soft tailings surfaces using
   hyperspectral observations. Hyperspectral time-series laboratory
   observations were collected from four different mature fine tailings
   (MFT) samples displaying variations in swelling potential and bitumen
   concentration. The samples were allowed to evaporate from an initial
   state of water saturation to an air-dried state. From these data,
   several spectral features were evaluated to predict water content and
   normalized evaporation rate from the optically sensed portion of the
   tailings surface (less than a few hundred micrometres). For the samples
   tested, the best estimate of moisture content was achieved using the
   normalized soil moisture index (NSMI) index (coefficient of
   determination R-2 = 0.97). The absolute reflectance at 1920 nm was found
   to be the best spectral estimator of normalized evaporation (R-2 =
   0.97), with the NSMI index also being valuable (R-2 = 0.95). In both
   instances, the NSMI index may be of value for estimations attempted in
   the field. Remote estimation of moisture content and evaporation could
   help tailings managers assess the drying process to determine when the
   deposit has stopped drying at the surface and decide when the next lift
   should be deposited. In future efforts, the models obtained from this
   laboratory investigation will be assessed for their applicability in
   field settings and validated using concurrent sampling.}},

   is used in conjunction with another microfluidic metal post to design a
   reconfigurable 1-pole band-pass filter with a transmission zero in the
   stop-band. The filter is configured for two states. The measured
   insertion loss of the filter at f(0) is 2.3 dB and 2.8 dB while the

Abstract = {{Vector quantization (VQ) is a general data compression technique that
   has a scalable implementation complexity and potentially a high
   compression ratio. In this paper, a novel implementation of VQ using
   stochastic circuits is proposed and its performance is evaluated against
   conventional binary designs. The stochastic and binary designs are
   compared for the same compression quality, and the circuits are
   synthesized for an industrial 28-nm cell library. The effects of varying
   the sequence length of the stochastic representation are studied with
   respect to throughput per area (TPA) and energy per operation (EPO). The
   stochastic implementations are shown to have higher EPOs than the
   conventional binary implementations due to longer latencies. When a
   shorter encoding sequence with 512 bits is used to obtain a lower
   quality compression measured by the L-1-norm, squared L-2-norm, and
   third-law errors, the TPA ranges from 1.16 to 2.56 times than that of
   the binary implementation with the same compression quality. Thus,
   although the stochastic implementation underperforms for a high
   compression quality, it outperforms the conventional binary design in
   terms of TPA for a reduced compression quality. By exploiting the
   progressive precision feature of a stochastic circuit, a readily
   scalable processing quality can be attained by halting the computation
   after different numbers of clock cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-weld creep testing conducted at 650 degrees C under 69 MPa stress
   has reproduced either the Type I or Type IV failure mode in Grade 91
   welds, depending on the post-weld heat treatment procedures. Welds
   post-weld heat treated below the An temperature have ruptured in the
   Type VI failure mode, while welds heat-treated above the An temperature
   of the alloy have ruptured in the Type I failure mode. Heat-treatments
   at lower temperatures and shorter durations have produced a reduced
   creep rate. The accelerated short term stress-relaxation test has been
   conducted to obtain the input creep rates for a finite element model for
   the cross-weld creep testing. The model predicted secondary creep rates
   are in good agreement with the results from the conventional cross-weld
   creep tests. From the finite element model, the creep damage by
   cavitation is believed to start at regions where the first principal
   stress and stress triaxiality concentrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties, including yield stress, relaxation behavior,
   moduli (elastic modulus at the strain of 0.5\% and strain hardening
   modulus at strains above 70\%), viscous stress, and quasi-static stress,
   are compared between polyethylene (PE) pipes that are made of PE80 and
   PE100 resins. The mechanical properties are measured using D-split
   tensile test on modified notched pipe ring specimens. The comparison
   includes the influence of strain rate (by the change of crosshead speed)
   on the yield strength and influence of pre-strain on the relaxation
   behavior and the modulus values. A two-stage approach is used to
   characterize the influence of pre-strain on the moduli, to ensure that
   viscous recovery from the first-stage of the test, to introduce the
   pre-strain, does not affect the modulus measurement from the
   second-stage test. The results show that elastic modulus, yield stress,
   strain hardening modulus, viscous stress, and quasi-static stress for
   PE100 are higher than those for PE80, but PE80 shows higher resistance
   to stress relaxation. The results also show that with the increase in
   the pre-strain level, the elastic modulus drops but the strain hardening
   modulus remains relatively constant.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Polyimide is one of the most popular substrate materials for the
   microfabrication of flexible electronics, while polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS) is the most widely used stretchable substrate/encapsulant
   material. These two polymers are essential in fabricating devices for
   microfluidics, bioelectronics, and the internet of things; bonding these
   materials together is a crucial challenge. In this work, we employ click
   chemistry at room temperature to irreversibly bond polyimide and PDMS
   through thiol-epoxy bonds using two different methods. In the first
   method, we functionalize the surfaces of the PDMS and polyimide
   substrates with mercaptosilanes and epoxysilanes, respectively, for the
   formation of a thiol-epoxy bond in the click reaction. In the second
   method, we functionalize one or both surfaces with mercaptosilane and
   introduce an epoxy adhesive layer between the two surfaces. When the
   surfaces are bonded using the epoxy adhesive without any surface
   functionalization, an extremely small peel strength (<0.01 N mm(-1)) is
   measured with a peel test, and adhesive failure occurs at the PDMS
   surface. With surface functionalization, however, remarkably higher peel
   strengths of similar to 0.2 N mm(-1) (method 1) and >0.3 N mm(-1)
   (method 2) are observed, and failure occurs by tearing of the PDMS
   layer. We envision that the novel processing route employing click
   chemistry can be utilized in various cases of stretchable and flexible
   device fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Spinal cord injury causes a drastic loss of motor, sensory
   and autonomic function. The goal of this project was to investigate the
   use of intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) for producing long distances
   of walking over ground. ISMS is an electrical stimulation method
   developed for restoring motor function by activating spinal networks
   below the level of an injury. It produces movements of the legs by
   stimulating the ventral horn of the lumbar enlargement using fine
   penetrating electrodes (<= 50 mu m diameter). Approach. In each of five
   adult cats (4.2-5.5 kg), ISMS was applied through 16 electrodes
   implanted with tips targeting lamina IX in the ventral horn bilaterally.
   A desktop system implemented a physiologically-based control strategy
   that delivered different stimulation patterns through groups of
   electrodes to evoke walking movements with appropriate limb kinematics
   and forces corresponding to swing and stance. Each cat walked over an
   instrumented 2.9 m walkway and limb kinematics and forces were recorded.
   Main results. Both propulsive and supportive forces were required for
   over-ground walking. Cumulative walking distances ranging from 609 to
   835 m (longest tested) were achieved in three animals. In these three
   cats, the mean peak supportive force was 3.5 +/- 0.6 N corresponding to
   full-weight-support of the hind legs, while the angular range of the
   hip, knee, and ankle joints were 23.1 +/- 2.0 degrees, 29.1 +/- 0.2
   degrees, and 60.3 +/- 5.2 degrees, respectively. To further demonstrate
   the viability of ISMS for future clinical use, a prototype implantable
   module was successfully implemented in a subset of trials and produced
   comparable walking performance. Significance. By activating inherent
   locomotor networks within the lumbosacral spinal cord, ISMS was capable
   of producing bilaterally coordinated and functional over-ground walking
   with current amplitudes < 100 mu A. These exciting results suggest that
   ISMS may be an effective intervention for restoring functional walking
   after spinal cord injury.}},

Abstract = {{We present an efficient numerical scheme (based on complex variable
   techniques) to calculate the effective thermal expansion coefficients of
   a composite containing unidirectional periodic fibers. Moreover, the
   mechanical behavior of the fibers incorporates interface effects
   allowing the ensuing analytical model of the composite to accommodate
   deformations at the nanoscale. The resulting `nanocomposite' is
   subjected to a uniform temperature variation which leads to periodic
   deformations within the plane perpendicular to the fibers and uniform
   deformations along the direction of the fibers. These deformation fields
   are determined by analyzing a representative unit cell of the composite
   subsequently leading to the corresponding effective thermal expansion
   coefficients. Numerical results are illustrated via several physical
   examples. We find that the influence of interface effects on the
   effective thermal expansion coefficients (in particular that
   corresponding to the transverse direction in the plane perpendicular to
   the fibers) decays rapidly as the fibers become harder. In addition, by
   comparing the results obtained here with those from effective medium
   theories, we show that the latter may induce significant errors in the
   determination of the effective transverse thermal expansion coefficient
   when the fibers are much softer than the matrix and the fiber volume
   fraction is relatively high.}},

Abstract = {{We incorporate the mechanics of the interface to construct optimal

   circle in an infinite imaginary plane with specific boundary value on
   the unit circle. We illustrate such shapes using several examples. We
   show that the incorporation of interface mechanics has a significant
   effect on the design of such shapes and hence on the existence of these
   inclusions at the nanoscale. In addition, we show that if the period of
   the inclusion-matrix system exceeds roughly seven times the inclusion
   size, such shapes can be treated essentially as being equivalent to
   those of a single inclusion enclosing the same uniform internal strain
   in the presence of identical bulk and interface material constants,

Abstract = {{Intraoral ultrasonography uses high-frequency mechanical waves to study
   dento-periodontium. Besides the advantages of portability and
   cost-effectiveness, ultrasound technique has no ionizing radiation.
   Previous studies employed a single transducer or an array of transducer
   elements, and focused on enamel thickness and distance measurement. This
   study used a phased array system with a 128-element array transducer to
   image dento-periodontal tissues. We studied two porcine lower incisors
   from a 6-month-old piglet using 20-MHz ultrasound. The high-resolution
   ultrasonographs clearly showed the cross-sectional morphological images
   of the hard and soft tissues. The investigation used an integration of
   waveform analysis, travel-time calculation, and wavefield simulation to
   reveal the nature of the ultrasound data, which makes the study novel.
   With the assistance of time-distance radio-frequency records, we
   robustly justified the enamel-dentin interface, dentin-pulp interface,
   and the cemento-enamel junction. The alveolar crest level, the location
   of cemento-enamel junction, and the thickness of alveolar crest were
   measured from the images and compared favorably with those from the cone
   beam computed tomography with less than 10\% difference. This
   preliminary and fundamental study has reinforced the conclusions from
   previous studies, that ultrasonography has great potential to become a
   non-invasive diagnostic imaging tool for quantitative assessment of
   periodontal structures and better delivery of oral care.}},

Abstract = {{A layerwise theory within the framework of first-order shear deformation
   theory is introduced to investigate the postbuckling behavior and the
   delamination growth of geometrically imperfect composite plates. The
   Ritz method is adopted and the displacement fields are assumed in a form
   of polynomial series leading to a reduced computational cost. The
   proposed method is capable of predicting both the local buckling of the
   delaminated sublaminates and the global buckling of the plate. Two types
   of delaminations are considered: through-the-width and edge
   delaminations. To inhibit the penetration of delarninated domain,
   contact constraints are applied. The debonding of adjacent plies is
   modeled to illustrate the effect of delamination growth on the
   postbuckling response of the delaminated composite plate. A parametric
   study is carried out to investigate the influence of size and location
   of delamination as well as the amplitude of imperfection on the
   postbuckling behavior with concurrent propagation of delamination. A
   three dimensional finite element analysis is also implemented. A
   comparison study is conducted for numerical predictions of the developed
   theoretical model and implemented finite element simulation. It is found
   that the snap-back instability can occur during the delamination growth.
   Moreover, the results show that predictions based upon an analysis
   without consideration for the delamination growth could not be reliable.

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate the intra- and inter-observer
   reliability of the axial vertebral rotation (AVR) measurements of
   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) using the center of lamina (COL)
   method on ultrasound transverse images.
   Three cadaver vertebrae were scanned with 42 AVR configurations by both
   ultrasound and radiograph. In this in vitro study, four observers
   measured the AVR using the COL method on ultrasound transverse images
   and three observers measured the AVR using the Stokes' method on
   radiographs. In the in vivo study, 13 AIS subjects were recruited.
   Eighteen spinal curvatures were identified and 48 vertebrae were
   selected for the AVR measurements. Two observers performed the AVR
   measurements on both the ultrasound images and radiographs. All
   measurements were performed twice with 1 week interval apart to reduce
   memory bias. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), mean absolute
   differences (MAD), and standard deviation (SD) were used to analyze the
   intra- and inter-observer reliability of the AVR measurements. The
   Bland-Altman plot was used to analyze the 95 \% limit of the differences
   between the two methods.
   The proposed COL method had high intra- and inter-observer reliability
   on both the in vitro and in vivo studies (ICCs > 0.91, MADs < 1.4A
   degrees) and agreed well with the experimental setup (ICCs > 0.96, MADs
   < 2.3A degrees). The COL method showed good agreement with the Stokes'
   method for the in vitro study (ICC 0.84-0.85, MAD 4.5A degrees-5.0A
   degrees), while poor agreement for the in vivo study (ICC 0.49-0.54, MAD
   2.7A degrees-3.5A degrees).
   The pilot study indicated the proposed COL method was a simple and
   reliable method to evaluate the AVR on ultrasound images.
   Standardization of the posture during ultrasound scan and taking
   radiograph is important.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale plant-wide processes have become more common and monitoring
   of such processes is imperative. This work focuses on establishing a
   distributed monitoring scheme incorporating multivariate statistical
   analysis and Bayesian method for large-scale plant-wide processes.
   First, the necessity of distributed monitoring is demonstrated by
   theoretical analysis on the impact of process decomposition on
   multivariate statistical process monitoring performance. Second, a
   stochastic optimization algorithm based performance-driven process
   decomposition method is proposed which aims to achieve the best possible
   monitoring performance from process decomposition aspect. Based on the
   obtained sub-blocks, local monitors are established to characterize
   local process behaviors, and then a Bayesian fault diagnosis system is
   established to identify the underlying process status of the entire
   process. The proposed distributed monitoring scheme is applied on a
   numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process.
   Comparison results to some state-of-the-art methods indicate the
   efficiency and feasibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, engineering companies face the challenge of delivering
   complex engineering project in a compressed time frame, which warrants
   concurrent and collaborative engineering. Due to the tedious
   dependencies embedded in collaborative domains, engineering change
   propagation is commonly a challenge and the procedure is carried out by
   engineers manually without systematic consistency check. Design change
   impacts are difficult to predict. To address the above challenge, an
   explicit and comprehensive engineering constraint modeling method is
   investigated according to a feature-based engineering scheme. To
   represent the network of constraints, a dynamically generated feature
   parameter association map is developed to analyze the associations among
   those parameters. Then, a dynamic mechanism of identifying the locally
   admissible value ranges of those related constraint parameters has been
   proposed in order to quickly accept design changes or to identify
   potential design conflicts. This mechanism then determines the
   admissible domain for the variable arrays in the formulated constraint
   satisfaction problem (CSP). Consequently, a well-controlled and
   progressively expanded change propagation method is proposed. This
   progressively expanded CSP solving approach is dynamic and incremental
   based on the association map. This proposed method is demonstrated to be
   effective to assist engineers with a typical intelligent change
   propagation solution.}},

   is investigated with this experimentally validated multidomain model. We
   find that the effectiveness of the voltage amplification in NCFETs is
   strongly dependent on the viscosity coefficient rho of the
   ferroelectric, and that a low rho (<0.1 Omega . m) is required for the
   operation at the high gigahertz frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional Bayesian fault diagnosis assumes that all measurements are
   available synchronously; however, this condition does not always hold in
   practical industry because a process can be characterized by multiple
   sampling or transmitting rates. This paper introduces a Bayesian fault
   diagnosis system incorporating both historical and online information to
   address the asynchronous measurement problem. First, the Expectation
   Maximization approach is utilized to deal with the historical
   asynchronous measurements; second, the online incomplete measurements
   are handled through a Bayesian marginalization method within a moving
   horizon. Then, a Bayesian diagnosis system revealing both the underlying
   fault status of the whole plant and the unavailable statuses of the
   corresponding local units is established, which is more robust for
   practical application. The proposed scheme is tested on a numerical
   example, the distributed monitoring problem of Tennessee Eastman
   benchmark process, and the distributed monitoring problem of an
   industrial tail gas treatment plant. Monitoring results demonstrate the
   feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Concentric neutral cables are commonly used in medium-voltage power
   distribution systems. Presently, the cable ampacity calculation methods
   can take into account only the fundamental frequency current and the
   harmonic currents in the phase conductors. In reality, the cable neutral
   can carry fundamental frequency and harmonic currents (induced and
   unbalanced), leading to a further increase of cable temperature. In view
   of the increased harmonics and load imbalance in power distribution
   systems and the need to determine their impact on concentric neutral
   cables, this paper presents a method to estimate the ampacity of
   concentric neutral cables, especially for multi-grounded neutral
   systems. The proposed cable derating factor can be used to determine the
   increase in cable loading caused by unbalanced load and harmonics. A
   chart is also presented as a simplified method for cable ampacity and
   cable loading estimation, for which only the total harmonic distortion
   and zero-sequence current ratio of the phase current are needed.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Arcing fault is a special fault in medium-voltage distribution lines
   which can potentially cause shock hazard, apparatuses failure, and wild
   fire. Due to its short duration or low fault current, the detection of
   an arcing fault in distribution lines is highly challenging. In this
   paper, a model-based general detection method to separate an arcing
   fault from common nonarcing disturbances is proposed. First, an arcing
   fault model and a nonarcing disturbance model relating the disturbance
   characteristics, the load parameters, and the substation voltage and
   current waveforms are derived. For the accuracy of the models, the
   voltage drop on the distribution line is taken into consideration. Then,
   the procedure of arcing fault detection is introduced, including
   disturbance current calculation, parameters estimation,
   mean-square-error calculation, and decision making. An arcing fault is
   claimed when the measured voltage and current signals match the arcing
   fault model better than the nonarcing disturbance model. The method is
   tested on a modified standard test system using PSCAD/EMTDC considering
   different fault locations and scenarios. Simulation results show that
   the proposed detection method has high accuracy and is robust to fault
   distance, fault resistance, load current, and sampling rate. Laboratory
   experiments are also conducted to further validate the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Harmonic resonance has become an important concern for the application
   of shunt capacitors in recent years. A potential solution to address
   this challenge is to convert a shunt capacitor into a passive filter.
   This paper presents design methods to configure a shunt capacitor as a
   C-type filter or a third-order high-pass filter with guaranteed
   resonance-free performance. The concept of resonance-free condition is
   first introduced in this paper. It is then used to develop filter design
   methods that always meet the resonance-free condition. The two filter
   configurations are also compared. It was found that the third-order
   high-pass filter has more advantages than the C-type filter. Another
   useful finding of this work is that the filter parameters, as determined
   using the proposed design methods, are independent of the system
   conditions. As a result, a lookup table for the filter parameters has
   been created to facilitate immediate use by the industry.}},

Abstract = {{Switching of shunt capacitors can cause transient overvoltage. The

   studies directly inside commercial power-flow/short-circuit tools such

   conduct switching studies in the frequency domain. The frequency
   response of the study network is determined using the short-circuit
   solution engine of the host commercial software. This paper presents the
   theory, unique issues, and implementation details of the idea. The

Abstract = {{Recently, supporting the grid voltage and proper operation of the
   grid-connected converters (GCCs) under a wide range of grid voltage
   conditions have become major requirements. An analytical study is very
   useful for evaluating the supporting capability of the available control
   strategies in GCCs. This paper analytically studies, then modifies the
   supporting capability of three existing strategies. The contribution of
   this paper is two-fold: first, analytical expressions of instantaneous
   active/reactive powers oscillation and maximum phase currents are
   formulated and used to conduct several comparisons among different
   strategies. Second, based on the obtained formulas for the maximum phase
   currents, maximum allowable support (MAS) control schemes are proposed
   under unbalanced voltage conditions. The MAS control schemes have two
   important objectives: obtaining maximum active or reactive power
   delivery and simultaneously respecting the maximum phase currents under
   the unbalanced condition. The proposed equations can further estimate
   the maximum depth of the faulted voltage where each strategy is still
   able to satisfy the voltage support requirements imposed by the grid
   codes. The proposed expressions can also help all techniques to provide
   their maximum voltage or frequency support under the pre-set maximum
   phase current limitations. Different selected simulation and
   experimental tests are carried out for comparing the strategies, and
   validating the effectiveness of the proposed MAS equations.}},

   terms of pipe material, operation medium, properties of cracking zone
   material, and vertical displacements of inlet manifold and branch pipes
   is presented. The results revealed that cracking failures of three-way T
   junctions can be attributed to the stress concentration, which was
   caused by incongruous vertical deformations of inlet manifold and branch
   pipes, as well as variations in horizontal deformation heights of branch
   pipes. The incongruous displacements of inlet manifold and branch pipes
   were significantly mitigated by optimization design of the suspension
   device of the inlet pipe using the finite element method. The vertical
   displacement differences between inlet manifold and branch pipes and the
   east-west vertical displacement differences between the five branch
   pipes were reduced by 48 and 91.5\%, respectively. Bending of three-way
   T junctions was relieved and torsions were eliminated, resulting in
   mitigation of stress concentration. As a result, the maximum equivalence
   stress was reduced by 40\%, satisfying strength requirements. In this
   way, cracking failures of inlet manifold in hydrogen reformer furnace
   were prevented and stable hydrogen production was guaranteed.}},

Abstract = {{The flow characteristics in a rock-ramp fish pass can be significantly
   altered by the boulder arrangement. This study used a three-dimensional
   computational fluid dynamics solver to investigate flow characteristics
   for variations of discharge, channel slope and boulder size, spacing,
   and pattern. This study derived relationships for estimating water depth
   and velocity in a rock-ramp fish pass as a function of discharge and
   structure geometry. The flow resistance varies significantly with
   emergent boulder spacing and is nearly constant for submerged boulders.
   This study derives relationships for the drag coefficient and
   submergence ratio to forecast average flow velocity using a
   flow-resistance equation. Based on maximum velocity and a slow velocity
   zone, this study recommends effective boulder spacing in the
   longitudinal and transverse directions for two different boulder
   patterns. Finally, this study developed a design procedure for designing
   a rock-ramp fish pass.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{As the flow expands at expansions, generation of turbulence by shear
   layers results in the dissipation of energy of the mean flow. Based on
   simplified momentum equations, this head loss was previously estimated
   to be comparable to the velocity head of the incoming flow. In this
   paper, an approach based on turbulent jet theories is used to more
   accurately evaluate head loss at outlets. This approach is based on the
   similarity between the generation of a shear layer at an outlet to that
   of a turbulent jet at its origin. A general equation is derived for the
   variation of the kinetic energy of the flow from outlets of any geometry
   and the corresponding head loss coefficient. The equation is simplified
   for rectangular outlets, which are more common in practice.}},

Title = {{Air Entrainment in a Tall Plunging Flow Dropshaft}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A physical model study was conducted to investigate the mechanisms of
   air entrainment in a tall plunging dropshaft of 7.7m in height. The
   water flow in the dropshaft was observed to break up into small drops of
   approximately a few millimeters diameter at a drop height of 5 m. The
   dominant water drops were found to be approximately 2mm and they fell at
   an average speed of approximately 6m/s. An analytical model was
   developed to predict the amount of air drag and air flow needed on the
   basis of the momentum transfer from the water drops. The drag force
   induced a vertical air pressure gradient, and the model prediction
   compared well with the measurements. The entrained air flow rate
   increased with the water flow rate, but the ratio of the air to water
   flow rate decreased from approximately 20 to 5 times when the water flow
   rate increased from 3.9 to 47.7L/s. The air pressure was negative at the
   top of the dropshaft to allow the ambient air to be entrained, and it
   increased to the atmospheric pressure at the bottom at which point the
   outlet was open to the atmosphere. Additional experiments also were
   conducted with a weir of two different heights at the outlet pipe. At a
   large water flow rate, the weir would cause a significant blockage in
   air passage, resulting in a reduced air entrainment.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study on the breakup of a turbulent round-water jet in
   still air with a nozzle Reynolds number of 145,600 and Weber number of
   10,400 is reported. The visual structure of the falling water jet was
   recorded by a high-speed camera, and the characteristics of the falling
   jet were investigated. As the jet travelled from the nozzle, initial
   surface disturbances grew, and the lateral oscillation of the jet
   surface was amplified. The jet thickness initially increased and then
   decreased because of the combined effects of lateral turbulence
   fluctuation and gravitational acceleration. The amplitude of the surface
   disturbance grew in an exponential form. Based on the averaged
   transverse-water distribution, the water jet spreading rate was found to
   vary between 0.5 and 1.8\%, and the decay of the jet water core had an
   average value of 0.7\%. The onset of jet breakup was found at a distance
   of approximately 100times of the nozzle diameter. A theoretical model
   was developed for predicting the onset of jet breakup by comparing the
   dynamic air pressure with the restraining surface tension pressure. The
   velocity of the water drops released after breakup was measured and
   found to be approximately 0.8times of the local jet velocity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Untreated water can intrude into water distribution systems through pipe
   cracks and/or openings when negative pressure events occur inside
   drinking water pipelines. It is important to determine the magnitude of
   the possible intrusion event. To estimate the intrusion flow rate more
   accurately, the effects of surrounding soil must be considered. In this
   paper, an analytical relationship is derived by combining the seepage in
   soil and the flow through an orifice for predicting the intrusion flow
   rate for a circular orifice under steady-state conditions. The effect of
   the pipeline on reducing the flow area is incorporated in the model. An
   experimental study that simulates a buried pipeline was carried out to
   validate the accuracy of the improved model, and the analytical results
   fit well with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylenimine (PEI) is one of the most versatile non-viral vectors
   used in gene therapy, especially for delivering plasmid DNA to human
   cells. However, a good understanding of PEI binding to DNA, the
   fundamental basis for the functioning of PEI as a vector, has been
   missing in the literature. In this study, PEI (branched, 600Da) binding
   to DNA was examined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), quartz
   crystal microbalance (QCM) and a complementary set of analysis tools. We
   demonstrated that a separation between the binding heat and the
   condensation heat is needed and that the excluded site model should be
   used for PEI binding stage in the ITC analysis. The equilibrium constant
   for PEI binding to DNA was determined to be 2.5x10(5)m(-1) from the ITC
   analysis, and as 2.3x10(5)m(-1) from the QCM analysis. Additionally, we
   suggested that the 600Da branched PEI binds to the major groove of DNA
   and the rearrangement of PEI on DNA may be difficult to occur because of
   the small dissociation rate. The binding analysis presented here can be
   employed to improve our understanding of the functioning of PEI and
   PEI-like non-viral vectors.}},

Title = {{Towards setting credible speed limits: Identifying factors that affect
   driver compliance on urban roads}},
Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{A}},

Abstract = {{Road geometry, vehicle characteristics, and weather conditions are all
   factors that impact a driver's perception of a safe or credible speed
   and, consequently, the driver's decision on whether or not to comply
   with the posted speed limit. In fact, the role a road's environment
   plays in a driver's perception of a credible speed limit is a topic that
   has attracted the interest of many researchers in recent years. Despite
   that, not many studies have considered using empirical data to
   investigate what features of the road environment influence a driver's
   compliance choice. This paper aims to address this matter by exploring
   the relationships between features of the road surroundings (geometric,
   temporal factors, and weather conditions) and driver compliance with
   speed limits. The paper uses data from almost 600 different urban roads
   in the city of Edmonton, at which over 35 million vehicle spot speeds
   were collected. Compliance was represented using a categorical ordered
   response variable, and mixed-effects-logistic regression models were
   fitted. Two different models were built, one for arterials and another
   for collector roads. In general, the findings show that the more
   restricted drivers become, particularly on arterials, the more likely
   drivers are to comply with speed limits; potential restrictions include
   on-street parking and the absence of lateral shoulders. Furthermore,
   higher traffic activity during peak hours, and presumably on shoulder
   weekdays, both increase the likelihood of compliance on arterials.
   Similarly, posted speed limits and traffic volume are both positively
   correlated with compliance on both arterial and collector roads. The
   findings of this research provide evidence of the existence of an
   empirical relationship between road features and compliance,
   highlighting the importance of setting credible speed limits on roads
   and the possibility of achieving higher compliance rates through
   modifications to the road environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In elasticity theory, a neutral inhomogeneity is defined as a foreign
   body which can be introduced into a host solid without disturbing the
   stress field in the solid. The existence of circular neutral elastic
   nano-inhomogeneities has been established for both antiplane shear and
   plane deformations when the interface effect is described by constant
   interface parameters, and the surrounding matrix is subjected to uniform
   external loading. It is of interest to determine whether noncircular
   neutral nano-inhomogeneities can be constructed under the same
   conditions. In fact, we prove that only the circular elastic
   nano-inhomogeneity can achieve neutrality under these conditions with
   the radius of the inhomogeneity determined by the corresponding
   (constant) interface parameters and bulk elastic constants. In
   particular, in the case of plane deformations, the (uniform) external
   loading imposed on the matrix must be hydrostatic in order for the
   corresponding circular nano-inhomogeneity to achieve neutrality.
   Moreover, we find that, even when we relax the interface condition to
   allow for a nonuniform interface effect (described by variable interface
   parameters), in the case of plane deformations, only the elliptical
   nano-inhomogeneity can achieve neutrality.}},

   new closure by Kobryn, Gusarov, and Kovalenko (KGK closure) imposes the
   mean spherical approximation (MSA) almost everywhere in the solvation
   shell but levels out the density distribution function to zero (with the
   continuity at joint boundaries) inside the repulsive core and in the
   spatial regions of strong density depletion emerging due to molecular
   associative interactions. Similarly to MSA, the KGK closure reduces the
   problem to a linear equation for the direct correlation function which
   is predefined analytically on most of the solvation shells and has to be
   determined numerically on a relatively small (three-dimensional) domain
   of strong depletion, typically within the repulsive core. The KGK
   closure leads to the solvation free energy in the form of the Gaussian
   fluctuation (GF) functional. We first test the performance of the KGK
   closure coupled to the reference interaction site model (RISM) integral
   equations on the examples of Lennard-Jones liquids, polar and nonpolar
   molecular solvents, including water, and aqueous solutions of simple
   ions. The solvation structure, solvation chemical potential, and
   compressibility obtained from RISM with the KGK closure favorably
   compare to the results of the hypernetted chain (HNC) and
   Kovalenko-Hirata (KH) closures, including their combination with the GF
   solvation free energy. We then use the KGK closure coupled to RISM to
   obtain the solvation structure and thermodynamics of oligomeric
   polyelectrolytes and drug-like compounds at a finite concentration in
   electrolyte solution, for which no convergence is obtained with other
   closures. For comparison, we calculate their solvation structure from
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We further couple the 3D-RISM
   integral equation with the 3D-version of the KGK closure, and solve it
   for molecular mixtures as well as oligomeric polyelectrolytes and
   drug-like molecules in electrolyte solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Manganese oxide has been investigated extensively as an electrochemical
   capacitor or supercapacitor electrode material. Manganese oxide is
   inexpensive to fabricate and exhibits relatively high capacitance
   values, i.e., in excess of 200 F g(-1) in many cases; the actual value
   depends very much on the fabrication method and test conditions. The
   cycling behavior of Mn oxide, fabricated using anodic electrodeposition,
   is investigated using slice and view techniques, via a dual scanning
   electron microscope (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) instrument to
   generate three-dimensional (3D) images, coupled with electrochemical
   characterization. The initial as-fabricated electrode has a rod-like
   appearance, with a fine-scale, sheet-like morphology within the rods.
   The rod-like structure remains after cycling, but there are significant
   morphological changes. These include partial dissolution of Mn oxide
   followed by redeposition of Mn oxide in regions close to the substrate.
   The redeposited material has a finer morphology than the original
   as-fabricated Mn oxide. The Mn oxide coverage is also better near the
   substrate. These effects result in an increase in the specific
   capacitance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},

Pages = {{144-149}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pipeline transport of biomass is an economically viable and technically
   feasible approach to replace conventional truck delivery approach and
   make the biomass-based energy industry more competitive with fossil
   fuel-based plants. A 25 m long and 50 mm diameter closed-circuit
   pipeline facility was fabricated to experimentally investigate the
   mechanical and chemical feasibility of transporting agricultural residue
   biomass-water mixtures (slurries) through pipelines. This research used
   the pipeline facility to study the loss of sugars (glucose and xylose)
   while pipelining wheat straw-water mixtures. The release of similar
   sugars was also measured in shake-flask cultures under controlled
   conditions. The output of this research is important for bio-processing
   facilities as a high sugar content slurry would improve the yield of
   biofuels produced from pipelined lignocellulosic materials. After
   several hours of recirculating throughout the pipeline, as well as
   shaking in the flask, a drop in sugar concentration was detected. A
   microbiological analysis performed on both slurries proved the decline
   to be due to microbial proliferation. Accordingly, diethyl pyrocarbonate
   oxidizing antimicrobial agent and glutaraldehyde and bronopol
   non-oxidizing agents were alternatively tested to restrict microbial
   proliferation. These agents demonstrated reduced sugar loss and, in
   turn, showed an enhancement in the yield of glucose and xylose. This
   research aims at maximizing possible sugar release through mechanical
   action throughout the pipeline in the presence of antimicrobial
   compounds, which would increase the yield of biofuel produced from
   pipelined agricultural residue biomass. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Guar gum (GG) fracturing fluids were studied by incorporating cellulose
   nanofibrils (CNFs) in anhydrous borax crosslinked guar gum gels. To
   fully understand the impact of CNF on the proppant suspension capability
   of developed fracturing fluids, their shear rate-dependent viscosity and
   viscoelasticity were investigated. The shear rate dependencies of fluids
   was fitted to the Carreau model. The zero shear rate viscosity and
   elasticity of fracturing fluids increased significantly by incorporating
   CNF in guar gum gels. On the other hand, the viscosity at high shear
   rates (> 100 s(-1)) decreased as desired. The proppant settling
   velocities through fracturing fluids were evaluated by modeling the
   terminal falling velocity of proppants moving through a Carreau model
   fluid. The experimental results of the rheological behavior and the
   modeling results of the proppant settling rate indicated that the
   fracturing fluids containing CNF had better suspension capabilities. In
   addition, the lower viscosities of CNF formulated GG gels at higher
   shear rates will make them more pumpable.}},

Title = {{A local alignment approach to similarity analysis of industrial alarm
   flood sequences}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{13-25}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Similar alarm sequence alignment algorithms have been used to find
   similar alarm floods in the historical database for the prediction and
   prevention of alarm floods. However, the existing modified
   Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm has a high computation complexity,
   preventing its online applications within a tolerable computation time
   period. This paper proposes a new local alignment algorithm, based on
   the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). The novelty of the
   proposed algorithm is three-fold. First, a priority-based similarity
   scoring strategy makes the proposed algorithm more sensitive to alarms
   having higher alarm priorities. Second, a set-based pre-matching
   mechanism avoids unnecessary computations by excluding all irrelevant
   alarm floods and alarm tags. Third, the seeding and extending steps of
   the conventional BLAST are adapted for alarm floods, which reduce the
   searching space significantly. Owing to the novelties, the proposed
   algorithm is much faster in computation and provides a higher alignment
   accuracy than the SW algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm
   is demonstrated by industrial case studies based on the historical alarm
   floods from an oil conversion plant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Robotics-assisted needle steering can enhance targeting accuracy in

   for robotically controlled needle steering. This is the first model that
   predicts both needle shape and tip position in soft tissue, and accepts
   needle insertion velocity, needle 180. axial rotation, and needle base
   force/torque as inputs. A hybrid formulation of needle steering dynamics
   in soft tissue is presented, which considers the needle as a two-body
   rigid/flexible coupled system composed of a moving, discrete, and rigid
   part attached to a vibrating compliant part that is subject to external

   hand or the needle inserting robot, while the latter is a beam modeling
   the continuous deflection of the needle inside tissue. A novel
   time-delayed tissue model and a fracture mechanics-based model are
   developed to model the tissue reaction forces and cutting force at the
   needle tip, respectively. Experiments are performed on synthetic and ex
   vivo animal tissues to identify the model parameters and validate the
   needle steering model. The maximum error of the 2-D model in predicting
   the needle tip position in the insertion plane was 1.59 mm in the case
   of no axial rotation and 0.74 mm with axial rotation.}},

Abstract = {{The eigenstrain theory is widely used to study inelastic responses of
   several classes of materials subjected to phase transformation, thermal
   expansion, and other multiphysics excitations. In this paper, we focus
   on electrically conducting cellular solids and examine their
   magnetoelastic responses when used as a core of a sandwich cylinder
   subjected to an eigenstrain and an external magnetic field. The cylinder
   comprises layers of either solid or cellular material and undergoes
   either plane strain or plane stress conditions in both time-harmonic and
   transient states. We use direct homogenization techniques (standard
   mechanics and micromechanical models) along with Bessel, Struve, and
   Lommel functions to study the roles that cell topology, relative
   density, eigenstrain, and bonding interface play on the magnetoelastic
   responses of the sandwich cylinder. The results show that relative
   density, cell topology, and magnetic field are the factors that most
   contribute to control the sandwich response. We also show that a careful
   tailoring of relative density and cell topology can lead to the
   simultaneous weight and overall stress reduction with improved natural
   frequency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three dimensional (3D) printing is a technique conventionally used to
   manufacture prototypes. Commercial desktop 3D printers have become
   available which produce functional 3D printed parts. The MarkOne by Mark
   Forged manufactures printed structures reinforced with continuous
   Carbon, Fiberglass or Kevlar fibers. The aim of this study is to
   evaluate the elastic properties of the fiber reinforced 3D printed
   structures and predict elastic properties using an Average Stiffness
   (VAS) method. Samples evaluated in this study were produced by varying
   the volume fraction of fibers within the 3D printed structures (4.04,
   8.08 and 10.1\% respectively). The experimentally determined elastic
   modulus was found to be 1767.2, 6920.0 and 9001.2 MPa for fiber volume
   fractions of 4.04, 8.08 and 10.1\% respectively. The predicted elastic
   moduli were found to be 4155.7, 7380.0 and 8992.1 MPa. The model results
   differed from experiments by 57.5, 6.2 and 0.1\% for the 4.04, 8.08 and
   10.1\% fiber volume fractions. The predictive model allows for the
   elastic properties of fiber reinforced 3D printed parts. The model
   presented will allow for designers to predict the elastic properties of
   fiber reinforced 3D printed parts to be used for functional components
   which require specific mechanical properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The aeroelastic flutter characteristics of a functionally graded carbon
   nanotube reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) truncated conical shell under
   simultaneous actions of a hydrostatic pressure and yawed supersonic
   airflow are scrutinized. The nonlinearity in geometry of the conical
   shell is considered in Green-Lagrange sense and the model is derived
   according to the Novozhilov nonlinear shell theory. The aerodynamic
   pressure is modeled based on the quasi-steady Krumhaar's modified
   supersonic piston theory by considering the effect of the panel
   curvature and flow yaw angle. Parametric studies are conducted to
   investigate the effects of boundary conditions, semi-vertex angle,
   distribution and volume fraction of CNT, Mach number and airflow yaw
   angle on the stability boundaries and flutter characteristics. The
   results show that the semi-vertex angle and CNT distribution may alter
   the stability boundaries. It is also found that the aeroelastic flutter
   responses of the structure can be significantly improved through a
   functionally graded distribution of CNT in a polymer matrix. Moreover,
   the aeroelastic characteristics of the FG-CNTRC truncated conical shell
   are found to be very sensitive to geometrical parameters and the airflow
   yaw angle. The results of this study shed a light into developing and
   using ultra-high-strength and low-weight composites reinforced with CNT
   for aerospace applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an analytical model is provided to describe the filling
   dynamics of a capillary filled with a viscous fluid containing spinning
   particles. The aim is to demonstrate the effect of angular momentum on
   the capillary filling dynamics of molecular fluids which has not been
   explored before. The presence of spinning particles generates additional
   coefficients of viscosity, namely, spin viscosity and vortex viscosity,
   which couples rotational and translational movements. Three different
   time stages have been noticed during the capillary filling phenomenon:
   inertia force dominated, visco-inertial, and viscous-dominated regions.
   The last two regions are found to be mainly affected by the spinning
   particles. An increase in the spin and vortex viscosities is found to
   increase the viscous force and thus reduce the front position of the
   moving liquid. The results of this study are validated using the
   literature no-angular-momentum (NAM) base-case results and an excellent
   agreement is observed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The high reactivity of magnesium limits its extensive applications in
   the transportation industry for the development of lightweight vehicles
   and aircrafts. In addition to modification of the corrosion potential of
   bulk magnesium through alloying elements, tailoring its surface oxide
   film is an alternative approach for enhanced resistance corrosion. In
   this study, effects of small amounts of a rare-earth element, yttrium,
   on the strength of surface oxide film formed on Mg-3Al (wt.\%) alloy and
   its adherence to the substrate were investigated experimentally and
   computationally. It is demonstrated that the yttrium addition decreased
   the component ratio of hydroxides to oxides, mainly Mg(OH)(2) to MgO, in
   the surface oxide film, leading to markedly enhanced mechanical strength
   and resistance to scratch with stronger adherence to the substrate.
   However, as the nominal yttrium concentration exceeded a certain level,
   the beneficial effect of Y on the film was weakened. Efforts are made to
   clarify underlying mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mussel wet adhesion mechanisms have attracted much research interest and
   have been studied through nanomechanical measurements over the past
   decade. In this work, the self-healing process of Fe3+-mediated bridging
   interaction in mussel foot protein-1 (mfp-1) is investigated at theory
   level of B3LYP/LACVP{*} using Gaussian 09. The computational results in
   the gas phase show that strong adhesion is present between ferric ions
   and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) ligands, and the complex
   {[}Fe(DOPA)(3)](3-) is most inclined to break through a route during
   which one DOPA dissociates from the iron center via tandem cleavage of
   two Fe-O bonds. Considering the effects of solvent molecules (i.e.,
   water), {[}Fe(DOPA)(3)](3-) bounded by three water molecules can satisfy
   the saturated coordination of the iron atom in order to compensate the
   entropic penalty that is induced by the increase of water molecules. The
   retrieving process of {[}Fe(DOPA)(2)](-)center dot 2H(2)O and
   (DOPA)(2-)center dot H2O is a thermodynamically spontaneous process as
   compared with the breaking process of {[}Fe(DOPA)(3)](3-), which is the
   main driving interaction for the reconstruction of {[}Fe(DOPA)(3)](3-)
   and the self-healing of mfp-1. In addition, hydtogeri bonding
   interactions between water and {[}Fe(DOPA)(3)](3-) can effectively
   facilitate the reversible cohesion between two mfp-1 layers, enhancing
   the mechanical strength and stability of the mytilus byssal cuticle. The
   computational results are in good agreement with our previous surface
   force measurements and provide insights into the design and development
   of DOPA-mediated self-healing materials.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a predictive model to study how flocculant additives alter
   the interactions among clay particles in colloidal suspensions, such as
   industrial mining tailings. Fully atomistic models of kaolinite
   nanoplatelets constructed from X-ray crystal structure data feature a
   highly polarized charge distribution, which defines their solvation,
   adsorption, and association properties. Effective interactions, in the
   form of potential of mean force (PMF), between kaolinite platelets in
   aqueous electrolyte solution are calculated using the three-dimensional
   reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko Hirata closure
   relation (3D-RISM-KH) molecular theory of solvation based on the
   first-principles of statistical mechanics. This theory is also employed
   to study the adsorption of ions and flocculant additive building blocks
   onto kaolinite surfaces. Three main mutual orientations of platelets are
   studied in aqueous electrolyte solutions of several polymer building
   blocks represented by acrylamide, acrylic acid, acrylate, and styrene.
   The results indicate that Na+ are predominantly adsorbed onto the
   siloxane surface of kaolinite while the chloride and acrylate anions
   prefer the aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite. Weaker adsorption
   preference is observed for the neutral monomers. The PMF between
   platelets depends nontrivially on the concentration of solvent
   components and exhibits a complex oscillating behavior with several
   minima and maxima that correspond to important solvation and aggregation
   energy barriers. Among the three studied mutual orientations of the
   nanoplatelets, the most stable one corresponds to the direct contact of
   the aluminum hydroxide with siloxane surfaces. Other highly probable
   arrangements correspond to nanoplatelets separated by a single layer of
   solvent. The effect of additives on interparticle interactions is
   correlated with the strength of adsorption on kaolinite relative to
   water, as strongly and weakly adsorbing species cause increase and
   decrease, respectively, of the PMF at short distances. Moreover,
   hydrophobic additives cause a decrease in the local solvent density
   between nanoparticles and consequently a decrease in the PMF. These
   results provide valuable -insights into the mechanism of interactions of
   kaolinite nanoplatelets in thermodynamic conditions relevant to clay
   dispersions, as occurring in tailings produced by the process of hot
   water extraction of bitumen from oil sands and other milling tailings.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes molecular dynamics based simulations, which were
   performed to investigate the effects of different hydrogenation regimes
   on the mechanical properties of boron nitride nanosheets (h-BN). The
   reaction force field (ReaxFF) was used as the interatomic potential to
   capture atomistic interactions. Separate atomistic models were developed
   for pristine, semihydrogenated (hydrogen is attached either to boron or
   nitrogen) and fully hydrogenated h-BN (hydrogen is attached to both
   boron and nitrogen). The radial distribution function was used to study
   the structural integrity and stability of both pristine and hydrogenated
   structures. The simulations predicted an improvement in stability and
   integrity of the atomistic structures under the influence of
   hydrogenation compared to pristine h-BN. The semihydrogenated structure
   in which hydrogen was attached only to nitrogen was found to be the
   least stable configuration, while the fully hydrogenated structure was
   the most stable. Furthermore, the selective hydrogenation of h-BN
   nanosheets was studied with respect to tailoring the mechanical behavior
   of h-BN nanosheets. With applied strain the hydrogen atom shifts its
   role from hydrogen bond acceptor to donor, which semihydrogenated h-BN
   nanosheets.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Interactions between a Silica Sphere and Deformable Interfaces

Abstract = {{Recent studies, have successfully measured surface forces using atomic
   force microscope (AFM) and modeled surface deformations using the
   Stokes-Reynolds-Young-Laplace (SRYL) equations for particle-droplet,
   particle-bubble, droplet-droplet, and bubble-bubble systems in various
   solutions, The-Current work focuses on interactions between spherical
   silica particles and,a viscoelastic interface of water droplets in crude
   oil. The self-assembly of surface active natural polyaromatic molecules
   (NPAMs) at the oil-water interface has previously been shown to change a
   viscous dominant oil-water interface to an elastic dominant interface
   upon aging, due to gradual formation of rigid interfacial networks: AFM
   was used to measure the interactions between a small silica sphere (D
   approximate to 8 mu m) and a deformable water droplet (D approximate to
   70 mu m), which exhibits time-dependent interfacial viscoelasticity in
   NPAM solutions. Unlike the systems studied previously, the measured
   deformation shown as a repulsive force over the region of constant
   compliance could not be modeled adequately by the conventional SRYL
   equations which are applicable only to purely Laplacian interfaces. As
   the water droplet ages in NPAM solutions, a rigid ``skin{''} forms at
   the oil-water interface, with the interface exhibiting increased
   elasticity. Over a short aging period (up to 15 min in NPAM-in-toluene
   solution), interfacial deformation is well predicted by the SRYL model.
   However, upon further exposure to the NPAM solution, droplet deformation
   is overpredicted by the model. Physical properties of this mechanical
   barrier as a function of interfacial, aging were further, investigated
   by measuring interfacial tension, dilatational rheology, and interfacial
   ``crumpling{''} (non-smooth, non-Laplacian interface) upon droplet
   volume reduction. By introducing a viscoelasticity parameter to account
   for interfacial stiffening and using experimentally determined
   elasticity, we are able to correct this discrepancy and predict droplet
   deformation under AFM cantilever compression. This parameter appears to
   be important for modeling non-Laplacian systems of significant
   viscoelastic contributions, such as biological cell membranes or polymer
   blends.}},

Title = {{Luteolin exerts pro-apoptotic effect and anti-migration effects on A549
   lung adenocarcinoma cells through the activation of MEK/ERK signaling
   pathway}},
Journal = {{CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{An increasing amount of evidence suggests that luteolin, a common
   dietary flavonoid that is widely distributed in plants and foods, has
   been shown to be protective against cancer. However, the precise
   underlying mechanisms of its action against lung cancer are still poorly
   understood. In the present study, we investigated whether luteolin
   exhibits the anti-cancer effect in lung cancer through the induction of
   cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell migration, and whether
   mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Akt signaling pathways are
   required. Results revealed that luteolin exerted an anti-proliferation
   effect in a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549 lung adenocarcinoma
   cells, and induced apoptosis with a concomitant increase in the
   activation of caspases-3 and -9, diminution of Bcl-2, elevation in Bax
   expression, and the phosphorylation of MEK and its down-stream kinase
   ERK, as well as the activation of Akt. Luteolin also dramatically
   inhibited cell motility and migration in A549 cells. The inhibitor of
   MEK-ERK pathway protected against luteolin-induced cell death and
   suppressed the apoptosis-inducing and anti-migratory effects of
   luteolin, suggesting MEK-ERK signaling pathway plays an important role
   in mediating the pro-apoptotic effect and anti-migration effects of
   luteolin. Taken together, this study provides a new insight into the
   mode of action of luteolin on lung cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Rapidly solidified Sn-based solder alloys can provide metallurgical
   features such as low segregation and fine intermetallic compounds
   (IMCs). These features can be obtained in a controlled way by Impulse
   Atomization that provides powders of various sizes corresponding to a
   variety of cooling rates and undercoolings to which diverse
   microstructures are associated. In the present investigation, rapid
   solidification of Sn-0.7 wt\%Cu and Sn-0.7 wt\%Cu-3.0 wt\%Ag alloys have
   been examined through the production of a wide size range of impulse
   atomized powders. The microstructures and hardness resulting from the
   generated powders have been compared with those of directionally
   solidified (DS) specimens. Regular cells > dendrites and reverse
   dendrites > cells transitions were identified, and high-speed eutectic
   cells were found to prevail for the examined Sn-0.7 wt\%Cu powders of
   size smaller than 300 mu m. It is shown that the Vickers microhardness
   of the ternary Sn-3.0 wt\%Ag-0.7 wt\%Cu alloy is directly influenced by
   both the presence of tertiary dendrite arms (lambda(3)) and the cooling
   rate/powder size dependent eutectic fraction. Also, compaction and
   extrusion of the atomized powders were carried out in order to
   consolidate the samples so that tensile tests could be carried out.
   Tensile strength and ductility of samples corresponding to different
   powder sizes and compositions were thus measured and the results are
   found to be consistent with their microstructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The synthesis, characterization and potential application of eight 3'-O
   modified 2'-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are discussed.
   These nucleotide analogues are modified by capping the 3'-OH with a
   photolabile protecting group which can temporarily cease DNA strand
   growth and can smoothly reinitiate the growth by the photodecomposition
   of the protecting group and setting the 3'-OH of dNTPs free to
   propagate. The synthesis of 3'-O-(2-nitrobenzyl)-2'-deoxyribonucleoside
   triphosphates (NB-dNTPs) and
   3'-O-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl)-2'-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates
   (DMNB-dNTPs) is discussed in detail with structural confirmation using
   NMR. The UV-cleaving studies are monitored and quantified using LCMS and
   H-1 NMR spectral traces. The synthesised nucleotides are employed for
   terminating and reinitiating template-less DNA synthesis, using primer
   independent Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) enzyme. The use
   of this photolabile nucleotide in one step stop start DNA synthesis is a
   novel strategy towards the precise assembly of dNTPs with the potential
   to reinforce present technologies.}},

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{This work presents and generalizes our experience in the use of fuzzy
   set theory, including its combination with another branch of mathematics
   of uncertainty, in developing general approaches and methods for
   optimization and decision making with considering the uncertainty and
   multicriteria factors in problems of the design, planning, operation,
   and control of complex systems. Two major classes of situations that
   require the use of a multicriteria approach are identified. In
   accordance with this, two general classes of models related to
   multiobjective (< X, F > models) and multiattribute (< X, R > models)
   problems, respectively, are considered. Methods for their analysis based
   on the use of the Bellman-Zadeh approach to decision making in a fuzzy
   environment and fuzzy preference modeling techniques, respectively, are
   considered. Although, the use of < X, F > and (X, R > models is of an
   independent character, they also serve as parts of a general scheme for
   multicriteria decision making under conditions of uncertainty. This
   scheme is associated with the use of a generalization of the classic
   approach to considering the uncertainty of information to multicriteria
   problems, based on analyzing special aggregations of payoff matrices.
   The authors' experience in the use of the results indicated above for
   solving diverse classes of power system planning and operation problems
   is described. This experience convincingly demonstrates diverse
   advantages of applying fuzzy mathematics in optimization and decision
   making problems of power engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, the effects of a phosphonate molecular monolayer adsorbed
   on the surface of a freestanding self-organized TiO2 nanotube membrane,
   on the microwave photoresponse of the membrane are presented. This
   phenomenon is monitored using planar microwave sensors. A double ring
   resonator is utilized to monitor the permittivity and conductivity
   variation on the monolayer coated membrane and the sensor environment
   separately. It is shown that the rise time and subsequent decay of the
   amplitude (A), resonance frequency (f(0)) and quality factor (Q) of the
   resonator depend on the existence and the type of the monolayer coating
   the membrane. Three different monolayers of n-decylphosphonic acid
   (DPA), 1H, 1H', 2H, 2H'-perfluorodecyl phosphonic acid (PFDPA) and
   16-phosphonohexadecanoic acid adsorbed on the titania nanotube membrane
   are investigated while monitoring their microwave properties during the
   illumination time period and in the relaxation period, which demonstrate
   different behavior in comparison to each other and to the bare nanotube
   membrane layer. The effect of humidity on the TiO2 nanotube membrane
   with and without different monolayers is also studied and the results
   demonstrate distinguishable microwave responses. While each of the
   monolayer-coated membranes exhibited an attenuation of the photo-induced
   change in A, f(0) and Q with respect to the bare membrane, PFDPA-coated
   membranes showed the smallest relative change in the monitored microwave
   parameters upon ultraviolet illumination and upon the introduction of
   different levels of humidity. These effects are explained on the basis
   of surface trap passivation by the monolayers as well as the
   hydrophobicity of the monolayers. Our work also shows how the
   interactions of self-assembled monolayers with charge carriers and
   surface states on metal oxides may be used to indirectly sense their
   presence through measurement of the microwave response.}},

Abstract = {{China relies heavily on coal for power generation, and the demand for
   coal in a country of this size makes China the world's largest carbon
   dioxide emitter; hence China is pursuing greener pathways for power
   generation. Importing shale gas in the form of LNG from Canada is one
   such pathway. It starts with the recovery of shale gas in Canada and its
   export to China. This paper quantifies well-to-wire (WTW) greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions per kilowatt hour (kWh) of Canadian shale gas-fuelled
   electricity in China through models. WTW emissions include emissions
   from recovery, processing, transmission, liquefaction, marine shipping,
   re-gasification, power plant operations, and electricity transmission
   and distribution. Four Canadian shale gas reserves - Montney, Horn
   River, Liard, and Cordova - are considered. The results show that the
   WTW GHG emissions of Canadian shale gas-fired combined cycle technology
   range from 567 to 610 gCO(2)/kWh (57-62\% of the GHG emissions from
   China's present coal-fired electricity), and total well-to-port (WTP)
   GHG emissions (emissions from recovery, processing, and transmission to
   a liquefaction facility) range from 7.68 to 13.4 gCO(2e)/MJ. Sensitivity
   analysis results show that venting emissions during raw gas processing,
   flaring rates during well completion, and lifetime productivity of the
   gas significantly influence WTP emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Pilot-scale UV/H2O2 advanced oxidation process for municipal reuse
   water: Assessing micropollutant degradation and estrogenic impacts on
   goldfish (Carassius auratus L.)}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Low concentrations (ng/L-mu g/L) of emerging micropollutant contaminants
   in municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents affect the possibility
   to reuse these waters. Many of those micropollutants elicit endocrine
   disrupting effects in aquatic organisms resulting in an alteration of
   the endocrine system. A potential candidate for tertiary municipal
   wastewater treatment of these micropollutants is ultraviolet
   (UV)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an advanced oxidation process (ADP)
   which was currently applied to treat the secondary effluent of the Gold
   Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant (GBWWTP) in Edmonton, AB, Canada. A new
   approach is presented to predict the fluence-based degradation rate
   constants (kappa(f)') of environmentally occurring micropollutants
   including carbamazepine {[}(0.87-1.39) x 10(-3) cm(2)/mJ] and
   2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) {[}(0.60-0.91) x 10(-3) cm(2)/mJ
   for 2,4-D] in a medium pressure (MP) UV/H2O2 system based on a previous
   bench-scale investigation. Rather than using removal rates, this
   approach can be used to estimate the performance of the MP UV/H2O2
   process for degrading trace contaminants of concern found in municipal
   wastewater. In addition to the ability to track contaminant
   removal/degradation, evaluation of the MP UV/H2O2 process was also
   accomplished by identifying critical ecotoxicological endpoints (i.e.,
   estrogenicity) of the treated wastewater. Using quantitative PCR, mRNA
   levels of estrogen-responsive (ER) genes ER alpha 1, ER alpha 2, ER beta
   1, ER beta 2 and NPR as well as two aromatase encoding genes (CYP19a and
   CYP19b) in goldfish (Carassius auratus L.) were measured during exposure
   to the GBWWTP effluent before and after MP UV/H2O2 treatment (a fluence
   of 1000 mJ/cm(2) and 20 mg/L of H2O2) in spring, summer and fall.
   Elevated expression of estrogen-responsive genes in goldfish exposed to
   UV/H2O2 treated effluent (a 7-day exposure) suggested that the UV/H2O2

Title = {{A two-step flocculation process on oil sands tailings treatment using

Abstract = {{Water management and treatment of mineral tailings and oil sands
   tailings are becoming critical challenges for the sustainable
   development of natural resources. Polymeric flocculants have been widely
   employed to facilitate the flocculation and settling of suspended fine
   solid particles in tailings, resulting in the separation of released
   water and solid sediments. In this study, a new flocculation process was
   developed for the treatment of oil sands tailings by using two
   oppositely charged polymers, i.e. an anionic polyacrylamide and a
   natural cationic biopolymer, chitosan. The new process was able to not
   only improve the clarity of supernatant after settling but also achieve
   a high settling efficiency. Treatment of the oil sands tailings using
   pure anionic polyacrylamide showed relatively high initial settling rate
   (ISR) of similar to 10.3 m/h but with poor supernatant clarity (>1000
   NTU); while the treatment using pure cationic polymer resulted in clear
   supernatant (turbidity as low as 22 NTU) but relatively low ISR of
   >2m/h. In the new flocculation process, the addition of anionic
   polyacrylamide to the tailings was followed by a cationic polymer, which
   showed both a high ISR (similar to 7.7 m/h) and a low turbidity (71 NTU)
   of the supernatant. The flocculation mechanism was further investigated
   via the measurements of floc size, zeta potential and surface forces.
   The new flocculation process was revealed to include two steps: (1)
   bridging of fine solids by anionic polyacrylamide, and (2) further
   aggregation and flocculation mediated by charge neutralisation of the
   cationic polymer, which significantly eliminated the fine solids in the
   supernatants as well as increases floc size. Our results provide
   insights into the basic understanding of the interactions between
   polymer flocculants and solid particles in tailings treatment, as well
   as the development of novel tailings treatment technologies. (C) 2016

Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{47-57}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The oxidation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) was firstly carried out by
   heterogeneous Fenton-like process in the presence of
   ferrocene-containing silicotungstate catalyst (denoted as FcSiW). The
   catalyst was successfully prepared by precipitation method in aqueous
   solution using ferrocene (Fc, or CpFeCp) and silicotungstic acid (SiW,
   or H4SiW12O40 center dot xH(2)O) as raw materials and the intrinsic
   relationship between structure and catalytic activity was fully studied.
   Under the suitable conditions, the prepared FcSiW exhibited high
   catalytic activity, especially under irradiation conditions. Moreover,
   the catalyst showed good reusability without significant performance
   drop after successive experimental runs and high stability with very low
   iron leaching. The strong interaction resulting from the close contact
   between Fc and polyoxometalate (POM) species contributes to the
   charge-transition from Fc to POM, which is in favor of its
   photocatalysis. A possible catalytic mechanism revealing the synergistic
   effect between the Fenton-like reaction of ferricinium and
   photocatalysis of SiW12O404- anions in FcSiW/H2O2 system was proposed on
   the basis of experiment results and previous reports. This novel highly
   active heterogeneous catalyst has the potential for wide range of
   application in wastewater pollutants treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Influence of hydrothermal treatment on filterability of fine solids in
   bitumen froth}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{314-323}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Bitumen froth generated during the oil recovery operation from Athabasca
   oil sands needs to be cleaned to remove water and fine mineral solids
   for subsequent bitumen upgrading or pipeline transport. Two currently
   used bitumen froth cleaning methods, naphthenic froth treatment (NFT)
   and paraffinic froth treatment (PFT), either cannot generate market-spec
   bitumen froth (NFT) or causes losses of bitumen (PFT). In this study, a
   combination of hydrothermal treatment, venting and filtration was
   investigated to clean the bitumen froth. Laboratory hydrothermal
   treatment was conducted at 300-420 degrees C for 0-180 min. The
   filterability of fine solids was quantitatively characterized by
   room-temperature filtration or hot filtration at 200 degrees C.
   Mineralogical composition and particle size distribution of the
   untreated and treated fine solids were determined by quantitative X-ray
   diffraction using RockJock and focused beam reflectance measurement
   (FBRM) particle size analyzer. The microscopic observation of clay
   particle stacking behavior at the filter cake-filter medium interface
   was made by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results show that
   hydrothermal treatment followed by venting and filtration is an
   effective way to remove water and fine solids from bitumen froth: the
   water content was reduced from 14 wt\% to 0.03 wt\%, and the fine solids
   content was reduced from 8 wt\% to 0.08 wt\% by hot filtration at 200
   degrees C using a 0.5 mu m pore size stainless steel filter medium.
   After hydrothermal treatment, no noticeable changes were observed to the
   clay mineralogy and fine solids particle size. However, the platy clay
   particles at the filter cake-filter medium interface turned from
   preferential orientation to random orientation due to the attachment of
   numerous ultrafine particles on the basal surface of the clay,
   increasing the porosity of the filter cake and facilitating the
   filtration. Such a change in the filter cake was hypothesized to be
   caused by the re-structuring of the organic-mineral aggregates into the
   ultrafine-particle-coated platy clays, releasing the organics and the
   ultrafine solids during the hydrothermal treatment. The released
   ultrafine solids then adsorbed onto the clay platelets. It was indeed
   observed that the total organic carbon content of the bulk fine solids
   decreased from 14.7 wt\% to 10.3 wt\%, but the carbon concentration on
   the fine solids surface increased from 35.6 at.\% to 47.7 at.\%. (C)

Abstract = {{Here, a nonlinear plant is considered, which is operated by a
   decentralized control system. The existing system ignores the
   interactions between subsystems, which often results in uncaptured
   plantwide performance. The focus of this paper is on the design of a
   distributed model predictive control (DMPC) network using successively
   linearized internal models. In this method, all existing interactions
   between the subsystems should be considered in order to enhance the
   performance of the current decentralized DMPC scheme. A coordination
   layer is added to the existing network, while minor modifications are
   applied to the local MPC controllers, to achieve the performance and
   stability of a hypothetical centralized MPC for the entire plant. In
   this work, an interior-point algorithm is proposed to coordinate a DMPC
   network via the price-driven coordination approach. In addition, the
   convergence of the algorithm is shown, and the necessary conditions to
   ensure the closed-loop stability of the system are provided for the
   situation when the algorithm is terminated prematurely prior to
   convergence.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that an automated speech-recognition-inspired
   classification algorithm could differentiate between the heart sounds in
   subjects with and without pulmonary hypertension (PH) and outperform
   physicians. Heart sounds, electrocardiograms, and mean pulmonary artery
   pressures (mPAp) were recorded simultaneously. Heart sound recordings
   were digitized to train and test speech-recognition-inspired
   classification algorithms. We used mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
   to extract features from the heart sounds. Gaussian-mixture models
   classified the features as PH (mPAp >= 25 mmHg) or normal (mPAp < 25
   mmHg). Physicians blinded to patient data listened to the same heart
   sound recordings and attempted a diagnosis. We studied 164 subjects: 86
   with mPAp >= 25 mmHg (mPAp 41 +/- 12 mmHg) and 78 with mPAp < 25 mmHg
   (mPAp 17 +/- 5 mmHg) (p < 0.005). The correct diagnostic rate of the
   automated speech-recognition-inspired algorithm was 74\% compared to
   56\% by physicians (p = 0.005). The false positive rate for the
   algorithm was 34\% versus 50\% (p = 0.04) for clinicians. The false
   negative rate for the algorithm was 23\% and 68\% (p = 0.0002) for
   physicians. We developed an automated speech-recognition-inspired
   classification algorithm for the acoustic diagnosis of PH that
   outperforms physicians that could be used to screen for PH and encourage

Abstract = {{Semiconductor nanowires (NWs), due to their intriguing structural and
   physical properties, offer tremendous potential for future technological
   applications. The existence of strain in NWs can greatly affect, for
   instance, their mechanical, electrical and optical properties. Here, we
   report an extraordinary electrostatic response of semiconductor BiFeO3
   NW loops, based on Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and
   electrostatic force microscopy (EFM). A substantial similar to 300 mV
   surface potential difference, accompanied by an similar to 29\% higher
   surface charge density, was found on the NW loop. We also found that the
   electrostatic enhancement is strongly related to the strain present at
   the curvature of the NW loops. We propose that the electric polarization
   coupled with mechanical strain (piezoelectric effect) or strain gradient
   (flexoelectricity) as possible reasons to account for our observation.
   These findings provide new insights into multiferroic based
   semiconductor NWs under external stimuli as well as significant
   inspiration towards strain sensors and electromechanical devices with

Abstract = {{Despite significant effort to quantify the interdependence of the water
   and energy sectors, global requirements of energy for water (E4W) are
   still poorly understood, which may result in biases in projections and
   consequently in water and energy management and policy. This study
   estimates water-related energy consumption by water source, sector, and
   process for 14 global regions from 1973 to 2012. Globally, E4W amounted
   to 10.2 EJ of primary energy consumption in 2010, accounting for
   1.7\%-2.7\% of total global primary energy consumption, of which 58\%
   pertains to fresh surface water, 30\% to fresh groundwater, and 12\% to
   nonfresh water, assuming median energy intensity levels. The sectoral
   E4W allocation includes municipal (45\%), industrial (30\%), and
   agricultural (25\%), and main process-level contributions are from
   source/conveyance (39\%), water purification (27\%), water distribution
   (12\%), and wastewater treatment (18\%). While the United States was the
   largest E4W consumer from the 1970s until the 2000s, the largest
   consumers at present are the Middle East, India, and China, driven by
   rapid growth in desalination, groundwater-based irrigation, and
   industrial and municipal water use, respectively. The improved
   understanding of global E4W will enable enhanced consistency of both
   water and energy representations in integrated assessment models.}},

Abstract = {{There is a large, at times contradictory, body of research relating
   spinal curvature to Low Back Pain (LBP). Mechanical load is considered
   as important factor in LBP etiology. Geometry of the spinal structures
   and sagittal curvature of the lumbar spine govern its mechanical
   behavior. Thus, understanding how inter individual geometry particularly
   sagittal curvature variation affects the spinal load-sharing becomes of
   high importance in LBP assessment. This study calculated and compared
   kinematics and load-sharing in three ligamentous lumbosacral spines: one
   hypo-lordotic (Hypo-L) with low lordosis, one normallordotic (Norm-L)
   with normal lordosis, and one hyper-lordotic (Hyper-L) with high
   lordosis in flexed and extended postures using 3D nonlinear Finite
   Element (FE) modeling. These postures were simulated by applying
   Follower Load (FL) combined with flexion or extension moment. The Hypo-L
   spine demonstrated stiffer behavior in flexion but more flexible
   response to extension compared to the Norm-L spine. The excessive
   lordosis stiffened response of the Hyper-L spine to extension but did
   not affect its resistance to flexion compared to the Norm-L spine.
   Despite the different resisting actions of the posterior ligaments to
   flexion moment, the increase of disc compression was similar in all the
   spines leading to similar load-sharing. However, resistance of the facet
   joints to extension was more important in the Norm- and Hyper-L spines
   which reduced the disc compression. The spinal curvature strongly
   influenced the magnitude and location of load on the spinal components
   and also altered the kinematics and load sharing particularly in
   extension. Consideration of the subject-specific geometry and sagittal
   curvature should be an integral part of mechanical analysis of the
   lumbar spine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{According to Stokes' law, a moving solid surface experiences viscous
   drag that is linearly related to its velocity and the viscosity of the
   medium. The viscous interactions result in dissipation that is known to
   scale as the square root of the kinematic viscosity times the density of
   the gas. We observed that when an oscillating surface is modified with
   nanostructures, the experimentally measured dissipation shows an
   exponential dependence on kinematic viscosity. The surface
   nanostructures alter solid-gas interplay greatly, amplifying the
   dissipation response exponentially for even minute variations in
   viscosity. Nanostructured resonator thus allows discrimination of
   otherwise narrow range of gaseous viscosity making dissipation an ideal
   parameter for analysis of a gaseous media. We attribute the observed
   exponential enhancement to the stochastic nature of interactions of many
   coupled nanostructures with the gas media.}},

Title = {{Adsorption of asphaltenes on kaolinite as an irreversible process}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of asphaltenes on mineral surfaces is important in
   petroleum production and in oilsands extraction. Adsorption of Athabasca
   asphaltenes from toluene solutions onto kaolinite was investigated over
   a wide range of asphaltene and kaolinite concentrations. Although the
   adsorption appeared to follow the functional form of the Langmuir
   isotherm, the amount adsorbed depended on the kaolinite concentration so
   that the result depended on the experimental path, not the final
   solution concentration of asphaltenes. The results are consistent with
   kinetically limited adsorption, analogous to proteins, with a functional
   dependence on the asphaltene/kaolinite ratio. Multiple contacts between
   dried asphaltene-coated kaolinite and fresh asphaltene solutions, and
   between ``spent{''} asphaltene solutions and fresh samples of kaolinite
   further confirmed that conventional isotherms were inadequate to
   describe the adsorption behavior. Repeated contact of asphaltene
   solution with kaolinite adsorbed up to 98\% of the asphaltenes,
   therefore, the adsorption was not selective for specific species in the
   asphaltene mixture. Kaolinite samples before and after multiple contacts
   with asphaltene were analyzed by elemental analysis and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption density of asphaltene
   on kaolinite increased dramatically after each contact with a fresh
   asphaltene solution, but the surface composition detected by XPS on the
   kaolinite surface was unchanged. The presence of Al and Si, detectable
   even at high asphaltene adsorption density, proved that asphaltene
   adsorption layer is not continuous on the kaolinite surface, and that
   subsequent asphaltene adsorption occurred preferentially on the
   asphaltenes already adsorbed on the kaolinite surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of activated carbon's pore size distribution (PSD) on heel
   formation during adsorption of organic vapors was investigated. Five
   commercially available beaded activated carbons (BAC) with varying PSDs
   (30-88\% microporous) were investigated. Virgin samples had similar
   elemental compositions but different PSDs, which allowed for isolating
   the contribution of carbon's microporosity to heel formation. Heel
   formation was linearly correlated (R-2 = 0.91) with BAC micropore
   volume; heel for the BAC with the lowest micropore volume was 20\% lower
   than the BAC with the highest micropore volume. Meanwhile, first cycle
   adsorption capacities and breakthrough times correlated linearly (R-2
   =0.87 and 0.93, respectively) with BAC total pore volume. (C) 2016
   Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
   Micropore volume reduction for all BACs confirmed that heel accumulation
   takes place in the highest energy pores. Overall, these results show
   that a greater portion of adsorbed species are converted into heel on
   highly microporous adsorbents due to higher share of high energy
   adsorption sites in their structure. This differs from mesoporous
   adsorbents (low microporosity) in which large pores contribute to
   adsorption but not to heel formation, resulting in longer adsorbent
   lifetime. Thus, activated carbon with high adsorption capacity and high
   mesopore fraction is particularly desirable for organic vapor
   application involving extended adsorption/regeneration cycling. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{metallic glasses (MGs), plastic deformation at room temperature is
   dominated by highly localized shear bands. Here we report the
   non-localized deformation under tension in CueZr multi-layer MGs with a

   demonstrated that amorphous samples with high layer numbers, composed of
   Cu64Zr36 and Cu40Zr60, or Cu64Zr36 and Cu50Zr50, present obviously
   non-localized deformation behavior. We reveal that the deformation
   behavior of the multi-layer-structured MG films is related but not
   determined by the deformation behavior of the composed individual
   layers. The criterion for the deformation mode change for MGs with a
   pure amorphous structure, in generally, was suggested, i.e., the
   competition between the elastic-energy density stored and the energy
   density needed for forming one mature shear band in MGs. Our results
   provide a promising strategy for designing tensile ductile MGs with a
   pure amorphous structure at room temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Vein-hosted gold deposits are characterized by mineralization, which is
   spatially restricted to narrow vein structures. Drillholes intersecting
   a mineralized vein can lead to unreliable and biased assay values
   compared to selective mining unit scale block grades. In this work, a
   discrete fracture network is simulated and adapted to model gold
   mineralization within the veins. Veins are assumed planar and the
   required inputs are distributions of vein orientation, vein length, and
   vein intensity (i.e., density). These inputs are collected from
   drillhole data, geological mapping, and expert knowledge of the deposit.
   A spatial point process is then applied to model gold grade as discrete
   events or ``nuggets,{''} which are spatially restricted to the simulated
   quartz veins for the case of incomplete mineralization of the veins;
   when the vein is completely mineralized, a vein thickness distribution
   is required. The methodology is applied to an epithermal gold deposit in
   northwestern British Columbia, Canada and shows improvement in
   restricting the influence of the high-grade gold samples without
   resorting to ad-hoc manipulation of input assays through capping or
   cutting. The final output of this methodology is a block model of gold
   grade, which better honors the spatial structure of the veins in the
   deposit and is suitable for use in mine planning or resource estimation.}},

   This study aims to improve the accuracy of IFRBSs without sacrificing

   Method with an Interpretability-Accuracy tradeoff (OPMIA) to learn the
   parameters of IFRBSs by tuning the types of membership and
   non-membership functions and by adjusting adaptive factors and rule
   weights. The proposed method has been validated in the context of a
   medical diagnosis problem and a well-known publicly available auto-mpg
   data set. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared to Objective
   Programming Method not considering the interpretability (OPMNI) and
   Objective Programming Method based on Similarity Measure (OPMSM). The
   OPMIA helps achieve a sound a tradeoff between accuracy and
   interpretability and demonstrates its advantages over the other two
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data for the NO oxidation to NO2 at atmospheric pressure
   over Co3O4 catalyst were subjected to various kinetic rate models. The
   power law kinetics, Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) kinetics,
   and Eley-Rideal (ER) kinetics were employed to suggest a possible
   reaction mechanism and a suitable kinetic rate equation. The kinetic
   rate equation based on the LHHW kinetics with adsorption of NO as the
   rate-controlling step and the kinetic rate equation based on the ER
   kinetics with surface reaction as the rate-limiting step were first
   equivalently found as the best-fit kinetic rate equations. In each case
   similar activation energies were resulted and that the oxygen adsorption
   was found inhibiting the rate of the oxidation reaction. However, the
   final discrimination based on the literature findings suggested the ER
   model as the best-fit kinetic model with activation energy of 58.3
   kJ/mol and enthalpy of dissociative adsorption of oxygen as -2.10

Abstract = {{Optical metamaterials have redefined how we understand light in notable
   ways: from strong response to optical magnetic fields, negative
   refraction, fast and slow light propagation in zero index and trapping
   structures, to flat, thin and perfect lenses. Many rules of thumb
   regarding optics, such as mu = 1, now have an exception, and basic
   formulas, such as the Fresnel equations, have been expanded. The field
   of metamaterials has developed strongly over the past two decades.
   Leveraging structured materials systems to generate tailored response to
   a stimulus, it has grown to encompass research in optics,
   electromagnetics, acoustics and, increasingly, novel hybrid material
   responses. This roadmap is an effort to present emerging fronts in areas
   of optical metamaterials that could contribute and apply to other
   research communities. By anchoring each contribution in current work and
   prospectively discussing future potential and directions, the authors
   are translating the work of the field in selected areas to a wider
   community and offering an incentive for outside researchers to engage
   our community where solid links do not already exist.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method to address the oil sands tailings
   reclamation problem using surface geopolymerization reactions.
   Geopolymerization involves dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals and
   re solidification reactions that result in the formation of
   three-dimensional inorganic polymers of significant strengths. Since the
   fines present in oil sands mature fine tailings (MFT) mainly consist of
   aluminosilicate minerals, or clay minerals, it is hypothesized that by
   adding appropriate reagents, the surface of the clay minerals can be
   activated and go through geopolymerization reaction under ambient
   conditions. The resulting geopolymeric species formed on the clay
   minerals will bind the clay particles together and strengthen the
   tailings even without further dewatering.
   Geopolymerization was tested on 0.51 g/g (51 wt\%) solids centrifuged
   MFT and its shear strength was observed to increase from 115 to 4880 Pa
   in 90 days when treated with 40 kg of sodium hydroxide and 60 kg sodium
   silicate per tonne of dry MFT solids. Sirnilarly, the shear strength of
   0.48 g/g (48 wt\%) solids polymer flocculated MFT increased from 395 to
   3950 Pai 90 days after the addition of the same dosages of sodium
   hydroxide and sodium silicate. Tests conducted on a geopolymerized model
   kaolinite sample showed that under the test conditions, the
   geopolymenzation reaction only occurs on the surface of the kaolinite at
   the indicated dosages. The surface geopolymers held the kaolinite
   particles together, leading to an increase in its shear strength.}},

   under a synchronized global time scale. Moreover, a modified Lagrangian

Abstract = {{Aggregation in multi-criteria decision-making environments is a process
   of combining the values of a set of attributes into one representative
   value for the entire set of attributes. Many aggregation methodsranging
   from the simple averaging approach to more sophisticated methods, such
   as ordered weighted averaginghave been applied in previous research. One
   challenge in aggregation arises in special cases of prioritized
   aggregation, wherein the prioritized relationships between attributes
   must be considered during aggregation. This paper presents a new
   approach to aggregating attributes with prioritized relationships.
   First, an overview of past research is conducted to identify different
   aggregation methods, classes and properties. Next, the concept of
   prioritized aggregation is explained in detail. A prioritized
   aggregation method utilizing the technique of order preference by
   similarity to ideal solution is then presented. Subsequently, the
   presented prioritized aggregation method is applied on an actual case
   study. According to the results, the aggregation method presented in
   this paper is, through the application of technique of order preference
   by similarity to ideal solution, capable of quantifying and considering
   the prioritized relationship between a set of attributes undergoing
   aggregation. Finally, conclusions are stated, and a discussion
   describing future work pertinent to this paper is presented. Copyright

Abstract = {{Aggregation in a decision making environment requires the fusion of
   opinions of a group of decision makers. The group of decision makers are
   required to analyse a set of interrelated criteria that are usually
   measured on a linguistic scale. This process requires, in many
   instances, to capture experts experience, intuition and thinking that
   are traditionally expressed in a linguistic fashion rather than a
   numerical fashion. Furthermore, the necessity of considering the
   relationship between the criteria to the overall decision must be
   considered by the group of decision makers. This paper extends the
   application of fuzzy numbers, fuzzy relative importance scores (FRIS),
   fuzzy relative weights (FRW) and the fuzzy technique of order preference
   by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) in prioritized aggregation.
   This extension provides a mean to systematically aggregate a group of
   decision makers' views for a set of interrelated criteria that are
   measured on a linguistic scale. First, an overview of the application of
   fuzzy numbers and the characteristics of aggregating fuzzy numbers in
   multi-criteria decision making problems are presented. Then, the
   application of TOPSIS in fuzzy environments is presented. Next, past
   research is highlighted to present prioritized aggregation and the
   different aggregation operators' classes. Subsequently, a new
   prioritized aggregation method is presented. This method utilizes fuzzy
   TOPSIS with prioritized aggregation in fuzzy environments. Finally, the
   fuzzy prioritized aggregation method presented in this paper is applied
   on an actual case study. According to the results, the method presented
   in this paper provides a systematic approach to capture the uncertainty
   and imprecision associated with quantifying linguistic measurements in
   multi-criteria decision making problems. Furthermore, it considers the
   relationship between the set of linguistically measured criteria
   undergoing prioritized aggregation in a fuzzy environment. Lastly,
   findings, conclusions and future work are presented. Copyright (c) 2016

Abstract = {{Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) is a widely used
   technique to examine pore structures in shale reservoirs. Prior to a
   FESEM scan, one must decide upon the location of sample to be viewed as
   well as the magnification ratio to be used, which is, however, prone to
   human errors. One common practice in FESEM study is that one tends to
   use a fixed magnification ratio for observing the pore structure on a
   given location of a sample. Also, the pore structure observed based on a
   given magnification factor cannot entirely represent the true pore
   structure characteristics of the shale sample, primarily due to the
   multi-scale heterogeneity of the shale rocks. To improve the FESEM
   characterization of pore structure in shale samples, we propose a
   methodology to reveal the multi-scale characteristics of shale samples.
   In this work, we propose an improved method for taking multiple FESEM
   images for performing more accurate characterization of the pore
   structures in shale samples. With the improved method, we can determine
   the appropriate number of FESEM images to be taken as well as the
   appropriate magnification ratio to be used in FESEM scan. A given
   magnification ratio is used throughout all the FESEM scans. This method
   can be used to retrieve important multiscale pore-structure
   characteristics of shale samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
   improved FESEM characterization technique by applying it to a shale gas
   formation in Sichuan basin in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate gradient-echo phase errors caused by
   intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) of low signal magnitude, and propose
   methods to reduce artifacts from phase errors in quantitative
   susceptibility mapping (QSM) of ICH.
   Methods: Two QSM methods are proposed: (1) mask-inversion that masks the
   phase of low signal magnitude regions, and (2) ICH magnetic dipole field
   isolation followed by susceptibility superposition using multiple
   boundaries for background field removal. The reconstruction methods were
   tested in eight subjects with ICH using standard single-echo
   susceptibility-weighted imaging at 1.5 Tesla with 40 ms echo time.
   Different phase unwrapping algorithms were also compared.
   Results: Significant phase errors were evident inside ICHs with low
   signal magnitude. The mask-inversion method recovered susceptibility of
   ICH in numerical simulation and minimized phase error propagation in
   patients with ICH. The additional superposed dipole inversion process
   substantially suppressed and constrained streaking artifacts in all
   subjects. Using the proposed superposition method, ICH susceptibilities
   measured from long and short echo times were similar. Laplacian based
   phase unwrapping substantially underestimated the ICH dipole field as
   compared to a path-based method.
   Conclusion: The proposed methods of mask-inversion as well as ICH
   isolation and superposition can substantially reduce artifacts in QSM of
   ICH. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of isochronal annealing on D2 tool steel powder, rapidly
   solidified via both Impulse Atomization and Water Atomization, has been
   evaluated using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and Vickers
   microhardness. The amount of supersaturation of the alloying elements
   inside the retained austenite phase as a function of eutectic
   undercooling was calculated. The fraction of austenite transformed to
   ferrite at different annealing temperatures (from 350 degrees C to 810
   degrees C) was also determined, using Rietveld analysis. The results
   show that although the particles with larger eutectic undercooling have
   larger supersaturation of alloying elements within the retained
   austenite phase, they have a smaller fraction of austenite to ferrite
   transformation at the temperature in which transformation starts. The
   maximum hardness was achieved at an annealing temperature of 550 degrees
   C, due to the formation of fine and well-distributed carbides. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The algebraic geometric (AG) approach has been used to identify switched
   auto regressive exogenous (SARX) models in hybrid systems, and it has
   several advantages over other SARX identification methods. This paper is
   focused on improving the estimation accuracy of the AGapproach for
   systems corrupted with indispensable noises. A stochastic hybrid
   decoupling polynomial (SHDP) is constructed by reformulating the hybrid
   decoupling polynomial (HDP) used in the original AG method. An iterative
   scheme is developed to estimate parameters of the SHDP, which are used
   to calculate the SARX model parameters. This estimation involves linear
   regression with multiplicative noises, therefore a novel approach is
   proposed to solve this regression problem. Then, the parameters are
   recovered fromthe SHDP. Finally, all these steps for SARX model
   identification are summarized in an algorithm called the iterative
   algebraic geometric (IAG) approach. Simulations and experimental
   validation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of and the
   improvement made by the proposed IAG method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a systematic, data-driven framework by which to
   operate a mobile photo radar enforcement (MPRE) program, consisting
   broadly of site choice, enforcement resource allocation and scheduling,
   and evaluation. The overall goal is provide a framework for operating an
   MPRE program that is well-defined and replicable, in order to improve
   efficiency in deploying finite enforcement resources and efficacy in
   improving traffic safety. To illustrate the process, the proposed
   program was applied to simulate a deployment plan for one month using
   data from the City of Edmonton. The results of program application were
   assessed against the results of the existing MPRE program in place in
   May 2014, using several candidate short-term evaluation measures. Based
   on the results, it is expected that with implementation of the proposed
   program, the City of Edmonton's MPRE program may observe moderate to
   high improvements in travel distance efficiency and coverage of sites
   with safety issues. The promising test results do further indicate the
   need for a full-scale, real-life deployment of the proposed program.
   This proposed MPRE program design framework can provide planners,
   engineers, and law enforcement professionals with a systematic,
   analytic, and data-driven process by which to operate a MPRE program.
   Despite that the design framework was built in response to the needs of
   the City of Edmonton's current MPRE program, its development was
   generalized for adaptation and adoption within any jurisdiction looking
   to begin a new program, or make improvements to an existing one, in
   their pursuit of greater traffic safety. (C) 2016 World Conference on

Abstract = {{We propose using variable-length constrained sequence codes to mitigate
   inter-cell interference (ICI) in all-bit-line flash memory with
   multi-page programming for single-level cell, multi-level cell, and
   triple-level cell flash memory structures. We outline constraints that
   mitigate ICI in these systems based on an observation of the Gray
   mapping of data symbols, and we derive the capacity of each constraint.
   Based on a finite state machine representation of each constraint, we
   construct variable-length constrained sequence codes with code rates
   very close to capacity to mitigate ICI in these flash memories. We then
   exploit the inherent error control capability of the proposed
   constrained sequence codes to alleviate error propagation. Finally, we
   integrate these codes with error control codes and present simulation
   results that demonstrate the enhanced bit error rate performance that
   can be achieved.}},

Title = {{Fabrication methods and applications of microstructured gallium based
   liquid metal alloys}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This review contains a comparative study of reported fabrication
   techniques of gallium based liquid metal alloys embedded in elastomers
   such as polydimethylsiloxane or other rubbers as well as the primary
   challenges associated with their use. The eutectic gallium-indium binary
   alloy (EGaIn) and gallium-indium-tin ternary alloy (galinstan) are the
   most common non-toxic liquid metals in use today. Due to their
   deformability, non-toxicity and superior electrical conductivity, these
   alloys have become very popular among researchers for flexible and
   reconfigurable electronics applications. All the available manufacturing
   techniques have been grouped into four major classes. Among them,
   casting by needle injection is the most widely used technique as it is
   capable of producing features as small as 150 nm width by high-pressure
   infiltration. One particular fabrication challenge with gallium based
   liquid metals is that an oxide skin is rapidly formed on the entire
   exposed surface. This oxide skin increases wettability on many surfaces,
   which is excellent for keeping patterned metal in position, but is a
   drawback in applications like reconfigurable circuits, where the
   position of liquid metal needs to be altered and controlled accurately.
   The major challenges involved in many applications of liquid metal
   alloys have also been discussed thoroughly in this article.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of solids cleanout in horizontal wellbores was studied
   experimentally. The special case of drilling-fluid circulation with no
   inner-pipe rotation was considered. This case is similar to coiled
   tubing (CT) drilling in which frequent hole cleanout must be performed.
   Sand-sized cuttings (ranging from 260 to 1240 mm) were used. Critical
   velocity and wall shear stress required for starting bed erosion were
   measured. Water and viscous-polymer base fluids with three different
   polymer concentrations were used.
   Results have shown that water always starts cuttings movement at lower
   flow rates than polymer solutions. Fluids with higher polymer
   concentration (and higher viscosity) required higher flow rates to start
   eroding the bed. Critical wall shear stress was also determined from
   pressure-loss measurements. Analyzing the data revealed that water
   starts cuttings removal at lower pressure loss than more-viscous fluids.
   Higher-viscosity fluids always showed higher pressure loss at the start
   of bed erosion.
   For the range of cuttings size studied, results show that an
   intermediate cuttings size was slightly easier to remove. However, the
   impact of cuttings size was far less than that of fluid rheology.
   Overall cuttings size was found to have a small impact on hole cleaning.
   Dimensionless analysis of parameters relevant to the process of cuttings
   movement was performed. It was shown that dimensionless wall shear
   stress (in the forms of Shields' stress and also ratio of shear velocity
   to settling velocity) at the onset of bed erosion correlated well with
   particle Reynolds number. On the basis of this finding, two correlations
   were developed to predict critical wall shear stress. A procedure was
   developed to calculate critical flow rate as well. Friction-factor data
   for the flow through the annulus with a stationary cuttings bed are also
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most popular vegetation indices to monitor terrestrial
   vegetation productivity, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
   has been widely used to study the plant growth and vegetation
   productivity around the world, especially the dynamic response of
   vegetation to climate change in terms of precipitation and temperature.
   Alberta is the most important agricultural and forestry province and
   with the best climatic observation systems in Canada. However, few
   studies pertaining to climate change and vegetation productivity are
   found. The objectives of this paper therefore were to better understand
   impacts of climate change on vegetation productivity in Alberta using
   the NDVI and provide reference for policy makers and stakeholders. We
   investigated the following: (1) the variations of Alberta's smoothed
   NDVI (sNDVI, eliminated noise compared to NDVI) and two climatic
   variables (precipitation and temperature) using non-parametric
   Mann-Kendall monotonic test and Thiel-Sen's slope; (2) the relationships
   between sNDVI and climatic variables, and the potential predictability
   of sNDVI using climatic variables as predictors based on two predicted
   models; and (3) the use of a linear regression model and an artificial
   neural network calibrated by the genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) to estimate
   Alberta's sNDVI using precipitation and temperature as predictors. The
   results showed that (1) the monthly sNDVI has increased during the past
   30 years and a lengthened growing season was detected; (2) vegetation
   productivity in northern Alberta was mainly temperature driven and the
   vegetation in southern Alberta was predominantly precipitation driven
   for the period of 1982-2011; and (3) better performances of the
   sNDVI-climate relationships were obtained by nonlinear model (ANN-GA)
   than using linear (regression) model. Similar results detected in both
   monthly and summer sNDVI prediction using climatic variables as
   predictors revealed the applicability of two models for different period
   of year ecologists might focus on.}},

Abstract = {{Contact effects at the source/drain (S/D) electrodes in thin film
   transistors (TFTs) based on zinc oxide (ZnO) utilizing the top gate,
   bottom contact geometry are investigated using electrical and material
   studies. Low temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to
   directly grow the ZnO active layer on Au, Ru, and TiW bottom electrodes.
   TFT performance varies significantly depending on the S/D metallization
   scheme. Au contacts are seen to uniquely promote the growth of a highly
   n-doped ZnO channel that degrades the TFT's output impedance and
   controllability. On the other hand, TiW contacts suffer from poor
   carrier injection because of Schottky barrier formation. The best
   overall performance is demonstrated by Ru/ZnO TFTs based on their
   excellent switching capabilities alongside a moderately high mobility.
   From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, the superior
   performance of Ru is the consequence of an oxidation-free interface that
   inhibits the adsorption of hydroxide surface dopants. Thus, the surface
   chemistry of the metal contact plays a large role on the ZnO growth and
   metal/ZnO interface energetics.}},

Abstract = {{In traditional networked control systems, wired communication networks
   are used for the transmission of information between the communicating
   systems. With the increasing demand for distributed systems and the
   growth in the scale of the applications, the use of wireless
   communication networks offers significant advantages over their wired
   counterparts. To facilitate the deployment of a fully automated
   closed-loop wireless networked control system (WNCS), this paper
   addresses several design considerations for a proposed topology for
   potential use as a closed-loop WNCS. The topology consists of a plant
   system having sensor and actuator nodes, a controller system having
   input and output nodes, an intermediate network system having
   interconnected nodes, and wireless communication links for the
   information transfer between the different nodes of the plant,
   controller, and network systems. More specifically, the design
   considerations addressed in the paper are: the condition requirements
   needed to facilitate the design of optimal controller and network
   systems, the joint design of optimal controller and network systems to
   control the plant system, and the structured model reduction of the
   closed-loop WNCS to reduce its scale. Finally, simulation examples are
   provided to demonstrate the applicability of discussed design
   considerations.}},

Abstract = {{A discontinuous pulse-width modulation (PWM) scheme is presented for a
   six-switch three-limb coupled inductor inverter. Three-level PWM phase
   output voltages are produced with a reduced switch count and reduced
   dv/dt stresses on loads and output filters. The PWM scheme described
   lowers the coupled inductor and semiconductor losses by lowering the
   inductor winding high-frequency current ripple using two techniques: 1)
   winding excitation flipping within each carrier cycle; and 2) the
   inductor magnetic flux is kept within the three-limb core, neglecting
   natural leakage, by avoiding switching states that produce common-mode
   voltage excitation of the three-limb inductor. To make best use of the
   nonstandard switching patterns produced, reference signals are
   preprocessed before being delivered to the PWM modules using only one
   carrier signal: representing an approach well suited for implementation
   in a low-cost digital signal processor. The digital output signals of
   each PWM module represent the desired switching states of each switch in
   the inverter. This approach contrasts with previous published work,
   where postprocessing of the PWM module output signals is necessary using
   digital logic circuitry, such as a field-programmable gate array.
   Experimental results, with inductor loss and inverter efficiency
   comparisons for different operating conditions, confirm that the
   three-phase six-switch inverter PWM patterns lower the high-frequency
   current ripple in the inductor windings and, hence, significantly lower
   the inverter losses and increase the power conversion efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity and uncertainty inherent in large cellular networks make
   the acquisition of location and channel information of all but perhaps a
   few neighboring network nodes (base stations (BSs)) difficult for a
   given user. Therefore, a cell association policy must operate with
   sparse information. Thus, the serving BS is proposed to be the one that
   provides the highest instantaneous signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
   from among all BSs providing average received signal power exceeding a
   predetermined minimum. This policy is evaluated for the downlink of
   single-tier (homogeneous) and two-tier (heterogeneous) networks, and for
   the latter, the key advantage of the proposed policy is its capability
   to enable traffic offloading. Two methods to determine the minimum
   average signal power are given. Coverage probabilities and average rates
   of mobile stations in coverage are derived, accounting for path loss,
   multipath fading, and random locations of BSs in each tier. Analysis is
   verified by Monte Carlo simulations. We observe that the instantaneous
   SIR and average received signal power of a few BSs are sufficient to
   achieve the coverage corresponding to the highest SIR association, which
   in general requires instantaneous SIR information of a larger subset of
   a network. We also observe that in a two-tier network, the effect of
   strong interference from high-power BSs, such as macro BSs, can be
   limited by proper choice of minimum average received signal power for
   low-power BSs.}},

Abstract = {{Long-standing alarms are those in the alarm state continuously for a
   long period of time. Some long-standing alarms belong to nuisance
   alarms, playing a detrimental role to the performance of industrial
   alarm systems, and hence they should be removed. The paper analyzes the
   main causes leading to long-standing alarms as nuisance ones; industrial
   examples from a large-scale thermal power plant are provided as
   supportive evidences of the main causes. A dynamic state-based alarm
   system is designed to remove long-standing alarms caused by the
   inconsistency between the alarm design and discrete-valued operating
   states. The design is based on two rules formulated to select state
   variables and a novel alarm generation mechanism to generate state-based
   alarm variables. Industrial case studies illustrate the effectiveness of
   the dynamic state-based alarm system in significantly reducing the
   severity of long-standing alarms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Multi-frequency capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs)
   consist of interlaced large and small membranes for multiband operation.
   In modeling these devices, accurate and computationally efficient
   methods are required for computing self-and mutual-acoustic-radiation
   impedances. However, most previous works considered mutual-acoustic
   impedance between radiators of identical size. A need was thus found to
   revisit the fundamental framework for mutual-acoustic impedance for its
   applicability to radiators, especially flexural disks, of differing
   size. The Bouwkamp integral method is used to achieve infinite series
   expressions for self-and mutual-acoustic radiation impedances.
   Polynomial-fitting-based approximate relations of the mutual-acoustic
   impedance are developed for arbitrary array geometries and are in good
   agreement with exact expressions. The derived mutual-acoustic impedance
   is incorporated into equivalent circuit models of multi-frequency CMUTs
   showing excellent agreement with finite element modeling. The results
   demonstrate that mutual-acoustic interactions significantly impact
   device performance. The framework presented here may prove valuable for
   future design of multi-frequency arrays for novel multiscale imaging,
   superharmonic contrast imaging, and image therapy applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present a rigorous solution of the problem of an arc-shaped interface
   crack embedded between a circular electrostrictive fiber and a foreign
   matrix subjected to uniform remote electric loadings. The crack faces
   are assumed to be permeable to an electric field. Mode-I and Mode-II
   stress intensity factors for the oscillatory singular stress field at
   the crack tips are obtained using complex variable methods. We find that
   the stress intensity factors typically increase as the fiber becomes
   harder. For certain combi-nations of the arc length of the crack and
   material constants of the fiber-matrix system, we show that remote
   electric loadings may actually prevent mode-I interfacial fracture. In
   particular, we show that when the fiber-matrix system degenerates to a
   homogeneous electrostrictive material and the medium inside the crack is
   identical to that surrounding the material remotely, the application of
   remote electric loadings continue to have a significant influence on
   both mode-I and mode-II fracture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition of ZnO with diethyl zinc and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Although atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO using diethyl zinc (DEZ)
   precursor has been extensively reported, variation in growth-per-cycle
   (GPC) values and the range of substrate temperature (T-sub) for ALD
   growth between related studies remain unexplained. For identical
   processes, GPC for the characteristic self-limiting ALD growth is
   expected to be comparable. Hence, a significant variation in GPC among
   published ZnO ALD studies strongly suggests a concealed non-ALD growth
   component. To investigate this, the authors report plasma-enhanced ALD
   growth of ZnO using DEZ precursor and O-2 inductively coupled plasma.
   The effect of T-sub on ZnO GPC was studied with deposition cycles (1)
   0.02 s-15 s-6 s-15 s, (2) 0.10 s-15 s-15 s-15 s, and (3) 0.20 s-15 s-30
   s-15 s, where the cycle parameters t(1)-t(2)-t(3)-t(4) denote duration
   of DEZ pulse, post-DEZ purge, plasma exposure, and postplasma purge,
   respectively. The non-ALD growth characteristics observed at T-sub >= 60
   degrees C are discussed and attributed to DEZ precursor decomposition.
   The authors demonstrate ZnO growth at T-sub = 50 degrees C to be
   self-limiting with respect to both t(1) and t(3) giving GPC of 0.101 +/-
   0.001 nm/cycle. The effect of precursor decomposition related (non-ALD)
   growth at T-sub >= 60 degrees C is illustrated from comparison of
   optical dielectric function, electrical resistivity, and surface
   roughness of ZnO films deposited at T-sub = 50, 125, and 200 degrees C.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{55-65}},

Abstract = {{It is widely believed that maximum traction of traction-separation law
   (TSL) and cohesive energy are the two key parameters of cohesive zone
   model (CZM). A method is presented in this paper to determine the two
   key CZM parameters for pipeline steels. The maximum traction of TSL is
   given by the critical stress defined based on damage at fracture point
   from the true stress-strain curve. And the other key parameter, cohesive
   energy defined as the area under the curve of TSL and usually considered
   as the critical J-integral, is estimated from a simple tensile test
   simulation. The two key CZM parameters obtained by the present method
   are validated for dynamic fracture of pipeline steels. Both
   load-displacement curves and crack tip opening angle (CTOA)-fracture

   operated inside this fluidic environment and a performance deviation of
   similar to 15\% was measured compared to an open MEMS configuration.

Abstract = {{Current-source converters (CSCs) have a promising potential to interface
   the large-scale photovoltaic (PV) generators to electric grids. In order
   to overcome several drawbacks associated with the conventional
   vector-controlled CSC-based PV systems, this paper presents for the
   first time, the power synchronization control (PSC) scheme for the
   single-stage grid-connected CSC-based PV generator. A detailed
   small-signal model for the complete CSC-based PV system with the PSC
   strategy is developed to investigate the system stability, characterize
   the converter interactions with the electric grid, and design the
   controller parameters. The PSC of the CSC-based PV system reflects a
   stable performance under different operating conditions and following
   sudden variations in the insolation level. Due to the inherent
   synchronizing feature of the PSC, the phase-locked loop is eliminated
   and, hence, the integration to the very weak grids is seamlessly
   achieved. Although there is no direct control on the injected ac current
   to the grid, the inherent self-current-limiting feature of the CSC
   through the modulation of the regulated dc-choke current offers an
   overcurrent protection. Detailed nonlinear time-domain simulations
   results validate the theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of
   the PSC strategy.}},

Title = {{Effects of reservoir heterogeneity on scaling of effective mass transfer
   coefficient for solute transport}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{181-193}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modeling transport process at large scale requires proper scale-up of
   subsurface heterogeneity and an understanding of its interaction with
   the underlying transport mechanisms. A technique based on volume
   averaging is applied to quantitatively assess the scaling
   characteristics of effective mass transfer coefficient in heterogeneous
   reservoir models. The effective mass transfer coefficient represents the
   combined contribution from diffusion and dispersion to the transport of
   non-reactive solute particles within a fluid phase. Although treatment
   of transport problems with the volume averaging technique has been
   published in the past, application to geological systems exhibiting
   realistic spatial variability remains a challenge. Previously, the
   authors developed a new procedure where results from a fine-scale
   numerical flow simulation reflecting the full physics of the transport
   process albeit over a sub-volume of the reservoir are integrated with
   the volume averaging technique to provide effective description of
   transport properties. The procedure is extended, such that spatial
   averaging is performed at the local-heterogeneity scale.
   In this paper, the transport of a passive (non-reactive) solute is
   simulated on multiple reservoir models exhibiting different patterns of
   heterogeneities, and the scaling behavior of effective mass transfer
   coefficient (Kell) is examined and compared. One such set of models
   exhibit power-law (fractal) characteristics, and the variability of
   dispersion and K-eff with scale is in good agreement with analytical
   expressions described in the literature. This work offers an insight
   into the impacts of heterogeneity on the scaling of effective transport
   parameters. A key finding is that spatial heterogeneity models with
   similar univariate and bivariate statistics may exhibit different
   scaling characteristics because of the influence of higher order
   statistics. More mixing is observed in the channelized models with
   higher-order continuity. It reinforces the notion that the flow response
   is influenced by the higher-order statistical description of
   heterogeneity. An important implication is that when scaling-up
   transport response from lab-scaleresults to the field scale, it is
   necessary to account for the scale-up of heterogeneity. Since the
   characteristics of higher-order multivariate distributions and
   large-scale heterogeneity are typically not captured in small-scale
   experiments, a reservoir modeling framework that captures the
   uncertainty in heterogeneity description should be adopted. (C) 2016

Title = {{Perceiving Interactions on Construction Safety Behaviors: Workers'
   Perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic approach that incorporates structural
   equation modeling (SEM) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to
   perceive and verify causal-relationships and interactions between
   enablers and goals of construction workers' safety behaviors (CWSB). A
   sample of 450 questionnaire surveys regarding CWSB was collected from
   construction workers in several Chinese construction companies. EFA was
   used to extract eight common factors in order to identify the model
   structure among 28 questionnaire items. Then, SEM was employed to
   investigate the interrelationships among variables in the hypothesized
   safety behavior model. The built causal model was verified in terms of
   the hypothesis test and goodness-of-fit test. The impact of the path
   coefficient on CWSB was investigated and analyzed in detail. Results
   indicate that management-oriented supervision and system (F3) and
   leadership (F8) exert obvious positive impacts on CWSB in accordance
   with the path coefficients analysis, whereas psychological workers'
   condition (F5) and workplace conditions (F6) exert obvious negative
   influences. Individual differences among workers (F2) do not perform
   statistically significantly with workers' safety behaviors. The
   developed approach is capable of revealing causal-relationships, testing
   hypothesized models, and determining leading factors in complex project
   environments. This research provides insights into cause-effect
   relationships among the workers' perceived influential factors and
   goals, and the results can be used to understand the factors that the
   construction workers perceive as important factors in safety behaviors.
   This can further provide decision support on the improvement of
   construction safety performance in the context of the Chinese
   construction industry.}},

Title = {{Design of LRT Signal Priority to Improve Arterial Traffic Mobility}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Transit signal priority (TSP) is a cost-effective strategy for improving
   the movement of public transit vehicles, such as Light Rail Transit
   (LRT), buses, and streetcars, through controlled intersections. The
   application of TSP strategies improves the reliability and quality of
   service for transit vehicles with less disruption to normal traffic. The
   City of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada has recently extended its LRT
   system, which mainly runs through at-grade intersections. Edmonton's LRT
   is currently operating under pre-emption, which causes significant
   delays to other traffic. The problem is especially pronounced during
   peak hours when the LRT headway is decreased to 5min in both directions.
   This has led to dissatisfaction among motorists using the roadway along
   the LRT corridor. This paper analyzes different TSP strategies for
   improving the performance of the LRT corridor. A standard
   microsimulation tool with a ring barrier controller emulator was used to
   implement the strategies at a major intersection during peak hours.
   Field data for both morning and evening peak hours were collected at
   four intersections along the LRT corridor for the calibration of the
   model. Three strategies were explored in this paper: (1)simple LRT
   pre-emption, (2)LRT prediction and pre-emption, and (3)LRT prediction
   and pre-emption together with transit bus priority. A number of
   performance measures were used to evaluate each strategy. Results
   revealed that Strategy 2, where LRT arrival time is predicted to provide
   LRT pre-emption, yields the highest improvement in corridor performance.}},

Abstract = {{The massive emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), the major portion of
   greenhouse gases, has negatively affected our ecosystem. Developing new
   technologies to effectively reduce CO2 emission or convert CO2 to useful
   products has never been more imperative. In response to this challenge,
   we herein developed novel in situ exsolved Fe-Ni alloy nanospheres
   uniformly socketed on an oxygen-deficient perovskite {[}La(Sr)Fe-(Ni)]
   as a highly stable and efficient catalyst for the. effective conversion
   of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) in a high temperature solid oxide
   electrolysis cell (HT-SOEC). The symmetry between the reduction and
   reoxidation cycles of this catalyst indicates its good redox
   reversibility. The cathodic reaction kinetics for CO2 electrolysis is
   significantly improved with a polarization resistance as low as 0.272
   Omega cm(2). In addition, a remarkably enhanced current density of 1.78
   A cm(-2), along with a high Faraday efficiency (similar to 98.8\%), was
   achieved at 1.6 V and 850 degrees C. Moreover, the potentiostatic
   stability test of up to 100 h showed that the cell was stable without
   any noticeable coking in a CO2/CO (70:30) flow at an applied potential
   of 0.6 V (vs OCV) and 850 degrees C. The increased oxygen vacancies
   together with the in situ exsolved nanospheres on the perovskite
   backbone ensures sufficiently active sites and consequently improves the
   electrochemical performance for the efficient CO2 conversion. Therefore,
   this newly developed perovskite can be a promising cathode material for
   HT-SOEC. More generally, this study points to a new direction to develop
   highly efficient catalysts in the form of the perovskite oxides with
   perfectly in situ exsolved metal/bimetal nanospheres.}},

Abstract = {{Rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are receiving interest as promising
   energy storage devices owing to their high theoretical energy density.
   One of the major challenges in developing rechargeable ZABs is the slow
   kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution (ORR/OER) on the air
   electrode during battery discharging and charging. Here, we report on a
   composite air electrode consisting of a Mn-Co mixed oxide
   electrocatalyst film on a carbon gas diffusion layer synthesized via
   anodic electrodeposition. The Mn-Co oxides have a fibrous structure and
   exhibit high catalytic activity towards both ORR and OER. ZAB test
   results show that the catalyst reduces the discharge-charge voltage gap
   and improves the round-trip efficiency in comparison with the baseline
   Pt-Ru/C catalyst. Furthermore, the catalyst remains stable for repeated
   cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Progressive contralateral hippocampal atrophy following surgery for
   medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy}},
Journal = {{EPILEPSY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{62-71}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Determine the extent and time course of volumetric changes in
   the contralateral hippocampus following surgery for medically refractory
   temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
   Methods: Serial T1-weighted MRI brain scans were obtained in 26 TLE
   patients pre- and post-temporal lobe epilepsy surgery as well as in 12
   control subjects of similar age. Patients underwent either anterior
   temporal lobectomy (ATL) or selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH).
   Blinded, manual hippocampal volumetry (head, body, and tail) was
   performed in two groups: 1) two scan group {[}ATL (n = 6); SAH (n =
   10)], imaged pre-surgery and on average at 5.4 years post-surgery; and
   2) longitudinal group {[}ATL (n = 8); SAH (n = 2)] imaged pre-surgery
   and on post-operative day 1, 2, 3, 6, 60, 120 and a delayed time point
   (average 2.4 years).
   Results: In the two scan group, there was atrophy by 12\% of the
   unresected contralateral hippocampus (p < 0.001), with atrophy being
   most pronounced (27\%) in the hippocampal body (p < 0.001) with no
   significant differences seen for the hippocampal head or tail. In the
   longitudinal group, significant atrophy was also observed for the whole
   hippocampus and the body with atrophy seen as early as post-operative
   day \#1 which progressed significantly over the first post-operative
   week (1.3\%/day and 3.0\%./day, respectively) before stabilizing over
   the long-term to a 13\% reduction in total volume. There was no
   significant difference in atrophy compared by surgical approach (ATL vs.
   SAH; p = 0.94) or side (p = 0.31); however, atrophy was significantly
   more pronounced in patients with ongoing post-operative seizures
   (hippocampal body, p = 0.019; whole hippocampus, p = 0.048). There were
   no detectable postoperative neuropsychological deficits attributable to
   contralateral hippocampal atrophy.
   Significance: Significant contralateral hippocampal atrophy occurs
   following TLE surgery, which begins immediately and progresses over the
   first post-operative week. The observation that seizure free patients
   had significantly less atrophy of the contralateral hippocampus after
   surgery suggests the possibility of an early post-operative imaging
   marker to predict surgical outcome. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A phased-mission system (PMS) usually consists of several nonoverlapping
   phases of tasks. All phases are required to be accomplished sequentially
   for a successful mission. Different features must be considered in the
   reliability evaluation of a PMS, including the dependence among the
   phases with respect to a common component and the different system
   topologies for the phases. To overcome the limitation of existing
   approaches, a stochastic computational approach is proposed for
   efficiently analyzing the reliability of a nonrepairable PMS. Stochastic
   logic models are proposed to analyze the common components in the
   different phases. In the stochastic analysis, the signal probabilities
   of the basic components are encoded as non-Bernoulli sequences of random
   permutations with fixed numbers of 1s and 0s. Thus, the proposed
   stochastic approach can be used to evaluate a PMS under any
   distribution. Based on the generated stochastic sequences for the basic
   components and the system topology, the failure probability of the PMS
   can be efficiently predicted. Several case studies are evaluated to show
   the accuracy and efficiency of the stochastic approach. Compared with a
   combinatorial analysis, the accuracy of the stochastic analysis varies
   with the length of the stochastic sequences. However, it is shown that
   the stochastic analysis is more efficient than a Monte Carlo simulation
   at the same execution complexity in the number of runs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recently developed laboratory and numerical techniques reveal that the
   very thin, near-wall (assumed) ``laminar{''} fluid layer, an essential
   feature of all turbulent flow conditions, houses a world of identifiable
   jetlike structures including bursts generated from the near-wall regions
   and lumps of fluids projected back onto the wall zones. This activity,
   identified as ``coherent structures{''} (CS), is recognized as an
   important mechanism for radial mass transport and energy dissipation,
   particularly in near-wall or fluid-bed zones. Buoyancy-, adhesion-,
   hydrodynamic-, and CS-related updraft forces act on particles positioned
   in the fluid-bed interface zone. Depending on the particle nature, bulk
   fluid properties, and transport velocity, three pairs of forces were
   identified corresponding to the equilibrium condition of deposit
   particles in each of the three size ranges with respect to the onset of
   entrainment into the bulk flow. This mechanistic approach using a set of
   force equilibrium equations to assess the potential entrainment of
   particles was first suggested in 1980 by Phillips and was later (2006)
   applied by Toma and a research team from ARC and PETRONAS to explain the
   aging of wall-deposit layer occurring during waxy crude transportation
   as an effect of size-selective removal of paraffin crystals formed from
   a mixture of crystalized alkanes. The merit of this paper, regarded as
   an extension of the 2006 publication, is to introduce a more general
   selective extraction rate function that enables calculations of both the
   rate of paraffin aging and size alteration of any fine, polydisperse
   particulate matter exposed to bulk turbulent flow, gas or liquid.
   Without any adjustment of the process or physical constants, the
   modeling results presented in this paper compared satisfactorily with
   the experimental results obtained independently by the Texaco Research
   (aging of waxy crude) and laboratory data from the University of Alberta
   on the effect of size-selective extraction of fine sand or glass beads
   (GB) initially deposited on the bottom of a pipe and exposed to a
   turbulent bulk flow of water. An overarching objective of this paper is
   to stir interest in mechanistic modeling and prediction of
   size-selective radial transport and separation for a broad range of
   industrial and environmental applications and studies and specifically
   in the recognition and use of burst-sweep CS structures for calculating
   radial transport of small particle sizes, particularly in near-interface
   zones exposed to turbulent flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Albeit simple and easy to interpret, a piecewise representation of time
   series comes with discontinuities that inevitably lead to substantial
   representation (approximation) error. In this study, we present models
   of time series with time granulation that reduce representation errors
   and subsequently give rise to the better approximation abilities and
   classification rates of classifiers of time series. The jumps
   (discontinuities) occurring because of the local piecewise
   representation of time series over disjoint time windows are eliminated
   due to the use of fuzzy sets describing overlapping time segments
   (temporal windows). We engage particle swarm optimization (PSO) as an
   optimization vehicle to minimize the representation error based on the
   adjustments of the length of the segments and the degree of overlap
   among membership functions of the temporal windows. We also consider PSO
   to minimize the classification error of classifiers of time series. In a
   series of experiments, we consider two commonly used piecewise
   techniques of approximation of time series such as piecewise aggregate
   approximation (PAA) and piecewise linear representation (PLR). The
   results demonstrate that PLR models produce lower approximation errors
   in comparison with those obtained for the PAA representation and
   quantify an impact of fuzzy temporal segmentation on the overall quality
   of the model. Results of comprehensive comparative studies are provided

Abstract = {{Aim: To develop delivery systems for efficient siRNA delivery to breast
   cancer. Methods: Poly(ethylene
   oxide)-block-poly(e-caprolactone-grafted-spermine) (PEO-b-P(CL-g-SP))

   RGD4C peptide on their shell. Transfection efficiency of complexed MCL-1
   siRNA in MDA-MB-435 was investigated, in vitro and in vivo following
   intratumoral and intravenous injection. Results: Cholesteryl
   modification of the core significantly increased the transfection
   efficiency of PEO-b-P(CL-g-SP)-complexed siRNA, in vitro, but not
   following intratumoral or intravenous administration, in vivo. Instead,
   RGD4C modification of the micellar shell enhanced transfection
   efficiency of complexed MCL1 siRNA in tumor upon intravenous
   administration. Conclusion: RGD4C-PEO-b-P(CL-gSP) micelles, without or
   with cholesterol modification, can provide efficient delivery of siRNA
   to breast tumors following systemic administration.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a dynamic image-based visual servoing (IBVS)
   control for a rotary wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which directly
   accounts for the vehicle's underactuated dynamic model. The motion
   control objective is to follow parallel lines and is motivated by power
   line inspection tasks where the UAV's relative position and orientation
   to the lines are controlled. The design is based on a virtual camera
   whose motion follows the onboard physical camera but which is
   constrained to point downwards independent of the vehicle's roll and
   pitch angles. A set of image features is proposed for the lines
   projected into the virtual camera frame. These features are chosen to
   simplify the interaction matrix which in turn leads to a simpler IBVS
   control design which is globally asymptotically stable. The proposed
   scheme is adaptive and therefore does not require depth estimation.
   Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the
   proposed control and its robustness to calibration parameter error.}},

Title = {{Removal of iron from sythetic copper leach solution using a

Abstract = {{Iron removal is a common procedure in hydrometallurgy of non-ferrous
   metallic ores. Chemical precipitation and solvent extraction are
   currently the main methods employed for separation of iron from copper
   leach solution. However, chemical precipitation methods have the problem
   of producing large amounts of iron precipitates, and/or requiring high
   temperature and high pressure conditions for precipitation. The
   precipitates are difficult to separate from the solution. Emulsification
   is a general problem for solvent extraction, which causes loss of
   extractants and contamination of the electrolyte. A common problem for
   solvent extraction and chelating ion exchange processes is the difficult
   iron stripping process. Therefore, finding an efficient and
   environmentally friendly method for iron removal is of great
   significance. In this paper, new processes of using ion exchange resins
   to remove iron from copper leach solution have been investigated.
   Salicylic acid, amino carboxylic acid, amino phosphonic acid and
   hydroxy-oxime resins were employed to adsorb iron from a synthetic
   copper leach solution containing 40 g/L of Cu2+ and 36 g/L of Fe3+. It
   was found that a hydroxy-oxime resin, named Z-Fe, has excellent
   adsorption selectivity on Fe3+. Desorption behavior of the resin was
   studied by two step elutions using dilute H2SO4 and oxalic acid
   solution, respectively. After optimizing the adsorption-elution
   processes, the extent of removal of iron from the simulated copper leach
   solution using resin Z-Fe was 89.83\%, while copper recovery could reach
   100\% in closed circuit processing. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{Adding hydrophobic groups to polyacrylamide (PAM) flocculants improves
   flocculation and dewatering (settling, turbidity, capillary suction time
   and solids content after centrifugation) of mature fine tailings (MFT).
   In this study, we copolymerized different amounts of polypropylene oxide
   macromonomers (PPO) with acrylamide to produce PAM-PPO graft copolymers
   with different hydrophobicities and molecular weights. According to CST,
   turbidity and centrifugation results, the PAM-PPO copolymers dewatered
   and densified MFT more efficiently than a reference commercial anionic
   PAM supposedly because the PPO hydrophobic groups reduced the amount of
   water trapped inside the polymer floccules. Besides densifying and
   dewatering tailings more efficiently, the PAM-PPO copolymers had
   molecular weights ten times smaller than the reference anionic PAM
   flocculant, which reduced their viscosities and shear-sensitivities. As
   a result, it is easier to mix these copolymers with tailings under a
   wider window of operating conditions. We also observed that aged MFT
   (stored for approximately 10 months) were more easily dewatered,
   especially at high solids content (20 wt\%). This behavior might be
   attributed to the evaporation of water, hydrocarbons, or other low
   molecular weight organic compounds. However, further studies are
   required to understand what and how chemical compositional changes alter
   the stability of MFT. The information generated in these studies could
   be used to design polymers that could target the MFT components
   responsible for its high stability and slow consolidation. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Recently, important advances in road safety statistics have been brought
   about by methods able to address issues other than the choice of the
   best error structure for modeling crash data. In particular, accounting
   for spatial and temporal interdependence, i.e., the notion that the
   collision occurrence of a site or unit times depend on those of others,
   has become an important issue that needs further research.
   Overall, autoregressive models can be used for this purpose as they can
   specify that the output variable depends on its own previous values and
   on a stochastic term. Spatial effects have been investigated and applied
   mostly in the context of developing safety performance functions (SPFs)
   to relate crash occurrence to highway characteristics. Hence, there is a
   need for studies that attempt to estimate the effectiveness of safety
   countermeasures by including the spatial interdependence of road sites
   within the context of an observational before-after (BA) study.
   Moreover, the combination of temporal dynamics and spatial effects on
   crash frequency has not been explored in depth for SPF development.
   Therefore, the main goal of this research was to carry out a BA study
   accounting for spatial effects and temporal dynamics in evaluating the
   effectiveness of a road safety treatment. The countermeasure analyzed
   was the installation of traffic signals at unsignalized urban/suburban
   intersections in British Columbia (Canada). The full Bayes approach was
   selected as the statistical framework to develop the models.
   The results demonstrated that zone variation was a major component of
   total crash variability and that spatial effects were alleviated by
   clustering intersections together. Finally, the methodology used also
   allowed estimation of the treatment's effectiveness in the form of crash
   modification factors and functions with time trends. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The City of Edmonton began its intersection safety device (ISD) program
   in 2009 with the installation of 50 cameras throughout the city. The
   ISDs are approach-specific and combine automated enforcement of
   red-light running and speed violations during the red and green phases
   of the intersection control. The goal of this study is to evaluate the
   safety performance of ISDs within the city of Edmonton, Canada and to
   identify factors that can lead to successful selection of future ISD
   sites. A before-and-after Empirical Bayes (EB) method is used to account
   for regression-to-the-mean and other confounding factors. A safety
   performance function and yearly calibration factors are developed using
   data from a set of reference intersections within Edmonton. The
   before-and-after analysis is applied at the overall intersection level
   and for each approach of the ISD intersections. The results showed
   significant reductions that ranged from 12\% to 25\% for total
   collisions, and from 33\% to 43\% for angle collisions. No significant
   reduction was observed for severe collisions at the intersection level,
   however significant reductions were found at the approach level at
   locations with a relatively higher collision history. The impact of site
   selection criteria on collision reduction was also evaluated. Greater
   reductions were found at sites with a higher collision frequency.
   Additionally, the impact of intersection characteristics on collision
   reduction was investigated. Speed limits, presence of separated right
   turn lane and the number of lanes were found to impact ISD collision
   reduction. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Modeling and evaluating construction project competencies and their
   relationship to project performance}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{115-130}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In contemporary construction environments, construction organizations
   measure their performance against a set of predefined performance
   measures. These performance measures are governed by the ability of the
   organization to maintain necessary sets of ``competencies{''} that
   assist in the successful execution of its construction projects.
   Competencies are often difficult to define and measure due to the
   multidimensional and subjective nature of their assessment. This paper
   identifies 41 project competencies with a total of 248 criteria for
   evaluating the different project competencies. This paper also
   identifies seven performance categories with 46 project key performance
   indicators. A systematic framework and methodology are presented in this
   paper to measure project competencies and project key performance
   indicators. A new modeling approach considering prioritized fuzzy
   aggregation, factor analysis, and fuzzy neural networks is presented to
   identify the relationship between project competencies and project key
   performance indicators. Data collected from seven construction projects
   are first aggregated using prioritized fuzzy aggregation to measure the
   different construction project competencies. The different project
   competencies are then analyzed using factor analysis. The factor
   analysis results are used with the prioritized fuzzy aggregation results
   to calculate inputs for the fuzzy neural networks. The fuzzy neural
   networks are then trained and tested using the data collected from the
   seven construction projects to identify and quantify the relationship
   between the different project competencies and project key performance
   indicators. This paper contributes to the current body of knowledge in
   project competencies and performance by establishing a standardized
   framework and methodology for evaluating the impact of construction
   project competencies on project key performance indicators. Furthermore,
   this paper incorporates advanced modeling techniques through the
   application of fuzzy set theory and neural networks to identify the
   relationship between the different project competencies and project key
   performance indicators. Identifying the relationship between
   construction project competencies and project key performance indicators
   allows construction organizations to improve their overall construction
   project performance by enhancing their projects competencies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Data clustering is aimed at discovering a structure in data. The
   revealed structure is usually represented in terms of prototypes and
   partition matrices. In some cases, the prototypes are simultaneously
   formed using data and features by running a co-clustering

   advantages when handling uncertainty. This study introduces a novel
   clustering technique by combining fuzzy co-clustering approach and
   interval-valued fuzzy sets in which two values of the fuzzifier of the
   fuzzy clustering algorithm are used to form the footprint of uncertainty
   (FOU). The study demonstrates the performance of the proposed method
   through a series of experiments completed for various datasets
   (including color segmentation, multi-spectral image classification, and
   document categorization). The experiments quantify the quality of
   results with the aid of validity indices and visual inspection. Some

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Implicit solvent models offer an attractive way to estimate the effects
   of a solvent environment on the properties of small or large solutes
   without the complications of explicit simulations. One common test of
   accuracy is to compute the free energy of transfer from gas to liquid
   for a variety of small molecules, since many of these values have been
   measured. Studies of the temperature dependence of these values (i.e.
   solvation enthalpies and entropies) can provide additional insights into
   the performance of implicit solvent models. Here, we show how to compute
   temperature derivatives of hydration free energies for the 3D-RISM
   integral equation approach. We have computed hydration free energies of
   1123 small drug-like molecules (both neutral and charged). Temperature
   derivatives were also used to calculate hydration energies and entropies
   of 74 of these molecules (both neutral and charged) for which
   experimental data is available. While direct results have rather poor
   agreement with experiment, we have found that several previously
   proposed linear hydration free energy correction schemes give good
   agreement with experiment. These corrections also provide good agreement
   for hydration energies and entropies though simple extensions are
   required in some cases.}},

Title = {{Identifying semantic blocks in Web pages using Gestalt laws of grouping}},

Abstract = {{Semantic block identification is an approach to retrieve information
   from Web pages and applications. As Website design evolves, however,
   traditional methodologies cannot perform well any more. This paper
   proposes a new model to merge Web page content into semantic blocks by
   simulating human perception. A ``layer tree{''} is constructed to remove
   hierarchical inconsistencies between the DOM tree representation and the
   visual layout of the Web page. Subsequently, the Gestalt laws of
   grouping are interpreted as the rules for semantic block detection.
   During interpretation, the normalized Hausdorff distance, the CIE-Lab
   color difference, the normalized compression distance, and the series of
   visual information are proposed to operationalize these Gestalt laws.
   Finally, a classifier is trained to combine each operationalized law
   into a unified rule for identifying semantic blocks from the Web page.
   Experiments are conducted to compare the efficiency of the model to a
   state-of-art algorithm, the VIPS. The comparison results of the first
   experiment show that the GLM model generates more ``true positives{''}
   and less ``false negatives{''} than VIPS. The next experiment upon a
   large-scale test set produces an average precision of 90.53 \% and
   recall rate of 90.85 \%, which is approximately 25 \% better than that
   of VIPS.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of three different oxidation processes, UV/H2O2
   oxidation, ferrate(VI) oxidation, and ozonation with and without
   hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) scavenger tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) on
   the removal of organic compounds from oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW) was investigated and compared. The removal of aromatics and
   naphthenic acids (NAs) was explored by synchronous fluorescence spectra
   (SFS), ion mobility spectra (IMS), proton and carbon nuclear magnetic
   resonance (H-1 and C-13 NMR), and ultra-performance liquid
   chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC
   TOFMS). UV/H2O2 oxidation occurred through radical reaction and
   photolysis, transforming one-ring, two ring, and three-ring fluorescing
   aromatics simultaneously and achieving 42.4\% of classical NAs removal
   at 2.0 mM H2O2 and 950 mJ/cm(2) UV dose provided with medium pressure
   mercury lamp. Ferrate(VI) oxidation exhibited high selectivity,
   preferentially removing two-ring and three-ring fluorescing aromatics,
   sulfur-containing NAs (NAs + S), and NM with high carbon and high
   hydrogen deficiency. At 2.0 mM Fe(VI), 46.7\% of classical NAs was
   removed. Ozonation achieved almost complete removal of fluorescing
   aromatics, NM + S, and classical NAs (NAs with two oxygen atoms) at the
   dose of 2.0 mM O-3. Both molecular ozone reaction and center dot OH
   reaction were important pathways in transforming the organics in OSPW as
   supported by ozonation performance with and without TBA. H-1 NMR
   analyses further confirmed the removal of aromatics and NM both
   qualitatively and quantitatively. All the three oxidation processes
   reduced the acute toxicity towards Vibrio fischeri and on goldfish
   primary kidney macrophages (PKMs), with ozonation being the most
   efficient. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Granular data imputation: A framework of Granular Computing}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{307-316}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Data imputation is a common practice encountered when dealing with
   incomplete data. Irrespectively of the existing spectrum of techniques,
   the results of imputation are commonly numeric meaning that once the
   data have been imputed they are not distinguishable from the original
   data being initially available prior to imputation. In this study, the
   crux of the proposed approach is to develop a way of representing
   imputed (missing) entries as information granules and in this manner
   quantify the quality of the imputation process and the quality of the
   ensuing data. We establish a two-stage imputation mechanism in which we
   start with any method of numeric imputation and then form a granular
   representative of missing value. In this sense, the approach could be
   regarded as an enhancement of the existing imputation techniques.
   Proceeding with the detailed imputation schemes, we discuss two ways of
   imputation. In the first one, imputation is realized for individual
   variables of data sets and afterwards enhanced by the buildup of
   information granules. In the second approach, we are concerned with the
   use of fuzzy clustering, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), which helps establish a
   structure in the data and then use this information in the imputation
   process.
   The design of information granules invokes the fundamentals of Granular
   Computing, namely a principle of justifiable granularity and an
   allocation of information granularity. Numeric experiments concerned
   with a suite of publicly available data sets offer detailed insights
   into the main facets of the overall design process and deliver a
   parametric analysis of the methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   real-world problems are often imprecise. To cope with this situation,
   fuzzy DEA models were constructed for expressing relative fuzzy
   efficiencies of decision-making units (DMUs). However, fuzzy DEA is
   still limited to fuzzy input/output data while some inputs and outputs
   might be affected by various factors of uncertainty and information
   granularity, meaning that they could be better modeled in terms of fuzzy
   sets of type-2. In this paper, we develop a multi-objective DEA model in
   a setting of type-2 fuzzy modeling to evaluate and select the most
   appropriate sustainable suppliers. In the proposed model, both
   efficiency and effectiveness are considered to describe the integrated
   productivity of suppliers. In sequel, chance constrained programming,
   critical value-based reduction methods and equivalent transformations
   are considered to solve the problem. A detailed case study is employed
   to show the advantages of the proposed model in terms of measuring
   effectiveness, efficiency and productivity in an uncertain environment
   expressed at different confidence levels. At the same time, the results
   demonstrate that the model is capable of helping decision makers to
   balance economic, social, and environmental factors when selecting
   sustainable suppliers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in major
   depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most consistently replicated
   biological findings in psychiatry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   studies have consistently demonstrated that hippocampal (HC) volume is
   decreased in patients with MDD. The improved spatial resolution of high
   field strength MRI has recently enabled measurements of HC subfield
   volumes in vivo. The main goal of the present study was to examine the
   relationship between cortisol concentrations over a day and HC subfield
   volumes in patients with MDD compared to healthy controls and to
   investigate whether diurnal cortisol measures are related to memory
   performance.
   Fourteen MDD patients with moderate or severe episodes were recruited,
   together with 14 healthy controls. Imaging was performed using a 4.7 T
   whole-body imaging system. HC subfields and subregions were segmented
   manually using previously defined protocol. Memory performance was
   assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale IV. The salivary cortisol
   levels were measured over the course of one day.
   We found that cortisol awakening response to 8 h (CAR-8 h) was higher in
   MDD patients compared to controls and that this increase in CAR-8 h in
   MDD patients correlated negatively with left total Cornu Ammonis (CA)1-3
   and left HC head volume. In healthy controls mean cortisol levels were
   negatively associated with right total CA1-3, right HC head, and right
   total HC volume. In addition, in healthy controls higher CAR-8 h was
   related to worse performance on the immediate content memory. These
   results provide the first in vivo evidence of the negative associations
   between cortisol level, CA1-3 HC subfield volume and memory performance
   in patients with MDD and healthy controls. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Pages = {{269-276}},

Abstract = {{The usual method to account for a finite number of blades in blade
   element calculations of wind turbine performance is through a tip loss
   factor. Most analyses use the tip loss approximation due to Prandtl
   which is easily and cheaply calculated but is known to be inaccurate at
   low tip speed ratio. We develop three methods for the direct calculation
   of the tip loss. The first is the computationally expensive calculation
   of the velocities induced by the helicoidal wake which requires the
   evaluation of infinite sums of products of Bessel functions. The second
   uses the asymptotic evaluation of those sums by Kawada. The third uses
   the approximation due to Okulov which avoids the sums altogether. These
   methods are compared to the tip loss determined independently and
   exactly for an ideal three-bladed rotor at tip speed ratios between zero
   and 15. Kawada's asymptotic approximation and Okulov's equations are
   preferable to the Prandtl factor at all tip speed ratios, with the
   Okulov equations being generally more accurate. In particular the tip
   loss factor exceeds unity near the axis of rotation by a large amount at
   all tip speed ratios, which Prandtl's factor cannot reproduce. Neither
   the Kawada nor the Okulov equations impose a large computational burden
   on a blade element program. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time simulation of modular multilevel converters( MMCs) is
   challenging due to their complex structure consisting of a large number
   of submodules (SMs). In the literature, the computational speed is
   emphasized for MMC modeling in real-time simulation, while accurate and
   detailed information of insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules
   in SMsis sacrificed. A novel datasheet-based device-level electrothermal
   model for an MMC on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) is
   presented in this paper for real-time hardware emulation. Conduction and
   switching power losses, junction temperatures, temperature-dependent
   electrical parameters, and linearized switching transient waveforms of
   IGBT modules are adequately captured in the proposed model.
   Simultaneously the system-level behavior of the MMC is accurately
   modeled. Five-level and nine-level MMC systems are emulated in the
   hardware with the time step of 10 mu s and 10 ns for system-level and
   device-level computations, respectively. The paralleled and pipelined
   hardware design using IEEE 32-bit floating point number precision runs
   on Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX485T device. The emulated real-time results by
   an oscilloscope have been validated by offline simulation on SaberRD

Title = {{An injection and mixing element for delivery and monitoring of inhaled
   nitric oxide}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a selective pulmonary
   vasodilator used primarily in the critical care setting for patients
   concurrently supported by invasive or noninvasive positive pressure
   ventilation. NO delivery devices interface with ventilator breathing
   circuits to inject NO in proportion with the flow of air/oxygen through
   the circuit, in order to maintain a constant, target concentration of
   inhaled NO.
   Methods: In the present article, a NO injection and mixing element is
   presented. The device borrows from the design of static elements to
   promote rapid mixing of injected NO-containing gas with breathing
   circuit gases. Bench experiments are reported to demonstrate the
   improved mixing afforded by the injection and mixing element, as
   compared with conventional breathing circuit adapters, for NO injection
   into breathing circuits. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are
   also presented to illustrate mixing patterns and nitrogen dioxide
   production within the element.
   Results: Over the range of air flow rates and target NO concentrations
   investigated, mixing length, defined as the downstream distance required
   for NO concentration to reach within +/- 5 \% of the target
   concentration, was as high as 47 cm for the conventional breathing
   circuit adapters, but did not exceed 7.8 cm for the injection and mixing
   element.
   Conclusion: The injection and mixing element has potential to improve
   ease of use, compatibility and safety of inhaled NO administration with
   mechanical ventilators and gas delivery devices.}},

Abstract = {{An optical damage threshold for crystalline silicon from single
   femtosecond laser pulses was determined by detecting a permanent change
   in the refractive index of the material. This index change could be
   detected with unprecedented sensitivity by measuring the resonant
   wavelength shift of silicon integrated optics microring resonators
   irradiated with femtosecond laser pulses at 400 nm and 800 nm
   wavelengths. The threshold for permanent index change at 400 nm
   wavelength was determined to be 0.053 +/- 0.007 J/cm(2), which agrees
   with previously reported threshold values for femtosecond laser
   modification of crystalline silicon. However, the threshold for index
   change at 800 nm wavelength was found to be 0.044 +/- 0.005 J/cm(2),
   which is five times lower than the previously reported threshold values
   for visual change on the silicon surface. The discrepancy is attributed

Title = {{Nonlinear deformation and localized failure of bacterial streamers in

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the failure of bacterial floc mediated streamers in a
   microfluidic device in a creeping flow regime using both experimental
   observations and analytical modeling. The quantification of streamer
   deformation and failure behavior is possible due to the use of 200 nm
   fluorescent polystyrene beads which firmly embed in the extracellular
   polymeric substance (EPS) and act as tracers. The streamers, which form
   soon after the commencement of flow begin to deviate from an apparently
   quiescent fully formed state in spite of steady background flow and
   limited mass accretion indicating significant mechanical nonlinearity.
   This nonlinear behavior shows distinct phases of deformation with
   mutually different characteristic times and comes to an end with a
   distinct localized failure of the streamer far from the walls. We
   investigate this deformation and failure behavior for two separate
   bacterial strains and develop a simplified but nonlinear analytical
   model describing the experimentally observed instability phenomena
   assuming a necking route to instability. Our model leads to a power law
   relation between the critical strain at failure and the fluid velocity
   scale exhibiting excellent qualitative and quantitative agreeing with
   the experimental rupture behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrophobic mechanism of 3-hexyl-4-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole- 5-thione
   (HATT) to malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)(2)) was investigated by contact angle,
   micro-flotation, zeta potential, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
   spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)
   and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). After HATT modification, the
   wettability of malachite surfaces was changed from hydrophilicity to
   hydrophobicity, and its zeta potential moved to more negative values,
   demonstrating that HATT might adsorb on the positively charged copper
   species via its anionic amino-triazole-thione group with leaving its
   hexyl group against malachite surfaces. The hydrophobized malachite
   particles attached selectively to air bubbles and subsequently moved to
   the pulp surface with the bubbles. FTIR and ToF-SIMS indicated that HATT
   might chemisorb on malachite surfaces by formation of Cu-S and Cu-N
   bonds with the breakage of S-H bond in HATT thiol tautomer. XPS further
   elucidated that a five membered-ring HATT-Cu(I) surface complex was
   formed by bonding the exocyclic S and N atoms of HATT with the copper
   atom on malachite surfaces. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An energy-efficient adaptive frameless ALOHA protocol}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Random access protocols are a key feature of a family of emerging
   communication networks such as machine-to-machine, radio frequency
   identification (RFID), and sensor networks. To accommodate the needs of
   such networks with a massive number of uncoordinated devices, new random
   multiple access (MAC) protocols have been proposed that aim to improve
   the system efficiency by resolving collisions in the received signal. In
   this work, we consider one of such protocols, called frameless ALOHA,
   and propose two techniques to improve its energy efficiency without
   sacrificing the network throughput. More specifically, we propose
   mechanisms to adaptively control the access probability at the users.
   The proposed mechanisms are local and like the original frameless ALOHA,
   no coordination between the users is needed. Our simulation results
   verify the improvement achieved in the energy efficiency by the proposed
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the three-dimensional elasticity theory, the investigation of
   the free vibration response of a carbon nanotube-reinforced cylindrical
   panel resting in elastic foundation in thermal environments is
   presented. The response of the elastic medium is formulated by the

   carbon nanotube in the radial direction and the material properties are
   temperature dependent and estimated by the extended rule of mixture.
   Dynamic Young's modulus of single-walled carbon nanotubes can be
   expressed a function of loading rate and environmental temperature.
   Differential quadrature method is being utilized and natural frequencies
   of cylindrical panel are obtained. An accuracy of the present solution
   is confirmed by comparing with some available results in the article. A
   detailed numerical study is conducted to examine the effects of
   temperature rise, carbon nanotube volume fraction, elastic foundations

Abstract = {{NetZero Energy Homes (NZEHs) are designed to achieve zero energy balance
   annually (i.e., produce approximately as much energy as consume). In
   this context, the actual energy performance of NZEHs must be examined
   and assessed to verify the design assumptions. In this paper, an energy
   performance monitoring and analysis framework is proposed for NZEHs, and
   a NZEH in Edmonton, Canada is analysed as a case example, which is found
   to have an energy deficit of 669.38 kWh (4.1\% of total consumption) for
   the first monitored year. The actual energy performance is analysed with
   great detail, among which the energy consumption is analysed by category
   of occupant-driven and less-occupant-driven. Based on the categorization
   and the analysis, both polynomial and regression models are proposed for
   the energy consumption modelling. The monitored results are also
   compared with that of simulation models. Overall, the NZEH consumes
   14.4\% less than estimated, and. generates 10\% less than predicted; the
   differences and the reasons are analysed by category of space heating
   and cooling, domestic hot water (DHW) heating, heat recovery ventilator
   (HRV), base loads, and energy generation. This research proposes a
   generic framework of energy monitoring, analysis, and modelling for
   NZEHs, which provides feedback for NZEH operation, and yields
   information for the future design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{On April 25, 2015, a major earthquake of moment magnitude M-w 7.8 struck
   the Gorkha District of Nepal at 11:56 a.m. local time (6:11 a.m. UTC).
   One major aftershock of M-w 7.3 on May 12, 2015, contributed to the
   devastation of many villages in mountainous areas nearby the epicenter.
   The spatial distribution of aftershocks, which extended 150 km to the
   east of the epicenter, suggests that the rupture propagated from west to
   east, thus producing severe destruction in Kathmandu, at approximately
   80 km southeast of the epicenter. A total of 800,000 buildings were
   severely damaged or collapsed. A post-earthquake reconnaissance showed
   that damages in reinforced concrete buildings in urban areas were mostly
   due to poor construction quality, low concrete strength, non-seismic
   detailing in beam-column joints, and local site effects. Most of the
   masonry buildings in the villages nearby main shock epicenter were also
   affected. This paper presents the recorded accelerograms, acceleration
   response spectra, and the seismological aspects of the earthquake. Case
   histories of damaged buildings, the patterns, and the failure mechanisms
   are discussed in this paper. It is concluded that a majority of the
   damaged buildings were not designed or constructed properly in
   accordance with national building codes of Nepal or ACI codes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose the architecture of a content-based
   recommender system aimed at the selection of reviewers (experts) to
   evaluate research proposals or articles. We introduce a comprehensive
   algorithmic framework supported by various techniques of information
   retrieval. We propose a well-rounded methodology that explores concepts
   of data, information, knowledge, and relations between them to support a
   formation of a suitable recommendation. In particular, the developed
   system helps collecting data characterizing potential reviewers,
   retrieving information from relational and unstructured data, and
   formulating a set of recommendations. The designed system architecture
   is modular from the functional perspective and hierarchical from the
   technical point of view. Each essential part of the system is treated as
   a separate module, whereas each layer supports a certain functionality
   of the system. The modularity of the architecture facilitates its
   maintainability. The process of information retrieval includes
   classification of publications, author disambiguation, keywords
   extraction, and full-text indexing, whereas recommendations are based on
   the combination of a cosine similarity between keywords and a full-text
   index. The proposed system has been verified through a case study run at
   the National Center for Research and Development, Warsaw, Poland. (C)

Abstract = {{An embedded Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation for the simulation of
   droplet dynamics within a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) channel
   is presented. Air is modeled using an Eulerian formulation, whereas
   water is described with a Lagrangian framework. Using this framework,
   the gas-liquid interface can be accurately identified. The surface
   tension force is computed using the curvature defined by the boundary of
   the Lagrangian mesh. The method naturally accounts for material property
   changes across the interface and accurately represents the pressure
   discontinuity. A sessile drop in a horizontal surface, a sessile drop in
   an inclined plane and droplets in a PEFC channel are solved for as
   numerical examples and compared to experimental data. Numerical results
   are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Numerical results are
   also compared to results obtained with the semi-analytical model
   previously developed by the authors in order to discuss the limitations
   of the semi-analytical approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{38\% to 93\% selectivity enhancement toward sulfur-free products was
   observed upon iridium addition to a palladium-only catalyst in the
   hydrodesulfurization of a refractory sulfur compound
   4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) at the same 40\% conversion
   from a 300 ppm, S-containing feed at 5 MPa and 300 degrees C. Pd
   promoted hydrogenation to sulfurous intermediates, while Ir catalyzed
   C-S hydrogenolysis and also improved Pd resistance to sintering. The
   selectivity in the direct desulfurization path for the Ir-containing
   catalysts increased up to 26\% versus 5\% for the Pd-only catalyst. The
   bimetallic catalyst allowed for a decrease in S from 300 ppm to 11 ppm.
   It can be used at reduced pressure (3 MPa) with only a 15\% decrease in
   hydrodesulfurization conversion as compared to the operation at 5 MPa.

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at the improvement of process conditions for
   catalytic steam gasification of ash-free coal (AFC) integrated with CO2
   capture. A novel modified catalytic hydrogen production reaction
   integrated gasification (M-HyPr-RING) process was proposed for
   high-purity H-2 production from steam gasification of AFC. AFC was
   prepared from lignite coal by solvent extraction with maximum yields of
   67\% on a dry ash free basis at 400 degrees C using hydrotreated heavy
   aromatic hydrocarbons with a coal-to-solvent ratio of approximately 1:
   10.
   The gasification temperature and sorbent-to-carbon (CaO/C) ratio were
   maintained constant for all experiments at 675 degrees C and 2,
   respectively, as determined by our previous findings. The steam
   gasification experiments were conducted on AFC in a fixed-bed reactor in
   the presence of different catalyst loadings (5, 10 and 20 wt\% of
   potassium carbonate) with and without sorbent. A maximum hydrogen molar
   fraction of 85\% (dry basis with nitrogen) was observed with catalyst
   loading of 20\% and CaO/C of 2 after 5 min of steam gasification under
   mild process conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The design and optimization of a pressure/vacuum swing adsorption
   process for the separation of ethane (C2) from residue gas (2.4 mol\%
   ethane and the rest being methane) is presented. To achieve this,
   experimental measurements, modeling and optimization tools are developed
   to characterize the adsorbents, define the cycle configuration, and find
   the optimal operating conditions for the process. Adsorbents from two
   different families, namely, titano-silicate (Na-ETS-10) and activated
   carbons are chosen. Experimental high-pressure isotherms were measured
   and described using a dual-site Langmuir model. A rigorous
   one-dimensional model is developed to simulate the adsorption process.
   Two different pressure/vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) cycle
   configurations are proposed and assessed based on C2 purity and
   recovery. The effect of feed temperature is studied and is shown to have
   a high impact on the separation. Finally, a multi-objective optimization
   study is performed to identify the material that offers the best
   trade-off between the two objective functions: C2 purity; and recovery.
   Among the adsorbents examined, Na-ETS-10 is found to provide the best
   performance with a possibility of obtaining approximate to 76\% purity
   at a recovery of 68\%. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

   sulfur-inhibited hydrogenation of 3,3-dimethylbiphenyl, which is a

   particles provided unprecedented (for Pd at 5MPa and 300 degrees C)
   direct desulfurization selectivity of 20\% at 40\% conversion because of
   the reduced contribution of the hydrogenation path. The 4nm particles
   were poisoned by the adsorbed sulfur to the greatest extent. The optimal
   size, providing the highest Pd mass-based yield of the desulfurized
   products, was found to be 8nm. The catalyst with 87nm particles was
   based on Pd nanocubes with the lowest edge/terrace surface atom ratio

Abstract = {{Iterative learning control is an effective control strategy for control
   of batch processes and initial condition is one of the most important
   factors affecting convergence of iterative learning batch process
   control. In this study, a novel initial value dynamic compensation-based
   data-driven optimal terminal iterative learning control (IDC-DDOTILC)
   approach is proposed for non-linear systems under random initial
   conditions. The unknown influence on the terminal output caused by the
   initial states is deduced by using a dynamical linearisation of the
   controlled non-linear system along the iteration direction, and then the
   unknown influence is estimated iteratively and incorporated into the
   learning control law. As a result, the proposed IDC-DDOTILC can drive
   the terminal output of the plant to attain the target value at the
   endpoint asymptotically under iteration-varying initial conditions. Two
   chemical engineering examples including a batch reactor and a fed-batch
   ethanol fermentation process are used to demonstrate effectiveness of
   the proposed control algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We prepared a CO2 responsive emulsion by using switchable hydrophobic
   tertiary amine, N,Ndimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA). DMCHA exhibits
   little miscibility with water in the absence of CO2, but shows a
   complete miscibility with water in the presence of CO2. DMCHA converts
   to watersoluble bicarbonate salts upon treatment with CO2, which could
   induce the ionic strength increase of aqueous phase. Together with
   paraffin oil, DMCHA was used to prepare CO2 responsive 0/W emulsions
   with a conventional surfactant, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS),
   as the emulsifier. Emulsions containing DMCHA in paraffin oil were more
   stable than those without DMCHA, as a result of electrostatic

Title = {{Deformation behavior of metallic glasses with shear band like atomic
   structure: a molecular dynamics study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the plastic
   deformation within the shear bands in three different metallic glasses
   (MGs). To mimic shear bands, MG specimens were first deformed until flow
   localization occurs, and then the volume of the material within the
   localized regions was extracted and replicated. Homogeneous deformation
   that is independent of the size of the specimen was observed in
   specimens with shear band like structure, even at a temperature that is
   far below the glass transition temperature. Structural relaxation and
   rapid cooling were employed to examine the effect of free volume content
   on the deformation behavior. This was followed by detailed atomic
   structure analyses, employing the concepts of Voronoi polyhedra and
   ``liquid-like{''} regions that contain high fraction of sub-atomic size
   open volumes. Results suggest that the total fraction of atoms in
   liquid-like regions is a key parameter that controls the plastic
   deformation in MGs. These are discussed in the context of reported
   experimental results and possible strategies for synthesizing monolithic
   amorphous materials that can accommodate large tensile plasticity are
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive speeding is a global problem experienced on roads all around
   the world. The impacts of this behaviour on the safety of all road users
   have led many jurisdictions to adopt more significant sanctions when

   more significant sanctions against excessive speeders in Canada while
   also considering issues which should be explored when adopting such a
   policy. The paper uses ARIMA intervention analysis to assess changes in
   fatal collision data since the adoption of stronger penalties. The
   changes were assessed for statistical significance, and the magnitude of
   the change was quantified. In general, the findings show that the
   legislative changes allowing for stronger penalties were associated with
   significant drops in province-wide fatal collisions. Reductions in the
   mean level of monthly collisions ranged from 5\% to 22\% at the three
   provinces. Moreover, the paper highlights four major areas, which must
   be considered for jurisdictions attempting the adoption of such a

Abstract = {{One of the challenges in the numerical modelling of chemically reacting
   multi-phase flows, e.g. including solid particles and a gas phase, is
   the complexity of transport processes occurring on the particle surface.
   This complexity is the result of coupling between the gas flow in the
   void spaces, which is three-dimensional a priori, and heterogeneous
   reactions on the particle surface. This complexity and
   three-dimensionality of the flow requires the use of computationally
   expensive numerical grids to resolve the particle surface and the void
   space between particles. Thus, as of yet it is not feasible to simulate
   the heat and mass transfer in different fixed-bed reactors (with as many
   as hundreds of thousands of particles) resolving all particles. At the
   same time, the accuracy of existing 1-D models depends on the empirical
   closure relations describing the heat and mass transfer between
   particles and the fluid flow. In this view, one way to solve this
   problem applied to a structured packed bed is to approximate the
   particulate beds using 2-D geometry, which will still allow us to
   calculate the heat and mass transfer directly without using any
   empirical relations. Thus, the main subject of this work is the
   development and validation of an axisymmetric representative element
   approximating the heat and species transport, and gas flow in a 3-D
   structured fixed bed with different porosities. Comparative analysis of
   3-D and 2-D simulations shows acceptable agreement. Finally, we explore
   the influence of the void fraction on the gas-phase temperature
   behaviour between particles.}},

Title = {{Development and application of a quantitative risk assessment to a very

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of quantitative risk assessments for landslide management
   have been discussed and illustrated in several publications. However,
   there still are some challenges in its application for low-probability,
   high-magnitude events. These challenges are associated with the
   difficulties in populating our models for risk calculations, which
   largely require the input of expert opinion. This paper presents a
   quantitative risk assessment to a very slow moving rock slope within a
   dam reservoir in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The
   assessment is focused on the risk to the population in the vicinity of
   the dam and the populated areas downstream. Expert opinions quantified
   the slope failure probabilities in the order of 10(-3) to 10(-1) per
   year for the smallest failure scenario considered and less than 10(-6)
   for a failure of the entire slope. However, these estimations are
   associated with high levels of uncertainty. Our approach starts with the
   calculation and assessment of the magnitude and probability of the
   potential slope failure consequences, minimizing the uncertainties
   associated with estimated slope failure probabilities. Then, these
   consequences and failure probabilities are combined to obtain a measure
   of risk. The uncertainty associated with the slope failure probabilities
   is managed by the estimation of plausible ranges for these. The
   calculated risk levels are then presented as ranges of values and
   assessed against adopted evaluation criteria. The consequence and risk
   assessment of the rock slope suggest that the risk to the population
   exposed in the vicinity of the dam and populated areas downstream is
   under adequate control. The probability of large consequence scenarios
   is extremely low, in the order of 10(-7) chance of an event causing more
   than 100 fatalities. We propose an observational technique to assess
   changes in risk levels and decide when to update the risk management
   approach or deploy emergency measures. The technique is focused on the
   detection of changes in the slope deformation patterns that would
   indicate an increase in the potential failure volumes or an imminent
   failure. It can be considered an extension to the current early warning
   system in place, easy to implement and enhanced with the strength of the
   comprehensive analysis required for a quantitative risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Geostatistical simulation is performed for reservoir characterization to
   depict local variability in the modeled properties. The conventional
   simulation methods are implemented in a grid-dependent manner that makes
   regridding of realizations, refinement of existing grids, and the
   simulation on irregular grids challenging. The grid-free-simulation
   (GFS) method has been recently developed for flexible reservoir
   characterization. The geostatistical realizations of a reservoir are
   expressed as an analytical function of the coordinates of the simulation
   locations and, thus, are infinitely resolvable. The resulting model is
   conditioned to primary scattered point-scale hard data and secondary
   exhaustively sampled block-scale soft data. The former data are sampled
   along wells, whereas the latter data are from seismic surveys. The GFS
   methodology is applied to the Firebag oil-sands thermal project operated
   in northern Alberta, Canada. The conditioning data are point-scale core
   measurements, log observations, and block-scale acoustic impedance (AI).
   The models of correlated porosity, permeability, and water saturation
   attributes are constructed on three different grids by facies and are
   consistent with each other. These models are intended for resource
   estimation, reserves estimation, and subsequent-flow simulation,
   respectively. The modeling results of the grid-independent simulation
   method are promising for industrial application to petroleum reservoir
   characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Estimation of effective fracture-network permeability (EFNP) is an
   essential part of modeling transport processes in naturally fractured
   reservoirs. A practical way of doing this is to use correlations that
   consider the statistical and physical characteristics of the networks.
   Thus, selection of the proper parameters to be characterized and/or
   measured that are highly correlative to the network permeability is
   critical. In this study, we analyzed fractal-based correlations
   previously developed by Jafari and Babadagli (2011a, 2011b) to clarify
   the physical relationship among network properties and the correlation
   parameters. It was shown that the connectivity index is a more-powerful
   parameter to rely on in permeability estimation, especially at
   percolation ranges far from the threshold.
   Also, it was of high interest to inspect the effect of physical
   parameters of a fracture network on different fractal dimensions as well
   as their positive/negative correlation with permeability to make a
   distinction between the mathematical and physical contributions of
   variables. We explained the earlier observation of Jafari and Babadagli
   (2009) regarding the method to determine fractal dimensions and their
   observed differences, which were found to be related to the
   computational scheme. That is why the box-counting fractal dimension
   gives the highest correlation compared with other fractal dimensions,
   especially the sandbox fractal dimension. The conditions of a strong
   correlation among different fractal dimensions and the scale-dependency
   of correlations in natural and synthetic patterns were also addressed.}},

Title = {{Numerical Investigation of Coupling Multiphase Flow and Geomechanical
   Effects on Water Loss During Hydraulic-Fracturing Flowback Operation}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Less than half the fracturing fluid is typically recovered during the
   flowback operation. This study models the effects of capillarity and
   geomechanics on water loss in the fracture/matrix system, and
   investigates the circumstances under which this phenomenon might be
   beneficial or detrimental to subsequent tight-oil production. During the
   shut-in (soaking) and flowback periods, the fracture conductivity
   decreases as effective stress increases because of imbibition. Previous
   works have addressed fracture closure during the production phase;
   however, the coupling of imbibition caused by multiphase flow and
   stress-dependent fracture properties during shut-in is less understood.
   A series of mechanistic simulation models is constructed to simulate
   multiphase flow and fluid distribution during shut-in and flowback.
   Three systems-matrix, hydraulic fracture, and microfractures-are
   explicitly represented in the computational domain. Sensitivities to
   wettability and multiphase-flow functions (relative permeability and
   capillary pressure relationships) are investigated. As wettability to
   water increases, matrix imbibition increases. Imbibition helps to
   displace the hydrocarbons into nearby microfractures and hydraulic
   fractures, enhancing initial oil rate, but it also hinders water
   recovery. The results indicate that fracture closure may enhance
   imbibition and water loss, which, in turn, leads to further reduction in
   fracture pressure and conductivity. Results also suggest that
   more-aggressive flowback is beneficial to water cleanup and long-term
   oil production in stiff rocks, whereas this benefit is less prominent in
   medium-to-soft formations because of excessive fracture closure. Because
   no direct correlation between high initial oil-flow rate and improved
   cumulative oil production is observed, measures for increasing oil
   relative permeability are recommended for improving long-term oil
   production.
   This work presents a quantitative study of the controlling factors of
   water loss caused by fluid/rock properties and geomechanics. The results
   highlight the crucial interplay between imbibition and geomechanics in
   short-and long-term production performances. The results in this study
   would have considerable impact on understanding and improving current
   industry practice in fracturing design and assessment of stimulated
   reservoir volume.}},

   that supports building simulation solutions based on discrete event and
   continuous simulation. Key features that make Simphony unique are
   highlighted, with a focus on the ability of the environment to build
   special purpose simulation tools, an extensible API, an integrated
   calendar that facilitates building complex models sensitive to `date and
   real time' information, data connectivity, and others. A practical
   special purpose simulator developed using Simphony used in a real life

Abstract = {{The current production of wood composites relies mostly on
   formaldehyde-based adhesives such as urea formaldehyde (UF) and phenol
   formaldehyde (PF) resins. As these resins are produced from
   non-renewable resources, and there are some ongoing issues with possible
   health hazard due to formaldehyde emission from such products, the
   purpose of this research was to develop a formaldehyde-free plywood
   adhesive utilizing waste protein as a renewable feedstock. The feedstock
   for this work was specified risk material (SRM), which is currently
   being disposed of either by incineration or by landfilling. In this
   report, we describe a technology for utilization of SRM for the
   development of an environmentally friendly plywood adhesive. SRM was
   thermally hydrolyzed using a Canadian government-approved protocol, and
   the peptides were recovered from the hydrolyzate. The recovered peptides
   were chemically crosslinked with polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE)
   resin to develop an adhesive system for bonding of plywood specimens.
   The effects of crosslinking time, peptides/crosslinking agent ratio, and
   temperature of hot pressing of plywood specimens on the strength of
   formulated adhesives were investigated. Formulations containing as much
   as 78\% (wt/wt) peptides met the ASTM (American Society for Testing and
   Materials) specifications of minimum dry and soaked shear strength
   requirement for UF resin type adhesives. Under the optimum conditions
   tested, the peptides-PAE resin-based formulations resulted in plywood
   specimens having comparable dry as well as soaked shear strength to that
   of commercial PF resin.}},

Abstract = {{An (n, k) erasure code that can recover any coded symbol by at most r
   other coded symbols is called a locally repairable code (LRC) with
   locality r. LRCs have been recently implemented in distributed storage
   systems. Coding complexity reduction can be significantly decreased by
   using binary LRCs (BLRCs) as they eliminate costly multiplication
   calculation. In this paper, motivated by the recently erasure codes with
   d = 4 used in practice, we propose BLRCs when (r + 1) vertical bar n and
   d = 4. We prove that our proposed binary codes are optimal for r is an
   element of \{1, 3\}, meaning that neither their locality nor their
   minimum distance can be improved by non-binary codes. For r >= 4, our
   proposed binary codes offer near-optimal code rate, with a rate gap of
   O(log r/n) compared with optimal non-binary codes. While keeping the
   bulk of code structure binary, we eliminate this rate gap by using
   fields with sizes as small as r + 2 for only two redundant symbols.
   These non-binary codes still eliminate the need for costly
   multiplications in many operations including a single failure repair (a
   dominant repair scenario). Using the construction of spanning BLRC with
   d = 4 as a backbone, we also construct LRCs with minimum distance d >=
   6. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form equation for the mean-time to
   data-loss of arbitrary erasure codes.}},

   this paper. The effect of the pulse shape, bandwidth, integration angle,
   and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received pulse on the image

   preprocessing of the received pulses with envelope detection or match
   filtering are also studied. The range and cross-range resolutions
   achieved by Gaussian and chirp pulses with the same center frequency and

   Gaussian pulse with envelope detection provides better image resolution,
   whereas the chirp pulse with match filtering provides more resistance to
   noise. Closed-form equations and design guidelines are developed to
   design the input pulse characteristics to achieve the desired image

Title = {{Stability and mobility of foam generated by gas-solvent/surfactant
   mixtures under reservoir conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{366-375}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Surfactant-alternating-gas injection, where foam generation can be
   expected, is a feasible approach for improving the sweep efficiency of
   solvent flooding by increasing the apparent viscosity of gas solvent.
   The foam stability plays an important role in this process. In this
   study, the foam stability and mobility of
   solvent/surfactant/pseudo-heavy-oil system under reservoir condition has
   been examined experimentally. The following factors are considered in
   the static foam stability experiments: surfactant concentration,
   salinity, temperature, the presence of pure n-C16H34 as pseudo-heavy
   oil, and two types of gases (CO2 and C3H8). During the static
   experiments, foam is generated by sparging C3H8 or CO2 at a constant
   flow rate through the surfactant Triton X-100 solution, and then
   stirring the mixture with a magnetic stirrer. The foam stability is
   subsequently evaluated in terms of its height change as a function of
   time. It is found that the increasing surfactant concentration
   contributes to an increase in foam stability; foam stability is
   insensitive to surfactant concentration when the surfactant
   concentration is above the threshold CMC. As for the C3H8 foam, an
   elevated temperature is detrimental to foam stability. At a higher
   temperature, the effective critical micelle concentration (CMC) of
   surfactant also increases. In general, the stability of C3H8 foam is
   negatively affected by an increasing salinity. As n-C16H34 is added to
   the solution, foam stability deteriorates. In order to study the effect
   of solvent type on foam stability, CO2 is used to replace C3H8 for
   generating foam, with the consideration of different salinity and
   temperature conditions. In comparison, CO2 foam only exhibits several
   minutes of half-life at any conditions, which is much shorter than the
   C3H8 foam. Additional flow experiments are also conducted by alternately
   injecting C3H8 and Triton X-100 solution into a glass beadpack. The
   pressure difference during the experiments is recorded so as to obtain
   the mobility of the dynamic flow in the porous media. It is found that
   alternating C3H8 and Triton X-100 solution results in a larger pressure
   difference, hence leading to more mobility reduction than alternating
   C3H8 and water through the porous media. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The influences of spatial geometric shape and position of a fracture on
   gas seepage were analyzed to explore the law of gas flow in the fracture

   reconstruction model with a single artificial fracture with different
   shapes and angles was established by translating the artificial fracture
   plane using three-dimensional reconstruction technology. Finally, the
   internal gas seepage law was analyzed together with the finite element
   method. The simulation on the same spatial shape of the fracture
   structure demonstrated that the seepage velocity at the coal section did
   not show evident variation law with the angle. Based on further
   extraction of the penetration velocity on the artificial fracture
   section, the penetration velocity increased with the expansion of the
   fracture angle under the same fracture shape. The penetration velocity
   on different shapes of the fracture surface increased with the fracture
   edges (from square to circular) under the same angle. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{A techno-economic study of shipping LNG to the Asia-Pacific from Western
   Canada by LNG carrier}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{979-992}},

Abstract = {{There is a high demand for natural gas in the Asia-Pacific region. Most
   of this gas is exported from the Middle East, Australia, Indonesia, and
   Malaysia. There is interest in the Asia-Pacific to diversify its import
   portfolio. From a Canadian perspective, there are abundant resources of
   natural gas in Western Canada, and countries in the Asia-Pacific are
   potential customers. This paper develops the cost of shipping a unit of
   natural gas (in liquefied form) from proposed liquefaction facilities in
   Western Canada to liquefied natural gas (LNG) re-gasification terminals
   in Asia-Pacific countries (Japan, China, and India). Fundamental
   engineering principles-based models were developed to estimate costs. A
   comparative analysis of delivery costs to Japan, China, and India is
   presented. To account for various propulsion systems available for LNG
   carriers, five scenarios were developed. Calm water resistance for the
   two different categories of LNG carriers was estimated. These estimates
   were used to determine the required propulsion power needed for an LNG
   carrier at a given speed and to select the appropriate main engine. The
   results of this study show that shipping costs to Japan range from 51-95
   U.S. cents/GJ depending on the type of propulsion system selected and
   for an average transport distance of 7793 km. The shipping costs to
   China and India range from 59-113 U.S. cents/GJ and 98-197 U.S. cents/GJ
   for an average transport distance of 9475 km and 17,035 km,
   respectively. The results show that a propulsion system burning only
   natural gas as primary fuel is the most economical scenario, while a
   propulsion system based on pure marine diesel oil is the least
   economical. In addition to a sensitivity analysis, a risk analysis was
   conducted to identify the range of shipping costs in each scenario with
   their occurrence probability measure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Spin echo transverse relaxation and atrophy in multiple sclerosis deep

Abstract = {{Background: Deep gray matter (DGM) is affected in relapsing-remitting
   multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and may be studied using short-term
   longitudinal MRI.
   Objective: To investigate two-year changes in spin-echo transverse
   relaxation rate (R-2) and atrophy in DGM, and its relationship with
   disease severity in RRMS patients.
   Methods: Twenty six RRMS patients and 26 matched controls were imaged at
   4.7 T. Multiecho spin-echo R-2 maps and atrophy measurements were
   obtained in DGM at baseline and two-year follow-up. Differences between
   MRI measures and correlations to disease severity were examined.
   Results: After two years, mean R-2 values in the globus pallidus and
   pulvinar increased by similar to 4\% (p<0.001) in patients and <1.7\% in
   controls. Two-year changes in R-2 showed significant correlation to
   disease severity in the globus pallidus, pulvinar, substantia nigra, and
   thalamus. Multiple regression of the two-year R-2 difference using these
   four DGM structures as variables, yielded high correlation with disease
   severity (r=0.83, p<0.001). Two-year changes in volume and R-2 showed
   significant correlation only for the globus pallidus in multiple
   sclerosis (MS) (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Two-year difference R-2 measurements in DGM correlate to
   disease severity in MS. R-2 mapping and atrophy measurements over two
   years can be used to identify changes in DGM in MS.}},

Title = {{Illness versus substance use effects on the frontal white matter in
   early phase schizophrenia: A 4 Tesla H-1-MRS study}},
Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{175}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{4-11}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Young adults with early phase schizophrenia often report a
   past or current pattern of illicit substance use and/or alcohol misuse.
   Still, little is known about the cumulative and separate effects of each
   stressor on white matter tissue, at this vulnerable period of brain
   development.
   Methods: Participants involved 24 healthy controls with a past or
   current history of sustained illicit drug use and/or alcohol misuse
   (users), 23 healthy controls without such history (normative data), and
   27 users with early phase schizophrenia. H-1-MRS data were acquired from
   a large frontal volume encompassing 95\% of white matter, using a 4
   Tesla scanner (LASER sequence, TR/TE 3200/46 ms).
   Results: Reduced levels of choline-containing compounds (Cho) were
   specific to the effect of illness (Cohen's d = 0.68), with 22\% of the
   variance in Cho levels accounted for by duration of illness. Reduced
   levels of myoInositol (d = 1.10) and creatine plus phosphocreatine (d =
   1.07) were specific to the effects of illness plus substance use. Effect
   of substance use on its own was revealed by reductions in levels of
   glutamate plus glutamine (d = 0.83) in control users relative to
   normative data.
   Conclusions: The specific effect of illness on white matter might
   indicate a decreased synthesis of membrane phospholipids or
   alternatively, reduced membrane cellular density. In terms of
   limitations, this study did not include patients without a lifetime
   history of substance use (non-users), and the specific effect of each
   substance used could not be studied separately. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In the problem of a half-plane containing a nearby nanosized hole, it is
   customary to assume that the edge of the half-plane is traction free. In
   the context of nanomechanics, however, the more realistic scenario is to
   incorporate surface effects not only on the edge of the hole but also on
   the edge of the half-plane. Our results indicate that the incorporation
   of surface effects on the edge of the half-plane indeed plays a
   significant role, in particular as the distance between the hole and the
   half-plane decreases. In fact, we show that the absence of the
   corresponding surface effect on the edge of the half-plane induces a
   significant error in the stress concentration around an arbitrary-shaped
   hole when the distance between the hole and the edge reaches a critical
   value. We illustrate our results with a variety of examples including
   circular, elliptical, triangular and square-shaped holes.}},

Abstract = {{Propane and mixtures including propane as a principal component are
   among the leading potential candidates for co-injection along with steam
   for improving the process and environmental efficiency of oil sands
   bitumen production processes. Phase diagrams and thermophysical property
   data enable technologies for the development and optimization of such
   processes. In this work, phase behavior, phase composition, and phase
   densities of propane + Peace River bitumen mixtures are reported in the
   temperature range 303 to 393 K at pressures ranging from 1 to 6 MPa. The
   phase behavior of this pseudobinary mixture can be categorized as Type
   III according to the van Konynenburg-Scott nomenclature. Pressure
   temperature at fixed composition, and pressure composition at fixed
   temperature phase diagrams, and pressure temperature phase projections
   are presented, along with saturated compositions and densities of the
   coexisting bitumen-saturated propane liquid (L-1) and propane saturated
   bitumen liquid (L-2) phases. Saturated L-1 and L-2 phases are both
   significantly less dense than liquid water phases at the same
   temperatures and pressures, and the volumes of mixing, particularly for
   the L-1 phase, are large and negative. This data set provides a
   benchmark for process development and process design calculations for
   ongoing bitumen production and deasphalting applications.}},

Abstract = {{Non-equilibrium microstructure of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) in the
   as-welded modified 9Cr-1Mo-V-Nb pipe steel (P91) weldment deposited by
   gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) and flux core arc welding (FCAW) has
   been characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope
   (FESEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The heterogeneous
   structures in the sub-layers of the as-welded HAZ are attributable to
   phase transformations caused by the welding thermal cycles and the local
   structure variations in the as-received base metal. Coarse-grained
   heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) has a prior austenite grain (PAG) size of 20
   mu m. Fine uniformly-distributed precipitates and a higher fraction of
   MX carbonitrides are observed in the CGHAZ. Fine-grained heat-affected
   zone (FGHAZ) consists of the finest grains (1.22 mu m measured by EBSD,
   5 mu m PAG size), coarse undissolved M23C6 carbides within the PAG
   boundaries and fine nucleated M23C6 particles within the martensite
   laths. Inter critical heat-affected zone (ICHAZ) consists of partially
   austenitized grains and over-tempered martensite laths. EBSD kernel
   average misorientation (KAM) map in the FGHAZ close to the ICHAZ
   illustrates the greatest local strain variations with a moderate
   normalized KAM value of 0.92 degrees. The majority (88.1\%) of the
   matrix grains in the CGHAZ are classified as deformed grains by EBSD
   grain average misorientation (GAM) evaluation. The FGHAZ close to the
   ICHAZ has the most recrystallized grains with an area fraction of
   14.4\%. The highest density variation of precipitates within grains in
   the FGHAZ originates from the inhomogeneous chemistry in the base metal.

Abstract = {{We investigate the anti-plane shear problem of a curvilinear crack lying
   along the interface of an arbitrarily shaped elastic inhomogeneity
   embedded in an infinite matrix subjected to uniform stresses at
   infinity. Complex variable and conformal mapping techniques are used to
   derive an analytical solution in series form. The problem is first
   reduced to a non-homogeneous Riemann-Hilbert problem, the solution of
   which can be obtained by evaluating the associated Cauchy integral. A
   set of linear algebraic equations is obtained from the compatibility
   condition imposed on the resulting analytic function defined in the
   inhomogeneity and its Faber series expansion. Each of the unknown
   coefficients in the corresponding analytic functions can then be
   uniquely determined by solving the linear algebraic equations, which are
   written concisely in matrix form. The resulting analytical solution is
   then used to quantify the displacement jump across the debonded section
   of the interface as well as the traction distribution along the bonded
   section of the interface. In addition, our solution allows us to obtain
   mode-III stress intensity factors at the two crack tips. The solution to
   the anti-plane problem of a partially debonded elliptical inhomogeneity
   containing a confocal crack is also derived using a similar method.}},

   reducing the catalyst poisoning as it relates to carbonylation of
   dimethyl ether to methyl acetate. Zinc maintains 90\%+ selectivity even
   during deactivation versus 60\% for the Cu-mordenite, which leads to
   6-fold higher product yield. The concept of Zn addition is recommended

Abstract = {{Cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, represents a resource
   for sustainable production of biofuels. Thermochemical treatments make
   lignocellulosic biomaterials more amenable to depolymerization by
   exposing cellulose microfibrils to enzymatic or chemical attacks. In
   such treatments, the solvent plays fundamental roles in biomass
   modification, but the molecular events underlying these changes are
   still poorly understood. Here, the 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of
   solvation has been employed to analyze the role of water in cellulose
   aggregation under different thermodynamic conditions. The results show
   that, under ambient conditions, highly structured hydration shells
   around cellulose create repulsive forces that protect cellulose
   microfibrils from aggregating. Under hydrothermal pretreatment
   conditions, however, the hydration shells lose structure, and cellulose
   aggregation is favored. These effects are largely due to a decrease in
   cellulose water interactions relative to those at ambient conditions, so
   that cellulose cellulose attractive interactions become prevalent. Our
   results provide an explanation to the observed increase in the lateral
   size of cellulose crystallites when biomass is subject to pretreatments
   and deepen the current understanding of the mechanisms of biomass
   modification.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, an adaptive filtering technique is proposed to estimate
   and characterize pathological tremors caused by Parkinson's Disease (PD)
   and Essential Tremor (ET). The technique is based on the formulation of
   band-limited multiple Fourier Linear Combiners (BMFLC) and is called
   Enhanced-BMFLC (E-BMFLC). The effectiveness of the designed filter is
   statistically evaluated through a clinical study involving 14 PD and 13
   ET patients. The hand tremors of the participants are studied in three
   Degrees Of Freedom (DOF). Using statistical analysis, it is shown that
   the new design of the filter significantly enhances the accuracy in
   comparison with the performance of conventional BMFLC filtering. In
   addition, E-BMFLC significantly reduces the sensitivity to parameter
   tuning and intrapatient variabilities. The observed improvements are
   achieved by modulating the memory of the proposed filter, and by
   enriching the utilized harmonic model. The proposed filter is then used
   to develop a safe haptics-enabled robotic rehabilitation architecture,
   designed for patients having hand tremors. The architecture is entitled
   Augmented Haptic Rehabilitation (AHR), which enables adaptive management
   of the involuntary components of the hand motion while delivering
   assist-as-needed haptic therapy (for the voluntary component) and
   avoiding unsafe amplification of hand tremors. Experimental evaluations
   are provided to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed AHR system.}},

Title = {{A Gaussian Mixture Framework for Co-Operative Rehabilitation Therapy in
   Assistive Impedance-Based Tasks}},

Abstract = {{Rehabilitation robots can aid patients to practice activities of daily
   living in order to enhance muscle strength and recover motor functions.
   In this paper, we focus on robot-assisted rehabilitation for
   co-operative therapy tasks that elicit impedance-based behaviors from
   the patient. For instance, if the rehabilitation robot is controlled to
   behave as a self-closing door and if pulling this simulated door open is
   the therapy task the patient needs to complete, the patient's hand
   should display a minimum required impedance to complete the task. When a
   patient is unable to complete the task, determining the minimum
   assistance to be provided to the patient by the rehabilitation robot
   such that the task can be accomplished is of interest. In this paper, we
   compare the impedance behavior of a therapist in multiple trials of the
   task with that of the patient using a learning from demonstration (LfD)
   technique that utilizes Gaussian mixture models. First and during the
   demonstration phase, the therapist performs the tasks individually so
   that the robot gains insight into how a healthy person would perform the
   task. Next and during the reproduction phase, the robot will co-operate
   with the patient in the therapist's absence and provide him/her with
   adaptive external assistance on a patient-specific and as-needed basis
   so that the task can be completed. To encourage active participation,
   provision of assistance to the patient is coupled to the variability
   observed in the therapist's behavior across various trials of the task.
   Therefore, the presented framework transfers the constraints and
   underlying characteristics of a given impedance-based task to the
   rehabilitation robot leading to co-operative interaction between the
   robot and the patient where the robot provides just-enough assistance.
   Experimental results involving 1-D and 2-D impedance-based tasks show
   that the proposed framework effectively provides the patient with
   assistance as needed during co-operative therapy.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the downlink of a clustered coordinated multicell
   multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is considered,
   and various low-complexity user scheduling algorithms to maximize the
   sum rate are proposed. The users' data signals are transmitted
   cooperatively via the base stations (BSs) of a cluster within the
   sectorized multicell heterogeneous cellular network. Exhaustive search
   as the optimal scheduling method is extremely complex, particularly for
   large numbers of users requesting service. We therefore propose
   suboptimal scheduling algorithms based on the lower complexity
   metaheuristic stochastic optimization techniques of simulated annealing
   (SA) and particle swarm (PS). Moreover, a hybrid algorithm combining the
   traits of PS and a greedy scheduler is also proposed. The performance
   and complexity of these algorithms are evaluated for a heterogeneous
   system model employing different precoding methods. Assessing the
   algorithms' performance via computer simulations, the effectiveness of
   the proposed schemes in terms of sum rate is demonstrated, yielding
   performance very close to that of the exhaustive search at much lower
   complexity. For each precoding method used in the employed system model,
   the best corresponding approach to scheduling from our proposed
   algorithms is determined.}},

   Two symmetric MEMS capacitive switches across a slot on a single layer

Abstract = {{Power amplifiers are essential components in communication systems and
   are inherently non-linear. The non-linearity creates spectral growth
   (broadening) beyond the signal bandwidth, which interferes with adjacent
   channels. It also causes distortions within the signal bandwidth, which
   decreases the bit error rate at the receiver. This study reports an
   adaptive digital predistorter with fast convergence rate and low
   complexity and cost to alleviate these problems. In this design, a
   lookup table-based adaptive digital predistortion (DPD) technique using
   a five-port receiver instead of traditional heterodyne and homodyne
   architectures is proposed to realise the linearisation loop for this
   amplifier. The five-port receiver is implemented by use of passive
   microwave circuits and detector diodes. This approach highly reduces the
   cost and complexity of the linearisation system. Simulation and
   measurement results obtained are presented for a laterally diffused
   metal-oxide-semiconductor-based high-power amplifier biased in class AB
   operation with wideband code-division multiple access input signal to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel DPD design. Moreover, these
   results are compared with DPD technique using homodyne receiver in
   feedback path.}},

Title = {{Effect of pH on the flocculation behaviors of kaolin using a
   pH-sensitive copolymer}},
Journal = {{WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{729-737}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{pH-sensitive copolymers have been widely introduced to achieve rapid
   dewatering and consolidation of solids in mining and oil sands
   processing wastes. But no more attention has been given to the
   flocculation efficiency of solid suspensions as a function of pH using
   pH-sensitive copolymer. In this study, a pH-sensitive copolymer was
   synthesized and employed to investigate the flocculation behaviors of
   kaolin by focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM). A titration test
   was introduced to characterize the copolymer conformation transition.
   The results demonstrated that at pH ranging from 3 to 6, with the pH
   increase, the zeta potential magnitude of kaolin particles increased,
   resulting in the repulsive forces between particles increasing. However,
   the hydrophobicity of kaolin increased as the pH increased. Thus, the
   hydrophobic forces could neutralize a part of the repulsive forces
   between particles and result in good and similar flocculation
   performances. At the pH greater than 6, the zeta potential magnitude of
   kaolin particles and copolymer molecules increased significantly, and
   the repulsive force between kaolin particles increased after copolymer
   addition due to the kaolin particles being more negatively charged,
   which resulted in poor flocculation efficiency and cloudy supernatant.
   It was concluded that the pH-sensitive copolymer could achieve both
   perfect flocculation efficiency and low moisture of filter cake at the
   isoelectric point of copolymer.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{291-301}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and tandem mass spectrometry
   (MS/MS) were used to study the interaction between Fe2+ and the
   heptapeptide (SVNVPLY) from barley protein hydrolysate under
   physiological pH. The peptide showed an ability to form complexes with
   Fe2+ spontaneously, with a binding constant reaching 10(7) L mol(-1).
   Two peptide binding sites were identified and amino acid residues like
   Leu, Val, Pro and Tyr have been recognized as critical for iron
   coordination. The capacity for the heptapeptide and its shorter
   tripeptide analogue (VPL) to improve iron absorption was studied in
   vitro using Caco-2 cells. The cell uptake increased 4 times for the
   Fe2+-SVNVPLY complex after pepsin-pancreatin digestion compared to the
   iron sulfate salt. The ferritin formation in the Caco-2 cells was also
   significantly enhanced when iron was chelated to the peptides. This
   research suggests a potential application of barley peptides as dietary
   supplements to improve iron absorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Experimental and numerical studies were performed to investigate the

   the intake along its centerline. With the assumption of an axisymmetric
   flow condition, radial velocity is found to be the same within a conical
   zone, but varies with the axial angle outside this zone in spherical
   polar coordinates. It was found that the flow viscosity and yield stress
   do not change the location of the virtual sink but they reduce the
   horizontal velocity of the Laponite suspension. The extent of the
   sheared flow region was also studied and the deformation radius was
   found to be proportional to the 1/3 power of the pumping rate.}},

Title = {{Introduction to Techniques for Resolving Project Performance
   Contradictions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Improving project performance has always been emphasized in construction
   projects. When project objectives contradict, the project manager must
   apply mitigating or conflict resolution strategies to remove or minimize
   the level of contradiction in order to enhance project performance. A
   typical example is conflict between cost and schedule, where cost tends
   to increase when the schedule is crashed (sped up). Although some of the
   current project control systems attempt to diagnose the root cause of
   performance deviations and suggest corrective action, none is designed
   to resolve conflicts in a systematic and innovative manner to improve
   the project performance. The purpose of this paper is to present a
   systematic and structured approach to guide project managers to propose
   corrective action plans that lead to minimal conflict and ultimately to
   better project performance. Resolving contradictions can generate
   effective corrective action plans that would enhance project
   performance. Conflicts among competing project performance indices such
   as cost, schedule, safety, and quality are obvious in any project. This
   innovative approach uses the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ)
   to develop a framework for a conflict resolution strategy called
   techniques for resolving project performance contradictions (TRAC), or
   the techniques for resolving performance contradictions. TRAC provides
   an algorithmic approach for solving performance contradictions in order
   to optimize the overall project performance. TRAC is a user-oriented
   methodology and presents a new model for performance problem solving to
   assist project managers in their corrective action exercise. TRAC
   methodology is demonstrated in two case studies that indicate the
   workability of this model and its usefulness in resolving performance
   contradictions in contraction projects.}},

Abstract = {{We recently published a protocol to vitrify human articular cartilage
   and a method of cryoprotectant removal in preparation for
   transplantation. The current study's goal was to perform a
   cryoprotectant kinetic analysis and theoretically shorten the procedure
   used to vitrify human articular cartilage. First, the loading of the
   cryoprotectants was modeled using Fick's law of diffusion, and this
   information was used to predict the kinetics of cryoprotectant efflux
   after the cartilage sample had been warmed. We hypothesized that
   diffusion coefficients obtained from the permeation of individual
   cryoprotectants into porcine articular cartilage could be used to
   provide a reasonable prediction of the cryoprotectant loading and of the
   combined cryoprotectant efflux from vitrified human articular cartilage.
   We tested this hypothesis with experimental efflux measurements.
   Osteochondral dowels from three patients were vitrified, and after
   warming, the articular cartilage was immersed in 3 mL X-VIVO at 4
   degrees C in two consecutive solutions, each for 24 h, with the solution
   osmolality recorded at various times. Measured equilibrium values agreed
   with theoretical values within a maximum of 15\% for all three samples.
   The results showed that diffusion coefficients for indiyidual
   cryoprotectants determined from experiments with 2-mm thick porcine
   cartilage can be used to approximate the rate of efflux of the combined
   cryoprotectants from vitrified human articular cartilage of similar
   thickness. Finally, Fick's law of diffusion was used in a computational
   optimization to shorten the protocol with the constraint of maintaining
   the theoretical minimum cryoprotectant concentration needed to achieve
   vitrification. The learning provided by this study will enable future
   improvements in tissue vitrification. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{ELECTROCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{585-596}},

Abstract = {{Interaction of thiosulfate with Alloy 800 was systematically
   investigated to obtain the kinetics in a neutral simulated steam
   generator crevice solution. Cyclic polarization showed that the pitting
   potential in a thiosulfate-chloride solution was much lower than in
   either a chloride solution or a sulphate-chloride solution, and
   thiosulfate selectively and distinguishably degraded the oxide film on
   Alloy 800. The donor density of oxide film formed in a
   thiosulfatechloride solution was slightly higher than in either a
   chloride-only solution or a sulphate-chloride solution. Even in the
   passivity range the material was degraded due to the slow interaction
   with S2O32- with oxide, especially when the applied potential was close
   to the pitting potential. The UV-visible absorption spectra showed that
   thiosulfate formed a stable complex with Cu2+, and their product was
   soluble in aqueous solution, which is possible evidence to indicate that
   thiosulfate assists Cu2+ in dissolving from an oxide film into solution.
   Also, due to the complexity of the reaction, thiosulfate decreased the
   oxidation potential of Cu-0 to Cu2+. Since the Cu, an impurity in Alloy
   800, normally accumulates at the grain boundary, especially at the
   triple points, thiosulfate induced corrosion is in the form of pitting
   or intergranular attack. (C) The Electrochemical Society of Japan, All

Abstract = {{To make an accurate assessment on transformation behaviors of arsenic in
   coal at a high temperature, a typical high-arsenic coal collected from
   southwest China has been chosen in the study and a series of
   high-temperature experiments in different atmospheres have been
   conducted with the help of a lab-scale drop-tube furnace. Fine
   particulate matter were collected by a low-pressure impactor, for
   obtaining their mass size distributions and further quantifying for
   arsenic distributions and speciation in fine particles of different
   sizes. The results indicated that the bleeding ratios of arsenic in air
   combustion, CO2 gasification, and N-2 pyrolysis were 85, 65, and 45\%,
   respectively, at 1300 degrees C. The ratio was found to remain
   relatively constant when the temperature increased from 1200 to 1400
   degrees C. Organically associated arsenic would be more inclined to
   vaporize in N-2 pyrolysis, while both organic and inorganic associated
   arsenic would vaporize in. CO2 gasification and air combustion. Pyrite
   associated arsenic would vaporize together with sulfur in pyrite
   inclusions. The decomposition of pyrite followed the principle of an
   unreacted core model and was mostly controlled by the surface sulfur
   vapor pressure. Mass size distributions of fine particulate matter
   generated from coal gasification presented a bimodal distribution, and
   two major peaks appeared at 0.4 and 5 mu m. Particles in the size range
   of 5 mu m were presented as a round shape with pores and cracks on the
   surface, while particles in the size range of 0.4 mu m were confirmed to
   be soot. Arsenic was obviously enriched in fine particles with a size of
   around 0.1-0.2 mu m in both combustion and gasification. The major
   speciation of arsenic identified in fine particles generated from coal
   combustion was As2O5 and Ca-3(AsO4)(2), while that in fine particles
   generated from coal gasification was As2O5, As, AsO, and Ca-3(AsO4)(2).}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to gain insight into the secondary
   pyrolysis of biomass-based slurry under entrained-flow gasification
   conditions. The focus was set on the types of solid products from
   secondary pyrolysis, their mechanism of formation, and subsequent
   conversion behavior. Primary chars and pyrolysis oils from wood and
   wheat straw were produced in a screw pyrolysis reactor. A suspension
   fuel (slurry) was prepared composed of primary straw char and straw
   pyrolysis oil. A drop tube reactor was used to study the secondary
   pyrolysis of the different fuels at 1200 degrees C and 3 s residence
   time. The secondary pyrolysis of both chars yielded approximately 60 m\%
   of secondary char. While the wood char reactivity was unchanged by the
   secondary pyrolysis, the straw char showed signs of massive
   deactivation, which is most likely explained by the loss of catalytic
   activity. The secondary pyrolysis of both pyrolysis oils yielded
   approximately 20 m\% of secondary char and soot. Cenospheres could be
   identified with diameters close to the initial droplet diameter. Oil
   cenospheres and soot had similar chemical compositions but showed very
   different reactivities, which is likely to be explained by their
   different structures. The secondary pyrolysis of the straw-based slurry
   showed results similar to those of the secondary pyrolysis of oil with
   primary char particles being embedded in the cenosphere carbon shell.
   Additional thermogravimetric measurements revealed possible conversion
   mechanisms of cenospheres from oil and slurry feed.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{A detailed understanding of the impacts of trace compounds and
   asphaltene adsorption on the behavior of clays contributes to the
   development,of production processes for heavy oils and bitumen with
   lower environmental impacts, to the treatment of tailings from mined
   bitumen, and to the mitigation of impacts from oil spills in natural
   environments. Probes, such as solution calorimetry, are sensitive to
   species transfer to and from clay surfaces and outcomes can be
   interpreted unambiguously when supplemented with thermogravimetric
   analysis and scanning electron microscopy measurements. In this study,
   the effects of asphaltene coating on the enthalpy of solution of
   kaolinite and illite clays in toluene, n-heptane, and deionized water
   were investigated at 60 degrees C and atmospheric pressure. Asphaltene
   coating increases organic compound sorption but does not impact water
   sorption vis-a-vis uncoated clay particles or water displacement from
   clay particles by organic liquids as solvents or as trace contaminants
   in water. Experimental outcomes are interpreted using a quantitative
   mass and energy balance model framework that isolates terms for solvent
   and trace contaminant sorption/desorption and surface energy effects.
   Mechanistic and quantitative insights underlying the stability of
   asphaltene-coated clay dispersions in tailings ponds and the behaviors
   of these clays in diverse industrial and natural environments are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges for advanced metallic nanoparticles (NPs)
   supported functional perovskite catalysts is the simultaneous
   achievement of a high population of NPs with uniform distribution as
   well as long-lasting high performance. These are also the essential
   requirements for optimal electrode catalysts used in solid oxide fuel
   cells and electrolysis cells (SOFCs and SOECs). Herein, we report a
   facile operando manufacture way that the crystal reconstruction of
   double perovskite under reducing atmosphere can spontaneously lead to
   the formation of ordered layered oxygen deficiency and yield segregation
   of massively and finely dispersed NPs. The real-time observation of this
   emergent process was performed via an environmental transmission
   electron microscope. Density functional theory calculations prove that
   the crystal reconstruction induces the loss of coordinated oxygen
   surrounding B-site cations, serving as the driving force for steering
   fast NP growth. The prepared material shows promising capability as an
   active and stable electrode for SOFCs in various fuels and SOECs for CO2
   reduction. The conception exemplified here could conceivably be extended
   to fabricate a series of supported NPs perovskite catalysts with diverse

Journal = {{PETROLEUM GEOSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{A new geostatistical grid-free simulation (GFS) method has been
   developed recently that represents simulated continuous attributes of
   the natural phenomena, such as stratigraphic surface boundaries or
   petrophysical properties, as an analytical function of the coordinates
   of the simulation locations. Thus, GFS resolves challenges related to
   model regridding, increasing resolution around already simulated
   locations and integration of newly available data in a consistent
   manner. The present paper contains further developments in simulation of
   categorical variables, such as facies, in a grid-free fashion based on
   the truncated pluri-Gaussian simulation (TPG) paradigm. The resultant
   simulation engine allows the entire reservoir system to be represented
   as an analytical stochastic function: that is, values of any reservoir
   properties are simulated on demand at requested locations in space. The
   selection of proper variograms of Gaussian continuous variables for
   simulation of categorical variables in a TPG framework is proposed
   through a methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation. The variogram
   models of the underlying Gaussian continuous variables are obtained by
   minimizing the difference between numerically computed and target
   indicator variograms. A local optimization approach is suggested for a
   fast precise derivation of the variograms. The stable variogram model
   leads to the closest fit to the experimental variograms of the
   continuous variables. The automatic establishment of a truncation mask
   based on multidimensional scaling to convert Gaussian continuous
   variables to categories is also explained. Finally, the proposed GFS
   algorithm for petroleum reservoir characterization is demonstrated in
   its full-scale applicability to the Hekla offshore petroleum reservoir
   located in the North Sea. The results look promising, and should be
   beneficial to petroleum reservoir modelling in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The strip yield zone ahead of a penny-shaped crack in a
   magnetoelectroelastic material, subjected to electric, magnetic and
   axisymmetric mechanical loadings, is evaluated analytically. Hankel
   transform is employed to reduce the mixed boundary value problem of the
   penny-shaped crack to dual integral equations, which are solved exactly
   under the assumption of electrically and magnetically permeable crack
   face conditions and the plastic strip yield zone crack model. An
   analytic solution to the mixed boundary problem has been obtained to
   predict the relationship between the length of the strip yield zone and
   the applied loadings. The distribution of mechanical, electric and
   magnetic fields in and outside of the strip yield zone in the cracked
   magnetoelectroelastic material has been derived analytically, and the
   crack opening displacement has been investigated. The effects of the
   mechanical, electric and magnetic loadings on the size of the yield zone
   are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{This review is devoted to discussing the application of microfabrication
   technologies to target challenges encountered in life processes by the
   development of drug delivery systems. Recently, microfabrication has
   been largely applied to solve health and pharmaceutical science issues.
   In particular, fabrication methods along with compatible materials have
   been successfully designed to produce multifunctional, highly effective
   drug delivery systems. Microfabrication offers unique tools that can
   tackle problems in this field, such as ease of mass production with high
   quality control and low cost, complexity of architecture design and a
   broad range of materials. Presented is an overview of silicon-and
   polymer-based fabrication methods that are key in the production of
   microfabricated drug delivery systems. Moreover, the efforts focused on
   studying the biocompatibility of materials used in microfabrication are
   analyzed. Finally, this review discusses representative ways
   microfabrication has been employed to develop systems delivering drugs
   through the transdermal and oral route, and to improve drug eluting
   implants. Additionally, microfabricated vaccine delivery systems are
   presented due to the great impact they can have in obtaining a cold
   chain-free vaccine, with long-term stability. Microfabrication will
   continue to offer new, alternative solutions for the development of
   smart, advanced drug delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Head and neck cancer treatment alters the anatomy and physiology of
   patients. Resulting swallowing difficulties can lead to serious health
   concerns. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is used as an adjuvant to
   swallowing therapy exercises. sEMG signal collected from the area under
   the chin provides visual biofeedback from muscle contractions and is
   used to help patients perform exercises correctly. However, conventional
   sEMG adhesive pads are relatively thick and difficult to effectively
   adhere to a patient's altered chin anatomy, potentially leading to poor
   signal acquisition in this population. Here, the emerging technology of
   epidermal electronics is introduced, where ultra-thin geometry allows
   for close contouring of the chin. The two objectives of this study were
   to (I) assess the potential of epidermal electronics technology for use
   with swallowing therapy and (2) assess the significance of the reference
   electrode placement This study showed comparative signals between the
   new epidermal sEMG patch and the conventional adhesive patches used by
   clinicians. Furthermore, an integrated reference yielded optimal signal
   for clinical use; this configuration was more robust to head movements
   than when an external reference was used. Improvements for future
   iterations of epidermal sEMG patches specific to day-to-day clinical use
   are suggested. (C) 2016 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes several designs of approximate restoring dividers;
   two different levels of approximation (cell and array levels) are
   employed. Three approximate subtractor cells are utilized for integer
   subtraction as basic step of division; these cells tend to mitigate
   accuracy in subtraction with other metrics, such as circuit complexity
   and power dissipation. At array level, exact cells are either replaced
   or truncated in the approximate divider designs. A comprehensive
   evaluation of approximation at both cell-and array (divider) levels is
   pursued using error analysis and HSPICE simulation; different circuit
   metrics including complexity and power dissipation are evaluated.
   Different applications are investigated by utilizing the proposed
   approximate arithmetic circuits. The simulation results show that with
   extensive savings for power dissipation and circuit complexity, the
   proposed designs offer better error tolerant capabilities for quotient
   oriented applications (image processing) than remainder oriented
   application (modulo operations). The proposed approximate restoring
   divider is significantly better than the approximate non-restoring
   scheme presented in the technical literature.}},

Title = {{Approximate Radix-8 Booth Multipliers for Low-Power and High-Performance
   Operation}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS}},

Abstract = {{The Booth multiplier has been widely used for high performance signed
   multiplication by encoding and thereby reducing the number of partial
   products. A multiplier using the radix-4 (or modified Booth) algorithm
   is very efficient due to the ease of partial product generation, whereas
   the radix-8 Booth multiplier is slow due to the complexity of generating
   the odd multiples of the multiplicand. In this paper, this issue is
   alleviated by the application of approximate designs. An approximate
   2-bit adder is deliberately designed for calculating the sum of 1x and
   2x of a binary number. This adder requires a small area, a low power and
   a short critical path delay. Subsequently, the 2-bit adder is employed
   to implement the less significant section of a recoding adder for
   generating the triple multiplicand with no carry propagation. In the
   pursuit of a trade-off between accuracy and power consumption, two
   signed 16 x 16 bit approximate radix-8 Booth multipliers are designed
   using the approximate recoding adder with and without the truncation of
   a number of less significant bits in the partial products. The proposed
   approximate multipliers are faster and more power efficient than the
   accurate Booth multiplier. The multiplier with 15-bit truncation
   achieves the best overall performance in terms of hardware and accuracy
   when compared to other approximate Booth multiplier designs. Finally,
   the approximate multipliers are applied to the design of a low-pass FIR
   filter and they show better performance than other approximate Booth
   multipliers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a therapist-in-the-loop framework for
   robotics-assisted mirror rehabilitation integrated with adaptive
   assist-as-needed therapy (ANT) that is adjusted based on the impairment
   level of the patient's affected limb. The framework, which is designed
   for patients with hemiparesis and/or hemispatial neglect, uses a
   patient's functional limb as the medium to transfer therapeutic training
   from the therapist to the patient's impaired limb (PIL). This allows the
   patient to use his/her functional limb to adjust the desired trajectory
   generated by the therapist if the trajectory is painful or uncomfortable
   for the PIL. In order to realize the adaptive patient-targeted therapy,
   two motor-function assessment metrics, performance symmetry and level of
   guidance, are proposed, providing real time, task-independent, and
   objective assessment of the PIL's motor deficiency. An adaptation law is
   also presented to adjust the intensity of the therapy delivered to the
   patient in real time and based on the aforementioned estimation of the
   impairment level of the PIL. Closed-loop system stability has been
   investigated in the presence of communication delays to facilitate
   tele/in-home rehabilitation. For this purpose, a combination of the
   Circle Criterion and the Small-Gain theorem has been applied to account
   both for communication time delays and the time-varying adaptive ANT.
   Results of experiments to investigate the performance of the proposed
   framework are reported.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with a robust control problem of a class of
   networked systems operated within a multiple communication channels
   (MCCs) environment. A practical scenario is considered that the active
   channel in such MCCs for the data communication is switched and the
   switching is governed by a Markov chain. For each channel, two
   network-induced imperfections, time delays, and packet dropouts with
   different characteristics are taken into account. Suppose that the
   practical plant is subject to energy-bounded disturbance and
   norm-bounded uncertainties, a robust controller is designed to ensure
   that the closed-loop system is robustly stable and achieves a
   disturbance attenuation index against the phenomenon of channel
   switching. A semi-active suspension system is introduced to illustrate
   the effectiveness, applicability of the proposed approach, and to
   demonstrate the advantages of the MCCs scheme within the
   channel-switching framework.}},

Abstract = {{A novel grid-free geostatistical simulation method (GFS) allows
   representing coregionalized variables as an analytical function of the
   coordinates of the simulation locations. Simulation on unstructured
   grids, regridding and refinement of available realizations of natural
   phenomena including, but not limited to, environmental systems are
   possible with GFS in a consistent manner. The unconditional realizations
   are generated by utilizing the linear model of coregionalization and
   Fourier series-based decomposition of the covariance function. The
   conditioning to data is performed by kriging. The data can be measured
   at scattered point-scale locations or sampled at a block scale.
   Secondary data are usually used in conjunction with primary data for the
   improved modeling. Satellite imaging is an example of exhaustively
   sampled secondary data. Improvements and recommendations are made to the
   implementation of GFS to properly assimilate secondary exhaustive data
   sets in a grid-free manner. Intrinsic cokriging (ICK) is utilized to
   reduce computational time and preserve the overall quality of the
   simulation. To further reduce the computational cost of ICK, a block
   matrix inversion is implemented in the calculation of the kriging
   weights. A projection approach to ICK is proposed to avoid artifacts in
   the realizations around the edges of the exhaustive data region when the
   data do not cover the entire modeling domain. The point-scale block
   value representation of the block-scale data is developed as an
   alternative to block cokriging to integrate block-scale data into
   realizations within the GFS framework. Several case studies support the
   proposed enhancements.}},

Abstract = {{It has been observed that a large variability exists between wind speed
   and wind power in real metrological conditions. To reduce this
   substantial variability, this study developed a stochastic wind turbine
   power curve by incorporating various exogenous factors. Four
   measurements, namely, wind azimuth, wind elevation, air density and
   solar radiation are chosen as exogenous influence factors. A recursive
   formula based on conditional copulas is used to capture the complex
   dependency structure between wind speed and wind power with reduced
   variability. A procedure of selecting a proper form for each factor and
   its corresponding copula models is given. Through a case study on the
   small wind turbine located in southeast of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, we
   demonstrate that the variability can be reduced significantly by
   incorporating these influence factors. Wind turbine operators can apply
   the method reported in this study to construct a stochastic power curve
   for local wind farms and use it to achieve more accurate power
   forecasting and health condition monitoring of the turbine. Copyright

Abstract = {{Road safety is influenced by many factors; these factors include
   characteristics of the road, climate, traffic and, most importantly,
   vehicle speeds. Previous research shows that increases in speed are
   typically associated with an increased collision risk. Moreover,
   previous studies have also found relationships between road and traffic
   characteristics and collisions. In addition, these features have also
   been found to affect speeds. This paper aims to model all the
   aforementioned relationships simultaneously using a Structural Equation
   Modelling approach. More specifically, the paper attempts to model the
   relationship between average speed and collision frequency, while taking
   into account the effects of factors that confound the relationship.
   Moreover, the analysis attempts to assess the mediated effects that some
   variables have on collisions through their effects on speed. The data
   used in this study originated from 353 two-lane urban roads in the city
   of Edmonton, Canada. The average speeds were obtained from 35 million
   speed survey observations collected over a five-year period. The speed
   data are linked to the crash frequency at each location during the same
   time frame, along with the other factors (road, traffic and climate).
   The results show that, among others, average speed, volume, segment
   length, medians and horizontal curves all have statistically significant
   effects on collisions. On the other hand, shoulders, speed limits and
   vehicle-lengths are some variables that significantly influence speeds.
   The results also show that the effects of some variables on safety are
   indeed mediated through speeds (both partial and full mediation is
   observed). These findings provide valuable insight that may assist
   decision makers in choosing and developing alternative speed management
   strategies, which, in turn, could help improve safety. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Construction site layout changes dynamically depending on the progress
   of construction activities in ways that may constrain access routes and
   paths of mobile resources. Discrete event simulation is a useful tool
   for modeling time dependent activities and resource interactions but
   usually cannot depict spatial changes in a natural way. This paper
   describes a framework for integrating 3D visualization components with
   discrete event simulations to model the movement of mobile cranes on
   industrial construction projects and facilitate tempo-spatial planning
   of site layout The paper focuses on the integration approach using
   distributed simulation standards and spatial analysis using a dedicated
   visualization component with pathfinding algorithm. The A{*} algorithm
   is used in conjunction with mesh generation mechanism for developing the
   proposed framework. The benefits of the proposed framework emerge from
   taking full advantage of the geometrical and special processing
   strengths of the visualization component through loose coupling with
   simulation components. The paper describes the main components of the
   framework and the two-way communication mechanism between them based on
   distributed simulation standards. It also presents a case example of a
   real world project to demonstrate the proposed framework and compare the
   outcome to a traditional solution that uses a probability distribution
   to model crane travel times. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The room temperature tensile deformation behavior of two metallic
   glasses (MGs), Cu64Zr36 and Cu40Zr60, was investigated, by employing
   molecular dynamics simulations, with a view to examine the evolution of
   plastic deformation at the atomistic scale. It was found that after
   reaching the maximum stress, atoms in areas with lower packing
   efficiency, which have liquid-like polyhedral atomic configurations,
   exhibit larger displacement. On further deformation, the atoms in
   rigidly packed regions, which have solid-like polyhedral atomic
   configurations, also start partaking in the plastic deformation,
   especially within the shear band region. The average shear
   transformation zone (STZ) size, defined by the coordination neighborhood
   of highly strained atoms, was found to increase from 17 +/- 3 to 106 +/-
   6 atoms within the strain range of 7-12\%, which spans the shear band
   initiation to mature formation, in both MGs examined. A detailed
   examination of the distributions of the number and the size of STZs as a
   function of strain reveals that the formation of the shear band is
   linked with the occurrence of a few super-sized STZs. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper studies the consensus problem for multi-agent systems. A
   distributed consensus algorithm is developed by constructing homogeneous
   pulse width modulators for agents in the network. In particular, a
   certain percentage of the sampling period named duty cycle is modulated
   according to some state difference with respect to the neighbors at each
   sampling instant. During each duty cycle, the amplitude of the pulse is
   fixed. The proposed pulse width modulation scheme enables all agents to
   sample asynchronously with arbitrarily large sampling periods. It
   provides an alternative digital implementation strategy for multi-agent
   systems. We show that consensus is achieved asymptotically under the
   proposed scheme. The results are compared with the self-triggered

Title = {{Dendrimer functionalized graphene oxide for selenium removal}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{105}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Selenium is an essential trace element nutrient for human life; but it
   can be extremely toxic if taken excess. Various adsorbents have been
   applied for the removal of selenium from water but performed poorly in
   Se (VI) removal, which is more bioavailable and more difficult to
   remove. Herein, we reported a new method to prepare the dendrimer, a
   different generations of poly (amido amine), functionalized graphene
   oxide (PAMAM-GO). The PAMAM-GO was characterized by XPS, FTIR, XRD, TGA
   and TEM. The resulting products were applied in selenium removal from
   simulated waste water, showing an increasing capacity with increasing
   the generation of dendrimers. The 4th generation of PAMAM-GO (GO-G4)
   shows a removal capacity of 60.9 mg g(-1) in Se (IV) and 77.9 mg g(-1)
   in Se (VI) at pH 6. The adsorption mechanism is mainly attributed to the
   electrostatic interaction between selenium oxyanions and the amine
   groups, proved by the effect of initial pH on removal capacity and zeta
   potential measurement. Our study shows that PAMAM-GO is an excellent
   adsorbent in selenium removal from waste water. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Energy balance and greenhouse gas emissions from the production and
   sequestration of charcoal from agricultural residues}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{558-567}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural residues (wheat/barley/oat straw) can be used to produce
   charcoal, which can then be either landfilled off-site or spread on the
   agricultural field as a means for sequestering carbon. One centralized
   and five portable charcoal production technologies were explored in this
   paper. The centralized system produced 747.95 kg-CO(2)eq/tonne-straw and
   sequestered 0.204 t-C/t-straw. The portable systems sequestered carbon
   at 0.141-0.217 t-C/t-straw. The net energy ratio (NER) of the portable
   systems was higher than the centralized one at 10.29-16.26 compared to
   6.04. For the centralized system, the carbon sequestration and the
   cumulative energy demand were most sensitive to the charcoal yield.
   Converting straw residues into charcoal can reduce GHG emissions by 80\%
   after approximately 8.5 years relative to the baseline of in-field
   decomposition, showing these systems are effective carbon sequestration
   methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Developing high throughput thin film composite polyamide membranes for

Volume = {{511}},

Abstract = {{Application of thin film composite (TFC) membranes for forward osmosis
   (FO) separation processes has attracted growing attention due to their
   outstanding permeation properties as compared to conventional asymmetric
   membranes. The aim of the present study is to fabricate high-performance
   TFC membranes by an innovative adjustment of interfacial polymerization
   (IP) reaction between m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride
   (TMC) at the surface of a polyethersulfone (PES) microporous support. It
   was found that reducing the temperature of the organic solution down to
   - 20 degrees C effectively reduced the thickness of the PA selective
   layer and thus, significantly enhanced water permeation through the
   membranes. The water flux increased more than double from 17.6 LMH for
   membranes prepared at 25 C to 38.5 LMH at - 20 degrees C, when 3 M NaCI
   solution and de-ionized water were used as draw and feed solutions,
   respectively. In addition, all the lab-made membranes showed
   significantly lower specific solute flux than the commercial membrane.
   The performance of lab-synthesized TFC membranes was also evaluated for
   the treatment of boiler feed water (BEIN) of steam assisted gravity
   drainage (SAGD) process. The results showed superior permeation
   properties of lab-made membranes to commercially available TFC-FO
   membranes. This was attributed to the thinner PA selective layer and
   lower structural parameter (451 +/- 13) of the lab-made membranes
   compared to the commercial membrane (1770 pm) which alleviated the
   effect of internal concentration polarization (ICP) remarkably. This
   study provides valuable guidelines for an effective tuning of the
   organic solution temperature during the IP reaction to develop
   high-throughput TFC FO membranes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Among high-power pulsewidth modulation (PWM) current-source motor
   drives, the transformerless structure using the integrated dc choke has
   been widely acknowledged with superior advantages. A typical challenge
   faced by such transformerless PWM current-source drive systems is the
   potential common-mode resonance excited by the common-mode voltage
   (CMV). Since the implementation of power factor compensation (PFC) at
   low motor speeds may increase the CMV in such drives, the common-mode
   resonance could be serious and further aggravate the CMV stress on the
   system. In this paper, the critical factors on the common-mode resonance
   are thoroughly investigated. Based on the investigation, a solution
   based on average-value-reduction (AVR) spacevector modulation (SVM) is
   proposed to suppress the common-mode resonance while maintaining the PFC
   function. The investigation of common-mode resonance and the
   effectiveness of the proposed resonance suppression solution are
   verified through experiments on a transformerless PWM current-source
   drive system.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery that approximately 20\% of natural gas is microbial in
   origin has elevated interest in microbially enhanced coalbed methane
   (MECoM). However, a rational approach to exploit this calls for the
   development of reservoir scale models that include the effect of
   microbial activity. To address this, we have developed a multiscale,
   multiphase, multicomponent reactive -transport model for the production
   of microbially enhanced coalbed methane (MECoM) that includes microbial
   kinetics. The model is used to evaluate field scale strategies for
   commercial MECoM production. Optimization studies are also conducted
   over a range of compositions of the injected nutrient and injector
   bottomhole pressures. In order to account for the effect of uncertainty
   in the model parameters, mean -variance robust optimization is
   performed, allowing a trade-off between performance and robustness.
   Proxy modeling is performed in a multivariate polynomial chaos expansion
   framework to evaluate the cost functions involved in the robust
   optimization and sparse expansions are constructed in order to deal with
   issues related to high dimensionality. The optimization strategy is
   tested for different trade-offs between robustness and performance. It
   is observed that for the given case, the location of robust optimal
   points does not vary unless only robustness is included in the objective
   function, and nominal performance is not. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hierarchical nanocomposite of ultrathin WS2 nanosheets uniformly
   attached on the surface of hollow nitrogen doped carbon spheres
   (WS2@HNCSs) were successfully fabricated via a facile synthesis
   strategy. When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, the hierarchical
   WS2@HNCSs exhibit a high specific capacity of 801.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A
   g(-1), excellent rate capability (545.6 mA h g(-1) at a high current
   density of 2 A g(-1)), and great cycling stability with a capacity
   retention of 95.8\% after 150 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). The Li-ion storage
   properties of our WS2@HNCSs nanocomposite are much better than those of
   the previously most reported WS2-based anode materials. The impressive
   electrochemical performance is attributed to the robust nanostructure
   and the favorable synergistic effect between the ultrathin (3-5 layers)
   WS2 nanosheets and the highly conductive hollow N-doped carbon spheres.
   The hierarchical hybrid can simultaneously facilitate fast electron/ion
   transfer, effectively accommodate mechanical stress from cycling,
   restrain agglomeration, and enable full utilization of the active
   materials. These characteristics make WS2@HNCSs a promising anode
   material for high-performance LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{The adhesion and detachment of polymer and solid substrate surfaces play
   important roles in many engineering applications such as for designing
   adhesives, biomedical adhesives, adhesive tapes, robust protective
   coatings, biomedical scaffolds, prosthetic devices (e.g., artificial
   joints and implants), and fabrication of micro- and
   nanoelectromechanical devices. In this work, a surface forces apparatus
   (SEA) coupled with top-view optical microscopy was employed to measure
   the adhesion between thin polystyrene (PS) films and a mica substrate to
   probe their detachment behaviors. Various factors, including molecular
   weight (MW), contact time, and polarity-enhancing UV/ozone treatment,
   were examined. The results show that increased chain-end density, chain
   mobility, and segment polarity can all contribute to enhanced adhesion
   strength for both the ``symmetric{''} PS PS and ``asymmetric{''} PS mica
   systems but attributed to different adhesion/detachment mechanisms. For
   the asymmetric PS mica system, the increased chain-end density (lower
   MW), increased chain mobility, and increased polarity (induced by
   UV/ozone treatment) facilitate the rearrangement of the polystyrene
   chains and the development of mainly ``polar{''} interactions such as
   dipole dipole, dipole induced dipole, and attractive hydrogen bond
   interactions between the polar groups on the UV-treated PS (the
   pi-electron clouds of the phenyl rings) and the highly polar mica
   surface. For the symmetric PS PS system, the enhanced adhesion is mainly
   due to the interdiffusion, interdigitation, interpenetration, and
   entanglement of chains across the polymer polymer contact interface.
   Importantly, during the separation of a UV/ozone-treated PS surface from
   mica, ``stick slip{''} detachment was observed, resulting in a residue
   of concentric polymer rings left on the mica surface. Our results
   provide new fundamental and practical insights into the adhesion,
   detachment, and damage (wear) mechanisms of polymer polymer and polymer
   solid surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{A wastewater treatment plant is a large-scale nonlinear system including
   a series of biological reactors and a settler. In this work, we propose
   a distributed state estimation scheme for wastewater treatment processes
   in the context of extended Kalman filtering. Specifically, we consider a
   wastewater treatment process that includes a five compartment reactor
   and an ideal splitter. First, we present a method to design the sensor
   network for the process and then discuss how the process may be
   decomposed into subsystems for distributed state estimation. We present
   a detailed design of the distributed filters and a detailed distributed
   state estimation algorithm to coordinate the actions of the different
   filters. Without loss of generality, we consider the entire system as
   being decomposed into two subsystems. The proposed approach can be
   extended in a straightforward fashion to include more subsystems. The
   distributed scheme is compared with the corresponding centralized
   extended Kalman filtering scheme under different weather conditions.
   Simulation results show that the distributed scheme can give comparable
   estimation performance to the centralized scheme or even better
   performance than the centralized scheme. Also, the distributed
   estimation scheme is shown to have more stable performance under
   different noise conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a time-varying gain-scheduling approach is proposed to
   deal with the problem of stabilisation for a class of semi-Markov jump
   linear systems. A more general class of Lyapunov functions that depends
   not only on the system modes, but also on the staying time during the
   current system mode is constructed, which can cover the common
   time-invariant Lyapunov functions as special cases. In the sense of the
   sigma-error mean-square stability proposed previously, the numerically
   testable sufficient criteria for the stability analysis are derived and
   certain techniques are employed such that the obtained conditions are
   linear in the system matrices. Both the time-invariant and time-varying
   control syntheses are investigated, and the results in a recent study
   can be deemed as extreme cases of the obtained criteria. Finally, the
   developed theoretical results are verified by three numerical examples,
   and it is demonstrated that the results based on the time-varying
   approach is less conservative than those based on the time-invariant
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Gel is an intermediate phase of solid and liquid, which exhibits
   properties of both, and this unique feature of gel has made it an
   excellent choice as a reaction medium for the nanomaterials synthesis.
   Herein, we report use of oil swollen surfactant gels as reaction medium
   and exfoliation medium, for the synthesis of metals (Au, Ag)
   nanoparticles and graphene, respectively. Confined growth of metals (Au
   and Ag) nanoparticles, has been achieved by exploring tween 80 based
   surfactant gel as a reaction medium. Au NPs prepared within tween 80 gel
   were found to be spherical with size similar to 5 nm, arranged in
   template micelles. Heating triggered the growth of Au nanoparticles and
   particles of various shapes including triangles, rods and pentagonal,
   were produced. Au and Ag containing tween 80 gels were found to be
   promising as catalysts for the nitrophenol reduction. Apart from
   separate synthesis of Au and Ag nanoparticles, bimetallic (Au-Ag)
   nanoparticles have also been synthesized by taking advantage of
   selective reducing property of tween 80. First time CTAB gel has been
   utilized as an exfoliation medium for the quick exfoliation of graphite
   into graphene sheets, eliminating the necessity of any external driving
   force such as sonication or heating, to reinforce exfoliation. (C) 2016

   monolayers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Several candidate phenomenological expressions are studied for
   self-rippling energy that drives ripple formation of free single-layer
   graphene sheets. One phenomenological expression is admitted, while all
   others are rejected because they cannot admit stable periodic ripple
   mode. The admitted phenomenological expression contains two terms: one
   quadratic term which acts like a compressive force and has a
   destabilizing effect, and another fourth-order term which acts like a
   nonlinear elastic foundation and has a stabilizing effect. The two
   associated coefficients depend on specific mechanism of self-rippling
   and can be determined based on observed wavelength and amplitude of
   ripple mode. Based on the admitted expression, the effect of an applied
   force on ripple formation is studied. The present model predicts that
   the rippling can be controlled or even suppressed with an applied
   tensile force or collapsed into narrow wrinkles (of deformed wavelengths
   down to around 2 nm) under an applied compressive force, and the
   estimated minimum tensile strain to suppress rippling is in remarkable
   agreement with some known data. Our results show that self-rippling
   energy dominates ripple formation of sufficiently long free graphene
   ribbons, although it cannot drive self-rippling of sufficiently short
   free graphene ribbons. Consequently, a critical length is estimated so
   that self-rippling occurs only when the length of free single-layer
   graphene ribbons is much longer than the critical length. The estimated
   critical length is reasonably consistent with the known fact that
   self-rippling cannot occur in shorter free graphene sheets (say, of
   length below 20 nm). Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) exhibit great potential as
   high-capacity cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, but usually
   suffer from capacity/voltage fade during electrochemical cycling.
   Herein, a gradient polyanion-doping strategy is developed to initiate
   surface structural transition to form a spinel-like surface nanolayer
   and a polyanion-doped layered core material in LLOs simultaneously. This
   strategy integrates the advantages of both bulk doping and surface
   modification as the oxygen close-packed structure of LLOs is stabilized
   by polyanion doping, and the LLO cathodes are protected from steady
   corrosion induced by electrolytes. A LLO material modified with 5 at\%
   phosphate (5\% P@LLO) shows a high reversible discharge capacity of
   approximate to 300 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, excellent cycling stability with
   a capacity retention of 95\% after 100 cycles, and enhanced electrode
   kinetics. This gradient doping strategy can be further extended to other
   polyanion-doped LLO materials, such as borate and silicate polyanions.}},

Title = {{Robust probabilistic principal component analysis for process modeling
   subject to scaled mixture Gaussian noise}},

Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{Conventionally, for probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA)
   based regression models, noise with a Gaussian distribution is assumed
   for both input and output observations. This assumption makes the model
   to be vulnerable to large random errors, known as outliers. In this
   article, unlike the conventional noise assumption, a mixture noise model
   with a contaminated Gaussian distribution is adopted for probabilistic
   modeling to diminish the adverse effect of outliers, which usually occur
   due to irregular process disturbances, instrumentation failures or
   transmission problems. This is done by down-weighing the effect of the
   noise component which accounts for contamination on output prediction.
   Outliers are common in process industries; therefore, handling this
   issue is of practical importance. In comparison with conventional PPCA
   based regression model, prediction performance of the developed robust
   probabilistic regression model is improved in presence of data
   contamination. To evaluate the model performance two case studies were
   carried out. A simulated set of data with specific characteristics to
   highlight the presence of outliers was used to demonstrate the
   robustness of the developed model. The advantages of this robust model
   are further illustrated via a set of real industrial process data. (C)

   identify the local ARX model. Just-in-time learning (JITL) and dual

Abstract = {{Cross-flow ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse
   osmosis (RO) were applied for the first time on a produced water
   obtained from a thermal in situ bitumen recovery process called
   steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), with the intent to remove salt,
   silica, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) so that the produced water
   could be re-used as high-quality boiler feedwater. It was found that
   more hydrophilic and more negatively charged membranes were less
   susceptible to fouling. The UF membrane tested rejected a maximum of
   30\% of the salt and silica and 50\% of the DOM. Nanofiltration with
   loose membranes removed more than 70\% of the salt and DOM. The tight NF
   membranes tested removed more than 86\% of the salt, silica, and DOM,
   and consumed less energy than RO, which showed almost the same
   rejection. An instantaneous increase in water flux resulting from a step
   change in feedwater pH demonstrated the critical role of pH in flux
   recovery and in fouling mitigation. Analysis of the fouled membranes
   indicated presence of silica, iron, and calcium in the foulant material.
   Feed and permeate characterization showed that mainly hydrophilic DOM
   passed through the membrane. The study provides valuable insights
   regarding the suitability of membranes as alternatives to conventional
   SAGD water treatment methods, especially in terms of producing higher
   quality recycled water.}},

   Detailed emulation designs are presented for the following protective

   operate these relays are also emulated, allowing the protection system
   to be stand-alone and fed with instantaneous fault data. Real-time

Abstract = {{A series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to probe
   the adsorption behaviors of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) from
   n-heptane and toluene onto water droplets. In n-heptane, the simulations
   revealed distinct adsorbed structures of PAC molecules on the water
   droplets with different sizes. In the system with a small water droplet
   (radius 1.86 nm), the adsorbed PAC aggregate renders a straight
   one-dimensional (1D) structure; contrarily, in the presence of a large
   water droplet (radius 3.10 nm), a bent 1D structure of nonzero curvature
   is formed. Such size effect is a result from the delicate balance
   between the deformation energy required for adsorption and the available
   attractions between the PAC and water molecules. While the adsorbed
   structures are sensitive to the size of the water droplet at relatively
   low PAC concentration in n-heptane, the size effect in toluene is only
   prominent when the concentration of PAC molecules is sufficiently high.}},

Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{We present the design of a magnetoplasmonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer
   (MZI) modulator facilitating radio-frequency (RF) mixing and nonlinear
   frequency generation. This is achieved by forming the MZI arms from
   long-range dielectric-loaded plasmonic waveguides containing
   bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG). The magnetization of
   the Bi:YIG can be driven in the nonlinear regime by RF magnetic fields
   produced around adjacent transmission lines. Correspondingly, the
   nonlinear temporal dynamics of the transverse magnetization component
   are mapped onto the nonreciprocal phase shift in the MZI arms, and onto
   the output optical intensity signal. We show that this tunable mechanism
   can generate harmonics, frequency splitting, and frequency
   down-conversion with a single RF excitation, as well as RF mixing when
   driven by two RF signals. This magnetoplasmonic component can reduce the
   number of electrical sources required to generate distinct optical
   modulation frequencies and is anticipated to satisfy important
   applications in integrated optics. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{For materials used under dynamic loading conditions such as impact and
   impact wear, an appropriate balance between hardness and toughness is
   highly desired. However, determination of such a balance is challenging,
   since the toughness depends on both the mechanical strength and
   ductility, which complicates the judgement and control. Besides, local
   defects, poor phases and interfaces all could trigger local cracking and
   consequent global failure. These undesired structural or microstructural
   imperfections increase the difficulty in controlling the
   hardness-toughness balance. In this article, using high-Cr cast irons
   (HCCI) as example, we demonstrate that electron work function is a
   promising indicative parameter for supplementary clues to adjust the

Abstract = {{The energy absorptions of drop-weight tear tests (DWTT) are analyzed
   using a finite element model based on the cohesive zone model. The
   parameters in the traction-separation law for the cohesive zone are
   validated by matching the simulation results to test data of standard
   specimens of DWTT. Based on the simulations the fracture energy (defined
   as the adhesion energy plus the plastic energy surrounding the crack
   tip) is quantified from the total energy absorption in the standard
   specimen. A ratio of the fracture energy to the total energy absorption
   for the steady-state crack propagation in the standard specimen is
   obtained which could be used to estimate the energy-based toughness of
   pipeline steel based on the measurable total energy absorption in DWTT.

Abstract = {{Six oil sands with increasing water and clay content were investigated
   for their electrical relaxation mechanisms using broadband dielectric
   spectroscopy with frequency (1 Hz to 1 MHz) and temperature (20-200
   degrees C) to identify suitable operational strategies for electrical
   heating. Oil sands having least water and clay content showed a
   conduction relaxation mechanism following Jonscher's law due to
   Maxwell-Wagner (MW) polarizations at bound water interfaces between
   bitumen and silica grains. MW polarizations due to free water interfaces
   between 1 kHz and 1 MHz were observed for oil sands having pendular
   connected water channels between sand grains. Poor oil sands with water
   entrapped in fine clusters had a dominant dc conduction mechanism.
   Additionally, all oil sands displayed dipole relaxations due to bitumen
   molecules between 100 kHz and 1 MHz. Electrical properties increased as
   temperatures were increased from 20 to 120 degrees C, whereas a further
   increase from 120 to 200 degrees C resulted in reduction of these
   properties and dominance of ac conduction, causing all oil sands to
   behave the same irrespective of their grade.}},

Abstract = {{We derive a series solution for the electro-elastic field inside an
   anisotropic piezoelectric half-plane containing an elliptical hole or a
   crack when the half-plane is subjected to in-plane mechanical and
   electric loadings. Our solution is based on a specific type of conformal
   map which allows for the mapping of a complete half-plane (without a
   hole) onto the interior of the unit circle in the imaginary plane. We
   illustrate our solution with several examples. We show that with
   decreasing distance between the hole and the edge of the half-plane, the
   maximum hoop stress around the hole increases rapidly under mechanical
   loading but slowly in the presence of electric loading. In particular,
   for a crack with particular orientation in a piezoelectric half-plane
   subjected to pure shear, we find that the mode-II stress intensity
   factor at the crack tip farthest from the edge of the half-plane may
   decrease as the crack approaches the edge. Moreover, if the distance
   between the crack or the elliptical hole and the edge of the half-plane
   exceeds four times the size of the hole or semi-length of the crack, the
   half-plane can be treated essentially as a whole plane without inducing
   significant errors in the stress concentration around the hole or in the
   stress and electric displacement intensity factors at the crack tips.}},

Abstract = {{A sensor fault estimation method is proposed for a general class of
   uncertain nonlinear systems. Taking the sensor faults as auxiliary
   states, an augmented descriptor system is constructed. For this
   augmented descriptor system, an adaptive fuzzy proportional-derivative
   sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the sensor faults and
   states, simultaneously. Adaptive fuzzy systems based on the universal
   approximation theorem are used to approximate the nonlinearities. Thus,
   the nonlinearities can be unknown and the Lipschitz assumption can be
   utterly relieved. To relax the requirement of knowing the bound of
   uncertainties, an adaptive gain for the sliding mode term is used. The
   semi-global asymptotic convergence of the proposed fault estimation
   observer is proved using the Lyapunov approach. The proposed method is
   applied to a highly nonlinear mathematical model with both bounded and
   unbounded sensor faults. Simulation results show the satisfactory
   performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{A stretchable transmissive hexagonal diffraction grating, which has the
   potential to act as an optical diffuser, is demonstrated. Leveraging the
   simplicity of the self-assembly fabrication process, the photon
   manipulation capability of polystyrene nanosphere arrays, and
   elastomeric properties of polydimethylsiloxane, the proposed device is
   capable of reproducible in situ tuning of both diffraction efficiency
   and spectral range. While being able to achieve maximum diffraction
   efficiencies of about 80\%, the device displays highly efficient and
   broadband light diffusion fairly independent of incident light
   polarization and angle of incidence. Due to its efficient and tunable
   diffraction capabilities, one potential application of the reported
   device can be broadband photon management in solar cells and
   photodetectors by significant increase of the light path length inside
   the light-absorbing thin films of these devices. As a proof of concept,
   the proposed optical diffuser is utilized for light absorption
   enhancement in colloidal quantum dot semiconductor thin films. The
   demonstrated devices enable integration of cheap and widely used
   materials with simple cost-effective fabrication for photon management
   in optics, photonics, and optoelectronics.}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach for the integration of micro- and nanoscale
   components using self-assembly based on the specific binding of
   complementary DNA strands. In this concept, separately fabricated
   components are integrated onto a common substrate in the proper location
   based on this molecular recognition in solution, rather than robotic
   mechanical positioning. In an attempt to demonstrate this, we have
   fabricated model devices based on small (25 mu m) silicon tiles which
   have been functionalized with a 16 base strand of DNA. The complementary
   DNA strand has been attached to a patterned silicon substrate. Two
   different DNA attachment strategies are presented based on bare silicon
   or on employing a gold coating. Validation of the DNA attachment
   procedure is demonstrated using contact angle measurement, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, fluorescent microscopy and time-of-flight
   secondary mass spectrometry. While viable DNA functionalization of the
   surface has been demonstrated, assembly of the 25 mu m devices has
   proven to be challenging. Possible reasons for this are presented.
   Somewhat more success has been achieved using 200 nm gold nanoparticles
   or by employing an biotin-avidin based binding procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of pipeline steels in near-neutral pH
   environments has remained a significant integrity risk for oil and gas
   pipelines. Although it has traditionally been termed ``stress corrosion
   cracking,{''} crack growth has never been observed under a static
   loading condition. It was determined later that the cracking is driven
   by corrosion-fatigue mechanisms with some uniqueness. First, the loading
   frequencies typically vary over a wide range from 10(-1) Hz to 10(-6)
   Hz, which is usually beyond the scope of most fatigue investigations.
   Second, the rate of corrosion is typically well below 0.1 mm/y at which
   a premature failure solely by corrosion would occur much longer than
   that actually found in the field. Third, hydrogen, a by-product of
   corrosion, can be generated to a level at which hydrogen embrittlement
   may occur only under special conditions. Fourth, pipelines are operated
   under variable pressure fluctuations that may lead to enhanced crack
   growth resulting from load-interactions effects. All existing crack
   growth models were developed based on the results obtained from tests
   either under constant load for the case of SCC or under constant stress
   amplitude loading for the case of fatigue or corrosion fatigue. These
   models generally yield predictions that are deviated from the crack
   growth rates being measured because they fail to consider both the
   stress-dependent and the time-dependent load interactions during
   variable pressure fluctuations. This overview will discuss details on
   how these factors are synergistically interacted to cause failures of
   pipeline steels in the field. Based on the understanding of the cracking
   mechanisms, strategies to mitigate field crack initiation and
   propagation will be introduced.}},

Abstract = {{The consensus reached in the literature is that the roughness of
   fractures plays a crucial role on proppant transport affecting the
   aperture sustainability and conductivity of hydraulic fractures. To
   clarify this, an experimental scheme and analysis are presented in this
   paper. Propping agents were introduced into seven different transparent
   fracture replicas obtained from different origin rock samples (granite,
   marble, and limestone) at a high rate mimicking hydraulic fracturing
   process conditions. The inlet pressure was continuously monitored to
   quantify the change in hydraulic conductivity due to proppant
   distribution. Corresponding images were collected to trace the transport
   of proppants and their behavior was correlated to the measured pressure
   drop (representing conductivity) change. Experiments were repeated on
   joint (perfectly mating) and horizontally displaced (sheared-unmating)
   models using water and polymer solution.
   Existing closure areas controlled by roughness dictated proppant
   movement and the change in hydraulic conductivity significantly in both
   joint and displaced type fractures. To quantify this effect, pressure
   drop across the model and proppant distribution (area saturated with
   sands) were correlated to three fractal methods (variogram, power
   spectral density, and triangular prism) and the ratio of total and
   planar fracture surface areas. Correlation parameters and types differ
   for water and polymer solution. Joint and displaced type fractures also
   showed differences in hydraulic conductivity change and sand
   distribution for certain type of rocks, especially at the higher
   variogram fractal dimensions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Alkali metals are strong electron donors and can form electron
   donor-acceptor ion pairs with multinuclear aromatics. Single electron
   donation converts the aromatic into a radial ion, and two electron
   donations convert the aromatic into a dianion. The anionic aromatic
   species are more susceptible to reductive addition reactions, such as
   hydrogen transfer from more hydrogen-rich molecules, such as employed in
   Birch reduction. The conversion of heavy oils in the presence of alkali
   metals is claimed to be capable of bulk desulfurization with little
   hydrogen consumption. In this work, the conversion of oilsands bitumen
   asphaltenes with sodium was investigated over the temperature range of
   60-250 degrees C under an inert atmosphere to limit the contribution of
   thermal conversion. Control experiments conducted with asphaltenes
   without sodium revealed that the asphaltenes were reactive on their own,
   and the nature of products was affected by the phase behavior of the
   asphaltenes that gradually changed from a solid to liquid between 124
   and 142 degrees C. When fluidity was limited, intermolecular hydrogen
   transfer was restricted; intramolecular hydrogen disproportionation and
   ``in cage{''} intermolecular reactions resulted in the formation of more
   condensed and potentially more aromatic products. Sodium markedly
   affected the natural hydrogen transfer and disproportionation.
   Conversion of the asphaltenes with sodium did not result in an increased
   maltene yield, but the maltenes had a higher hydrogen/carbon ratio, less
   sulfur, and less nitrogen. Model compound reactions were employed to
   study the influence of the reaction atmosphere (N-2 or H-2) and hydrogen
   donor properties of the organic matrix. In the presence of H-2, the
   formation and reaction of NaH appeared to influence selectivity and the
   reaction network. In the absence of H-2, desulfurization of thiophenic
   compounds by sodium proceeded by hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation
   pathways, with the hydrogenolysis pathway being favored by the lack of
   hydrogen donor molecules. It was also found that hydrogenolysis of the
   carbon-carbon bond in the thiophenic ring of dibenzothiophene is
   reversible.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing generation of mature fine tailings (MFT) or fluid fine
   tailings (FFT) from surface mining activities of the oil sands industry
   in Canada has been a contentious issue for many years. In the absence of
   large-scale processing facilities, many far-reaching consequences from
   extensive stockpiling of FFT will plague the industry for many years to
   come. Application of polymeric flocculants to treating FFT for efficient
   solid water separation has been well-established. However, most
   commercially used flocculants carry a negative charge and yield
   incomplete capture of suspended fine solids and hence relatively turbid
   recycle water. This inefficient flocculation of fine solids limits the
   effort of process water recycling and severely strains most downstream
   dewatering processes, such as filtration. Cationic flocculants offer a
   promising alternative in terms of overall solids capture and recycle
   water quality, although the associated high cost hindered much of its
   commercial applications. In this work, we introduce a method to deploy a
   commercial cationic flocculant (Zetag 8110). Heating and increasing pH
   of the flocculant solution in oil sands process water led to more
   effective fines flocculation and a supernatant of <200 nephelometric
   turbidity units (NTU), at similar to 75\% less dosage than the direct
   use of Zetag solution without any form of preconditioning. The insights
   gained from this study can lead to a better flocculant design,
   utilization, and process economics for FFT treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Several factors influencing the stability of asphaltene- and
   bitumen-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions were investigated including
   salt type, salt concentration, pH, interfacial film properties, surface
   coverage, drop size, and emulsion packing. Emulsions were prepared from
   bitumens (and their asphaltenes) from an oil sands mining process, a
   cyclic steam process, and a steam-assisted gravity drainage process. The
   aqueous phases consisted of reverse-osmosis water and salts (NaCl,
   CaCl2, Na2SO4, KCl, and Na2CO3), and the organic phases consisted of 10
   g/L asphaltenes (extracted with n-heptane) or crude oil bitumen
   dissolved in heptane toluene solutions. The stability of the emulsions
   was assessed in terms of the percentage of water resolved after repeated
   treatment cycles involving heating at 60 degrees C and centrifugation at
   3500 rpm. The bitumen water systems had similar behavior to the
   asphaltene-water systems, suggesting that the emulsion stabilizers come
   primarily from the asphaltenes. Irreversibly adsorbed interfacial films
   were formed in all cases, a condition necessary for mechanical
   stabilization. Salt contents as low as 0.02 wt \% were found to
   significantly increase the stability of the emulsions. The increase in
   stability correlated with an increase in the mass and apparent molecular
   weight of asphaltenes adsorbed at the interface. A mass surface coverage
   of 5 mg/m(2) and an apparent molecular weight of 7000 g/mol appear to be
   the threshold required for stable emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major challenges in petroleum production is the formation of
   undesirable emulsions, which often leads to an increased cost for
   downstream operations. This problem is exacerbated for bitumen, which
   contains a greater fraction of interfacially active materials known to
   stabilize small emulsified water droplets that are extremely difficult
   to separate. To accelerate separation of emulsified water droplets from
   bitumen, chemical demulsifiers are extensively used to modify
   interfacial properties, promote droplet flocculation, and facilitate
   coalescence of the emulsified droplets. However, the use of chemical
   demulsifiers is rather system-specific as a result of the overdosing
   phenomenon. As an alternative to chemical demulsification, composite
   absorbent particles, prepared by dehydrating well-designed water-in-oil
   emulsion droplets, were proposed to promote dewatering of
   water-in-diluted bitumen emulsions. The composite particles were
   composed of nanosize magnetic particles dispersed in an absorbent matrix
   coated with an interfacially active material. The composite structure
   combines the absorptive capacity of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose for
   water with the interfacial activity of ethylcellulose while retaining
   the magnetic responsiveness of dispersed Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Using
   composite absorbent particles, nearly complete dewatering of water-in
   diluted bitumen emulsions was achieved by increasing the dosage of
   absorbent particles. The dewatering rate was improved using smaller
   particles of greater specific surface area or increasing mixing
   intensity to promote contact between absorbent particles and emulsified
   water droplets. Although the surface of composite absorbent particles
   was initially suitable for dispersing in non aqueous media, the
   subsequent change in wettability upon absorption of water (hydration)
   caused hydrated absorbent particles to aggregate, providing an
   opportunity for regeneration/reuse of hydrated particles by first
   separation particles from diluted bitumen through gravity separation or
   a filtration process.}},

Abstract = {{A major waste byproduct of oil sands in situ extraction is oil sands
   tailings, which are a mixture of water, clay, and residual bitumen.
   These tailings represent a huge ecological footprint in the form of
   tailings ponds, which not only render large land areas unusable but also
   prevent reuse of water. The slow dewatering of the tailings ponds poses
   a major challenge to the industry. The presence of complex
   inorganic-organic bitumen-clay mixtures in these tailings contributes to
   this problem. Hence, understanding the nature of the bitumen-clay
   association and the effect of bitumen on clay particle particle
   interactions is important for the development of more effective
   chemicals or processes to accelerate particle aggregation and
   sedimentation during dewatering. Previous studies that investigate these
   interactions used techniques that are sensitive only toward inorganic
   clay but not sensitive towards organic bitumen. Here, we use a
   high-resolution total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy
   to help identify the accurate location and distribution of bitumen in
   mature fine tailings (MFT) samples. We report the first adaptation of
   TIRF beyond cell biology for visualization of bitumen and its
   interaction with clay. The high signal-to-noise ratio of TIRF microscopy
   and a high contrast between the clay and residual bitumen provide images
   that reveal a wealth of information about the bitumen coverage on clay
   as well as clay-clay aggregates and how the bitumen positions itself
   within these aggregates. These images confirm the presence of
   hydrophobic fine clay agglomerates along with the hydrophilic clay
   particles in MFT. It is also observed that bitumen coats clay particles,
   bridges clay agglomerates, and is mostly absent as free bitumen in the
   bulk of the MFT sample. Our work paves the way for the use of
   nanophotonic tools in oil sands imaging and provides strategic
   suggestions for the development of better methods for clay sedimentation
   and bitumen recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Clays, due to their specific surface area and electrical charge density,
   are among the most active minerals in aquifers, oil and gas reservoirs,
   and tailings ponds. Important problems, such as limited yield of oil
   recovery during petroleum exploration, involve the interaction of
   process fluids with minerals which constitute reservoir pore walls.
   During mine tailings treatment and management, water chemistry impacts
   the aggregation and settling of clays. Solution calorimetry is a
   sensitive probe for species transfer to and from clay surfaces, and for
   the measurement of the effects of water chemistry (temperature, pH,
   salinity) on clay particle surfaces, in this case, kaolinite, illite,
   and montmorillonite. In this work, we show that interactions between
   clays and surrounding water are temperature-independent for all three
   clay types and that water chemistry has no measurable effect on the
   surface properties of illite. For kaolinite, water pH does impact
   surface properties and has a synergistic impact with salinity at high
   pH. The surface properties of montmorillonite are sensitive to water pH
   and salinity. These data and observations extend a solution enthalpy
   modeling framework for clays and contaminated clays in water and liquid
   hydrocarbons. In the next phases of this work, entropic effects will be
   addressed so that a quantitative Gibbs free energy modeling framework
   for the enthalpy of solution of clays can be constructed and linked to
   clay settlement kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{Oil sands in the Athabasca and Cold Lake regions of Northern Alberta
   form Canada's primary source of energy reserves. Asphaltenes, a
   significant part of bitumen, are often considered to be the least
   valuable component of crude oil due to various factors such as
   difficulty in transporting and processing. Very few studies have been
   carried out on the pyrolysis of asphaltenes in entrained flow
   conditions. Single particle investigations are useful since they are
   conducted in a well-controlled environment allowing for the elimination
   of complexities arising from particle particle interactions. Char is an
   intermediate of the gasification process, and the structural and
   morphological behavior of char plays a pivotal role in determining the
   rate of gasification. In this work, the pyrolysis of pulverized
   asphaltene feedstock was carried out in a tube furnace maintained at
   atmospheric pressure. The effects of furnace temperature and particle
   size on char formation and char characteristics were investigated. Chars
   obtained from larger particles (1.7 mm to 850 mu m) exhibited morphology
   similar to that of asphaltene particles while the pyrolysis of particles
   ranging from 250 to 425 mu m at higher temperatures resulted in char
   with less volatile matter remaining. Scanning electron microscope (SEM)
   and cross-sectional images of char particles indicated the formation of
   cenospheres and the fragmentation of char particles at higher pyrolysis
   temperatures. High pyrolysis temperatures also led to a loss of active
   sites, an increase in alkene content, and aromatic condensation.
   Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and X-ray
   fluorescence (XRF) investigations validated the retention of K and Na
   along with heavy elements such as V, Ni, and Cu in char at temperatures
   above 700 degrees C. Ultimately, the combustion reactivities of char
   were obtained at 700, 800, and 900 degrees C for particles of 425-850,
   355-425, and 250-355 mu m, respectively, and were compared using the
   Flynn Wall Ozawa method.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an interface crack whose crack faces are coated with a thin
   reinforcing film of separate elastic material. We obtain asymptotic
   solutions, which, in the case of plane elasticity, demonstrate that the
   addition of the thin film effectively eliminates the well-known
   oscillatory behavior of the displacement and stress fields in the
   vicinity of the crack tip leading to a strong square-root stress
   singularity. In the case of anti-plane elasticity, the effect of the
   reinforcement is to reduce the order of the stress singularity at the
   crack tip. In addition, we demonstrate that the reinforcement induces a
   displacement field which is smooth locally and bounded at the crack tip.}},

Title = {{Time-dependent interfacial sliding in nano-fibrous composites under

Abstract = {{We use complex variable methods to analyze time-dependent deformations
   of an isolated elastic nano fiber embedded in an infinite elastic matrix
   under longitudinal shear subjected to uniform stress at infinity. In
   order to incorporate nanoscale size-effects into our continuum-based
   model, the nano fiber and the matrix are each endowed with separate and
   distinct surface elasticities described by the Gurtin-Murdoch model. The
   fiber/matrix interface is allowed to slide via a diffusion-controlled
   mechanism. We show that the characteristic relaxation time and
   time-dependent stress distribution in the composite can be described
   completely by three size-dependent parameters and a size-independent
   mismatch parameter. Further, we note that the internal stress field is
   spatially uniform yet size- and time-dependent. Finally, we obtain the
   effective anelastic and size-dependent shear modulus of the fibrous
   composite using the mean-field method of Mod-Tanaka. (C) 2016 Elsevier
