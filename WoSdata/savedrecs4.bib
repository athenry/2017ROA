Abstract = {{Composite endpoints are commonly used in cardiovascular clinical trials.
   When using a composite endpoint a subject is considered to have an event
   when the first component endpoint has occurred. The use of composite
   endpoints offers the ability to incorporate several clinically important
   endpoint events thereby augmenting the event rate and increasing
   statistical power for a given sample size. One assumption of the
   composite is that all component events are of equal clinical importance.
   This assumption is rarely achieved given the diversity of component
   endpoints included. One means of adjusting for this diversity is to
   adjust the outcomes using severity weights determined a priori. The use
   of a weighted endpoint also allows for the incorporation of multiple
   endpoints per patient. Although weighting the outcomes lowers the
   effective number of events, it offers additional information that
   reduces the variance of the estimate. We created a series of simulation
   studies to examine the effect on power as the individual components of a
   typical composite were changed. In one study, we noted that the weighted
   composite was able to offer discriminative power when the component
   outcomes were altered, while the traditional method was not. In the
   other study, we noted that the weighted composite offered a similar
   level of power to the traditional composite when the change was driven
   by the more severe endpoints.}},

Abstract = {{The unsaturated permeability function is an important soil property
   function used in the numerical modeling of saturated-unsaturated soil
   systems. The permeability function is generally predicted by integrating
   along the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) starting at saturated
   soil conditions. The integration is based on a particular integral
   formula. The Fredlund-Xing-Huang permeability function is a flexible
   integration technique used for calculating the unsaturated permeability
   function. The original permeability theory published by Fredlund, Xing,
   and Huang in 1994 specified that the air-entry value (AEV), psi(aev), be
   used as the lower limit of the integration when calculating the
   permeability function. However, as there was no analytical procedure
   available for the calculation of the AEV on the SWCC, it became common
   practice to start the integration procedure from a value near zero. The
   assumption was made that the error associated with starting the
   integration from an arbitrary low value was minimal. While this might be
   the case in some situations, the error can be quite substantial in other
   situations. This paper undertakes a study of the effect of the lower
   limit of integration on the calculation of the permeability function.
   Comparisons are made between starting the integration from various
   values below the AEV and starting the integration from the calculated
   AEV, psi(aev). A mathematical algorithm is also proposed for the
   calculation of the AEV for integration purposes. The results show that
   the relative coefficient of permeability can be significantly
   underestimated when the lower limit of integration is smaller than the
   AEV. The recommendation is that the AEV always be used as the lower
   limit of integration in the Fredlund-Xing-Huang permeability equation.}},

Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A series of 27 experiments were carried out at three different
   turbulence intensities in the frazil ice production tank at the
   University of Alberta. The frazil particles produced were photographed
   in suspension throughout the duration of the supercooling process using
   a high-resolution digital camera. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV)
   was used to record vertical profiles of the velocities at three
   locations in the tank, and the velocity time series data were processed
   to determine the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy per
   unit mass. A computer algorithm was written to process the captured
   images to determine the particle sizes and compute the properties of the
   partide size distribution. The resulting data were used to study the
   evolution of the size distribution throughout the supercooling process.
   It was found that the number of individual particles in suspension
   peaked shortly after the maximum degree of supercooling had been
   reached, and at approximately the same time the mean and standard
   deviation of the particle diameter approached constant values. The
   overall mean particle diameter prior to the onset of particle
   flocculation was found to decrease with increasing values of the
   dissipation rate, and ranged from 0.94 to 0.66 mm for dissipation rates
   of 24 to 336 cm(2)/s(3). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The one-class classification problem is a well-known research endeavor
   in pattern recognition. The problem is also known under different names,
   such as outlier and novelty/anomaly detection. The core of the problem
   consists in modeling and recognizing patterns belonging only to a
   so-called target class. All other patterns are termed nontarget, and
   therefore, they should be recognized as such. In this paper, we propose
   a novel one-class classification system that is based on an interplay of
   different techniques. Primarily, we follow a dissimilarity
   representation-based approach; we embed the input data into the
   dissimilarity space (DS) by means of an appropriate parametric
   dissimilarity measure. This step allows us to process virtually any type
   of data. The dissimilarity vectors are then represented by weighted
   Euclidean graphs, which we use to determine the entropy of the data
   distribution in the DS and at the same time to derive effective decision
   regions that are modeled as clusters of vertices. Since the
   dissimilarity measure for the input data is parametric, we optimize its
   parameters by means of a global optimization scheme, which considers
   both mesoscopic and structural characteristics of the data represented
   through the graphs. The proposed one-class classifier is designed to
   provide both hard (Boolean) and soft decisions about the recognition of
   test patterns, allowing an accurate description of the classification
   process. We evaluate the performance of the system on different
   benchmarking data sets, containing either feature-based or structured
   patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed technique.}},

Title = {{Risk of Exceeding Extreme Design Storm Events under Possible Impact of
   Climate Change}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Given the risk of intensive storms (the probability of exceeding certain
   storm intensity one or more times within the project life) of central
   Alberta is expected to change in the future, a new risk chart is
   proposed which represents the nonlinear relationship between storm
   intensity, design project life, and the risk of intensive storms being
   exceeded within the project life. First, a comparison between estimated
   risk charts of the past (1914-1995) and the present (1984-2010) for
   central Alberta shows that the risk of intensive storms occurring has
   increased for all storm durations in recent years, and the risk had been
   higher for storms of large return periods (>= 50 year). Given a design
   project life of 50 years, the average increase in risk is 9\%. Second,
   the uncertainty associated with projecting the risk of intensive storms
   occurring in 2011-2100 was assessed by considering three special reports
   on emissions scenarios (SRESs) of four global climate models (GCMs)
   dynamically downscaled by a regional climate model (RCM), i.e., MM5.
   Based on storms simulated by MM5 for central Alberta forced by SRES
   climate scenarios of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
   for 2011-2100, the median risk for short-duration storms (<= 1 h) of a
   design project life of 25 and 50 years is projected to increase up to 37
   and 38\%, respectively. In other words, climate change impact could
   increase the vulnerability of central Alberta to the hazards of flooding
   by intensive storms in future. The proposed risk chart presents the risk
   in a straightforward and meaningful way which will be useful for the
   long-term planning and engineering design of municipal infrastructure.

Abstract = {{Preventive maintenance of drainage networks is an essential component of
   urban infrastructure management. Large cities require significant
   budgetary and other resources to perform the necessary prescheduled
   cleaning and flushing activities at various locations around the city at
   regular intervals. However, planning and scheduling of these activities
   can be challenging because of the wide variation of actual on-site
   flushing duration, which depends on a number of factors such as
   location, properties of the pipes, frequency of flushing, time of day,
   and season. This study develops a model for estimating the on-site
   duration of high pressure flushing (HPF), based on such predictor
   variables. The model is developed and validated using historical data
   from the City of Edmonton, where 5,500 km of network is maintained
   through more than 1,400 prescheduled preventive maintenance locations
   for HPF. The panel data set utilized in this study is obtained by
   integrating several databases, one of which is the historical data
   collected by the global positioning system (GPS) device installed in the
   flushing trucks. The framework presented here first uses ordered probit
   analysis to estimate the probability of a number of stops to flush a
   given set of pipes and then forecasts the flushing duration by means of
   a multiple regression model. This approach is applicable for similar
   municipalities and can be effectively used for resource optimization,
   maintenance scheduling, sensitivity analysis, and performance
   evaluation. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Modeling Driver Compliance to VSL and Quantifying Impacts of Compliance
   Levels and Control Strategy on Mobility and Safety}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Variable speed limits (VSL) aim to improve freeway mobility and safety
   by influencing collective behaviors of drivers. Thus, VSL benefits
   should be positively correlated with the VSL compliance level (CL).
   Surprisingly, a number of heuristic VSL control strategies have shown
   that VSL with increased CLs can, in fact, increase travel time. However,
   it has yet to be analyzed whether or not that outcome is because of the
   control strategy design or the CL. Some recent studies have shown that,
   regardless of CL, a proactive optimal VSL control provides mobility
   benefits; however, no evidence has been found to indicate which CL is
   most achievable in practice, nor has a description been found for the
   distribution of speed of a given VSL. The objective of this paper is to
   quantify the relative contribution of CLs with a proactive optimal VSL
   control toward improving mobility and safety. In this study, several
   CL-to-VSL strategies have been modeled after real-world driver behavior.
   To quantify the impact of CLs only, speed distributions are altered with
   the static speed limit. Then, the benefits are quantified by
   implementing a proactive optimal VSL control strategy with CLs. The
   simulation evaluation shows that both VSL mobility and safety benefits
   are positively correlated with increasing CLs. Specifically, the travel
   time, throughput, and collision probability are improved in the CL
   ranges of 5-15\%, 6-8\%, and 50-60\%, respectively. The study findings
   will help guide transportation agencies in deploying VSL control by
   considering CL, so as to achieve maximum mobility and safety benefits.

Title = {{A variable reduction strategy for evolutionary algorithms handling
   equality constraints}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{774-786}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Efficient constraint handling techniques are of great significance when
   Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are applied to constrained optimization
   problems (COPs). Generally, when use EAs to deal with COPs, equality
   constraints are much harder to satisfy, compared with inequality
   constraints. In this study, we propose a strategy named equality
   constraint and variable reduction strategy (ECVRS) to reduce equality
   constraints as well as variables of COPs. Since equality constraints are
   always expressed by equations, ECVRS makes use of the variable
   relationships implied in such equality constraint equations. The essence
   of ECVRS is it makes some variables of a COP considered be represented
   and calculated by some other variables, thereby shrinking the search
   space and leading to efficiency improvement for EAs. Meanwhile, ECVRS
   eliminates the involved equality constraints that providing variable
   relationships, thus improves the feasibility of obtained solutions.
   ECVRS is tested on many benchmark problems. Computational results and
   comparative studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed ECVRS. (C)

Title = {{Queue performance measures in construction simulation models containing
   subjective uncertainty}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, discrete event simulation (DES) has been widely used
   for analyzing construction projects. Recently, fuzzy discrete event
   simulation (FDES), which is an integration of fuzzy set theory with DES,
   has been proposed for simulating construction projects. FDES provides a
   framework to consider subjective uncertainty (uncertainty due to
   vagueness, subjectivity, and linguistic expression of knowledge) in
   construction simulation models. Current FDES frameworks only calculate
   simulation time (e.g., project completion time) as the simulation
   output. However, queue performance measures (e.g., average queue length
   and waiting time) though important simulation model outputs for decision
   making, finding bottlenecks, and optimizing construction resources are
   not analyzed in current FDES methodologies. Using fuzzy logic to
   consider the subjective uncertainty of service time and the
   inter-arrival time of systems' queues may improve such simulation models
   by more realistically representing their results. This paper provides a
   novel methodology to consider subjective uncertainty in analyzing the
   fuzzy queues in construction FDES models. Incorporating fuzzy queuing
   theory with FDES methodology as proposed in this paper enhances the
   applicability of FDES in construction projects. The proposed methodology
   is validated through mathematically solved queueing examples, and its
   practical aspects are illustrated using an example of an asphalt paving
   operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A hybrid simulation approach for quantitatively analyzing the impact of
   facility size on construction projects}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{39-48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sizing temporary facilities is a crucial task in construction site
   layout planning due to its significant impact on project productivity
   and cost. This paper describes a simulation-based approach for modeling
   the size of facilities that temporarily contain materials in
   construction projects. Different methods have been introduced for
   estimating the required size of this kind of facility; however, space
   limitations, particularly on congested sites, may not allow the planner
   to allocate the estimated space to the facilities. This study aims at
   quantitatively analyzing the impact of facility size on the project and
   modeling the managerial corrective actions to remedy the space shortage
   in facilities. To this end, a hybrid discrete-continuous simulation
   technique is adopted. Simulation is superior in modeling dynamic
   interactions between variables as well as modeling construction
   processes with inherent uncertainties. The combination of discrete and
   continuous simulation is used to enhance accuracy and model the project
   at both operational level (i.e., activity level with higher level of
   detail) to estimate production rate, and strategic level (i.e., macro
   level with lower level of detail) to account for some construction
   planning decisions such as material management variables. The novelty of
   this study is analyzing the impact of facility size on the project time
   and cost, while managerial actions taken to resolve space shortages are
   modeled, and interdependent influencing parameters of the different
   disciplines, such as site layout, material management, logistics, and
   construction process planning are integrated in a unified model. The
   applicability and suitability of the proposed approach is demonstrated
   in layout planning of a tunneling project site. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{106-115}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Interactions between fine subbituminous coal particles and micron size
   bubbles generated by hydrodynamic cavitation were investigated. The
   experimental results showed that increasing fluid velocity increases the
   number counts of micron size bubbles. The number counts of microns size
   bubbles were found to increase with increasing the dissolved gas
   content. At a given fluid flow velocity, reducing the dissolved gas
   content by heating the liquid for 2 h at 80 degrees C reduced the number
   counts of micron size bubbles while saturating the liquid with CO2 led
   to a significant increase in the number counts of micron size bubbles.
   However, change in fluid velocity or dissolved gas content had little
   effect on the bubble size. Introducing micron size bubbles generated by
   hydrodynamic cavitation into flotation column was found to be a
   promising method to enhance the recovery of fine coal particles. The
   micron size bubbles were found to attach to the solids with contact
   angle of 45 or larger. The micron size bubbles frosted on the solid
   surface were proven to enhance the bubble-solid attachment. These
   findings further improved our understanding of the role of hydrodynamic
   cavitation in the attachment of flotation size bubbles to gas-nucleated
   fine particles and hence in fine particle flotation. The conclusions
   derived from this study provide scientific basis for the design of
   hydrodynamic cavitation assisted flotation devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fabric-guided micro-fracturing phenomenon in brittle rocks and its
   effect on crack damage thresholds remains subject to continuing
   research. The available fabric in rocks can act as a motivator for
   nucleation and/or extension and interaction of micro-fractures in a
   preferred orientation, or as a suppressor for growth of micro-cracks in
   a given direction by different mechanisms such as compliance (stiffness
   contrast) or preferred orientation of minerals and their boundaries.
   While anisotropy of brittle rocks in terms of their mechanical strengths
   can play a significant role in the stability of underground openings,
   the understanding of the dependency of crack initiation (CI) and crack
   propagation (CD) thresholds on the available fabric in rocks can improve
   predictions of the extension and density of micro-fracturing in
   different directions in the walls of underground openings. To better
   understand the fabric-guided micro-fracturing phenomenon, and also to
   study the effect of fabric types available in brittle rocks on their
   anisotropic behaviour, four types of brittle rocks with different types
   of fabric are investigated in terms of crack damage anisotropy in this
   paper. The rocks that are chosen for this study are limestone from the
   Cobourg Formation, Queenston shale, Olkiluoto mica gneiss and Lac du
   Bonnet granite. For each rock type, CI and CD thresholds are identified
   from the unconfined compressive strength testing data. The mechanical
   behaviour of the four rock types are investigated at each damage stress
   level and the contributing factors to the isotropic or anisotropic
   behaviour of the rocks at different crack damage thresholds are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the multiple-attribute decision-making
   (MADM) problems based on traditional Maclaurin symmetric mean operator
   operating under hesitant fuzzy environment. The Maclaurin symmetric mean
   (MSM) operator is a classical mean type aggregation operator and has
   strong modeling capability in modern information fusion theory, which
   has particular advantages for aggregating multi-dimension arguments. The
   prominent characteristic of the MSM operator is that it can capture the
   interrelationship among the multi-input arguments. Motivated by the idea
   of MSM operator, we develop the hesitant fuzzy Maclaurin symmetric mean
   (HFMSM) operator for aggregating the hesitant fuzzy information. Some
   desirable properties such as monotonicity, boundedness, idempotency are
   studied. Furthermore, we have discussed some special cases with respect
   to different parameter values of the HFMSM operator in detail. For the
   situations where the input arguments have different importance, we
   further develop the weighted hesitant fuzzy Maclaurin symmetric mean
   operator to aggregate hesitant fuzzy information. Based on which, an
   approach to MADM problems with hesitant fuzzy information is developed.
   Finally, a practical example with paper quality evaluation of
   sciencepaper online in China is provided to illustrate the practicality
   and effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Delayed coking as a part of heavy oil upgrading is characterized with
   severe thermal-mechanical operating conditions. Coke drums operating
   under such conditions require proper design and material selection in
   order to sustain the high stresses caused by the thermal-mechanical
   loading. This paper has the objective to explore alternative material
   selections for coke drum applications based on material property data
   provided in ASME Boiler \& Pressure Vessel Code, Section II-Materials.
   The materials were compared based on the stress levels obtained by using
   finite element analyses (FEA) for two critical loading scenarios in the
   coke drum operation cycle, i.e., the heating up and quenching stages.
   The results show that closer matching in the coefficients of thermal
   expansion (CTE) between clad and base materials reduce significantly the
   stress in the clad during heating up stage. Among other material
   properties, the results show that the variation in Young's modulus
   values of base materials plays an important role in the variation of
   maximum stress in the coke drum shell during the bending of the shell
   caused by quenching water. Among the considered 11 pairs of clad and
   base material combinations, the combination of SA302-C as the base
   material and nickel alloy N06625 as the cladding material is recommended
   for delayed coke drum application.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Conventionally, heterogeneous object modeling methods paid limited
   attention to the concurrent modeling of geometry design and material
   composition distribution. Procedural method was normally employed to
   generate the geometry first and then determine the heterogeneous
   material distribution, which ignores the mutual influence. Additionally,
   limited capability has been established about irregular material
   composition distribution modeling with strong local discontinuities.
   This article overcomes these limitations by developing the
   computer-aided design-computer-aided engineering associative
   feature-based heterogeneous object modeling method. Level set functions
   are applied to model the geometry within computer-aided design module,
   which enables complex geometry modeling. Finite element mesh is applied
   to store the local material compositions within computer-aided
   engineering module, which allows any local discontinuities. Then, the
   associative feature concept builds the correspondence relationship
   between these modules. Additionally, the level set geometry and material
   optimization method are developed to concurrently generate the geometry
   and material information which fills the contents of the computer-aided
   design-computer-aided engineering associative feature model.
   Micro-geometry is investigated as well, instead of only the local
   material composition. A few cases are studied to prove the effectiveness
   of this new heterogeneous object modeling method.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a paradigm of fuzzy clustering is augmented by available
   domain knowledge expressed in the form of relational constraints built
   with the aid of a collection of fuzzy sets. These constraints are
   described as a collection of Cartesian products of fuzzy sets or their
   logic expressions are used to form an augmented data space and transform
   nonlinearly original data. Depending upon the nature of the constraints,
   discussed are two categories of resulting representations (clustering
   spaces), namely homogeneous spaces (in case when the transformations are
   fully expressed by means of the constraints) and heterogeneous spaces
   (when the resulting space is composed of some original variables present
   in the initially available data space and those being transformed and
   expressed by means of satisfaction levels of the constraints). The role
   of information granules of order-2 is revealed with regard to results of
   clustering produced in the transformed space. A generalization of the
   proposed approach is also discussed in case the clustered data are not
   numeric but are provided in the form of information granules; in this
   case a special attention is paid to a way in which a representation
   (description) of information granules is realized through relational
   constraints. We elaborate on the formation of the space (induced by
   constraints) and original data as well as discuss the detailed
   algorithmic developments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative cancer therapy based on RNA interference (RNAi) has shown
   considerable promise but the possibility of resistance development is
   not known. This study explored the possibility of therapeutic resistance
   against siRNA nanoparticles in human cancer cells.
   Two approaches to siRNA treatment were undertaken using lipid-modified
   polyethylenimines, a single high concentration (shock) and repeated
   increasing concentrations (gradual). The targets were Mcl-1, RPS6KA5 and
   KSP in MDA-MB-435 cells.
   There was no evidence of resistance development in shock-treated cells,
   while the decrease in mRNA levels of targeted proteins was not as robust
   in na < ve cells in gradual treatment. However, silencing efficiency was
   restored after a 7-day recovery period when expression of suppressed
   proteins returned to normal levels. Cellular uptake of siRNA was not
   affected by pre-treatments. Other mediators involved in cell survival
   and proliferation were altered in siRNA-treated cells, but only JUN
   silencing led to a heightened loss of viability. In vivo experiments
   demonstrated similar silencing efficiency at mRNA level after repeat
   doses.
   Human cancer cells responded to repeat siRNA nanoparticles in a similar
   fashion after a temporary initial alteration and little, if any,
   resistance was evident against repeated siRNA treatments.}},

   variations of processes, some of which are potentially correlated to
   quality variables and hence help improving the prediction performance of
   soft sensors. An efficient expectation maximum algorithm is proposed to
   estimate parameters of the probabilistic model, which turns out to be
   suitable for analyzing massive process data. Two criteria are also
   proposed to select quality-relevant SFs. The validity and advantages of
   the proposed method are demonstrated via two case studies. (c) 2015

Volume = {{75-76}},

Abstract = {{The energy required to fracture viscoelastic media is known to depend on
   the rate of crack propagation. In this work, crack propagation, driven
   by applied moments, in an idealized model of a viscoelastic double
   cantilever beam (DCB) is studied. Rate dependency is taken into account
   through a standard linear solid viscoelastic model for the bulk
   material, and an adhesive zone model describing bond rupture kinetics
   for the polymer chains which bridge the interface. Attractive van der
   Waals (vdW) forces are also taken into account within the adhesive zone.
   The apparent energy release rate consists of two parts: the energy to
   overcome adhesion on the interface as well as viscous dissipation in the
   bulk. The adhesive energy in rupturing polymer chains increases as crack
   propagation speed increases. Relaxation of the bulk material causes
   viscous dissipation as stored strain energy is lost. For a beam of fixed
   length this dissipation was found to be negligible at high and low rates
   of crack propagation. Between these two limits there is a critical crack
   propagation speed where viscous dissipation is maximized. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The interest in lean product development in general and the Kanban
   approach in particular has increased over the years. However,
   practitioners, in the software development field, have significant
   challenges in implementing the Kanban approach as it lacks a clear
   definition of its principles, practices, techniques and tools. This
   study aims to provide insight into the Kanban approach and its elements
   (concepts, principles, practices, techniques, and tools) that have been
   empirically reported by scholars and practitioners. This insight is
   produced by using the systematic review method to analyze the available
   literature. A total of 37 primary studies were selected from more than
   3,000 unique studies. Our findings show that the primary studies have
   considered and reported 20 different elements as part of the Kanban
   approach based upon considerations of being an agile approach or a lean
   principle; these elements have realized great benefits and improvements
   to the software development teams. These benefits along with the
   challenges have been reported in this study. Due to the variety of
   organization types, contexts, and project sizes reported in the primary
   studies, it is expected that the results in this study would help in
   establishing knowledge on what are the different elements of the Kanban
   approach as well as offering a first step towards developing guidelines
   for practitioners to help in introducing the Kanban approach to software
   development organizations.}},

Abstract = {{The nickel and vanadium content of heavy oil and bitumen affects residue
   upgrading technology selection. Processes employing heterogeneous
   catalysts cannot be selected when the metals concentration in the oil
   exceeds tens, or at most a few hundred parts per million, due to
   catalyst fouling. Demetalation of high metal content oil is desirable
   before catalytic conversion. Mild halogenation was evaluated for bulk
   demetalation of Ni and V from a tetrapyrrole macrocycle, which is found
   in porphyrins and phthalocyanines. Specifically, bromination of Ni(II)
   phthalocyanine and V(IV) oxide phthalocyanine was investigated to
   evaluate selective metal removal, i.e. demetalation without disrupting
   the tetrapyrrole macrocycle. Bromination was spectroscopically
   confirmed. Halogenation derivitized the phthalocyanine, irrespective of
   the metal, but no destruction of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle was
   observed. Ni was substantially (74 wt\%) removed after mild bromination.
   No demetalation of V was observed. The selective removal of only Ni(II)
   could be explained in terms of the combined effects of acid-based and
   metal-ligand equilibria. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A site deficient La0.2Sr0.7TiO3-delta (LSTA) and a highly proton
   conductive electrolyte BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2O3-delta (BCZY) are synthesized
   by using solid state reaction method. The performance of the

   cu//BCZY//(La0.60Sr0.40)(0.95)Co0.20Fe0.80O3-delta (LSCF)+ BCZY, is
   fabricated and investigated. LSTA shows remarkably high electrical
   performance, with a conductivity as high as 27.78 Scm(-1) at 1150
   degrees C in a 10\% H-2/N-2 reducing atmosphere. As a main anode
   component, it shows good catalytic activity towards the oxidation of
   ethane, causing the power density to considerably increase from 158.4 mW
   cm(-2) to 320.9 mW cm(-2) and the ethane conversion to significantly
   rise from 12.6\% to 30.9\%, when the temperature increases from 650
   degrees C to 750 degrees C. These changes agree well with the
   polarization resistance which dramatically decreases from 0.346 Omega
   cm(2) to 0.112 Omega cm(2). EDX measurement shows that no element
   diffusion exists (chemical compatibility) between anode (LSTA +
   Cr2O3+Cu) and electrolyte (BCZY). With these properties, the pure phase
   LSTA is evaluated as a high electro-catalytic activity anode material
   for ethane proton conducting solid oxide fuel cell (PCSOFC). (C) 2015

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Bitumen-air bubble attachment is an essential element for bitumen
   recovery from oil sands by flotation. Effect of solvent addition to
   bitumen on bitumen-air bubble attachment in an industrial process water
   was investigated by determining the minimum time required to achieve the
   bitumen-air bubble attachment, known as induction time. Proper addition
   of solvent to bitumen significantly reduced the induction time of
   bitumen-air bubble attachment, more so for naphtha than for toluene and
   reaching optimal at 10 wt\% solvent added to bitumen. The measurement of
   bubble coalescence time and total organic carbon content in the
   resulting process water revealed a critical role in bitumen-air bubble
   attachment of air bubble interfacial properties controlled primarily by
   surfactants in the process water and water chemistry. Increasing the
   solvent addition to bitumen led to an increased migration of natural
   surfactants to the bitumen-water interface. At a given solvent dosage,
   more surfactants adsorbed at toluene-diluted bitumen-water interface
   than at naphtha-diluted bitumen-water interface. Interestingly, zeta
   potentials of diluted bitumen droplets in the process water exhibited a
   maximum at about 10 wt\% of solvent addition to bitumen for both toluene
   and naphtha. At an identical dosage of solvent, toluene-diluted bitumen
   in the tailings water possesses a more negative zeta potential than
   naphtha-diluted bitumen. Finally, a possible adsorption mechanism of
   ions and surfactants accumulating at the diluted bitumen-water interface
   under the impact of solvent addition is proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Biological fixation of CO2 using microalgae is an effective carbon

   mathematical model that describes the kinetics of algal growth and CO2,
   phosphate, nitrate and ammonium uptake rate of Chlorella kessleri
   cultivated in oil sands process water (OSPW). The model considers the
   uncoupling between nutrients uptake and growth and the possibility of
   luxurious uptake of nutrients. This nonlinear dynamic model was used to
   determine the optimal CO2 concentration, phosphate concentration and
   light intensity for CO2 uptake and algal growth over a period of time in
   a batch culture using a multi-objective optimization technique to
   maximize CO2 fixation and algal growth simultaneously. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Today, conventional power systems are evolving to modern smart grids,
   where interconnected microgrids may dominate the distribution system
   with high penetration of renewable energy and energy storage systems.
   The hybrid ac/dc systems with dc and ac sources/loads are considered to

   structures. For such hybrid ac/dcmicrogrids, power management strategies
   are one of the most critical operation aspects. This paper presents an
   overview of power management strategies for a hybrid ac/dc microgrid
   system, which includes different system structures (ac-coupled,
   dc-coupled, and ac-dc-coupled hybrid microgrids), different operation
   modes, a thorough study of various power management and control schemes
   in both steady state and transient conditions, and examples of power
   management and control strategies. Finally, discussion and
   recommendations of power management strategies for the further research
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) district-scale geoscience information for the
   Luanchuan Mo district was integrated for understanding the development
   of its regional geology and ore-forming processes and for
   decision-making about potential targets for mineral exploration. The
   methodology and datasets used were: (1) construction of an initial
   geological model (25 km x 20 km x 2.5 km) using 1:10,000 scale
   geological map, nine geological cross-sections and gravity and magnetic
   data; (2) construction of three large-scale Mo deposits model (5 km x 4
   km x 2.5 km) using 1:2000 scale geological and topographic maps, 288
   boreholes (total core length of 158,700 m), and 32 1:2000 scale
   cross-sections; (3) 3D inversion of 1:25,000 scale gravity and magnetic
   data for identification metallogenic anomaly zones which are associated
   with Jurassic intrusions; (4) extraction of ore-controlling formation
   and sequence of the Luanchuan Group using the large-scale 3D models of
   Mo deposits and results of analysis of lithogeochemical samples from
   outcrops and borehole cores; (5) identification of ore-forming and
   ore-controlling faults using the large-scale 3D model of Mo deposits and
   mineralized Jurassic granite porphyry stocks; (6) boost
   weights-of-evidence and concentration-volume (C-V) fractal analyses to
   integrate metallogenic information and to identify and classify
   potential Mo targets. Four classes of exploration targets were
   identified using C-V modeling and 3D known orebodies model: the first
   and second class targets are mainly located in three large magma-skam
   type deposit camps, occupying similar to 1.4 km(3) with total estimated
   reserve of similar to 2.3 Mt; the third class targets, which are mainly
   located in Huangbeiling and Yuku deposit camps comprising concealed
   magma-skarn type deposits, occupy similar to 2.8 km(3) and represent a
   new target exploration zone in the Luanchuan district; the fourth class
   targets, which are located in the Huoshenmiao, Majuan, and Daping zones,
   occupy similar to 15 km(3) and represent potential mineral resources
   with likely similar orebody features as the Yuku deposit. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Quantitative appraisal of different operating areas and assessment of
   uncertainty due to reservoir heterogeneities are crucial elements in
   optimization of production and development strategies in oil sands
   operations. Although detailed compositional simulators are available for
   recovery performance evaluation for steam-assisted gravity drainage
   (SAGD), the simulation process is usually deterministic and
   computationally demanding, and it is not quite practical for real-time
   decision-making and forecasting. Data mining and machine learning
   algorithms provide efficient modeling alternatives, particularly when
   the underlying physical relationships between system variables are
   highly complex, non-linear, and possibly uncertain.
   In this study, a comprehensive training set encompassing SAGD field data
   compiled from numerous publicly available sources is analyzed.
   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out to interpret and extract
   relevant attributes describing characteristics associated with reservoir
   heterogeneities and operating constraints. An extensive dataset
   consisting of over 70 records is assembled. Because of their ease of
   implementation and computational efficiency, knowledge-based techniques
   including artificial neural network (ANN) are employed to facilitate
   SAGD production performance prediction. The principal components
   analysis (PCA) technique is implemented to reduce the dimensionality of
   the input vector, alleviate the effects of over-fitting, and improve
   forecast quality. Statistical analysis is performed to analyze the
   uncertainties related to ANN model parameters and dataset Predictions
   from the proposed approaches are both successful and reliable. It is
   demonstrated that model predictability is highly influenced by model
   parameter uncertainty. This work illustrates that data-driven models are
   capable of predicting SAGD recovery performance from log-derived and
   operational variables. The modeling approach can be updated when new
   information becomes available. The analysis presents an important
   potential to be integrated directly into existing reservoir management
   and decision-making routines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Evolvable Hardware (EHW) is hardware that can dynamically change its
   behavior and architecture by interacting with its environment. EHW can
   make use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to optimally synthesize

   implemented in a conventional genetic algorithm technique to
   automatically realize a digital 8 bit full adder (FA). The main
   achievement of this work is the comparison between those techniques in
   terms of number of iterations required to converge on the required
   logical structure. Results demonstrate that the sequential mutation
   method (SMM) and circular gene method (CGM) reduce the convergence time,
   and a substantial reduction is observed when these methods are combined
   with the Adaptive Group Mutation (AGM) method for the full adder
   implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{240-253}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Clustering has been applied to numerous areas, including signal and
   image processing. Many approaches have been developed over the years to
   efficiently construct granular models on a basis of numerical
   experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach to
   construct a granular model that is fundamentally designed around
   information granules regarded as hyperboxes. Several studies have been
   focused on building a set of hyperboxes around data; one of them being a
   Min-Max Neural Network (NN) algorithm. Here we develop two different
   methods to construct these information granules, nevertheless some
   essential similarities to previous studies can be found. In particular,
   hyperboxes are constructed by using some reference data, and they are
   endowed with some parametric flexibility to facilitate controlling their
   size, whereas the construction of the hyperboxes involve elimination or
   reduction of possible overlaps between them. In the proposed approach,
   given a set of input and output data pairs, we construct interval-based
   information granules to partition the output space (viz, the space of
   the output variable). On a basis of these intervals, we carry out a
   so-called context-based Fuzzy C-Means algorithm to construct cluster
   centers (prototypes) in the multivariable input space. These prototypes
   serve as hyperbox cores. To construct the information granules, two
   methods are studied: one develops a family of hyperboxes by realizing
   some constrictions, while the other one engages Differential Evolution
   (DE) to realize further optimization. To reduce overlap, two methods are
   tested: one being previously proposed for the min-max NN and a new one,
   which engages DE to optimize the overlap reduction. Experimental studies
   involve synthetic data and publicly available real-world data. The
   results are compared with the outcomes produced by the algorithm
   proposed by Simpson. The performance of the method is quantified and it
   is demonstrated that the obtained results are substantially better when
   dealing with multi-dimensional data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Petrologic analysis of the lunar surface is critical for determining
   lunar formation and evolution. Here, we report the first global
   petrologic map that includes the five most important lunar lithological
   units: the Ferroan Anorthositic (FAN) Unit, the Magnesian Suite (MS)
   Unit, the Alkali Suite (AS) Unit, the KREEP Basalt (KB) Unit and the
   Mare Basalt (MB) Unit. Based on the petrologic map and focusing on four
   long-debated and important issues related to lunar formation and
   evolution, we draw the following conclusions from the new insights into
   the global distribution of the five petrologic units: (1) there may be
   no petrogenetic relationship between MS rocks and KB; (2) there may be
   no petrogenetic link between MS and AS rocks; (3) the exposure of the
   KREEP component on the lunar surface is likely not a result of MB
   volcanism but is instead mainly associated with the combined action of
   plutonic intrusion, KREEP volcanism and celestial collision; (4) the
   impact size of the South Pole-Aitken basin is constrained, i.e., the
   basin has been excavated through the whole crust to exhume a vast
   majority of lower-crustal material and a very limited mantle components

Abstract = {{Post-operative complications can be attributed to technical aspects of
   surgery, yet no studies have investigated the mechanics behind commonly
   used incisions for total laryngopharyngectomies This procedure, seen in
   head and neck cancer patients, necessitates free tissue transfer to
   construct a neo-pharynx, creating an inherently greater risk of
   complications. We sought to investigate the impact of neck incision
   location on these post-operative complications for TLP using finite
   element analysis (FEA). A nonlinear hyperelastic 2-D finite element
   model was used to evaluate the stress and strain along the incision line
   of two separate neck incision models commonly used for UP: low-neck
   apron (LNA) incisions that incorporate the patient's tracheostoma and
   mid-neck apron (MNA) incisions that do not communicate with the
   tracheostoma. A constant displacement was applied to the incision to
   simulate normal neck extension experienced during the post-operative
   phase. Each neck incision was also modeled at varying strain energy
   densities to simulate various stages of wound healing. For a constant
   displacement of 40 mm, the principal von Mises stress of the LNA
   incision varied between 5.87 and 6.41 MPa, depending on the hyperelastic
   properties of the healing incision. This stress was concentrated at the
   junction of the incision and the fixed tracheostomal edge. The MNA model
   demonstrated a principal von Mises stress that varied between 0.558 and
   0.711 MPa and was concentrated along the midline of the neck incision.
   MNA incisions for U patients result in principal von Mises stresses
   which are up to 11 times lower than those seen in LNA incisions. These
   results coincided with clinical observations from a concurrent study
   that showed a decrease in rate of wound dehiscence for patients
   undergoing Tu, with an MNA incision. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},

Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{One of the most replicated findings has been that hippocampus volume is
   decreased in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent
   volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that
   localized differences in hippocampal volume may be more prominent than
   global differences. Preclinical and postmortem studies in MDD indicated
   that different subfields of the hippocampus may respond differently to
   stress and may also have differential levels of plasticity in response
   to antidepressant treatment. Advances in high-field MRI allowed
   researchers to visualize and measure hippocampal subfield volumes in MDD
   patients in vivo. The results of these studies provide the first in vivo
   evidence that hippocampal volume reductions in MDD are specific to the
   cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus hippocampal subfields, findings that
   appear, on the surface, consistent with preclinical evidence for
   localized mechanisms of hippocampal neuroplasticity. In this review we
   discuss how recent advances in neuroimaging allow researchers to further
   understand hippocampal neuroplasticity in MDD and how it is related to
   antidepressant treatment, memory function, and disease progression.

Abstract = {{This paper considers parameter estimation for linear parameter varying
   (LPV) systems with randomly missing output data. The multi-model LPV
   model is adopted and the identification problem is formulated under the
   scheme of the generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm. In
   order to deal with the missing output data, the local models are firstly
   taken to have the finite impulse response (FIR) model structure. To
   alleviate potential overparameterization problem, a prior on FIR model
   coefficients is imposed and the GEM algorithm is modified to derive the
   maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates of the multi-mode LPV FIR model
   parameters. Since the FIR model is not suitable for general control
   applications, a multi-mode LPV output error (OE) model is then
   identified by applying the GEM algorithm to the same identification data
   set with parameters initialized based on the estimated FIR models. One
   simulation example and two experiments are presented to demonstrate the
   efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Two integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) reactors were operated
   continuously to treat raw (untreated) and ozonated (30 mg/L) oil sands
   process-affected water (OSPW). After 11 months, 12.1\% of the acid
   extractable fraction (AEF) and 43.1\% of the parent naphthenic acids
   (NAs) were removed in the raw OSPW IFAS, while 42.0\% AEF and 80.2\% of
   parent NM were removed in the ozonated OSPW IFAS. UPLC/HRMS analysis
   showed that NA biodegradation significantly decreased as the NA
   cyclization number increased. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)
   results showed that the biofilm in the ozonated OSPW IFAS was
   significantly thicker (94 +/- 1.6 mu m) than the biofilm in the raw OSPW
   IFAS (72 +/- 2.8 mu m) after 283 days of cultivation. The quantitative
   polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) revealed that the abundance
   proportions of both nitrifier genes (AomA, NSR and Nitro) and
   denitrifier genes (narG, nirS, nirK and nosZ) within total bacteria were
   significantly higher in biofilms than in flocs in the raw OSPW IFAS

Abstract = {{This paper discusses performance limits of the segmented compressive
   sampling (CS) system that collects correlated measurements. It is shown
   that the effect of correlation among measurements for the segmented CS
   can be characterized by a penalty term in the corresponding bounds on
   the measurement rate. Moreover, this penalty term is vanishing as the
   signal dimension increases. It means that the performance degradation
   due to the fixed correlation among measurements obtained by the
   segmented CS (as compared to the standard CS with equivalent size
   measurement matrix) is negligible for a high-dimensional signal. In
   combination with the fact that the signal reconstruction quality
   improves with additional measurements obtained by the segmented CS (as
   compared to the standard CS without additional measurements), the fact
   that the additional correlated measurements also provide new information
   about a signal is a strong argument for the segmented CS.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{1149-1159}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the thermal instability of rectangular delaminated
   composite plates. A solution procedure is presented based on the
   third-order shear deformation theory by taking into consideration the
   von Karman geometrical nonlinearity. The proposed model is capable of
   analyzing both local buckling of the delaminated base laminate and
   sublaminate as well as the global buckling of the plate. The
   thermomechanical properties are temperature-dependent. The nonlinear
   equilibrium equations, derived by the minimum total potential energy
   principle, are solved by using the Ritz method along with the
   Newton-Raphson iterative procedure. Numerical results shed a light on
   the effects of embedded delamination, stacking sequences, and boundary
   conditions on the equilibrium path, thermal bifurcation points, buckling
   mode, in-plane displacement, normal/shear strain, and bending moment of
   the composite plates. It is found that the delamination leads to a
   substantial reduction in the thermal load-carrying capacity.
   Furthermore, depending on the boundary conditions and stacking sequence,
   the response of the perfect composite plates could be either of the
   bifurcation type or of the unique stable path. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Engine manufacturers have focused on natural gas spark ignition engines

   studies the structure of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) jet which is
   directly injected into an optical constant volume chamber for different
   pressure ratios. Schlieren photography is used to visualize the jet
   development. The correlation of tip penetration for near and far field
   of the jet is presented. The second experiment investigates the
   variations of mass flow rate due to variation of injection pressure and
   pressure of chamber. The results of this method indicate that mass flow
   rate through the injector is affected by the injection pressure linearly
   while it is not influenced by the pressure of chamber. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Field scale numerical modeling of low temperature air injection with
   propane for heavy-oil recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{140-152}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The alternatives for EOR in heavy oil deep fractured reservoirs are
   limited. Air injection is one of the options but running it in the high
   temperature mode, namely in-situ combustion, has technical limitations
   (poor areal distribution of injected air) because of highly
   heterogeneous characteristics of fractured reservoirs. This may also
   create a problem from safety point of view, i.e., there is a risk that
   oxygen is not completely consumed in reservoir reaching production wells
   quickly without fully consumed. Air, however, can be used as a
   pressurizing agent to recover matrix oil in the low temperature
   oxidation mode (LTO) even though it may result in oxidation of oil that
   forms asphaltenes. Our recent lab results showed that injecting a
   mixture of air-propane instead of pure air might reduce these negative
   effects. This enhanced diffusion of air and propane into matrix may also
   add to recovery. Hence, those lab results opened the window to think of
   air injection (LTO mode) as a way to produce some of the oil left in the
   matrix in addition to its pressurizing effect.
   In the present study, a single porosity numerical simulation model, with
   explicit representation of fractures, was developed to analyze the
   injection of a mixture of gases in a naturally fractured reservoir,
   involving the use of air in the LTO mode. A sector model of a
   hypothetical fractured heavy oil reservoir was created and several
   air-gas injection cases such as pure air, propane-air-propane and
   air-propane-air cycles were analyzed. The runs were performed using the
   diffusion data obtained from our previous experimental studies.
   Different scenarios of huff-and-puff options (cycle type and duration)
   were tested. Attention was paid to oxygen consumption in the matrix,
   while fracture to matrix oxygen transfer was mainly due to voidage
   replacement of oil by air, and some through diffusion of air into matrix
   during the injection and shut off periods of each cycle.
   The results obtained considering various shut in times and injection
   rates scenarios as well as safety aspects, showed benefits in the use of
   air in the LTO mode mixed with propane. This optimized air injection
   scheme could be considered as an alternative to develop naturally
   fractured heavy oil fields. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fouling of metal heat-transfer surfaces employed in crude oil refining
   operations, driven by inorganic corrosion products, is not well
   understood. Here we employ a range of advanced analytical techniques,
   including TEM, SEM, FIB and XRD to systematically document the
   interdependent corrosion - fouling processes of three refinery
   metallurgies: a carbon steel, a (P91) 9Cr-1Mo steel, and a 347 stainless
   steel. We utilize two representative crude oil blends, testing at a
   metal surface temperature of 490 degrees C and an oil bath temperature
   of 290 degrees C. For the three metallurgies there is a mechanistic
   similarity of the fouling phenomenon, which begins with sulfidic
   corrosion of the metal surface and progresses to coking. It is observed
   that after 1 h of testing, carbon steel samples actually fouled somewhat
   less than the P91, which was initially unexpected since the latter is
   considered a more sulfidic corrosion resistant alloy. TEM and SEM
   analyses demonstrate that there is poor adhesion of the sulfide layer on
   the carbon steel, which we hypothesize results in the metal surface
   effectively self-cleaning. Despite being the most resistant to sulfidic
   corrosion and to fouling, the stainless steel nevertheless forms a thin
   Fe-Cr-Mn rich inner sulfide and a thicker Fe-rich outer sulfide. We also
   examine the role of volatiles (reactor pressure), and demonstrate that
   fouling rates drop off with successive tests on the same oil batch. This
   is attributed to a gradual exhaustion of S-containing species that react
   at high temperature to sulfide the metal surface, which in turn catalyze
   the growth of the organic coke. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Towards hybrid clustering approach to data classification: Multiple
   kernels based interval-valued Fuzzy C-Means algorithms}},
Journal = {{FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{17-39}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, kernel interval-valued Fuzzy C-Means clustering (KIFCM)
   and multiple kernel interval-valued Fuzzy C-Means clustering (MKIFCM)
   are proposed. The KIFCM algorithm is built on a basis of the kernel
   learning method and the interval-valued fuzzy sets with intent to
   overcome some drawbacks existing in the ``conventional{''} Fuzzy C-Means
   (FCM) algorithm. The development of the method is motivated by two
   factors. First, uncertainty is inherent in clustering problems due to
   some information deficiency, which might be incomplete, imprecise,
   fragmentary, not fully reliable, vague, contradictory, etc. With this
   regard, interval-valued fuzzy sets exhibit advantages when handling such
   aspects of uncertainty. Second, kernel methods form a new class of
   pattern analysis algorithms which can cope with general types of data
   and detect general types of relations (geometric properties) by
   embedding input data in a vector space based on the inner products and
   looking for linear relations in the space. However, as the clustering
   problems may involve various input features exhibiting different impacts
   on the obtained results, we introduce a new MKIFCM algorithm, which uses
   a combination of different kernels (giving rise to a concept of a
   composite kernel). The composite kernel was built by mapping each input
   feature onto individual kernel space and linearly combining these
   kernels with the optimized weights of the corresponding kernel. The
   experiments were completed for several well-known datasets, land cover
   classification from multi-spectral satellite image and Multiplex
   Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (MFISH) classification problem. The
   obtained results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms.

Title = {{A Delicate Balance When Substituting a Small Hydrophobe onto Low
   Molecular Weight Polyethylenimine to Improve Its Nucleic Acid Delivery
   Efficiency}},
Journal = {{ACS APPLIED MATERIALS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{44}},
Pages = {{24822-24832}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{High molecular weight (BMW) polyethylenimine (PEI) is one of the most
   versatile nonviral gene vectors that was extensively investigated over
   the past two decades. The cytotoxic profile of HMW PEI, however,
   encouraged a search for safer alternatives. Because of lack of
   cytotoxicity of low molecular weight (LMW) PEI, enhancing its
   performance via hydrophobic modifications has been pursued to this end.
   Since the performance of modified PEIs depends on the nature and extent
   of substituents, we systematically investigated the effect of
   hydrophobic modification of LMW (1.2 kDa) PEI with a short propionic
   acid (PrA). Moderate enhancements in PEI hydrophobicity resulted in
   enhanced cellular uptake of polyplexes and siRNA-induced silencing
   efficacy, whereas further increase in PrA substitution abolished the
   uptake as well as the silencing. We performed all-atom molecular
   dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic details behind these
   observations. A new assembly mechanism was observed by the presence of
   hydrophobic PrA moieties, where PrA migrated to core of the polyplex.
   This phenomenon caused higher surface hydrophobicity and surface charge
   density at low substitutions, and it caused deleterious effects on
   surface hydrophobicity and cationic charge at higher substitutions. It
   is evident that an optimal balance of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity is
   needed to achieve the desired polyplex properties for an efficient siRNA
   delivery, and our mechanistic findings should provide valuable insights
   for the design of improved substituents on nonviral carriers.}},

   Exchange}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{44}},
Pages = {{12120-12125}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Solvent exchange is a simple process to form oil nanodroplets at
   solid-liquid interfaces with well-defined location and morphology. In
   this process, a good solvent of the oil is displaced by a poor solvent,
   leading to the nucleation and growth of oil droplets from a transient
   oversaturation at the mixing front. Our recent work has shown that the
   final volume of the droplets is related to the flow conditions. In this
   work, we investigate the effects of the type and the composition of
   solvents on the droplet formation under the same flow conditions. Water
   nanodroplets were produced by ethanol/cyclohexane (solution A) and
   cyclohexane (solution B) on a hydrophilic substrate. We found that the
   droplet size increases first and then decreases, with an increase of the
   initial ethanol concentration in solution A. This is attributed to the
   phase separation of ethanol-cyclohexane-water; in particular, the
   composition of solution A on the phase boundary above the Ouzo region.
   The same reason also contributes to the lower efficiency in droplet
   formation for a longer alkane. The important implication from this work
   is that the maximal droplet volume is limited by the phase separation of
   the solvents used in the solvent exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Competitive cycling is a popular activity in North America for which
   injuries to the head account for the majority of hospitalizations and
   fatalities. In cycling, use of helmet accessories (e.g. cameras) has
   become widespread. As a consequence, standards organizations and the
   popular media are discussing the role these accessories could play in
   altering helmet efficacy and head injury risk. We conducted impacts to a
   helmeted anthropomorphic headform, with and without camera accessories,
   at speeds of 4 m/s and 6 m/s, and measured head accelerations, forces on
   the head-form skull, and used the Simulated Injury Monitor to estimate
   brain tissue strain. The presence of the camera reduced peak linear head
   acceleration (51\% - 4 m/s impacts, 61\% - 6 m/s, p < 0.05). Skull
   fracture risk based on kinematics was always less than 1\%. For 4 m/s
   impacts, peak angular accelerations were lower (47\%, p < 0.05), as were
   peak angular velocities (14\%) with the velocity effect approaching
   significance (p=0.06), with the camera accessory. For 6 m/s impacts,
   accelerations were on average higher (5\%, p > 0.05) as were velocities
   (77\%, p < 0.05). Skull forces were never greater than 443.2 N, well
   below forces associated with fracture. Brain tissue strain, the
   cumulative strain damage measure at 25\% (CSDM-25), was lower (56\%, p <
   0.05) in 4 m/s but higher (125\%, p > 0.05) in 6 m/s impacts with the
   camera accessory. Based on CSDM-25 for 4 m/s tests, the risk of severe
   concussion was reduced (p < 0.05) from 25\% (no camera) to 7\% (camera).
   For 6 m/s tests, risks were on average increased (p > 0.05) from 18\%
   (no camera) to 58\% (camera). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work considers the automated tuning of a two-degree-of-freedom
   model predictive controller (MPC) for single-input, single-output
   industrial processes with model uncertainties. The objective of the
   tuning algorithm is to automatically determine the MPC tuning parameters
   such that (1) the robust stability can be guaranteed, (2) the worst-case
   overshoot is controlled, (3) the oscillations in process outputs are
   attenuated, and (4) the worst-case settling time is minimized. A
   rigorous robust stability analysis is first conducted based on the
   connection between parametric uncertainties and unstructured
   uncertainties, and a tight robust stability condition is derived. As the
   specification on process output variation is not easily made by the end
   users, two alternative methods are proposed to automatically determine
   the tolerable total variation, which lead to two automatic tuning
   algorithms that achieve the tuning objectives. The proposed results are
   tested and verified through examples extracted from industrial processes
   in the pulp and paper industry, and comparisons are made with other
   existing results.}},

Abstract = {{The effective density and volatility of particulate emissions from five
   gasoline direct injection (GDI) passenger vehicles were measured using a
   tandem differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and centrifugal particle
   mass analyzer (CPMA) system. The measurements were conducted on a
   chassis dynamometer at three steady-state operating conditions. A
   thermodenuder was employed to find the volatility and mixing state of
   the particles as well as the effective density of nascent and
   non-volatile particles (defined as particle phase remaining after
   denuding at 200 degrees C). The mass-mobility exponent ranged between
   2.4 and 2.7 for nascent (or undenuded) particles and between 2.5 and 2.7
   for non-volatile particles; higher than typical diesel soot. The
   effective density function was 4278d(m)(-0.438) 76.3kg/m(3) (for
   mobility diameter, d(m), in nm) for nascent particles and
   3215d(m)(-0.395) +/- 37.9kg/m(3) for non-volatile particles. The
   effective density functions of the non-volatile particles were fairly
   similar for the conditions studied. The uncertainty in using the
   effective density and mixing state data to determine the mass
   concentration of the aerosol by integrating mobility size distributions
   was examined. The uncertainty in mass concentration is minimized when
   only the non-volatile component is measured. However, the uncertainty in
   the mass concentration increases substantially if nascent particles are
   measured due to uncertainties in the particle mixing state and their
   associated effective densities. Furthermore, transient vehicle operation
   (cold-starts, accelerations, and decelerations) would likely change the
   mixing state of the exhaust particles suggesting it is difficult to
   accurately measure the mass concentration of undenuded GDI exhaust
   particulate using integrated size distribution methods.Copyright 2015

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel approach to construct the terminal cost for
   economic model predictive control (EMPC) is developed and two EMPC
   algorithms are designed based on the terminal cost for both
   infinite-time and finite-time operations. In the proposed approach, an
   auxiliary nonlinear controller which renders the desired optimal steady
   state asymptotically stable is taken advantage of. The idea is to take
   the auxiliary nonlinear controller as a benchmark control system and to
   design EMPC algorithms that gives practically better economic
   performance than the auxiliary nonlinear controller. The terminal cost
   ensures that the two EMPC algorithms give provable (practically)
   improved economic performance than the auxiliary controller with any
   prediction horizon. This means that the proposed EMPC algorithms could
   be very computationally efficient. The proposed EMPC algorithms are
   applied to an oilsand primary separation vessel. The simulation results

Abstract = {{With the current interest in exploiting thin unconsolidated heavy-oil
   reservoirs, cold heavy-oil production with sand (CHOPS) can be
   considered to be a promising primary-recovery technique. However, it
   offers low recovery factors (approximate to 5-15\%) and creates a
   complex network of high-permeability channels known as wormholes, while
   simultaneously changing formation compressibility and in-situ stress
   conditions. Eventually, development of such a network would lead to a
   softer layer within the shallow unconsolidated reservoir, which can
   carry less of the overburden stress. Further development of such
   reservoirs is usually achieved through enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR)
   applications in the form of cyclic solvent stimulation within an
   economic framework. Cyclic loading and unloading of this EOR technique
   make it even more difficult to predict the recovery performance.
   In this study, a 3D geomechanical model was used to calculate the stress
   distribution in a history-matched field in Alberta with 15 producers.
   The fractal patterns generated from the diffusion-limited-aggregation
   (DLA) algorithm were used to represent the wormhole network with
   different strength properties. Foamy behaviour of heavy oil was modelled
   with the help of a set of kinetic reactions. The hydro-geomechanical
   model was then used for field-development planning, reservoir
   management, and assessment of near-wellbore regions during cyclic
   injection and production. The fieldwide deformation and stress changes
   were analyzed in deep overburden, caprock, and reservoir to show the
   influence of local stress orientations in soft and stiff layers.
   Next, we considered a sector model with a single well. The model
   introduced was used to assess EOR processes with different solvent
   streams. While light hydrocarbon components help to repressurize the
   formation, the heavier components seem more effective in heavy-oil
   dilution. This occurred while stress arching redistributed the cyclic
   injection/production-induced stresses to flow around soft inclusions.
   Although it is difficult to obtain data to calibrate the 3D
   hydro-geomechanical model, it allows for reliable investigation of
   reservoir performance and provides deeper insight than does the use of
   flow simulation alone. The assessment of the potential of geomechanics
   can ascertain whether a more-detailed modelling is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 30 years, laboratory testing has been conducted to
   investigate the geotechnical properties of Clearwater clay shales from

   are important for characterization of the overburden zones above in-situ

   caprock-integrity assessments include caprock geological studies,

   and numerical simulations, which allow operators to ensure that
   steam-injection pressure does not cause any risk to the confinement of
   steam chambers. The aim of this study is to identify and provide the
   representative parameters that can enhance understanding of the
   geotechnical behaviour of the Alberta Clearwater formation clay shale.
   Moreover, it illustrates how the results can be used to extract
   constitutive model parameters for modelling the behaviour of this class

Abstract = {{History matching of a steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) reservoir
   requires a large ensemble size for proper uncertainty assessment, which
   ultimately results in high computational cost. Therefore, it is
   necessary to reduce the number of realizations for SAGD-reservoir
   simulation purposes. In this paper, a novel sampling method (based on
   the probability-distance-minimization method) to generate an initial
   ensemble of reduced size is discussed. This method considers multiple
   static measurements and geological properties and uses Kantorovich
   distance to quantify the probability distance between the original
   ensemble and the reduced ensemble, which is later optimized by use of
   the mixed-integer linear-optimization (MILP) technique. To show the
   effectiveness of the method, we have shown history matching of an SAGD
   reservoir using the smaller size initial ensemble derived from the
   proposed method and compared with the original ensemble. For history
   matching, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been used because of its
   ability to assimilate data for large-scale nonlinear systems. Results
   are compared with several other methods, such as importance sampling,
   kernel K-means clustering, and sampling by use of orthogonal ensemble
   members. The robustness and usefulness of each method for generating an
   improved initial ensemble of reduced size are analyzed on the basis of
   two criteria: (1) Does the smaller ensemble retain the same statistical
   distribution characteristics as the original ensemble, and (2) does the
   smaller ensemble improve the performance of history matching? In
   general, we conclude that the improved, smaller initial ensemble created
   by use of the proposed method retains the best statistical
   characteristics of the original ensemble. Also, it provides better
   performance compared with other ranking methods in sampling and history
   matching using EnKF. Finally, the proposed method can reduce the
   computing cost significantly without compromising uncertainty in the
   forecast model, which allows for real-time updating at smaller time
   intervals.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new hydraulic-fracturing model is introduced for
   cohesionless sand, which is also applicable to weak sandstone formations
   with high permeability and low shear strength. Phenomena such as
   shear-band development and shear-enhanced permeability are of paramount
   importance during hydraulic fracturing of cohesionless sand or weak
   sandstones, which make the fracturing response quite different from what
   it is conventionally believed to be in competent rocks.
   The smeared approach in simulating hydraulic fracturing has been
   implemented in the proposed model within the continuum mechanics
   framework. Bothmatrix and fracture flow have been considered in this
   model. Tensile- and shear-fracture development and their fluid flow were
   simulated. The cubic law and Touhidi-Baghini's shear-permeability model
   (Touhidi-Baghini 1998) were used to capture the permeability evolution
   and to model flow in tensile and shear fractures, respectively. Shear
   fracturing of geomaterials involves intense localization of deformation
   and strain softening, which is a discontinuous phenomenon, resulting in
   mesh dependency of the results in the continuum model. The
   fracture-energy-regularization method was used in this model to reduce
   the mesh-size dependency of the energy dissipated during fracture
   propagation.
   The smeared-fracture approach has been validated against laboratory
   hydraulic-fracturing experiments with reasonable agreement. Consistent
   with the experiments, the results of the numerical model indicate that
   tensile fractures are formed in a very small area around the injection
   point despite the application of high injection pressure compared with
   the minimum boundary stress. It is found that shear fracturing and
   shear-permeability evolution are the most important mechanisms that
   influence and control the fracturing response. The dominant fracturing
   mechanism is found to be governed by the high permeability and low shear
   strength of the material.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing attention being paid to the development of
   unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas or tight gas reservoirs
   with nanoscale pores, over the last few years, there is a great demand
   to develop a coherent theoretical framework that explains the transport
   mechanisms that take place in a nanoporous medium. In this paper, a
   complete modelling workflow that spans the mesoscale to the macroscale,
   including the lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) and Navier-Stokes equations,
   is introduced to reflect these transport characteristics. Gas flow for
   different pore diameters and Knudsen numbers is simulated by LBM.
   Comparison between physical experimental measurements and the LBM
   simulation results shows that the general transport equation is most
   appropriate for describing gas flow in nanoporous media and that the
   values of the diffusion coefficient and intrinsic permeability can be
   obtained simultaneously using this equation. Intrinsic permeability
   decreases faster than the diffusion coefficient with the decreasing
   average pore diameters in nanoporous media. The general transport
   equation has been verified to reflect the mechanisms of flow and
   diffusion in nanoporous media, and it also provides a theoretical basis
   to assess the results attained from numerical simulations. (C) 2015

Title = {{A complementary approach for uncertainty reduction in post-flowback

Abstract = {{A key limitation of conventional post-flowback production data analysis
   is non-uniqueness of solution. This causes uncertainty in reservoir
   parameter estimates and hydrocarbon forecasts. This paper proposes a
   complementary approach, using flowback data analysis to constrain
   post-flowback data analysis and reduce uncertainty in output results.
   This study history-matches two-phase pressure and rate data from seven
   multifractured Horn River shale-gas wells to investigate the benefits of
   analysing both flowback and post-flowback data together. The flowback
   history-match result estimates the pore-volume of active fracture
   networks, effective half-lengths and initial gas volume in hydraulic
   fractures during flowback. Also, the field production forecasts from the
   flowback history-match yield lower gas rates compared to actual
   post-flowback production data. On the other hand, the post-flowback
   history-match results overestimate effective half-lengths when compared
   to flowback history-match results. These observations are due to
   neglecting the secondary fracture and gas desorption effects on the
   dual-porosity based flowback model used in this study. The communication
   interface between secondary fractures and hydraulic fractures
   significantly increases during post-flowback periods (when most of the
   water in the active secondary fractures have been displaced by gas
   influx from the matrix and matrix pressure drops below the critical
   desorption pressure). Therefore, post-flowback analysis should properly
   couple flowback history, and account for secondary fracture and gas
   desorption effects to yield reasonable results.
   This paper shows how to perform a complementary flowback and
   post-flowback data analysis for comprehensive fracture/reservoir
   characterization. This complementary approach provides engineers with a
   tool to estimate fracture parameters (such as half length) from flowback
   analysis and use them as inputs for post-flowback analysis. Although a
   dual-porosity framework is sufficient for flowback data analysis, proper
   post-flowback analysis should account for both secondary fracture
   effects (using a triple-porosity framework) and gas desorption effects.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a detailed parametric study, conducted using finite
   element tools to cover a range of several geometric and material
   parameters, on the behaviour of thin-walled partially encased composite
   (PEC) columns. The PEC columns studied herein are composed of
   thin-walled built-up H-shaped steel sections with concrete infill cast
   between the flanges. Transverse links are provided between the opposing
   flanges to improve resistance to local buckling. The parametric study is
   confined to eccentricallyloaded columns subjected to major axis bending
   only. The parameters that were varied include the overall column
   slenderness ratio (L/d), load eccentricity ratio (e/d), link
   spacing-to-depth ratio (s/d), flange plate slenderness ratio (b/t) and
   concrete compressive strength (f(cu)). The overall column slenderness
   ratio was chosen to be the primary variable with values of 5, 10 and 15.
   Other parameters were varied within each case of L/d ratio. The effects
   of the selected parameters on the behaviour of PEC columns were studied
   with respect to the failure mode, peak axial load, axial load versus
   average axial strain response, axial load versus lateral displacement
   response, moment versus lateral displacement behaviour and the axial
   load-moment interaction diagram. The results of the parametric study are
   presented in the paper and the influences of each of the parameters
   investigated are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A volumetric metamaterial lens exhibiting a negative refractive index

   capacitors and dual-arm spiral inductors in a biplanar configuration.
   These elements, although fully printed and without vias, provide strong
   reactive loading that enables a unit cell size of lambda(0)/11 and
   allows the metamaterial's dispersion properties to be accurately modeled
   in the effective-medium regime using an equivalent-circuit approach. It
   is also conducive to implementation at high frequencies, where
   surface-mount components are unusable. The focusing properties of the
   fabricated lens are confirmed for a band of frequencies around 5.0 GHz
   in an anechoic chamber using a free-space field probing system
   consisting of electrically small shielded-loop antennas affixed to a

Abstract = {{In this paper, a compact eight-element antenna array is designed for
   ultra-wide band (UWB) pulsed radar in highly reflective metallic
   environments, such as storage and transport tankers. The impact of the
   sidewalls in metallic tanks is to increase noise and create spurious
   signals due to sidewall reflection that limits accuracy and causes
   liquid level and material property measurement errors. The designed
   Vivaldi antenna and array are characterized in terms of the transient
   energy patterns and the signal fidelity given in terms of the off-angle
   signal correlation. Comparison with horn antennas is made. Antenna
   transient signals are calculated from the frequency-domain data. The
   10-dB transient energy pattern beamwidth in the E-plane is improved from
   130 degrees to 50 degrees using the eight-element array versus single
   element. Also, the signal correlation and fidelity for off-broadside
   angles is greatly reduced. The reflection data from a multilayer of
   canola oil on metal-backed marble is processed with a calibrated
   layer-stripping technique for material properties. The transient
   radiation patterns of the array are compared to that of two horn
   antennas with similar dimensions. The noise/interference and measurement
   error is shown to be greatly reduced using an array compared to horn
   antennas in a realistic tank environment.}},

Abstract = {{Protein interfacial network formation under mechanical pressure and its
   influence on degradation was investigated at molecular level using
   Langmuir-Blodgett B-hordein monolayer as a 2D model. Surface properties,
   such as surface pressure, dilatational and shear rheology and the
   surface pressure - area (pi-A) isotherm, of B-hordein at air-water
   interface were analyzed by tensiometer, rheometer and a
   Langmuir-Blodgett trough respectively. B-Hordein conformation and
   orientation under different surface pressures were determined by
   polarization modulation-infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy
   (PM-IRRAS). The interfacial network morphology was observed by atomic
   force microscopy (AFM). B-Hordein could reduce the air-water surface
   tension rapidly to similar to 45 mN/m and form a solid-like network with
   high rheological elasticity and compressibility at interface, which
   could be a result of interactions developed by intermolecular
   beta-sheets. The results also revealed that B-hordein interfacial
   network switched from an expanded liquid phase to a solid-like film with
   increasing compression pressure. The orientation of B-hordein was
   parallel to the surface when in expended liquid phase, whereas upon
   compression, the hydrophobic repetitive region tilted away from water
   phase. When compressed to 30 mN/m, a strong elastic network was formed
   at the interface, and it was resistant to a harsh gastric-like
   environment of low pH and pepsin. This work generated fundamental
   knowledge, which suggested the potential to design B-hordein stabilized
   emulsions and encapsulations with controllable digestibility for small
   intestine targeted delivery of bioactive compounds. (c) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The technical feasibility of underground coal gasification (UCG) has
   been established through many field trials and laboratory-scale
   experiments over the past decades. However, the UCG is site specific and
   the commercialization of UCG is being hindered due to the lack of
   complete information for a specific site of operation. Since conducting
   UCG trials and data extraction are costly and difficult, modeling has
   been an important part of UCG study to predict the effect of various
   physical and operating parameters on the performance of the process.
   Over the years, various models have been developed in order to improve
   the understanding of the UCG process. This article reviews the
   approaches, key concepts, assumptions, and limitations of various
   forward gasification UCG models for cavity growth and product gas
   recovery. However, emphasis is given to the most important models, such
   as packed bed models, the channel model, and the coal slab model. In
   addition, because of the integral part of the main models, various
   sub-models such as drying and pyrolysis are also included in this
   review. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the various
   simulation methodologies and sub-models in order to enhance the
   understanding of the critical aspects of the UCG process.}},

Abstract = {{La/Fe/TiO2 composite photocatalysts were synthesized by Sol-Gel method
   and well characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen-physical adsorption, and UV-Vis
   diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis DRS). It is interesting that the
   doped catalysts were in anatase phase while the pure TiO2 was in rutile
   phase. In addition, the composites possessed better physical chemical
   properties in photocatalytic activity than pure TiO2: stronger
   visible-light-response ability, larger specific surface area, and more
   regular shape in morphology. The photodegradation results of ammonia
   nitrogen indicate that: the La/Fe/TiO2 had higher catalytic activity to
   ammonia nitrogen waste water compared pure TiO2 and the other single
   metal-doped TiO2. pH 10 and 2 mmol/L H2O2 were all beneficial to the
   removal of ammonia nitrogen by La/Fe/TiO2. However, the common inorganic
   ions of Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, HCO3-/CO32-, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in water
   all inhibited the degradation of ammonia nitrogen. By balance
   calculation, at least 20\% of ammonia nitrogen was converted to N-2
   during the 64.6\% removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen.}},

Title = {{Integrated Characterization of Hydraulically Fractured Shale-Gas
   Reservoirs-Production History Matching}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{481-494}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Advancements in horizontal-well drilling and multistage hydraulic
   fracturing have enabled economically viable gas production from tight
   formations. Reservoir-simulation models play an important role in the
   production forecasting and field-development planning. To enhance their
   predictive capabilities and to capture the uncertainties in model
   parameters, one should calibrate stochastic reservoir models to both
   geologic and flow observations.
   In this paper, a novel approach to characterization and history matching
   of hydrocarbon production from a hydraulic-fractured shale is presented.
   This new methodology includes generating multiple
   discrete-fracture-network (DFN) models, upscaling the models for
   numerical multiphase-flow simulation, and updating the DFN-model
   parameters with dynamic-flow responses. First, measurements from
   hydraulic-fracture treatment, petrophysical interpretation, and in-situ
   stress data are used to estimate the initial probability distribution of
   hydraulic-fracture and induced-microfracture parameters, and multiple
   initial DFN models are generated. Next, the DFN models are upscaled into
   an equivalent continuum dual-porosity model with analytical techniques.
   The upscaled models are subjected to the flow simulation, and their
   production performances are compared with the actual responses. Finally,
   an assisted-history-matching algorithm is implemented to assess the
   uncertainties of the DFN-model parameters. Hydraulic-fracture parameters
   including half-length and transmissivity are updated, and the length,
   transmissivity, intensity, and spatial distribution of the induced
   fractures are also estimated.
   The proposed methodology is applied to facilitate characterization of
   fracture parameters of a multifractured shale-gas well in the Horn River
   basin. Fracture parameters and stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) derived
   from the updated DFN models are in agreement with estimates from
   microseismic interpretation and rate-transient analysis. The key
   advantage of this integrated assisted-history-matching approach is that
   uncertainties in fracture parameters are represented by the multiple
   equally probable DFN models and their upscaled flow-simulation models,
   which honor the hard data and match the dynamic production history. This
   work highlights the significance of uncertainties in SRV and
   hydraulic-fracture parameters. It also provides insight into the value
   of microseismic data when integrated into a rigorous
   production-history-matching work flow.}},

Abstract = {{An ultrasonic wavefield imaging method is developed to reconstruct the
   internal geometric properties of long bones using zero-offset data
   acquired axially on the bone surface. The imaging algorithm based on
   Born scattering theory is implemented with the conjugate gradient
   iterative method to reconstruct an optimal image. In the case of a
   multilayered velocity model, ray tracing through a smooth medium is used
   to calculate the traveled distance and traveling time. The method has
   been applied to simulated and real data. The results indicate that the
   interfaces of the top cortex are accurately imaged and correspond
   favorably to the original model. The reconstructed bottom cortex below
   the marrow is less accurate mainly because of the low signal-to-noise
   ratio. The current imaging method has successfully recovered the top
   cortical layer, providing a potential tool to investigate the internal
   structures of long bone cortex for osteoporosis assessment. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{Halogenation of bitumen and asphaltenes was investigated to convert
   asphaltenes into maltenes. Halogenation resulted in products with
   increased penetration hardness. Three hypotheses were forwarded to
   explain these observations: stronger stacking as a result of
   electrostatic differences, free radical addition reactions, and
   increased hydrogen bonding. A model compound investigation was
   performed. No evidence was found that stacking,. strength increased as a
   result of electrostatic differences between halogenated and
   non-halogenated materials. Addition reactions were found on heating
   halogenated materials but not on mixing without heating. Evidence was
   presented of increased hydrogen bonding, although not necessarily
   stronger hydrogen bonding. Changes in the properties of mixtures of
   halogenated and non-halogenated materials were observed and, in one
   instance, the development of a new crystal configuration. On the basis
   of this work, the most plausible explanation for the increased hardness
   after halogenation bitumen and asphaltenes is an increase in hydrogen
   bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Plant equipment fouling is one of the major problems affecting the
   performance of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) bitumen extraction
   processes. The produced water that is treated and reused as boiler
   feedwater contains high concentration of silica and dissolved organic
   matter (DOM), and silica and carbon have been found to be principle
   components of steam generator and heat exchanger foulants. The
   interactions between silica and SAGD DOM were studied in this research
   to provide insight into possible fouling mechanisms and mitigation
   methods. The effects of physicochemical process parameters such as
   different types of organics, salts, and colloids in the silica-DOM
   co-precipitation are studied at different concentrations and pHs. In
   order to study the effects of all physicochemical process parameters at
   three different levels with a minimum number of experiments, Taguchi
   experimental design is employed. Analysis of variance is performed to
   evaluate the contribution of each parameter in the silica-DOM
   aggregation process. The study revealed that the rate of silica organic
   co-precipitation varies mainly with the nature of the organics. Further,
   at higher ionic strength and lower pH of the solution, an enhanced
   silica-organic aggregation is observed. Multivalent cationic salt is
   found to be a good coagulating agent to remove humic-like DOM fraction

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) relies on a sequence of self-limiting
   surface reactions for thin film growth. The effect of non-ALD side
   reactions, from insufficient purging between pulses and from precursor
   self-decomposition, on film growth is well known. In this article,
   precursor condensation within an ALD valve is described, and the effect
   of the continuous precursor source from condensate evaporation on ALD
   growth is discussed. The influence of the ALD valve temperature on
   growth and electrical resistivity of ZrN plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD)
   films is reported. Increasing ALD valve temperature from 75 to 95
   degrees C, with other process parameters being identical, decreased both
   the growth per cycle and electrical resistivity (rho) of ZrN PEALD films
   from 0.10 to 0.07 nm/cycle and from 560 to 350 mu Omega cm,
   respectively. Our results show that the non-ALD growth resulting from
   condensate accumulation is eliminated at valve temperatures close to the
   pressure corrected boiling point of precursor. (C) 2015 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{Shale barriers within the bituminous oil sand deposits of the McMurray
   Formation have a detrimental effect on the steam-assisted
   gravity-drainage chamber growth and oil recovery. Typically, the non-net
   shale barrier lateral extents are too small to be detected with a few
   widely spaced delineation wells. The information on net reservoir and
   shale interval thicknesses collected from wells, along with a vertical
   indicator variogram, provide limited information about the horizontal
   extent and connectivity of these intervals. In this paper, a novel
   quantitative approach for predicting the lateral extents of the
   barriers, using thickness information provided by well log data, is
   proposed. The proposed approach is based on moments of inertia (MOI)
   applied to the shale objects to determine their effective size. The MOI
   calculation is aimed to simplify the almost infinite complexity of shale
   bodies into summary size parameters that can be readily understood and
   calibrated to production parameters. A case study is presented for
   optimal well placement accounting for uncertainty in the shale barrier
   sizes.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A systematic experimental study was performed to understand the role of
   surface contact angles in affecting the process of fast liquid transfer.
   Surfaces with different wettabilities were used, and the transfer ratio
   (alpha, the amount of liquid transferred to the acceptor surface over
   the total amount of liquid) was measured for each pair of surfaces. A
   numerical model based on the volume of fluid method was developed to
   help understand the experimental results. The surface wettability was
   shown to significantly affect the boundaries between three regimes based
   on stretching speeds: quasi-static (surface force dominated), transition
   (surface/viscous/inertia forces all important) and dynamic
   (viscous/inertia forces dominated). Specifically, the values of the
   boundary speeds were found to increase with vertical bar alpha(0) - 0.5
   vertical bar, where alpha(0) is the transfer ratio in the quasi-static
   regime, and alpha(0) is governed by the surface receding contact angles.
   Based on our results, an empirical equation to describe the transfer
   ratio as function of stretching speed was proposed. This equation can
   also be used as a prediction tool for the value of alpha for a fast
   transfer system. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{For spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks, the IEEE 802.22
   standard requires the detection of primary signals with a
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as -20 dB and receiver sensitivity as
   low as -116 dBm. Under such low-SNR levels, the performance of a
   conventional energy detector is analyzed in this paper. The analysis
   includes novel expressions for missed-detection probability and area
   under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Thus, a unified
   framework covering fading channels, square-law diversity combining, and
   cooperative spectrum-sensing scenarios is developed. The detection
   threshold is optimized to minimize the total error rate subject to
   bounded false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities, which
   outperforms traditional detection threshold selection. Numerical results
   and Monte Carlo simulation results with the IEEE 802.22 sensing
   requirements are provided and discussed.}},

Title = {{Modeling impacts of subscale heterogeneities on dispersive solute
   transport in subsurface systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{63-77}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Previous works in the literature demonstrated that dispersion increases
   with heterogeneities and travel distance in heterogeneous reservoirs.
   However, it remains challenging to quantify the effects of subscale
   heterogeneities on dispersion. Scale-up of input dispersivity and other
   reservoir attributes to the transport modeling scale should account for
   subscale heterogeneity and its variability.
   A method is proposed to quantify the uncertainties in reservoir
   attributes and dispersivity introduced by scale-up. A random walk
   particle tracking (RWPT) method, which is not prone to numerical
   dispersion, is used for transport modeling. First, to scale-up rock
   properties including porosity and permeability, volume variance at the
   transport modeling scale is computed corresponding to a given spatial
   correlation model; numerous sets of ``conditioning data{''} are sampled
   from probability distributions whose mean is the block average of the
   actual measure values and the variance is the variance of block mean.
   Stochastic simulations are subsequently performed to generate multiple
   realizations at the transport modeling scale. Next, multiple sub-grid
   geostatistical realizations depicting detailed fine-scale
   heterogeneities and of the same physical sizes as the transport modeling
   grid block are subjected to RWPT simulation. Effective longitudinal and
   transverse (horizontal) dispersivities in two-dimensional models are
   determined simultaneously by matching the corresponding breakthrough
   concentration history for each realization with an equivalent medium
   consisting of averaged homogeneous rock properties. Aggregating results
   derived with all realizations, we generate probability distributions of
   scaled-up dispersivities conditional to particular averaged rock
   properties, from which values representative of the transport modeling
   scale are randomly drawn.
   The method is applied to model a tracer injection process. Results
   obtained from coarse-scale models, where reservoir properties and
   dispersivities are populated with the proposed approach, are compared to
   those obtained from fine-scale models. Our results verify that
   dispersivity increases with scale and demonstrate that (1) uncertainty
   distributions in recovery obtained by accounting for variability owing
   to scale-up capture the actual fine-scale behavior; and (2) ignoring
   sub-scale uncertainties would underestimate the ensuing uncertainty in
   recovery performance. An important contribution of this work is that it
   presents a quantitative and systematic procedure to scale-up both rock
   and flow-related properties. It reinforces the notion that deterministic
   conditioning data does not exist in reservoir modeling. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A simple and effective laboratory test methodology was developed for
   differentiating wildland fire chemicals based on the ignition time of
   vegetative fuel samples. The test apparatus consisted of an
   electric-powered radiant heater that was used to produce a uniform
   radiant thermal load to ignite the vegetative fuel samples. The samples,
   treated with wildland fire chemicals, were mounted on to a load cell to
   determine the transient mass loss during the combustion process. A
   custom-built heat flux sensor, that was modified and tested to reduce
   high errors, was used to determine the time to flaming ignition. The
   time to flaming ignition was also measured using transient mass loss
   data of the vegetative fuel samples. Statistical t-test analysis was
   conducted on the time to flaming ignition to determine whether the
   results were statistically significant for the different chemical
   treatments. The results indicated that the test methodology allowed for
   effective differentiation between the wildland fire chemical treatments
   by comparing their mean ignition times. The narrow standard deviations
   of the average ignition times suggested that the test methodology was
   able to produce repeatable results.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the climate anomalies impacts on the Upper Blue Nile Basin
   (UBNB), Ethiopia, a large basin with scarce hydroclimatic data, through
   hydrologic modeling is a challenge. A fully distributed,
   physically-based model, a modified version of the Interactions
   Soil-Biosphere Atmosphere model of Mete France (MISBA), and a lumped,
   conceptual rainfall-runoff Sacramento model, SAC-SMA of the US National
   Weather Service, were used to simulate the streamflow of UBNB. To study
   the potential hydrologic effect of climate anomalies on the UBNB,
   rainfall and temperature data observed when climate anomalies were
   active, were resampled and used to drive MISBA and SAC-SMA. To obtain
   representative, distributed precipitation data in mountainous basins, it
   was found that a 3\% adjustment factor for every 25 m rise in elevation
   was needed to orographically correct the rainfall over UBNB. The
   performance of MISBA applied to UBNB improved after MISBA was modified
   so that it could simulate evaporation loss from the canopy, providing
   coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.58, and root mean square error
   (RMSE) = 0.34 m(3)/s in comparison with the observed streamflow. In
   contrast, the performance of SAC-SMA at the calibration run and the
   validation run is better than that of MISBA, such that R-2 is 0.79 for
   calibration and 0.82 for validation even though it models the hydrology
   of UBNB in a lumped, conceptual framework as against the
   physically-based, fully distributed framework of MISBA. El Nino tends to
   decrease the June-September rainfall but increase the February-May
   rainfall, while La Nina has opposite effect on the rainfall of UBNB.
   Based on the simulations of MISBA and SAC-SMA for UBNB, La Nina and
   Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) tend to have a wetting effect while El Nino
   has a drying effect on the streamflow of the UBNB. In addition, El Nino
   Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and IOD increase the streamflow variability
   more than changing the magnitude of streamflow. The results provide
   useful information on the effects of global oceanic anomalies on the
   hydrology of UBNB. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   recent studies. In this letter, we consider networks in which the total

   than the total capacity of its outgoing links. We call these networks
   funnel networks and prove that any feasible non-multicast problem on
   funnel networks is solvable by routing (hence, by linear network coding,
   too). The desirability of network coding in funnel networks may be
   justified by the other benefits that coding offers. However, we see that
   in funnel networks, the conventional random approach to linear coding
   fails with high probability. Hence, we provide a new random linear
   network coding solution for these non-multicast problems.}},

Abstract = {{Phase equilibrium calculations based on 150 n-alkane + aromatic and
   n-alkane + naphthenic hydrocarbon binary mixtures were performed. These
   calculations were compared with experimental measurements whenever
   possible, and additional measurements were made as part of this work.
   The widely used Peng-Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK)
   equations of state are shown to predict nonphysical liquid-liquid phase
   behavior for long-chain n-alkane + aromatic and long-chain n-alkane +
   naphthenic hydrocarbon binary mixtures with standard pure-component
   parameters (T-c, P-c, omega). Incorrect phase behavior prediction is
   shown to be insensitive to the selection of correlations for estimating
   pure-component properties for n-alkanes that are not available from
   experimental data. For cubic equations of state, correct phase behaviors
   are obtained only when negative values of the binary interaction
   parameters (k(ij)) are used. For PC-SAFT, a noncubic equation of state
   (with standard parameter values defining molecules and with binary
   interaction parameters set to zero), phase behaviors that are consistent
   with observed phase behaviors are obtained. However, below the melting
   temperature of at least one of the components, liquid-liquid phase
   behavior is predicted for some binary mixtures. The quality of
   liquid/vapor phase composition and dew and bubble pressure predictions
   from the cubic and PC-SAFT models was not evaluated. Measurement and
   phase behavior modeling outcomes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Samarium-153 ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(methylenephosphonic
   acid) (Sm-153-EDTMP, or samarium lexidronam), also known by its
   registered trademark name Quadramet, is an approved therapeutic
   radiopharmaceutical used in the palliative treatment of painful bone
   metastases. Typically, patients with prostate, breast, or lung cancer
   are most likely to go on to require bone pain palliation treatment due
   to bone metastases. Sm(EDTMP) is a bone-seeking drug which accumulates
   on rapidly growing bone, thereby delivering a highly region-specific
   dose of radiation, chiefly through beta particle emission. Even with its
   widespread clinical use, the structure of Sm(EDTMP) has not yet been
   characterized at atomic resolution, despite attempts to crystallize the
   complex. Herein, we prepared a 1:1 complex of the cold (stable isotope)
   of Sm(EDTMP) under alkaline conditions and then isolated and
   characterized the complex using conventional spectroscopic techniques,
   as well as with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
   spectroscopy and density functional structure calculations, using
   natural abundance Sm. We present the atomic resolution structure of
   {[}Sm-III(EDTMP)(-8H)](5) for the first time, supported by the EXAFS
   data and complementary spectroscopic techniques, which demonstrate that
   the samarium coordination environment in solution is in agreement with
   the structure that has long been conjectured.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of rapid maxillary expansion
   (RME) on the sagittal dental or skeletal parameters of growing children
   with Class II malocclusion.
   Materials and Methods: A systematic review intended to identify relevant
   literature was conducted. The search was performed on Medline, Embase,
   Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases. Reference lists of the included
   articles were also screened for relevant documents. The qualitative
   assessment was performed according to the Methodological Index for
   Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool, and the resultant data were
   grouped and analyzed concerning dental and skeletal sagittal effects of
   RME.
   Results: Of 25 screened studies, seven articles met eligibility criteria
   and were included. Study samples were observed during mixed dentition
   stage and characterized as having either Class II dental malocclusion or
   skeletal discrepancy. None of the included studies was a randomized
   clinical trial. Included controlled studies presented several
   inadequacies related to control group or lacked appropriate comparative
   statistical analysis. Besides being frequently based on deficient
   methodology, dental and skeletal sagittal effects of RME were either
   controversial or lacked clinical relevance.
   Conclusion: The effect of RME on the sagittal dimension of Class II
   malocclusions has not been proved yet. Future randomized controlled
   clinical trials are still needed to definitely address this question.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of indium doping on chemical stability, sinterability, and
   electrical properties of BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.2O3- was investigated. The phase
   purity and the chemical stability of the powders in humid pure CO2 were
   evaluated by XRD. The dense electrolyte pellets were formed after the
   calcination at 1450 degrees C for 8h. SEM images and shrinkage plot
   showed that the sinterability of the samples was apparently improved by
   doping indium. The electrical conductivity was measured by impedance
   test through two-point method, at both low (200-350 degrees C) and high
   temperature ranges (450-850 degrees C) in different atmospheres.
   BaCe0.4Zr0.3In0.1Y0.2O3- has been proved to be the optimal composition
   which simultaneously maximized the chemical stability, sinterability,
   and electrical conductivity which reached 1.1x10(-2)S/cm in wet hydrogen
   at 700 degrees C, comparing with the 1.3x10(-2)S/cm for original
   BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.2O3-. Anode support fuel cell with a thin
   BaCe0.4Zr0.3In0.1Y0.2O3- electrolyte (15m) was fabricated by spin
   coating method. Maximum power density of 0.651W/cm(2) was obtained when
   operating at 700 degrees C and fed by humid H-2 (containing H2O 3
   vol\%). The obtained fuel cell could efficiently run at 650 degrees C

Abstract = {{The small scale pipe plays an important role in the heat and mass
   transfer of industrial application. For the study of the flow
   characteristics in small scale pipe, a modal mixed Discontinuous
   Galerkin (DG) method was proposed for solving axial-symmetrical
   Navier-Stokes (NS) equations with solid slip boundary conditions. A new
   limiter of modal DG was proposed. And, the special treatments of
   velocity slip and temperature jump in wall solid boundary were given in
   the numerical scheme. Extensive numerical studies for the flow
   characteristics of small scale pipe were conducted For validation, the
   comparison between the present study and experiment data were performed.
   The heat transfer coefficients and frictional factor are found to be
   increased with the diameter decreasing. Furthermore, it is observed that
   the frictional factor of small scale pipe is larger than that of macro
   scale pipe. And, the proposed DG-NS method provides a new way for the

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the heat transfer and X-ray diffraction patterns
   of solidified molten salt droplets in heat recovery processes of a
   thermochemical Cu-Cl cycle of hydrogen production. It is essential to
   recover the heat of the molten salt to enhance the overall thermal

   recovery within the cycle can be achieved by cooling and solidifying the
   molten salt exiting an oxygen reactor. Heat recovery from the molten
   salt is achieved by dispersing the molten stream into droplets. In this
   paper, an analytical study and experimental investigation of the thermal
   phenomena of a falling droplet quenched into water is presented,
   involving the droplet surface temperature during descent and resulting
   composition change in the quench process. The results show that it is
   feasible to quench the molten salt droplets for an efficient heat
   recovery process without introducing any material imbalance for the
   overall cycle integration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a flexible energy- and reliability-aware application
   mapping approach for network-on-chip (NoC)-based reconfigurable
   architecture. A parameterized cost model is first developed by combining
   energy and reliability with a weight parameter that defines the
   optimization priority. Using this model, the overall mapping cost could
   be evaluated. Subsequently, a mapping method using branch and bound with
   a partial cost ratio is employed to find the best mapping by enumerating
   all the possible patterns organized in a search tree. To improve the
   search efficiency, nonoptimal mappings are discarded at early stages
   using the partial cost ratio. Using the proposed approach, applications
   can be mapped onto most NoC topologies and running with various routing
   algorithms when considering both energy and reliability. Other
   state-of-the-art works have also done substantial research for the same

Abstract = {{This brief investigates the Restore mechanism of a nonvolatile static
   random access memory (NVSRAM) cell that utilizes two magnetic tunneling
   junctions (MTJs) as nonvolatile resistive elements and a 6T SRAM core.
   Two cells are proposed by employing different mechanisms for the Restore
   operation once the power is reestablished. The proposed cells use the
   bitline and supply as mechanisms to initiate the Restore operation, so
   connecting the two MTJs to different nodes of the NVSRAM circuitry. The
   cells are extensively analyzed in terms of their operations with respect
   to different figures of merit, such as operational delays (for the
   Write, Read, and Restore operations), the static noise margin, power
   consumption, critical charge, and process variations (in both the
   MOSFETs and the resistive elements). Simulation results show that the
   cell with the MTJs connected to the supply offers the best performance
   in terms of power for the Read/Restore operations; it also achieves the
   best Read delay, but the worst Restore delay.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses optimal constrained state estimation problem for
   finite and infinite-dimensional chemical process systems. We consider
   cases when the prior information, in addition to the model parameters
   and the measurements, is available in the form of an inequality
   constraint with respect to the system's state. In the latest
   developments of the optimal state estimation theory, considerations of
   the state constraints have been often neglected since constraints do not
   fit easily in the structure of the optimal state estimator. Therefore,
   the issue of the state constraints being present needs to be addressed
   adequately, in particular, nonnegativity of concentration. Motivated by
   this, we developed a sequential, algorithmic optimal constrained state
   estimator for both finite and infinite-dimensional process systems
   commonly found in chemical process engineering (CSTR, tubular reactor).
   In this paper, we also designed an optimal constrained state estimator
   for a large class of dissipative infinite-dimensional systems which
   involve boundary actuation and point observation. Finally, illustrative
   examples of chemical process systems and proposed optimal state
   constrained estimation are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   micromechanical square shape resonators fabricated in single crystal
   silicon using a silicon on isolator wafer. Two different types of
   excitation for square shape resonators were used to stimulate Lame mode
   and square mode of resonance. The fabricated devices were studied under
   different bias voltage and in air at room temperature. The highest
   quality factor measured for the Lame mode resonator was 11,121 and for
   the square mode was 9,120 for square mode at 3.17 and 4.01 MHz, under
   the 80 V DC bias voltage across 1.5 mu m actuation gap. It has been
   shown that by adding raggedy edge, the coupling capacitor has increased.
   Mass detection capabilities of these resonators were also investigated
   by adding an extra layer of gold. Frequency and quality factor variation
   was observed for each of the fabricated resonators. Adding a mass of 76
   pgr leads to resonance frequency shift of 3.1 kHz in Lame mode

Abstract = {{Chitosan, a natural biodegradable polymer, was studied as a selective

   Although chitosan depressed both molybdenite and chalcopyrite in single

   of molybdenum in the froth product was over 70\% while the recovery of

   had a higher adsorption density on chalcopyrite than on molybdenite.
   FTIR and ToF-SIMS measurements were carried out to confirm the different
   degrees of interaction of chitosan with molybdenite and chalcopyrite and
   the results showed that chitosan mostly adsorbed on chalcopyrite via
   amide groups when both molybdenite and chalcopyrite were present in the

Journal = {{VIROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{485}},
Pages = {{355-362}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The process of a bacteriophage attaching to its host cell is a
   combination of physical diffusion, biochemical surface interactions, and
   reaction-induced conformational changes in receptor proteins. Local
   variations in the physico-chemical properties of the medium, the phage's
   mode of action, and the physiology of the host cell also all influence
   adsorption kinetics. These characteristics can affect a specific phage's
   binding capabilities and the susceptibility of the host cell to phage
   attack. Despite the complexity of this process, describing adsorption
   kinetics of a population of bacteriophages binding to a culture of cells
   has been accomplished with relatively simple equations governed by the
   laws of mass-action. Many permutations and modifications to the basic
   set of reactions have been suggested through the years. While no single
   solution emerges as a universal answer, this review provides the
   fundamentals of current phage adsorption modeling and will guide
   researchers in the selection of valid, appropriate models. (C) 2015

   2 m of waste-rock stockpiles. Two AZLs were filled with waste rock
   containing an average of 0.014 wt.\% S predominantly as pyrrhotite (Type
   I AZLs) and two AZLs were filled with waste rock containing an average
   of 0.035 wt.\% S (Type III AZLs). The geochemistry and microbiology of
   the effluent from the AZLs was monitored for 4 years. The effluent from
   the Type III AZLs was characterized by low pH (< 3.5) with high
   concentrations of SO42- and dissolved metals. An increase in SO42-, Fe,
   and most dissolved metals coincided to the decrease in pH to 3.0 and the
   depletion of alkalinity. Maximum concentrations of SO42-, Al, Zn, Ni,
   Co, and Cu were observed in 2010, the final year of the dataset analyzed
   here. The effluent from the Type I AZLs maintained neutral pH (similar
   to 7.5) and lower concentrations of SO42- (< 2000 mg L-1), Fe (< 1.4 mg
   L-1), and other dissolved metals. The examination of effluent from the
   upper 2 m of waste rock indicated the active freeze-thaw layer underwent
   extensive weathering during the first 4 years of rock placement.
   Populations of Fe-and S-oxidizing bacteria in the AZLs were determined
   by most probable number methods. Enumerations for the Type III AZLs
   indicated an abundance of acidophilic S-oxidizing microorganisms,
   whereas neutrophilic S-oxidizing microorganisms were most abundant in
   the Type I AZLs. Iron-oxidizing microorganisms were generally less
   abundant than S-oxidizing microorganisms, but were detected in low-pH
   effluent with high dissolved metals in one of the Type III AZLs. The
   results of this experiment demonstrate that, in spite of the very low
   sulfide content of the waste rock and the cold temperatures prevalent at
   the Diavik site, colonization by S-and Fe-oxidizing bacteria and the
   microbially mediated oxidation of pyrrhotite can result in the
   generation of acidic drainage. Furthermore, although waste rock with a
   sulfide content of 0.035 wt.\% S generated acidic drainage within the
   first year following construction, the pH of the effluent from the waste
   rock containing 0.014 wt.\% S remained neutral, demonstrating the need
   for careful planning and storage of waste rock at the Diavik site. (C)

Title = {{Filling box flows in porous media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{782}},
Pages = {{455-478}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We report upon a theoretical and experimental investigation of a porous
   medium `filling box' flow by specifically examining the details of the
   laminar descending plume and its outflow in a control volume having an
   impermeable bottom boundary and sidewalls. The plume outflow initially
   comprises a pair of oppositely directed gravity currents. The gravity
   currents propagate horizontally until they reach the lateral sidewalls
   at y = +/- L. The flow then becomes of filling box type, with a
   vertically ascending `first front' separating discharged plume fluid
   below from ambient fluid above. The flow details are described
   analytically by first deriving a new similarity solution for Darcy
   plumes with Pe > O(1), where Pe is the PAcet number. From the similarity
   solution so obtained, we then derive expressions for the plume volume
   flux and mean reduced gravity as functions of the vertical distance from
   the source. Regarding the plume outflow, a similarity solution adopted
   from Huppert \& Woods (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 292, 1995, pp. 55-69)
   describes the height and front speed of the gravity currents, whereas a
   semi-implicit finite difference scheme is used to predict the first
   front elevation versus time and horizontal distance. As with
   high-Reynolds-number filling box flows, that studied here is an example
   of a coupled problem: the gravity current source conditions are
   prescribed by the plume volume flux and mean reduced gravity.
   Conversely, discharged plume fluid may be re-entrained into the plume,
   be it soon or long after reaching the bottom impermeable boundary. To
   corroborate our model predictions, analogue laboratory experiments are
   performed with fresh water and salt water as the working fluids. Our
   experiments consider as independent variables the porous medium bead
   diameter and the plume source volume flux and reduced gravity.
   Predictions for the gravity current front position and height compare
   favourably against analogue measured data. Good agreement is likewise
   noted when considering either the mean elevation or the profile of the
   first front. Results from this study may be adopted in modelling
   geological plumes. For example, our equations can be used to predict the
   time required for discharged plume fluid to return to the point of
   injection in the case of aquifers closed on the sides and below by
   impermeable boundaries.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The interpretation of pressuremeter test results in cohesive soils
   assumes that the soil is saturated and the rate of loading is such that
   undrained conditions apply. Pressuremeter tests in compacted soils or
   heavily overconsolidated clays may have a degree of saturation that is
   less than 100\%. Consequently, the soil may undergo volume changes
   during the initial stages of loading. Loading of the soil will result in
   the compression of occluded air and consequently the initial
   circumferential strains may be a function of volumetric changes and not
   a result of borehole expansion alone. A method to determine the applied
   radial total stress that will result in saturation for the pressuremeter
   test is developed based on Hilf's method of pore water pressure
   prediction during compressive loading of an unsaturated soil. A method
   to quantify the volume change that will occur within the plastic region
   around the pressuremeter probe prior to saturation is also developed.

Abstract = {{Probabilistic approaches are widely adopted for the modeling of rockfall
   trajectories, but are not widely discussed in the literature. This paper
   aims to help fill this gap by reviewing probabilistic models of rockfall
   trajectories, while providing some perspectives for future study. We
   first make it clear that, from a theoretical point of view, the
   probabilistic approach is necessitated by both the ontic (inherent)
   uncertainty associated with rockfalls and the epistemic (information)
   uncertainty associated with numerical modeling. The review suggests that
   there may be the potential to improve the probabilistic modeling of
   rockfall trajectories in various aspects, including the systematic
   probabilistic modeling criterion, the random sampling approaches
   employed for probabilistic variables, the probabilistic modeling of rock
   shape, and the probabilistic prediction of rockfall intensity. However,
   there are still some open questions regarding the promotion of
   probabilistic modeling in practice. It is not clear whether
   probabilistically treating all of the variables of rockfall trajectory
   model with reasoned distributions will lead to significantly improved
   results, or whether the improvements will be great enough (given the
   difficulties and costs involved) that it is worth quantifying all of the
   uncertainties involved in rockfall trajectory modeling. The answers to
   these questions can be found in the practice of probabilistic modeling
   itself.}},

Abstract = {{Design of underground mining operations, in their preliminary stages,
   often requires obtaining geomechanical data from re-logged rock core
   initially drilled for mineral exploration. The degree of alteration of
   this core due to handling and storage time increases uncertainty in the
   geotechnical parameters assessed and in the estimated required
   excavation support. Uncertainty is primarily related to changes in
   observed joint infill characteristics during storage. This paper
   presents a simple approach to assess this uncertainty quantitatively,
   illustrated with a case study in the Peruvian Cordillera. The Q-System
   was adopted for such assessment and to estimate the required excavation
   support. From results of the case study presented in this paper,
   uncertainty associated with the use of stored core was not considered
   significant when compared to the natural variability of the rock mass.
   Numerical simulations of excavation geometries for different rock mass
   qualities were performed to validate estimated support requirements
   through the Q-System. These simulations required estimations of strength
   characteristics of the rock mass and discontinuities. These were
   estimated from measurements in all core available (old and fresh) and
   considered the uncertainty in the adopted strength envelopes
   quantitatively. The range of model results and sensitivities to effects
   of modeling validated the recommended support requirements. During
   excavation, support requirements would be based on an assessment of Q as
   the excavation proceeds (an observational approach).}},

Abstract = {{The production of biofuels as alternative energy source over fossil
   fuels has gained immense interest over the years as it can contribute
   significantly to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy
   production and utilization. Also with rapidly increasing fuel price and
   fall in oil wells, the present scenario forces us to look for an
   alternative source of energy that will help us in the operation of
   industrial as well as the transportation sector. The pulp mills in India
   are one of the many options. The pulp mills in India can help us to
   produce bio-fuels by thermo-chemical/biochemical conversion of black
   liquor and wood residues. These technologies include extraction of
   hemi-cellulose from wooden chips and black liquor, lignin from black
   liquor, methanol from evaporator condensates, biogas production from
   waste sludge, syngas production from biomass using gasification and
   bio-oil production from biomass using pyrolysis. The objective of this
   paper is to overview these emerging bio-refinery technologies that can
   be implemented in Indian Forest Industry to get bio-fuels, bio-chemicals
   and bio-energy to reduce GHG emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

   components among the DG units based on their rated power, by assigning
   appropriate output impedance values and droop coefficients to each DG
   unit. The voltage control block is a multiloop voltage control unit
   employed to control the microgrid voltage. The detailed model of the
   proposed control architecture is established, and the system dynamics is
   analyzed. Since the synthesis of a local controller uses only
   information of the corresponding DG unit, the design procedure is

Abstract = {{This paper presents a market-oriented energy management system (EMS) for
   a hybrid power system composed of a wind energy conversion system and a
   battery energy storage system (BESS). The EMS is designed as a real-time
   model predictive control (MPC) system. The EMS dispatches the BESS to
   achieve the maximum net profit from the deregulated electricity market.
   Furthermore, the EMS aims at expanding the BESS lifetime by applying
   typical and practical constraints in the MPC problem on both the daily
   number of cycles (DNC) and depth of discharge (DOD). The MPC constraint
   optimizer is designed to tune the lifetime constraints optimally. It
   guarantees the optimal economic profit by finding the optimal DNC and
   DOD to achieve the maximum market revenue from energy arbitrage with the
   minimal expended-life cost. The effectiveness of this work is verified
   by comparison with a conventional MPC used in previous works. Simulation
   is conducted using real wind power and market data in Alberta, Canada.}},

   Equations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PIPELINE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) is a trenchless technology used to
   install underground utilities. The force required to pull a pipe through
   the borehole during installation is crucial to design engineers. Various
   methods have been proposed to estimate the pullback load, each dealing
   with fluidic drag in a different way. Limitations in fluidic drag
   estimation by current design procedures have revealed the significance
   of having a reliable method for calculation. This paper proposes a new
   method to calculate fluidic drag based on annular flow equations. This
   method is used to calculate viscous drag for two HDD case studies, and
   the results are compared to the estimations by current methods, such as
   PRCI and ASTM F1962. Pullback load estimation based on the new method
   agrees well with the actual installation loads. This paper also
   investigates the impact of design factors on fluidic drag by presenting
   a sensitivity analysis over a practical range of related parameters. The
   ratio of pipe radius to borehole radius is observed to have the most
   influence on fluidic drag. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using nondestructive test data has
   become promising for finite element (FE) model updating, model
   verification, structural evaluation and damage assessment. This research
   presents a multiresponse structural parameter estimation method for the
   automated FE model updating using data obtained from a set of
   nondestructive tests conducted on a laboratory bridge model. Both
   stiffness and mass parameters are updated at the element level,
   simultaneously. Having measurement and modeling errors is an inevitable
   part of data acquisition systems and finite element models. The presence
   of these errors can affect the accuracy of the estimated parameters.
   Therefore, an error sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation
   was used to study the input-output error behavior of each parameter
   based on the load cases and measurement locations of the nondestructive
   tests. Given the measured experimental responses, the goal was to select
   the unknown parameters of the FE model with high observability that
   leads to creating a well-conditioned system with the least sensitivity
   to measurement errors. A data quality study was performed to assess the
   accuracy and reliability of the measured data. Based on this study, a
   subset of the most reliable measured data was selected for the FE model
   updating. The selected subset of higher quality measurements and the
   observable unknown parameters were used for FE model updating. Three
   static and dynamic error functions were used for structural parameter
   estimation using the selected measured static strains, displacements,
   and slopes as well as dynamic natural frequencies and associated mode
   shapes. The measured data sets were used separately and also together
   for multiresponse FE model updating to match the predicted analytical
   response with the measured data. The FE model was successfully
   calibrated using multiresponse data. Two separate commercially available
   software packages were used with real-time data communications utilizing
   Application Program Interface (API) scripts. This approach was efficient
   in utilizing these software packages for automated and systematic FE
   model updating. The usefulness of the proposed method for automated
   finite element model updating at the element level is shown by being
   able to lead to simultaneous estimation of the stiffness and mass
   parameters using experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study focused on determining the capability of a proposed two-step
   curing process for composite rebars production. A finite element
   analysis is carried out on rapid curing of fiber-reinforced polymer
   rebars during a continuous braid trusion manufacturing process. This
   process combines pultrusion and braiding techniques to produce
   fiber-reinforced polymer rebars. The system uses a novel two-step curing
   technique to obtain a uniform cure profile. This is achieved by
   embedding small diameter steel wires within the core of the rebar. In
   the first step, as the rebar passes through an induction coil, a curing
   radially in the outward direction is initiated due to the induction
   coil. In the second step, the induction-initiated curing rebar enters a
   series of ovens, initiating radially inward curing. The resulting
   fiber-reinforced polymer rebars can be used as alternative to steel
   reinforcement in applications where steel cannot be utilized due to its
   corrosive or metallic nature. The result of this study showcased the
   importance of induction unit in obtaining a uniform cure profile.}},

Abstract = {{The study objective was to visualize regions of bone that undergo
   pathological mineralization and/or remodeling during pathogenesis of
   osteoarthritis, by employing non-radioactive strontium as a dynamic
   tracer of bone turnover. Post traumatic osteoarthritis was surgically
   induced in skeletally mature rats, followed by in vivo micro-CT imaging
   for 12 weeks to assess bone micro-structural changes. Rats either
   received strontium ranelate daily for the entire course of study or only
   last 10 days before euthanization. Distribution of strontium in bone was
   assessed in two and three dimensions, using electron probe
   micro-analysis (EPMA) and synchrotron dual energy K-edge subtraction
   micro-CT (SRCT), respectively. Considerable early formation of
   osteophytes around the collateral ligament attachments and margins of
   articulating surfaces were observed, followed by subchondral sclerosis
   at the later stages. Accordingly, strontium was heavily incorporated by
   mineralizing osteophytes at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-surgery, whereas
   subchondral bone only incorporated strontium between weeks 8-12.This
   study showed low dose stable strontium can effectively serve as a
   dynamic tracer of bone turnover to study pathological bone
   micro-structural changes, at resolution higher than nuclear medicine.
   Co-administration of strontium during therapeutic drug intervention may
   show enormous utility in assessing the efficacy of those compounds upon
   adaptive bone physiology. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Title = {{Dynamic behavior of an ordinary chondrite: The effects of microstructure

Volume = {{260}},
Pages = {{308-319}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the relationships between microstructure, stress-state and
   failure mechanisms is important in the development and validation of
   numerical models simulating large-scale impact events. In this study, we
   investigate the effects of microstructural constituent phases and
   defects on the compressive and tensile strength, failure, and
   fragmentation of a stony meteorite (GRO 85209). In the first part of the
   paper we consider the effect of defects on the strength and failure.
   Strengths are measured and linked with detailed quantification of the
   important defects in this material. We use the defect statistic
   measurements in conjunction with our current understanding of
   rate-dependent strengths to discuss the uniaxial compressive strength
   measurements of this ordinary chondrite with those of another ordinary
   chondrite, with a different defect population. In the second part of the
   paper, we consider the effects of the microstructure and defects on the
   fragmentation of GRO 85209. Fragment size distributions are measured
   using image processing techniques and fragments were found to result
   from two distinct fragmentation mechanisms. The first is a mechanism
   that is associated with relatively smaller fragments arising from
   individual defect grains and the coalescence of fractures initiating
   from microstructure defects. This mechanism becomes more dominant as the
   strain-rate is increased. The second mechanism is associated with larger
   fragments that are polyphase and polygrain in character and is dependent
   on the structural failure mechanisms that are activated during load. In
   turn, these are dependent on (for example) the strain-rate, stress
   state, and specimen geometry. The implications of these results are
   briefly discussed in terms of regolith generation and catastrophic
   disruption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Worst-case jamming of legitimate communications over multiple-input
   multiple-output Gaussian channels is studied in this paper. A worst-case
   scenario with a `smart' jammer that knows all channels and the
   transmitter's strategy and is only power limited is considered. It is
   shown that the simplification of the system model by neglecting the
   properties of the jamming channel leads to a loss of important insights
   regarding the effects of the jamming power and jamming channel on
   optimal jamming strategies of the jammer. Without neglecting the jamming
   channel, a lower-bound on the rate of legitimate communication subject
   to jamming is derived, and conditions for this bound to be positive are
   given. The lower-bound rate can be achieved regardless of the quality of
   the jamming channel, the power limit of the jammer, and the transmit
   strategy of the jammer. Moreover, general forms of an optimal jamming
   strategy, on the basis of which insights into the effect of jamming
   power and jamming channel are exposed, are given. It is shown that the
   general forms can lead to closed-form optimal jamming solutions when the
   power limit of the jammer is larger than a threshold. Subsequently, the
   scenario in which the effect of jamming dominates the effect of noise (
   the case of practical interest) is considered, and an optimal jamming
   strategy is derived in closed-form. Simulation examples demonstrate
   lower-bound rates, performance of the derived jamming strategy, and an
   effect of inaccurate channel information on the jamming strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy logic operations realized by triangular norms (t-norms and
   t-conorms) have been intensively studied in their theoretical setting
   and used in various applications. These operations are inherently
   numeric constructs yielding numeric results. We pose a question whether
   two t-norms produce distinct results. The problem is formally expressed
   as a certain hypothesis testing where a null hypothesis concerns
   equality of medians of membership grades produced by the two triangular
   norms. In the sequel, we extend a discussion on composition operations
   constructed with the aid of both t-norms and t-conorms (s-t and t-s
   composition operators). A comprehensive suite of experiments deals with
   a collection of commonly encountered triangular norms including those
   endowed with some parameters. The null hypothesis is tested with regard
   to the pairs of triangular norms as well as the same triangular norm but
   having two values of its parameter. We introduce a concept of granular
   t-norms (more specifically, t-norms operating on granular arguments) and
   discuss an idea of granular equivalence of logic operators. (C) 2015

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{158-167}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation on aerated water jets
   at a 45 angle into air. Different amount of air was injected into the
   water jets upstream of a circular nozzle. The focus was on the bulk
   trajectories of the aerated jets, as well as the intensity, size and
   velocity of the water drops in the far-field. It was found that, the
   injection of air into water jets will significantly accelerate water jet
   breakup in air, causing the water jet to spread much wider and more
   uniform. Meanwhile, water drop size became substantially smaller, but
   drop velocity only became slightly smaller. On the horizontal plane at
   the same elevation of the nozzle, intensity of falling water drops was
   noticed to have a Gaussian distribution in the transverse direction,
   while a left-skewed Gaussian distribution in the longitudinal direction.
   At the location of maximum intensity, drop size and velocity
   distributions also approximated Gaussian distributions, while the size
   distribution could be more complex in a pure water jet Terminal water
   drop velocity was correlated with drop diameter, and its value was 20\%
   smaller in an aerated jet than in a pure water jet for the drops with
   diameters of 2-10 mm. The energy dissipation of these jets was
   significant as these jets broke down to drops with relatively small
   terminal velocities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In existing literature, it remains an unexplored question whether any
   inclusion shape can achieve a uniform internal strain field in an
   elastic half-plane under either given uniform remote loadings or given
   uniform eigenstrains imposed on the inclusion. This paper examines the
   existence and construction of such single or multiple non-elliptical
   inclusions that achieve prescribed uniform internal strain fields in an
   elastic half-plane under given uniform anti-plane shear eigenstrains
   imposed on the inclusions. Such non-elliptical inclusion shapes in a
   half-plane can be determined by solving the original problem of an
   unknown holomorphic function in a multiply connected half-plane, which
   is transferred to an equivalent problem of an unknown holomorphic
   function in a multiply connected whole plane based on analytic
   continuation techniques. Extensive numerical examples are shown for
   single inclusion, multiple inclusions and two geometrically symmetrical
   inclusions, respectively. It is found that the inclusion shapes which
   achieve uniform internal strain fields depend on the given uniform
   eigenstrains, and the inclusion shapes that achieve uniform internal
   strain fields for arbitrarily given uniform eigenstrains do not exist.
   Moreover, specific conditions are derived on the given uniform
   eigenstrains and prescribed uniform internal strain fields for the
   existence of two geometrically symmetrical inclusions that achieve

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{481-487}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Thorium fission is a large yet relatively unexplored renewable energy
   source and could help feed increasing energy demands. An analysis was
   performed on the feasibility of replacing the uranium in Canada's
   nuclear reactors with thorium. Thorium only exists as a fertile isotope,
   and so an external fissile source such as U-235, U-233, or (PU)-P-239 is
   required to stimulate the fission process. A uranium plant and a similar
   thorium-fuelled plant were compared over a 40 year operational life
   based on a comprehensive economic analysis. The results from the
   economic analysis were used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG)
   abatement cost compared to the coal and natural gas-based power. The
   economic analysis determined that a thorium plant is more financially
   lucrative in Canada than a uranium plant. An abatement cost assessment
   in relation to gas-fired and coal-fired power plants demonstrated that
   nuclear power offers a cost savings per tonne of CO2 equivalent
   greenhouse gas (GHG) when compared to both fossil fuel alternatives.
   From the values determined for a plant potentially fuelled on thorium,
   the abatement cost when compared to the coal-fired and gas-fired plants
   is -\$10.4/tonne-CO(2)eq and -\$15.7/tonne-CO(2)eq, respectively. (C)

   scanning electron microscopy, energy disperse spectroscopy and X-ray
   diffraction. The mechanical properties of the gradient alloying surface
   are studied using nanoindentation and microhardness testers. The surface
   layer is observed to contain a (Fe,Cr)(7)C-3 phase. There is also a
   decrease in Cr content as grain size increases from the top surface to
   the matrix. These results can be attributed to defects in the
   microstructure induced by the punching deformation process, which
   promote diffusion of Cr in the matrix. The gradient alloying surface
   also exhibited increased hardness due to the grain refining process, the
   Cr solution used and the presence of the hard (Fe,Cr)(7)C-3 phase. (C)

Abstract = {{Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the parameter set of the
   second nearest-neighbor modified embedded atom method (2NN MEAM)
   interatomic potential for silicon (Si). The optimization is carried out
   by tuning the parameters to match a set of physical properties including
   elastic constants, point defect formation energy, phase transformation,
   surface formation/relaxation and stacking faults. Besides the physical
   properties for optimization, other molecular dynamics (MD) predictions
   such as surface reconstruction, point defect diffusion, dislocations and
   thermal properties are also calculated to test the robustness of the new
   potential. Another purpose of this work is to compare various physical
   properties of available MEAM potentials for Si (and Tersoff and SW where
   necessary). It is shown that the new potential gives a better
   description in surface, stacking fault and dislocation. Finally,
   extensive discussion is given to specify the applicability of this
   potential and the validity of the potentials on fracture simulation. (C)

Abstract = {{The coupled thermoelastic behavior of a multi-layered or functionally
   graded hollow cylinder under generally transient thermal and mechanical
   loadings is investigated in this paper. The generalized
   Chandrasekharaiah-Tzou (C-T) thermoelasticity theory, based on the
   dual-phase-lag hyperbolic heat conduction model, is used to describe the
   nature of finitely thermal and elastic wave speeds. The Kapitza thermal
   interface model indicates that the temperature can jump across the
   interface but the heat flux in the radial direction is continuous. With
   the Laplace transform method eliminating the time-dependence of the
   coupled partial differential equations, the problem is theoretically
   solved by introducing a displacement potential function. A numerical
   Laplace inversion technique is then employed to transform the results
   into the time domain. Finally, the effect of heat conduction models,
   inertial and coupling effects, loading types, interfacial imperfection,
   Blot number, and functionally graded profiles on the thermal and elastic
   results is analyzed. Also, the physically unrealistic discontinuity in
   displacement is observed when the cylinder is subjected to a Dirac
   delta-type thermal loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{315-323}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The porous structure of coal is analyzed to understand the complexities
   involved in the process of coal bio-conversion to methane. Computed
   X-ray tomography (CT) imaging is used to obtain the three-dimensional
   porous microstructure of coal in a non destructive manner. Novel image
   processing techniques combined with stochastic analysis are used to
   analyze the 3D images. A mercury intrusion porosimetry study is done to
   analyze the pore sizes present in the coal structure. Finally,
   permeability measurements are done using a conventional core experiment.
   The porosimetry studies show that coal has a bimodal porous structure
   with a primary mode in the range of 5-10 nm and a secondary mode in the
   range of 2-10 mu m. The imaging analysis showed that almost half of the
   pores in 2-10 mu m range are percolating. However the porous volume
   accessible to microbes and nutrients is quite small due to low porosity.
   The permeability analysis at core scales shows that coal is an extremely
   low permeability medium due to its low porosity and small pore sizes.
   Overall, the study shows that one must improve the permeability and
   porosity of the coal matrix to make the coal bio-conversion process
   faster and economically viable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{New synthesized polymeric surfactants have immensely attracted the
   researchers for further development of chemical enhanced oil recovery
   method particularly in surfactant flooding. Contact angle and
   interfacial tension measurement tests are the effective ways to identify
   proper chemicals/surfactants for enhanced oil recovery by
   chemical/surfactant flooding. In the present study a new polymeric
   surfactant was synthesized from pre-synthesized sodium methyl ester
   sulfonate (surfactant) and acrylamide for application in chemical
   enhanced oil recovery. The synthesized surfactant and polymeric
   surfactant were used to measure interfacial tension between their
   aqueous phase and crude oil phase to investigate the efficiency of the
   surfactants in reduction of interfacial tension. The synthesized
   polymeric surfactant has also ability to control the mobility because of
   its viscous nature in aqueous solution. Contact angles of solid-crude
   oil-surfactant interface were also measured to study the effect of the
   synthesized surfactant and polymeric surfactant on wettability
   alteration mechanism. Synergistic effect was studied by using NaCl and
   synthesized surfactants on interfacial tension. Dynamic interfacial
   tensions of the surfactant and polymeric surfactant solutions with crude
   oil were measured at different NaCl concentrations. Interfacial tension
   was found to be lowered up to 10(-2) to 10(-3) mN/m which is effective
   for oil recovery. Measurement of contact angle indicates the wettability
   change of the quartz surface. Comparative studies on efficiencies of
   synthesized sodium methyl ester sulfonate surfactant and polymeric
   surfactant were also carried out with respect to interfacial tension
   reduction and contact angle change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   properties of the face and the edge surfaces of natural molybdenite
   (MoS2) were investigated by direct surface force measurements using
   atomic force microscope (AFM). The interaction forces between the AFM
   tip (Si3N4) and face or edge surface of molybdenite were measured in 10
   mM NaCl solutions at various pHs. The force profiles were well-fitted
   with classical DLVO (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek) theory to
   determine the surface potentials of the face and the edge surfaces of
   molybdenite. The surface potentials of both the face and edge surfaces
   become more negative with increasing pH. At neutral and alkaline
   conditions, the edge surface exhibits more negative surface potential
   than the face surface, which is possibly due to molybdate and
   hydromolybdate ions on the edge surface. The point of zero charge (PZC)
   of the edge surface was determined around pH 3 while PZC of the face
   surface was not observed in the range of pH 3-11. The interaction forces
   between octadecyltrichlorosilane-treated AFM tip (OTS-tip) and face or
   edge surface of molybdenite were also measured at various pHs to study
   the wettability of molybdenite surfaces. An attractive force between the
   OTS-tip and the face surface was detected. The force profiles were
   well-fitted by considering DLVO forces and additional hydrophobic force.
   Our results suggest the hydrophobic feature of the face surface of
   molybdenite. In contrast, no attractive force between the OTS-tip and
   the edge surface was detected. This is the first study in directly
   measuring surface charge and wettability of the pristine face and edge
   surfaces of molybdenite through surface force measurements.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a systematic experimental study was performed to
   understand the fast liquid transfer process between two surfaces.
   According to the value of the Reynolds number (Re), the fast transfer is
   divided into two different scenarios, one with negligible inertia
   effects (Re << 1) and the other with significant inertia effects (Re >
   1). For Re << 1, the influences of the capillary number (Ca) and the
   dimensionless minimum separation (H-min{*} = H-min/V-1/3, where H-min is
   the minimum separation between two surfaces and Vis the volume of
   liquid) on the transfer ratio (alpha, the volume of liquid transferred
   to the acceptor surface over the total liquid volume) are discussed. On
   the basis of the roles of each physical parameter, an empirical equation
   is presented to predict the transfer ratio, alpha = f(Ca). This equation
   involves two coefficients which are affected only by the surface contact
   angles and Hmin{*} but not by the liquid viscosity or surface tension.
   When Re > 1, it is shown for the first time that the transfer ratio does
   not converge to 0.5 with the increase in the stretching speed.}},

Title = {{New rank detection methods for reduced-rank MIMO systems}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{In practical multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, the channel
   matrices often have reduced rank. Reliable detection of the channel rank
   is essential in achieving the significant gain provided by MIMO
   configuration. Existing work on MIMO channel rank detection assume a
   static channel model, so the proposed methods only consider the noise
   distributions while the distributions of the MIMO channels are not
   considered. In this paper, we employ a random channel model and propose
   three threshold-based rank detection methods which take into account the
   distributions of both the channels and the noises. In our first
   algorithm, following existing single-threshold rank detection scheme, we
   rigorously derive an analytical lower bound on the correct rank
   detection probability and propose a systematic threshold selection
   method by maximizing the lower bound. Then we propose two new rank
   detection methods which use multiple thresholds, where each threshold
   corresponds to one possible rank value. The thresholds are optimized
   based on the derived lower bounds on the rank detection probability for
   different channel rank values. The convergence and complexity of the
   proposed algorithms are analyzed. Simulation results on the correct rank
   detection probability of the proposed schemes are provided to show their
   advantage over existing schemes. The mean-squared-error (MSE) and outage
   probability are also simulated to show the importance of reliable rank
   detection in MIMO communications.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDPs and IDRs) lack
   stable 3D structure under physiological conditions in-vitro, are common
   in eukaryotes, and facilitate interactions with RNA, DNA and proteins.
   Current methods for prediction of IDPs and IDRs do not provide insights
   into their functions, except for a handful of methods that address
   predictions of protein-binding regions. We report first-of-its-kind
   computational method DisoRDPbind for high-throughput prediction of RNA,
   DNA and protein binding residues located in IDRs from protein sequences.
   DisoRDPbind is implemented using a runtime-efficient multi-layered
   design that utilizes information extracted from physiochemical
   properties of amino acids, sequence complexity, putative secondary
   structure and disorder and sequence alignment. Empirical tests
   demonstrate that it provides accurate predictions that are competitive
   with other predictors of disorder-mediated protein binding regions and
   complementary to the methods that predict RNA-and DNA-binding residues
   annotated based on crystal structures. Application in Homo sapiens, Mus
   musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster proteomes
   reveals that RNA-and DNA-binding proteins predicted by DisoRDPbind
   complement and overlap with the corresponding known binding proteins
   collected from several sources. Also, the number of the putative
   protein-binding regions predicted with DisoRDPbind correlates with the
   promiscuity of proteins in the corresponding protein-protein interaction
   networks. Webserver: http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DisoRDPbind/}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{156}},
Pages = {{159-173}},

Abstract = {{A life cycle assessment (LCA) is an extremely useful tool to assess the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with all the stages of a crude
   oil's life from well-to-wheel (WTW). All of the WTW life cycle stages of
   crude oil consume energy and produce significant amounts of GHG
   emissions. The present study attempts to quantify the WTW life cycle GHG
   emissions for transportation fuels derived from five North American
   conventional crudes through the development of an LCA model called
   FUNNEL-GHG-CCO (FUNdamental Engineering PrinciplEs-based ModeL for
   Estimation of GreenHouse Gases in Conventional Crude Oils). This model
   estimates GHG emissions from all the life cycle stages from recovery of
   crude to the combustion of transportation fuels in vehicle engines. The
   contribution of recovery emissions in the total WTW GHG emissions ranges
   from 3.12\% for Mars crude to 24.25\% for California's Kern County heavy
   oil. The transportation of crude oil and refined fuel contributes only
   0.44-1.73\% of the total WTW life cycle GHG emissions, depending on the
   transportation methods and total distance transported. The GHG emissions
   for refining were calculated from the amount of energy use in the
   refining of crude oil to produce transportation fuels. All the upstream
   GHG emissions were allocated to gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Refining
   GHG emissions vary from 13.66-18.70 g-CO(2)eq/MJ-gasoline, 9.71-15.33
   g-CO(2)eq/MJ-diesel, and 6.38-9.92 g-CO(2)eq/MJ-jet fuel derived from
   Alaska North Slope and California's Kern County heavy oil, respectively.
   The total WTW life cycle GHG emissions range from 97.55
   g-CO(2)eq/MJ-gasoline derived from Mars crude to 127.74
   g-CO(2)eq/MJ-gasoline derived from California's Kern County heavy oil.

Abstract = {{Understanding the emergence and diffusion of extreme opinions becomes
   important to our globalized society. In this study, we propose a social
   judgment based opinion (SJBO) dynamics model, which incorporates both
   the compromise between similar opinions and the repulsion between
   discrepant opinions, to study the occurrence and spread of extremism in
   two different scenarios. The first concerns a situation in which
   individuals interact with each other through their inner opinions, while
   the second involves a case that each individual updates his inner
   opinion and choice via observing his neighbor's choice. The simulation
   results show that, in the first scenario, a critical uncertainty level
   is present, at which the size of extremists can be maximized. Increasing
   or decreasing the uncertainty level from the critical value can diminish
   or even eliminate the extremists. In the second scenario, high
   uncertainty level tends to promote the development of extremists.
   However, the extremism can be contained or even avoided if the influence
   scope of silencers is large enough. In both scenarios, a large level of
   tolerance can help to reduce extremists as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Vapor-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) during product recovery and
   separation after Fischer-Tropsch synthesis affects the efficiency of
   downstream processing. Proper prediction of the VLLE is necessary to
   improve this processing step in the Fischer-Tropsch process; however,
   there is little guidance on what thermodynamic models to use. A similar
   problem presents itself in processes related to biomass conversion. The
   selection of an appropriate thermodynamic model to describe the nonideal
   VLLE of water-oxygenate-hydrocarbon mixtures was investigated. Cubic
   equations of state, virial equations of state, activity coefficient
   models, and equations of state with advanced mixing rules were
   considered. The evaluation was conducted using both default and
   optimized parameters. Predictive performance was improved when binary
   interaction parameters were optimized using experimental data, but
   parameter optimization is onerous and it is not always practical. It was
   found that cubic equations of state should not be used for nonideal
   systems, and even when combined with advanced mixing rules, there is a
   risk of poor predictive performance. Although the nonrandom two-liquid
   (NRTL) activity coefficient model is often considered for polar
   compounds, this investigation found that the predictive performance of
   NRTL degraded as the nonideality of the system increased. The universal
   quasi-chemical (UNIQUAC) activity coefficient model was the best
   all-around model for predicting the phase behavior of
   water-oxygenate-hydrocarbon systems. The Hayden-O'Connell virial
   equation of state predicted the vapor-liquid phase equilibrium of
   hydrogen bonding materials well. UNIQUAC in tandem with the
   Hayden-O'Connell equation of state is recommended for the modeling of
   Fischer-Tropsch syncrude VLLE when the partitioning of oxygenates
   between phases is important.}},

Title = {{A Mathematical Model to Capture Complex Microstructure Orientation on
   Insect Wings}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Microstructures on insect wings can promote directional drop shedding,
   and the local orientation of these structures is expected to facilitate
   drop removal. However, microstructures may exhibit very different
   orientations at different locations on the wing. Using the march fly
   Penthetria heteroptera, we propose that local orientation of small hairs
   (microtrichia) reflects a balance of three nonexclusive strategies: (1)
   preventing water from becoming stuck in intervenous grooves
   (microtrichia point upslope), (2) shedding water off the wing as readily
   as possible (microtrichia point towards the nearest edge), and, (3)
   shedding water away from the body (microtrichia point distally). We
   present evidence for all three and show that local microtrichial
   orientation is seldom determined by any one factor. We develop a
   mathematical model that employs factor-specific weighting values
   determined via optimization. Our predictions are tested against the
   orientation of microtrichia randomly sampled from a P. heteroptera
   specimen. Using the best-fit weighting parameters, the model displays a
   median residual of 20 degrees; no residual is greater than 46 degrees.
   The model also reproduces qualitative aspects of microtrichial
   orientation, such as bifurcation midway between veins and convergence
   toward peaks. This strong correspondence between modelled and observed
   orientation supports the role of microtrichia as directional antiwetting
   devices and highlights the importance of considering both function and
   wing geometry to explain the organization of natural microstructure
   arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Ultraperformance liquid chromatography ion mobility time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (UPLC-IM-TOFMS), integrating traveling wave ion mobility
   spectrometry (TWIMS) with negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode,
   was used to achieve two-dimensional (2D) separation (drift vs retention
   times) of naphthenic acids (NAs). Unprocessed and ozonated commercial
   NAs were used for method development. Only O-2-NAs were found in
   unprocessed NAs with ozonation creating O-2-NAs and O-4-NAs. Unprocessed
   and ozonated oil sands process-affected waters (OSPW) were examined to
   validate the method for complex matrix NAs. Ozonation increased the x
   number for O-x-NAs (2 <= x <= 5) and also impacted the -Z number
   distribution. OSPW extracted using dichloromethane removed the potential
   for sample matrix impacts and was used for MS/MS NAs characterization.
   The O-NAs (2 x 6) were identified with O-2-NAs separated into three
   clusters indicating isobaric and isomeric species. MS/MS was used to
   verify compounds, while also indicating the presence of CH3CH2S- NAs
   groups. This result may be useful for future studies of sulfur-NAs fate,
   toxicity, and treatment. Overall, the value-added information provided
   by UPLC-IM-TOFMS makes it a promising analytical technique for analysis
   of NAs in complex OSPW samples. Moreover, this methodology can be used
   for other matrices to investigate relative molecular sizes and to
   separate complex species (e.g., fatty acids, lipids), making it
   beneficial for environmental and bioanalytical applications.}},

   Microcantilever Arrays}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Ligand-directed targeting and capturing of cancer cells is a new
   approach for detecting circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Ligands such as
   antibodies have been successfully used for capturing cancer cells and an
   antibody based system (CellSearch(R)) is currently used clinically to
   enumerate CTCs. Here we report the use of a peptide moiety in
   conjunction with a microcantilever array system to selectively detect
   CTCs resulting from cancer, specifically breast cancer. A sensing
   microcantilever, functionalized with a breast cancer specific peptide
   18-4 (WxEAAYQrFL), showed significant deflection on cancer cell (MCF7
   and MDA-MB-231) binding compared to when exposed to noncancerous (MCF10A
   and HUVEC) cells. The peptide-functionalized microcantilever allowed
   efficient capture and detection of cancer cells in MCF7 spiked human
   blood samples emulating CTCs in human blood. A detection limit of 50-100
   cancer cells mL(-1) from blood samples was achieved with a capture yield
   of 80\% from spiked whole blood samples. The results emphasize the
   potential of peptide 18-4 as a novel peptide for capturing and detecting
   cancer cells in conjunction with nanomechanical cantilever platform. The
   reported peptide-based cantilever platform represents a new analytical
   approach that can lead to an alternative to the various detection
   platforms and can be leveraged to further study CTCs.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the optical and physical characterization of metallic
   nanowire (NW) metamaterials fabricated by electrodeposition of
   approximate to 30 nm diameter gold nanowires in nanoporous anodic
   aluminum oxide. We observe a uniaxial anisotropic dielectric response
   for the NW metamaterials that displays both epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) and
   epsilon-near-pole (ENP) resonances. We show that a fundamental
   difference in the behavior of NW metamaterials from metal-dielectric
   multilayer (ML) metamaterials is the differing directions of the ENZ and
   ENP dielectric responses relative to the optical axis of the effective
   dielectric tensor. In contrast to multilayer metamaterials, nanowire
   metamaterials exhibit an omnidirectional ENP and an angularly dependent
   ENZ. Also in contrast to ML metamaterials, the NW metamaterials exhibit
   ENP and ENZ resonances that are highly absorptive and can be effectively
   excited from free space. Our fabrication allows a large tunability of
   the epsilon-near- zero resonance in the visible and near-IR spectrum
   from 583 to 805 nm as the gold nanorod fill fraction changes from 26\%
   to 10.5\%. We support our fabrication process flow at each step with
   rigorous physical and optical characterization. Energy dispersive x-ray
   (EDX) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses are used to ascertain the
   quality of electrochemically deposited Au nanowires prior to and after
   annealing. Our experimental results are in agreement with simulations of
   the periodic plasmonic crystal and also analytical calculations in the
   effective medium metamaterial limit. We also experimentally characterize
   the role of spatial dispersion at the ENZ resonance and show that the
   effect does not occur for the ENP resonance. The application of these
   materials to the fields of biosensing, quantum optics, and thermal
   devices shows considerable promise. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Aims Anderson-Fabry Disease (AFD) is an important cause of
   cardiomyopathy characterized by concentric left-ventricular hypertrophy
   (LVH). We evaluated the extent of left-atrial (LA) structural and
   functional remodelling in this group of patients given that LA
   remodelling is a marker of adverse outcomes in the presence of LVH.
   Methods and results Clinical profiles were obtained and cardiac MRI was
   performed in cohorts of patients with AFD(n = 31), healthy controls (n =
   23), and a positive control cohort with known concentric remodelling and
   LVH (CR/H, n = 21). Of patients with AFD, 58\% were on
   enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT), 84\% were on renin-angiotensin system
   antagonism, and 65\% were on statins. Despite a similar increase in LV
   mass index in the AFD when compared with the CR/H cohort, mean LAvolumes
   for the AFD group were similar to those seen in the healthy control
   group. Following from this, we observed that the percentage contribution
   to LVstroke volume due to elastic/passive and active LA emptying was
   similar in the AFD and healthy control groups, while passive emptying
   was significantly lower in the CR/H group. The consequences of LVH in
   the AFD cohort were manifested in atrioventricular uncoupling, whereby
   the extent of elastic/passive and active LA emptying was not a function
   of the extent of longitudinal movement of the mitral annular plane, as
   it was in healthy control subjects.
   Conclusion Left-atrial structure and function were relatively normal in
   our cohort of patients with AFD, who were also judiciously treated with
   a contemporary strategy that includes renin-angiotensin system
   antagonism, statins, and ERT.}},

Title = {{Validating tyrosinase homologue melA as a photoacoustic reporter gene
   for imaging Escherichia coli}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},

Abstract = {{To understand the pathogenic processes for infectious bacteria,
   appropriate research tools are required for replicating and
   characterizing infections. Fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging have
   primarily been used to image infections in animal models, but optical
   scattering in tissue significantly limits imaging depth and resolution.
   Photoacoustic imaging, which has improved depth-to-resolution ratio
   compared to conventional optical imaging, could be useful for
   visualizing melA-expressing bacteria since melA is a bacterial
   tyrosinase homologue which produces melanin. Escherichia coli-expressing
   melA was visibly dark in liquid culture. When melA-expressing bacteria
   in tubes were imaged with a VisualSonics Vevo LAZR system, the
   signal-to-noise ratio of a 9x dilution sample was 55, suggesting that
   similar to 20 bacteria cells could be detected with our system.
   Multispectral (680, 700, 750, 800, 850, and 900 nm) analysis of the
   photoacoustic signal allowed unmixing of melA-expressing bacteria from
   blood. To compare photoacoustic reporter gene melA (using Vevo system)
   with luminescent and fluorescent reporter gene Nano-lantern (using
   Bruker Xtreme In-Vivo system), tubes of bacteria expressing melA or
   Nano-lantern were submerged 10 mm in 1\% Intralipid, spaced between <1
   and 20 mm apart from each other, and imaged with the appropriate imaging
   modality. Photoacoustic imaging could resolve the two tubes of
   melA-expressing bacteria even when the tubes were less than 1 mm from
   each other, while bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging could not
   resolve the two tubes of Nano-lantern- expressing bacteria even when the
   tubes were spaced 10 mm from each other. After injecting 100-mu L of
   melA-expressing bacteria in the back flank of a chicken embryo,
   photoacoustic imaging allowed visualization of melA-expressing bacteria
   up to 10-mm deep into the embryo. Photoacoustic signal from melA could
   also be separated from deoxy-and oxy-hemoglobin signal observed within
   the embryo and chorioallantoic membrane. Our results suggest that melA
   is a useful photoacoustic reporter gene for visualizing bacteria, and
   further work incorporating photoacoustic reporters into infectious
   bacterial strains is warranted. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under

Abstract = {{Sand production is a critical issue during oil and gas production from
   sandstone reservoirs. Uncontrolled sand production not only poses the
   risk of well failure, but also can cause extensive damage to surface and
   subsurface facilities such as tubing, pumps, valves and pipelines. In
   recent decades, research on sand production has been conducted in
   several fronts including sanding prediction, sand monitoring, sand
   control and well-bore integrity analysis to prevent or alleviate sand
   production and its consequences. This paper mainly focuses on sand
   monitoring based on non-intrusive ultrasonic sensor which produces
   real-time information that can be used for maximizing the safe
   production of hydrocarbon.
   We used non-intrusive ultrasonic sensor to monitor the acoustic signals
   generated by sand particles impacting the pipe wall, and developed a
   methodology for processing acoustic signals based on the kinetic energy
   of sand particles in the pipeline. Further, we developed a procedure for
   identifying and filtering acoustic noise from unrelated events. We
   validated the proposed methodology for signal processing against
   experimental data. The results indicated that the de-noising algorithm
   could filter out the noise from the acoustic data and the model was
   effective for assessing the sand rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An important class of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
   image sensors are those where pixel responses are monotonic nonlinear
   functions of light stimuli. This class includes various logarithmic
   architectures, which are easily capable of wide dynamic range imaging,
   at video rates, but which are vulnerable to image quality issues. To
   minimize fixed pattern noise (FPN) and maximize photometric accuracy,
   pixel responses must be calibrated and corrected due to mismatch and
   process variation during fabrication. Unlike literature approaches,
   which employ circuit-based models of varying complexity, this paper
   introduces a novel approach based on low-degree polynomials. Although
   each pixel may have a highly nonlinear response, an approximately-linear
   FPN calibration is possible by exploiting the monotonic nature of
   imaging. Moreover, FPN correction requires only arithmetic, and an
   optimal fixed-point implementation is readily derived, subject to a
   user-specified number of bits per pixel. Using a monotonic spline,
   involving cubic polynomials, photometric calibration is also possible
   without a circuit-based model, and fixed-point photometric correction
   requires only a look-up table. The approach is experimentally validated
   with a logarithmic CMOS image sensor and is compared to a leading
   approach from the literature. The novel approach proves effective and
   efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have considered the flow of a rectilinear, high
   Reynolds number, Boussinesq gravity current through a two-layer
   stratified ambient, however, far less is known concerning the analogue
   axisymmetric problem. Whereas in both instances there is the possibility
   of a dynamic coupling between the gravity current front and the waves
   that are excited by its forward advance, axisymmetric gravity currents
   entail the added complexity of a radially-diverging flow. Because a
   steady-state formulation cannot then be developed, we instead present a
   one-layer shallow water model that describes the flow evolution for
   various initial conditions and ambient stratifications. We also report
   upon > 30 full-and partial-depth lock release laboratory experiments
   that span a densitometric range 0 <= S < 0.8868 where S = (rho(1) -
   rho(2))/(rho(c) - rho(2)) in which rho(c), rho(1) and rho(2) denote,
   respectively, the densities of the gravity current and lower and upper
   ambient layers. Of principal interest is the initial front speed of the
   gravity current for which good agreement is observed between laboratory
   measurement and shallow water numerical simulation, despite the limiting
   assumptions of the latter. The horizontal distance over which the
   initial front speed is maintained may span several lock-lengths,
   however, this depends on whether or not the gravity current is
   substantially impacted by the interfacial wave(s). For example, when the
   lower ambient layer is moderate and S is large, the transfer of momentum
   from the gravity current front to the wave may lead to a deceleration so
   severe that gravity current fluid is swept in the -r direction. The
   connection between our analysis and problems of pollution dispersion is
   briefly outlined.}},

Abstract = {{A Finite Element Method in mixed Eulerian and Lagrangian formulation is
   developed to allow direct numerical simulations of dynamical interaction
   between an incompressible fluid and a hyper-elastic incompressible
   solid. A Fictitious Domain Method is applied so that the fluid is
   extended inside the deformable solid volume and the velocity field in
   the entire computational domain is resolved in an Eulerian framework.
   Solid motion, which is tracked in a Lagrangian framework, is imposed
   through the body force acting on the fluid within the solid boundaries.
   Solid stress smoothing on the Lagrangian mesh is performed with the
   Zienlciewicz-Zhu patch recovery method. High-order Gaussian integration
   quadratures over cut elements are used in order to avoid sub-meshing
   within elements in the Eulerian mesh that are intersected by the
   Lagrangian grid. The algorithm is implemented and verified in two
   spatial dimensions by comparing with the well validated simulations of
   solid deformation in a lid driven cavity and periodic elastic wall
   deformation driven by a time-dependent flow. It shows good agreement
   with the numerical results reported in the literature. In 3-D the method
   is validated against previously reported numerical simulations of 3-D
   rhythmically contracting alveolated ducts. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The turbulent flow in the midsection of an annular gap between two
   concentric tubes at Reynolds number of 59 200-90 800 based on hydraulic
   diameter (d(h) = 57 mm) and average velocity is experimentally
   investigated. Measurements are carried out using particle tracking
   velocimetry (PTV) and planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) with
   spatial resolution of 0.0068d(h) (size of the binning window) and
   0.0129d(h) (size of the interrogation window), respectively. Both PTV
   and PIV results show that the location of maximum mean streamwise
   velocity (yU) does not coincide with the locations of zero shear stress
   (y(uv)), minimum streamwise velocity fluctuation (y(u2)), and minimum
   radial velocity fluctuation (y(v2)). The separation between yU and yuv
   is 0.013d(h) based on PTV while PIV underestimates the separation
   distance as 0.0063d(h). Conditional averages of turbulent fluctuations
   based on the four quadrants across the annulus demonstrate that the
   inner and outer wall flows overlap in the midsection. In the midsection,
   the flow is subject to opposing sweep/ejection events originating from
   both the inner and outer walls. The opposite quadrant events of the two
   boundary layers cancel out at yuv while the local minimum of spatial
   correlation of u (maximum mixing of the two wall flows) occurs at yU.
   Investigation of the budget of Reynolds shear stress showed that
   production and advection terms act towards the coincidence of the yU and
   yuv while the dissipation term works against the coincidence of the two
   points. The location of < U >(max) also overlaps with zero dissipation
   of < uv >. The production of turbulent kinetic energy is slightly
   negative in the narrow region between yU and yuv. This negative
   production acts towards smoothing the mean velocity profile at the joint
   of the two wall flows by equalizing its curvature (partial derivative
   U-2 <>/partial derivative y(2)) on the two sides of yU. The small
   separation distance of the yU and yuv is associated with slight
   deviation from the fully developed condition. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Introduction: Our objective was to measure the impact on perceived root
   resorption based on the amount of anteroposterior incisal inclination as
   determined in vitro from conventional panoramic radiography. Methods: A
   rapid prototyping model was created to mimic different maxillary and
   mandibular incisal anteroposterior inclinations. Two titanium beads were
   placed on the incisors at the apical and incisal edges. Panoramic
   radiographs were obtained, with the incisors changing relative
   inclination by 10 degrees increments. The length was measured from the
   midpoint of the bead on the incisal edge to the midpoint of the bead on
   the apical edge. By using a length of wire of known size, this value was
   compared in all images to correct for image magnification. Results:
   Changes to mandibular incisor anteroposterior inclinations, as either a
   theoretical proclination or retroclination, resulted in an increase of
   ``apparent{''} root resorption on a panoramic radiograph. When the
   maxillary incisors were significantly and severely retroclined, they
   appeared larger than expected. When the maxillary incisors were mildly
   retroclined, the length was roughly similar to the theoretical model.
   When the maxillary incisors were mildly proclined, they appeared shorter
   than expected. Conclusions: The foreshortening or forelengthening of
   incisor root lengths because of incisor inclination vs root resorption
   cannot be reliably evaluated from panoramic images. The proposed
   theoretical model helps to understand the direction of the changes
   produced by the magnification factor. More severe scenarios where either
   the maxillary or the mandibular teeth are outside the focal trough have
   not been fully evaluated. The clinical impact of these changes is likely
   to be questionable.}},

   compounds with pyridine as a center ring gave cracking, hydrogenation,
   and hydrodenitrogenation products with selectivities that depended on
   the position of substituents on the central pyridine ring. In contrast,
   a series of fused cholestane-benzoquinoline compounds gave only
   hydrogenation of all-carbon aromatic rings.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltenes are formed during the primary upgrading process of bitumen.
   Gasification is considered as a good option for conversion of the
   low-value asphaltenes into syngas. Syngas can later be used in the
   generation of steam for steam-assisted gravity drainage, and the
   hydrogen from the syngas can be used for upgrading. Understanding the
   decomposition of asphaltenes, the subsequent formation of soot, and the
   properties of soot enables optimization of the process of asphaltene
   gasification. In this work, the effects of feed particle size,
   temperature, and residence time on the formation of soot particles
   during the pyrolysis of Athabasca oil sand asphaltenes were
   investigated. Morphological, structural, and elemental properties of
   collected soot were also investigated. The experiments were carried out
   in an atmospheric entrained-flow reactor that was electrically heated to
   a range of set temperatures between 800 and 1400 degrees C, and the
   residence time was varied between 5 to 12 s by controlling the carrier
   gas nitrogen flow rate. The pyrolysis products were air-cooled in the
   collection probe after the reactor and passed through a cyclone to
   separate out particles larger than 10 pm. The particles smaller than 10
   mu m were subsequently passed through a cascade impactor for segregation
   of soot and ash particles in the size range from 0.03 to 3 mu m. It was
   found that asphaltenes devolatilize to produce char, light gases, and
   tar. The different feed particle size ranges used in this study had a
   negligible effect on the analyzed properties of the soot. The yield of
   soot formed increased with the pyrolysis temperature. It was observed
   that the average size of primary soot particles decreases with an
   increase in temperature. The sulfur and hydrogen contents of soot
   decrease with temperature as a result of the liberation of sulfur as
   hydrogen sulfide during the pyrolysis reactions. With increasing
   residence time, the average size of the primary soot particles
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{Although the approximations based on the central limit theorem (CLT) for
   the detection probability (P-d) of the energy detector and of its more
   generalized cousin, the p-norm detector, are accurate for large sample
   sizes, their accuracy is poor otherwise. A recent work has addressed
   this problem by developing a cube-of-Gaussian approximation (CGA).
   However, CGA may not be the only option and thus this letter
   investigates five other classical approximations for deriving P-d. They
   tightly match the exact values even for few samples and thus are more
   accurate than CLT. These approximations have been unnoticed in the
   signal detection research community and this letter aims at making them
   known to a wider audience. Because the range of their potential
   applications could be diverse, to demonstrate their utility, we derive a
   novel expression for the area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve of the p-norm detector.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the achievable rate of the uplink of a single-cell multi-user
   distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each
   user is equipped with single antenna and the base station (BS) is
   equipped with a large number of distributed antennas. We derive an
   analytical expression for the asymptotic ergodic achievable rate of the
   system under zero-forcing (ZF) detector. In particular, we consider
   circular antenna array, where the distributed BS antennas are located
   evenly on a circle, and derive an analytical expression and closed-form
   bounds for the achievable rate of an arbitrarily located user.
   Subsequently, closed-form bounds on the average achievable rate per user
   are obtained under the assumption that the users are uniformly located.
   Based on the bounds, we can understand the behavior of the system rate
   with respect to different parameters and find the optimal location of
   the circular BS antenna array that maximizes the average rate. Numerical
   results are provided to assess our analytical results and examine the
   impact of the number and the location of the BS antennas, the transmit
   power, and the path-loss exponent on system performance. Simulations on
   multi-cell networks are also demonstrated. Our work shows that
   circularly distributed massive MIMO system largely outperforms
   centralized massive MIMO system.}},

Abstract = {{Flame-sprayed nickel-chromium-aluminum-yttrium (NiCrAlY) and
   nickel-chromium (NiCr) coatings were deposited on fiber-reinforced
   polymer composites for use as heating elements of structures that were
   exposed to cold environments. Electrical current was applied to the
   coatings to increase the surface temperature by way of Joule heating.
   The surface temperature profiles of the coatings were measured under
   free and forced convection conditions at different ambient temperatures,
   ranging from -25 to 23 A degrees C. It was found that at ambient air
   temperatures below 0 A degrees C, the surface temperature of the coating
   remained above 0 A degrees C for both the forced and free convection
   conditions, and there was a nearly homogeneous temperature distribution
   over the coating surface. This suggests that flame-sprayed coatings
   could be used as heating elements to mitigate ice accretion on
   structures, without the presence of areas of localized high temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The non-destructive, simultaneous chemical and physical characterization
   of materials at the nanoscale is an essential and highly sought-after
   capability. However, a combination of limitations imposed by Abbe
   diffraction, diffuse scattering, unknown subsurface, electromagnetic
   fluctuations and Brownian noise, for example, have made achieving this
   goal challenging. Here, we report a hybrid approach for nanoscale
   material characterization based on generalized nanomechanical force
   microscopy in conjunction with infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy. As
   an application, we tackle the outstanding problem of spatially and
   spectrally resolving plant cell walls. Nanoscale characterization of
   plant cell walls and the effect of complex phenotype treatments on
   biomass are challenging but necessary in the search for sustainable and
   renewable bioenergy. We present results that reveal both the
   morphological and compositional substructures of the cell walls. The
   measured biomolecular traits are in agreement with the lower-resolution
   chemical maps obtained with infrared and confocal Raman
   micro-spectroscopies of the same samples. These results should prove
   relevant in other fields such as cancer research, nanotoxicity, and
   energy storage and production, where morphological, chemical and
   subsurface studies of nanocomposites, nanoparticle uptake by cells and
   nanoscale quality control are in demand.}},

Abstract = {{On 25 April 2015, a moment magnitude (M-w) 7.8 earthquake struck the
   Gorkha District of Nepal. Two major aftershocks (M-w 6.6 and M-w 6.7)
   followed the mainshock contributing to devastation in many villages in
   mountainous areas north of Kathmandu. This report summarizes
   geotechnical and structural damage features caused by the earthquake,
   which were observed during a field investigation conducted by a survey
   team dispatched by the Japan Geotechnical Society (JGS), the Asian
   Technical Committee of ISSMGE on Geotechnical Natural Hazards (ATC3) and
   the Japan Society of Civil Engineers (JSCE). The post-earthquake damage
   survey was conducted in Kathmandu, Trishuli, Melamchi, Baluwa
   (epicentral area) and Pokhara from 1 to 6 May 2015. A significant damage
   to the historical architectures in the Durbar Square of Downtown
   Kathmandu was observed, while the damage to masonry structures in the
   surrounding area was limited. In mountainous areas including epicentral
   area, non-engineered masonry structures were severely damaged, and
   traces of medium to large scale landslides and rock falls were
   frequently observed. Dam embankment in Trishuli suffered from cracking
   at the reservoir side along its entire length. Such damages to the
   structures and slopes are posing risks of secondary disasters to the
   local residents. Based on the field survey, recommendations related to
   immediate policy following the earthquake and addressed to policy makers
   are made in the conclusion. (C) 2015 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

   effect of surface elasticity on the finite plane deformations of a
   circular inhomogeneity embedded in a particular class of compressible
   hyperelastic materials of harmonic type subjected to uniform remote
   Piola stresses. We incorporate the surface mechanics by using a version
   of the continuum-based surface/interface model of Gurtin and Murdoch. A
   complete solution is derived by reducing the original boundary value
   problem to two coupled first-order differential equations which can be
   solved analytically. The solution clearly demonstrates that the stress
   fields in the composite are size dependent and that the stress field
   inside a circular inhomogeneity is, in general, non-uniform. Two special
   cases which admit an internal uniform, yet size-dependent stress field,
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in experimental DNA origami have dramatically expanded
   the horizon of DNA nanotechnology. Complex 3D suprastructures have been
   designed and developed using DNA origami with applications in
   biomaterial science, nanomedicine, nanorobotics, and molecular
   computation. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) origami has recently been realized
   as a new approach. Similar to DNA, RNA molecules can be designed to form
   complex 3D structures through complementary base pairings. RNA origami
   structures are, however, more compact and more thermodynamically stable
   due to RNA's non-canonical base pairing and tertiary interactions. With
   all these advantages, the development of RNA origami lags behind DNA
   origami by a large gap. Furthermore, although computational methods have
   proven to be effective in designing DNA and RNA origami structures and
   in their evaluation, advances in computational nucleic acid origami is
   even more limited. In this paper, we review major milestones in
   experimental and computational DNA and RNA origami and present current
   challenges in these fields. We believe collaboration between
   experimental nanotechnologists and computer scientists are critical for
   advancing these new research paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{A mini-fluidic ultraviolet (UV) photoreaction system (MUPS) has been

   accuracy in UV fluence measurements, the MUPS can also increase the
   maximal available fluence rate (FR) by similar to 400-fold (i.e.,
   similar to the practical FRs existing in engineering applications), as
   compared to the commonly used quasi-collimated beam apparatus, and
   measure sample absorbance online. Photolysis experiments with two
   chemical actinometers (KI/KIO3 and atrazine) demonstrate that the MUPS
   can easily be applied to photochemical studies in both low (<100
   mJ/cm(2)) and high (>100 mJ/cm(2)) fluence ranges with accurate
   quantifications of FR and exposure time; in addition, online absorbance
   measurements greatly facilitate the determination of photochemical

Abstract = {{An investigation on the low Reynolds number effect on
   hemispherical-tipped Pitot tube measurements was performed by measuring
   the center-line velocity during the laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in
   a 25 mm (1 in.) diameter vertical recirculating pipe loop. The primary
   objective of the study was to reconsider the available low Reynolds
   number Pitot tube data in the literature with modern instrumentation.
   Using the results of this experimental study, a correlation that
   accurately predicts the low Reynolds number Pitot tube behavior has been
   developed. The correlation accounts for an additional viscous term in
   the relationship for the pressure coefficient (C-p) which is not
   accounted for in Bernoulli's Equation. The correlation is semi-empirical
   and accurately fits experimental data gathered in this study, as well as
   a significant body of experimental data available in the literature. The
   correlation, which is based on a Pitot tube Reynolds number calculated
   using the opening diameter (d), has been shown to be provide more
   accurate predictions of Cp for a wide range of opening diameter to outer
   diameter ratios (0.22 <= d/D <= 0.6) than available correlations based
   on outer diameter.
   The transition Pitot tube Reynolds number, below which Bernoulli's
   Equation is no longer appropriate, was predicted to be approximately 35,
   compared to a value of 79 obtained from fitting data collected by
   Barker. The correlation developed in this study provides smoother
   transitions at both ends of the low Reynolds range. At the low end (Re <
   10) it converges with a Stokes Law' analogy, while at the critical
   transition (Re similar to 35) it converges asymptotically with
   Bernoulli's Equation. The correlation also accurately predicts the
   behavior of the pressure coefficient with Reynolds numbers between these
   ranges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Improvement in diluted bitumen dewatering performance with improved
   mixing conditions was evaluated using a factorial design of experiments.
   The experiments were carried out in a confined impeller stirred tank
   (CIST), which provides quantifiable and repeatable mixing conditions
   with more uniform turbulence and flow than a conventional stirred tank.
   Four variables were considered: mixing time, energy dissipation, bulk
   concentration, and injection concentration of demulsifier active
   ingredient. Results showed that all four variables play an important
   role in demulsifier performance. As expected, demulsifier bulk
   concentration plays a decisive role. Lowering the injection
   concentration improved demulsifier performance. This indicates that
   strong mesomixing effects are present due to high local concentrations
   in the feed plume. Increasing energy dissipation and mixing time also
   substantially improved demulsifier performance, allowing the same water
   separation at a significantly lower demulsifier bulk concentration.
   Mixing time and energy dissipation were successfully combined into a
   single variable, mixing energy, which can be used to scale-up mixing
   conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We employed an in situ electrochemical cell in the transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) together with ex situ time-of-flight, secondary-ion
   mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiling, and FIB-helium ion
   scanning microscope (HIM) imaging to detail the structural and
   compositional changes associated with Na/Na+ charging/ discharging of 50
   and 100 nm thin films of Sb. TOF-SIMS on a partially sodiated 100 nm Sb
   film gives a Na signal that progressively decreases toward the current
   collector, indicating that sodiation does not proceed uniformly. This
   heterogeneity will lead to local volumetric expansion gradients that
   would in turn serve as a major source of intrinsic stress in the
   microstructure. In situ TEM shows time-dependent buckling and localized
   separation of the sodiated films from their TiN-Ge nanowire support,
   which is a mechanism of stress-relaxation. Localized horizontal fracture
   does not occur directly at the interface, but rather at a short distance
   away within the bulk of the Sb. HIM images of FIB cross sections taken
   from sodiated half-cells, electrically disconnected, and aged at room
   temperature, demonstrate nonuniform film swelling and the onset of
   analogous through-bulk separation. TOP-SIMS highlights time-dependent
   segregation of Na within the structure, both to the film-current
   collector interface and to the film surface where a solid electrolyte
   interphase (SET) exists, agreeing with the electrochemical impedance
   results that show time-dependent increase of the films' charge transfer
   resistance. We propose that Na segregation serves as a secondary source
   of stress relief, which occurs over somewhat longer time scales.}},

Pages = {{42-50}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents results from a study that quantifies the influence
   of excessive deformation on the damage development in polyethylene (PE)
   pressure pipe. The experimental investigation is through the application
   of a novel two-stage approach to the D-split test of notched pipe ring
   (NPR) specimens. The first test is to introduce damage by subjecting the
   specimens to different levels of tensile strain at crosshead speeds of
   0.01, 1, 10 or 100 mm/min. The second test is to apply monotonic tensile
   loading at a crosshead speed of 0.01 mm/min to characterize the
   mechanical properties for specimens that have had damage generated in
   the first test. Experimental results suggest that elastic modulus and
   yield stress decrease and yield strain increases with increase of the
   strain introduced in the first test. Variation of experimentally
   measured elastic modulus is used to establish influence of crosshead
   speed on the damage evolution in the PE pressure pipe. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nanostructured metals have different mechanical, chemical, and physical
   behaviors in comparison with the microstructured ones. Numerous research
   studies demonstrated that the biological behavior of nanostructured
   metallic implants was improved significantly. Concerning the
   nanostructured metals, decreasing the corrosion rate and the releasing
   of hazardous ions from metallic implants, and thus increasing the
   biocompatibility of implants are due to improving the native oxide
   layer. In the present study, nanostructured 316L stainless steel
   (biomedical grade) was manufactured via equal channel angular pressing
   (ECAP) method. To do so, the 316L stainless steel (SS) was exposed to
   the ECAP operation for eight passes. The impact of the ECAP process on
   corrosion behavior of SS samples was evaluated through performing the
   electrochemical polarization corrosion tests in Ringer's solution.
   Scanning electron microscopy was employed to study the surface
   morphology of common SS and ECAPed SS sample after the electrochemical
   polarization tests. Moreover, the biological behavior of the samples was
   evaluated via cell culture using fibroblast cells. The corrosion test
   results revealed a substantial decrease of corrosion rate from 3.12
   (coarse-grained sample) to 0.42 mu A cm(-2) (for nanostructured).
   Furthermore, the cell proliferation in the interface of nanostructured
   sample and cell culture medium enhanced dramatically compared with the
   coarse-grained one. The much better biological behavior of
   nanostructured SS sample in comparison with the coarse-grained one is
   mostly due to the significant decrease of corrosion rate on the surface
   of SS samples, and the presence of much more chrome oxide on the surface
   of SS sample. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The detection of causal interactions between variables from time series
   data is an important problem in many research areas. Granger causality
   is a well-known approach that uses prediction error to infer causality.
   However, the autoregressive models fitted to data usually do not pass
   model validation tests based on residual analysis, resulting in low
   causality values that can be inconclusive. The method proposed here fits
   models for paired combination of all variables and inferences about
   causality are provided after performing residual analysis. The model
   order is increased until the autocorrelation test of residual and
   cross-correlation test of residuals and input provide an answer about
   causality. The thresholds to decide the existence of causality are
   provided directly by the data. Higher order multivariate systems are
   similarly considered and a test to check if causality is direct or
   indirect is also proposed. The utility of the proposed approach is
   illustrated by several examples including application on a simulated
   data set and routine operating data from industry for causality
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Solving optimization problems under hybrid uncertainty bears a heavy
   computational burden. In this study, we propose a unified structured
   optimization approach, termed robust granular optimization (RGO), to
   tackle the optimization problems under hybrid manifold uncertainties in
   a computationally tractable manner. Essentially, the RGO can be regarded
   as a complementary fusion of granular computing and robust optimization
   techniques. The paradigm of RGO consists of three core phases: 1)
   uncertainty identification, 2) information granulation in which basic
   granular units (BGUs) are formed, and 3) robust optimization realized
   over the BGUs. Following the proposed paradigm, we develop two classes
   of RGO models for general single-stage and two-stage optimization
   problems with separable and higher order hybrid uncertainties,
   respectively. It is shown that both types RGO models can be equivalently
   transformed into linear programs or mixed integer linear programs that
   can be handled efficiently by off-the-shelf solvers. Furthermore, a
   target-based tradeoff model is developed to enhance the flexibility of
   the RGO models in balancing the granularity level (or robustness level)
   and the solution conservativeness. The tradeoff model can also be
   efficiently solved by a binary search algorithm. Finally, sufficient
   computational studies are presented, and comparisons with the existing
   approaches show that the RGO models can bring much higher computational
   efficiency and scalability without losing much optimality, and the RGO
   solutions exhibit a stronger resistance to the uncertainty.}},

   individual classes). The study makes a claim and offers sound evidence
   behind the observation that higher fuzziness of a fuzzy classifier may
   imply better generalization aspects of the classifier, especially for
   classification data exhibiting complex boundaries. This observation is
   not intuitive with a commonly accepted position in ``traditional{''}
   pattern recognition. The relationship that obeys the conditional maximum
   entropy principle is experimentally confirmed. Furthermore, the
   relationship can be explained by the fact that samples located close to
   classification boundaries are more difficult to be correctly classified
   than the samples positioned far from the boundaries. This relationship
   is expected to provide some guidelines as to the improvement of
   generalization aspects of fuzzy classifiers.}},

Abstract = {{A new global nonlinear predictor with a particle swarm-optimized
   interval support vector regression (PSO-ISVR) is proposed to address
   three issues (viz., kernel selection, model optimization, kernel method
   speed) encountered when applying SVR in the presence of large data sets.
   The novel prediction model can reduce the SVR computing overhead by
   dividing input space and adaptively selecting the optimized kernel
   functions to obtain optimal SVR parameter by PSO. To quantify the
   quality of the predictor, its generalization performance and execution
   speed are investigated based on statistical learning theory. In
   addition, experiments using synthetic data as well as the stock volume
   weighted average price are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the developed models. The experimental results show that the proposed
   PSO-ISVR predictor can improve the computational efficiency and the
   overall prediction accuracy compared with the results produced by the
   SVR and other regression methods. The proposed PSO-ISVR provides an
   important tool for nonlinear regression analysis of big data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization
   of a long-arm comb-drive actuator with an externally mounted large
   mirror for optical applications. The provision for an externally mounted
   mirror can be useful for many optical applications, which require large
   and high-quality reflecting surfaces. The angular stretch of the comb
   fingers at the far end is kept smaller than those near the anchor point.
   This structural feature allows the design of actuator arm lengths of
   over 5 mm. The truss of the actuator is designed carefully to support
   the large movable arm. An analytical model for the electrostatic forces
   in the actuator was developed, and detailed analyses for side
   instability and resonance frequency were performed. The complete
   fabrication process involving bulk micromachining of
   silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer using a two-mask process is described.
   A procedure for efficient mounting of the mirror utilizing die bonder,
   vacuum tip, and silver epoxy is demonstrated. Static characterization
   measurements show that the actuator can achieve a rotational angle of 3
   degrees with an applied voltage of 130 V. A resonance frequency of
   similar to 246 Hz for a mirror size of 2 mm x 100 mu m x 1 mm was
   determined by optical characterization; this closely matches with the
   simulation results and the analytical model. {[}2014-0318]}},

Abstract = {{Pipeline hydro-transport, an economically viable means of delivering
   large volumes of biomass, can replace conventional modes of transport
   road, rail, and river - to improve the economy of pulp and paper mills,
   as well as bio-based energy facilities. This paper is a review of
   experimental and theoretical studies conducted by various sectors on the
   transport of wood and non-wood biomass-water mixtures (slurries) in
   pipes. The aims were to collect technical challenges, governing
   mechanical equations, and associated economic issues, as well as to
   identify the gaps in knowledge in the area. There have been several
   experiments conducted on pipeline hydro-transport of wood chips over a
   wide range of pipeline materials, lengths, and diameters. However,
   pipeline transport of non-wood agricultural residue slurries, as well as
   the performance of the centrifugal slurry pump handling such mixtures,
   has recently been investigated in a single lab-scale pipeline facility.
   Several researchers have proposed empirical correlations to estimate
   friction loss in wood chip slurries flowing in pipes and also
   recommended technically and economically optimum pumping velocities.
   Those correlations, however, are reported to come with noticeable
   deviations from one another and from experimental measurements. One
   empirical correlation has been also proposed to predict, with an
   uncertainty of less than 10\%, the longitudinal pressure gradients in
   pipeline hydro-transport of agricultural residue biomass. All the
   experimental measurements and empirical correlations based some studies
   on the economic feasibility of pipelining wood chip-water mixtures.
   These studies proved the concept of economy of scale to be highly
   applicable to biomass pipeline systems. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Originally isolated from bone marrow, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
   have since been obtained from various fetal and post-natal tissues and
   are the focus of an increasing number of clinical trials. Because of
   their tremendous potential for cellular therapy, regenerative medicine
   and tissue engineering, it is desirable to cryopreserve and bank MSCs to
   increase their access and availability. A remarkable amount of research
   and resources have been expended towards optimizing the protocols,
   freezing media composition, cooling devices and storage containers, as
   well as developing good manufacturing practices in order to ensure that
   MSCs retain their therapeutic characteristics following cryopreservation
   and that they are safe for clinical use. Here, we first present an
   overview of the identification of MSCs, their tissue sources and the
   properties that render them suitable as a cellular therapeutic. Next, we
   discuss the responses of cells during freezing and focus on the
   traditional and novel approaches used to cryopreserve MSCs. We conclude
   that viable MSCs from diverse tissues can be recovered after
   cryopreservation using a variety of freezing protocols, cryoprotectants,
   storage periods and temperatures. However, alterations in certain
   functions of MSCs following cryopreservation warrant future
   investigations on the recovery of cells post-thaw followed by expansion
   of functional cells in order to achieve their full therapeutic
   potential. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Abstract = {{The success of cryopreservation protocols is largely based on membrane
   integrity assessments after thawing, since membrane integrity can be
   considered to give an upper limit in assessment of cell viability and
   the plasma membrane is considered to be a primary site of cryoinjury.
   However, the exposure of cells to conditions associated with low
   temperatures can induce injury to cellular structure and function that
   may not be readily identified by membrane integrity alone. Interrupted
   cooling protocols (including interrupted slow cooling without a hold
   time (graded freezing), and interrupted rapid cooling with a hold time
   (two-step freezing)), can yield important information about cryoinjury
   by separating the damage that occurs upon cooling to (and possibly
   holding at) a critical intermediate temperature range from the damage
   that occurs upon plunging to the storage temperature (liquid nitrogen).
   In this study, we used interrupted cooling protocols in the absence of
   cryoprotectant to investigate the progression of damage to human
   umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), comparing an assessment of
   membrane integrity with a mitochondrial polarization assay.
   Additionally, the membrane integrity response of HUVEC to interrupted
   cooling was investigated as a function of cooling rate (for interrupted
   slow cooling) and hold time (for interrupted rapid cooling). A key
   finding of this work was that under slow cooling conditions which
   resulted in a large number of membrane intact cells immediately post
   thaw, mitochondria are predominantly in a non-functional depolarized
   state. This study, the first to look directly at mitochondrial
   polarization throughout interrupted cooling profiles and a detailed
   study of HUVEC response, highlights the complexity of the progression of
   cell damage, as the pattern and extent of cell injury throughout the
   preservation process differs by injury site. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In this paper, two event-based robust sampled-data model predictive
   control (MPC) strategies are proposed based on the non-monotonic
   Lyapunov function approach for continuous-time systems with
   disturbances. Each event-triggering mechanism consists of the
   event-based MPC law and the triggering conditions. We show that although
   the proposed event-triggering conditions are only checked at the
   sampling instants and the control law is piecewise constant, the
   feasibility of the event-based sampled-data MPC algorithm and the
   stability of the closed-loop system are guaranteed in continuous time.
   Besides, the implementation issue is discussed, and we show that the
   proposed triggering conditions can be checked rapidly without obviously
   increasing the computational burden. Finally, an application to a
   nonholonomic robot system is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of
   the proposed results.}},

Title = {{Saturation pulse design for quantitative myocardial T-1 mapping}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Quantitative saturation-recovery based T-1 mapping sequences
   are less sensitive to systematic errors than the Modified Look-Locker
   Inversion recovery (MOLLI) technique but require high performance
   saturation pulses. We propose to optimize adiabatic and pulse train
   saturation pulses for quantitative T1 mapping to have <1 \% absolute
   residual longitudinal magnetization (vertical bar M-Z/M-0 vertical bar)
   over ranges of B-0 and <(B)over cap>(1) (B-1 scale factor) inhomogeneity
   found at 1.5 T and 3 T.
   Methods: Design parameters for an adiabatic BIR4-90 pulse were optimized
   for improved performance within 1.5 T B-0 (+/- 120 Hz) and (B) over cap
   (1) (0.7-1.0) ranges. Flip angles in hard pulse trains of 3-6 pulses
   were optimized for 1.5 T and 3 T, with consideration of T-1 values,
   field inhomogeneities (B-0=+/- 240 H-z and (B) over cap (1)=0.4-1.2 at 3
   T), and maximum achievable B-1 field strength. Residual M-Z/M-0 was
   simulated and measured experimentally for current standard and optimized
   saturation pulses in phantoms and in-vivo human studies. T-1 maps were
   acquired at 3 T in human subjects and a swine using a SAturation
   recovery single-SHot Acquisition (SASHA) technique with a standard 90
   degrees-90 degrees-90 degrees and an optimized 6-pulse train.
   Results: Measured residual M-Z/M-0 in phantoms had excellent agreement
   with simulations over a wide range of B-0 and (B) over cap (1). The
   optimized BIR4-90 reduced the maximum residual vertical bar M-Z/M-0
   vertical bar to <1 \%, a 5.8x reduction compared to a reference BIR4-90.
   An optimized 3-pulse train achieved a maximum residual vertical bar
   M-Z/M-0 vertical bar <1 \% for the 1.5 T optimization range compared to
   11.3 \% for a standard 90 degrees-90 degrees-90 degrees pulse train,
   while a 6-pulse train met this target for the wider 3 T ranges of B0 and
   (B) over cap (1). The 6-pulse train demonstrated more uniform saturation
   across both the myocardium and entire field of view than other
   saturation pulses in human studies. T1 maps were more spatially
   homogeneous with 6-pulse train SASHA than the reference 90 degrees-90
   degrees-90 degrees SASHA in both human and animal studies.
   Conclusions: Adiabatic and pulse train saturation pulses optimized for
   different constraints found at 1.5 T and 3 T achieved <1 \% residual
   vertical bar M-Z/M-0 vertical bar in phantom experiments, enabling
   greater accuracy in quantitative saturation recovery T-1 imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The main disadvantage of standard PID type controllers is the absence of
   self-tuning features. The PlD parameters are expected to vary either as
   operating condition or dynamics of the system vary or at different
   phases of control process with intent to develop an optimal strategy.
   The purpose of this study is to overcome the existing disadvantage by
   using a cunningly chosen nonlinear gain. The novelty of the study
   associates with a sound choice of the best form of nonlinear gains to
   impact the performance of a PID controller when being coupled with the
   cascade nonlinear gain (known as NPlD). An approximation grid evaluation
   of NPID controller used in a feedback control problem is proposed. This
   eliminates a technical restriction when using previous nonlinear
   variation evaluation. The evaluated forms cover a broad range of popular
   variants. To the practicing control engineers who prefer to realize an
   effective NPID control, the proposed approach highlights the potential
   to make a reasonable selection of the nonlinear gain functions without
   requiring any additional process information. (C) 2015 The Franklin

Title = {{Hybrid Genetic Algorithm-Simulation Optimization Method for Proactively
   Planning Layout of Material Yard Laydown}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a hybrid optimization method combining a genetic
   algorithm (GA) and simulation for planning the layout of material yard
   laydown areas. An optimized material yard layout entails efficiency in
   terms of time and cost for decision makers who seek increased
   performance in material handling, availability, and accessibility.
   Laying out materials on yards is mostly performed reactively in current
   practice, where the planner decides daily where to position the incoming
   materials, based on the list of material arrival and required materials
   for consumption, received daily. This policy cannot account for the
   dynamism of material flow in and out of the yard during a construction
   project. In contrast, a proactive materials placement policy can be used
   to address this concern based on incoming and outgoing material
   schedules for a certain period of time. This paper aims to evaluate the
   proactive material placement policy and present an integrated framework
   to determine the optimum layout for placing materials resulting in
   minimum material haulage time. To this end, a hybrid optimization is
   implemented through a case study from the steel fabrication industry,
   where an effective materials handling method could be of great
   significance. The major contribution of this work is the development of
   an approach that performs dynamic layout optimization of materials
   arriving at construction yards, using GA to heuristically search for the
   solution, and use of simulation to model the material handling process
   and determine the material haulage time. Results of the analyses show
   clear merits of proactive material placement over the reactive strategy
   and demonstrate the importance of GA and simulation integration to
   obtain more realistic outcomes. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel sensor clustering-based time series approach
   for anomaly detection. The basic idea of this approach is that localized
   change in the properties of a structure may affect the relationship
   between the accelerations around the position where the damage occurs.
   Therefore, for both healthy and damaged (or unknown state) structures,
   autoregressive moving average models with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) are
   created for different clusters using the data from the sensors in these
   clusters. The difference of the ARMAX model coefficients are employed as
   damage features (DFs) to determine the existence, location, and severity
   of the damage. To verify this approach, it is first applied to a 4-DOF
   mass spring system and then to the shear type IASC-ASCE numerical
   benchmark problem. It is shown that the approach performs successfully
   for different damage patterns. It is also demonstrated that the approach
   can not only accurately determine the location and severity of the
   damage, but can also distinguish between changes in stiffness and mass.

Abstract = {{Silicon-loaded nanoplasmonic waveguides were integrated onto a
   micron-scale characterization beam to allow for accurate and efficient
   nonlinear optical characterization. The waveguides consist of a 95 nm x
   340 nm silicon core that is capped by a 60 nm thick gold film. The
   characterization beam is formed by precision cleaving one waveguide end
   facet and by deep silicon etching the substrate area adjacent to the
   other end facet. This configuration allows input radiation to be coupled
   directly to the waveguides using a microscope objective and output
   radiation to be out-coupled with a lensed single-mode optical fiber. The
   fabrication steps are characterized via scanning electron microscopy at
   various points throughout the process. The fabricated devices are
   optically characterized using an ultrafast nonlinear pump probe
   time-domain spectroscopy setup. Ultrafast all-optical modulation is
   measured in the waveguides on two timescales: tau(1) = 1.98 +/- 0.40 ps

Journal = {{SOFT COMPUTING}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2751-2767}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The study is focused on a development of a global structure in a family
   of distributed data realized on a basis of locally discovered
   structures. The local structures are revealed by running fuzzy
   clustering (Fuzzy C-Means), whereas building a global view is realized
   by forming global proximity matrices on a basis of the local proximity
   matrices implied by the partition matrices formed for the individual
   data sets. To capture the diversity of local structures, a global
   perspective at the structure of the data is captured in terms of a
   granular proximity matrix, which is built by invoking a principle of
   justifiable granularity with regard to the aggregation of individual
   proximity matrices. The three main scenarios are investigated: (a)
   designing a global structure among the data through building a granular
   proximity matrix, (b) refining a local structure (expressed in the form
   of a partition matrix) by engaging structural knowledge conveyed at the
   higher level of the hierarchy and provided in the form of the granular
   proximity matrix, (c) forming a consensus-building scheme and updating
   all local structures with the aid of the proximity dependences available
   at the upper layer of the hierarchy. While the first scenario delivers a
   passive approach to the development of the global structure, the two
   others are of an active nature by facilitating a structural feedback
   between the local and global level of the hierarchy of the developed
   structures. The study is illustrated through a series of experiments
   carried out for synthetic and publicly available data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound detection of developmental dysplasia of

   Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound captures the entire acetabular shape,
   and a reproducible standard central plane may be generated, from two
   landmarks located on opposite ends of the acetabulum, for measurement of
   alpha angle and other indices. Two users identified landmarks on 51 3D
   ultrasounds, with ranging severity of disease, and inter- and
   intra-observer reproducibility of landmark and standard plane locations
   was compared; landmarks were chosen within 2 mm, and the standard plane
   rotation was reproducible within 10 degrees between observers. We
   observed no difference in variability between alpha angles measured on
   the standard plane in comparison with 2D ultrasound. Applications of the
   standardized 3D ultrasound central plane will be to fuse serial
   ultrasounds for follow-up and development of new indices of 3D

Abstract = {{Data clustering has been widely applied to numerous real-world problems
   such as natural resource management, urban planning, and satellite image
   analysis. Especially, fuzzy clustering with its ability of handling
   uncertainty has been developed for image segmentation or image analysis
   e.g. in health image analysis, satellite image classification. Normally,
   image segmentation algorithms like fuzzy clustering use spatial
   information along with the color information to improve the cluster
   quality. This paper introduces an approach, which exploits local spatial
   information between the pixel and its neighbors to compute the
   membership degree by using an interval type-2 fuzzy clustering
   algorithm, called IIT2-FCM. Besides, a Semi-supervising Interval Type-2
   Fuzzy C-Means algorithm using spatial information, called SIIT2-FCM, is
   proposed to move the prototype of clusters to the expected centroids
   which are pre-defined on a basis of available samples. The proposed
   algorithms are applied to the problems of satellite image analysis
   consisting of land cover classification and change detection.
   Experimental results are reported for various datasets of the LandSat7
   imagery at multi-temporal points and compared with the results produced
   by some existing algorithms and obtained from some survey data. The
   clustering results assessed with regard to some validity indexes
   demonstrate that the proposed algorithms form clusters of better quality
   and higher accuracy in problems of land cover classification and change
   detection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel and accurate AC current measurement method for multiconductor
   cables is proposed in this paper by employing magnetic sensor arrays and
   evolutionary algorithms. The positions of several conductors within the
   electrical cables are determined by the computing method. Then the
   currents in these conductors can be measured in real time by using a
   matrix multiplication computation. The mathematical model for estimating
   conductor currents is investigated considering two configurations, i.e.,
   single conductor and multiconductors in the cable. Evolutionary
   computation methods are investigated and implemented to improve the
   computing accuracy. In particular, the performances of a variety of
   evolutionary algorithms in the current computation are compared. The
   differential evolution (DE) computation method is found outperforming
   other methods after conducting numerous simulation studies. Finally,
   comprehensive experiments are carried out by utilizing the DE method to
   validate the theoretical studies. The experimental results sufficiently
   verify the feasibility and reliability of the proposed AC current
   measurement method for multiconductor cables.}},

Abstract = {{The impedance parameters of overhead transmission lines are fundamental

   proposes a method for estimating the parameters using fault records

   the main contributions of this work is the use of the wave propagation
   speed equation to simplify the problem and to improve the estimation
   accuracy. As a result, both the positive and zero sequence parameters
   can be estimated using simple algorithms in a decoupled solution
   process. Simulation results show that the proposed approach has good

Abstract = {{The results of an experimental study of a drill-drop manhole used in the
   City of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, are presented. A drill-drop manhole
   is a vertical drop manhole connected to a deep trunk sewer with an upper
   manhole and a lower manhole. The upper manhole diameter is only two or
   three times that of the lower manhole. Further, the flow in the upper
   manhole is dominated by the momentum of the incoming flow and as a
   result, the weir and orifice outflow types occurring in a relatively
   larger upper reservoir do not occur in drill-drop manholes. Instead,
   four regimes were discovered: deflected jet, stable pool, filling and
   emptying, and full pipe flow regimes. Dimensionless head-discharge
   curves were developed for the upper manhole for all flow regimes, and an
   expression for the sum of the losses in the upper manhole, including the
   entrance loss to the outlet pipe was found from the experimental
   results. Effects of outlet diameter and its length, inlet diameters, and
   their elevations were studied. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Hydrologic Modeling of the Blue River Basin Using NEXRAD Precipitation
   Data with a Semidistributed and a Fully Distributed Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{A semidistributed (DPHMRS) and a fully distributed (MISBA) physically
   based hydrologic models were applied to the Blue River Basin (BRB) of
   Oklahoma in a multiyear mode using next-generation radar (NEXRAD)
   precipitation data. DPHMRS generally oversimulated low flows of BRB
   during the validation stage partly because rainfall events based on
   radar precipitation data are likely too high. However, by adjusting the
   NEXRAD data based on Mesonet gauge measurements, the Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency (Ef) in the validation run is significantly improved from
   -0.16 to 0.46. The model performance of DPHMRS also depends on the
   subbasin resolution, and it was found that DPHMRS can optimally model
   BRB with seven subbasins. Goodness-of-fit statistics of streamflow
   simulated by both models demonstrate better performance of MISBA
   compared to DPHMRS in calibration (Ef improved from 0.53 to 0.82) and
   validation (Ef improved from 0.46 to 0.83) stages. This difference is
   partly due to spatially distributed information of soil, land use, and
   precipitation data for BRB that are partially averaged out in the
   subbasin framework of DPHMRS, while such information are better retained
   in the fully distributed framework of MISBA. It seems a fully
   distributed hydrologic model can more fully take advantage of the
   spatially distributed information of input data for BRB than a
   semidistributed model if such detailed data are available. However, this
   may not be necessarily true for river basins where either data are
   limited, or where river basins have fairly uniform land use and
   nonmountainous terrain characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Process measurements collected from daily industrial plant operations
   are essential for process monitoring, control, and optimization.
   However, those measurements are generally corrupted by errors, which
   include gross errors and random errors. Conventionally, those two types
   of errors were addressed separately by gross error detection and data
   reconciliation. Solving the simultaneous gross error detection and data
   reconciliation problem using the hierarchical Bayesian inference
   technique is focused. The proposed approach solves the following
   problems in a unified framework. First, it detects which measurements
   contain gross errors. Second, the magnitudes of the gross errors are
   estimated. Third, the covariance matrix of the random errors is
   estimated. Finally, data reconciliation is performed using the maximum a
   posteriori estimation. The proposed algorithm is applicable to both
   linear and nonlinear systems. For nonlinear case, the algorithm does not
   involve any linearization or approximation steps. Numerical case studies
   are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

   concerned. The dynamics of the hidden scheduling variables are
   represented by a state-space model with unknown parameters. To assure
   generality, it is assumed that the multiple correlated scheduling
   variables are corrupted with unknown disturbances and the identification
   dataset is incomplete with missing data. A multiple model approach is
   proposed to formulate the identification problem of nonlinear systems
   under the framework of the expectation-maximization algorithm. The
   parameters of the local process models and scheduling variable models as
   well as the hyperparameters of the weighting function are simultaneously
   estimated. The particle smoothing technique is adopted to handle the
   computation of expectation functions. The efficiency of the proposed
   method is demonstrated through several simulated examples. Through an
   experimental study on a pilot-scale multitank system, the practical
   advantages are further illustrated. (c) 2015 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Continuous monitoring of a 15 m high heavily instrumented experimental
   waste rock pile (0.053 wt.\% S) since 2006 at the Diavik diamond mine in
   northern Canada provided a unique opportunity to study the evolution of
   fresh run-of-mine waste rock as it evolved over annual freeze-thaw
   cycles. Samples were collected from soil water solution samplers to
   measure pore water properties, from twelve 4 to 16 m(2) basal collection
   lysimeters to measure basal leachate properties in the region underlying
   the crest of the pile (the core), and from basal drains to measure
   aggregate total pile leachate properties. By 2012, monitoring of pore
   water geochemistry within the core structure of the test pile revealed
   an apparent steady state with respect to weathering geochemistry,
   represented by (i) a flush of pre-existing blasting residuals and
   applied tracers, (ii) declining pH, (iii) a stepwise progression and
   subsequent equilibrium with acid-neutralizing phases (depletion of
   available carbonates; equilibrium with respect to aluminum hydroxide
   phases and subsequent iron (III) hydroxide phases), and (iv) concordant
   release of SO4, major cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Si), and trace metals (Al,
   Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn). Distinct, high concentration `spring flushes',
   characteristic of drainage in northern environments and primarily
   explained by a combination of fluid residence time and the build-up of
   oxidation products over the winter, were released from core drainage
   each season. Following the initial flush, the concentration of all
   dissolved constituents steadily declined, with distinct minimums prior
   to freeze-up. The opposite trend was observed in the cumulative pile
   drainage, in which early season leachate dominated by snowmelt and
   batter flow had low concentrations and late season leachate dominated by
   contributions from the core of the pile (indicated by season end merging
   of core and cumulative drainage geochemistry) had higher concentrations.
   Northern waste rock pile drainage geochemistry is strongly influenced by
   freeze-thaw cycling and varying core and batter subsystem contributions
   to total drainage. A comprehensive understanding of thermal cycling in
   waste rock piles is an important component of temporal predictions of
   drainage water composition based on up-scaling or reactive transport
   modeling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{316-319}},

Abstract = {{Electron work function (EWF), adhesion and friction coefficient of three
   passive alloys were investigated. During dry sliding tests, surfaces
   having higher work functions showed larger coefficients of friction.
   While under oil-lubricated sliding condition, the trend was reversed. It
   appears that when the surface passive film was damaged, the surface
   broken atomic bonds became active, leading to larger friction. However,
   under the oil-lubricated sliding condition, the passive film was
   retained, resulting in a different trend. Surface adhesive forces of
   freshly polished surfaces and etched ones were measured using an atomic
   force microscope. Results of the adhesion measurement are consistent
   with the behaviors of the alloys observed during the friction tests. (C)

Title = {{Effect of surface roughness and lithology on the water-gas and water-oil
   relative permeability ratios of oil-wet single fractures}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{68-81}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses the effect of surface roughness on the water-gas
   and water-oil relative permeabilities of single fractures. After
   manufacturing 20 x 20 cm transparent replicas of fractures developed
   under tensional load, constant injection rate displacement experiments
   were performed. Saturation distribution against time was visually
   monitored and the residual phases were determined for seven fracture
   samples of different rock types. These values were then correlated to
   the fractal and statistical properties of the fracture surfaces.
   Fractures developed from less porous and larger grain size rock samples
   (marbles) showed ``larger scale{''} heterogeneity, which caused residual
   phase saturation in the form of large pockets. Porous rocks with small
   grain sizes (limestones) showed ``small scale{''} heterogeneity yielding
   residual saturations in small pockets. The fractal dimension obtained by
   the triangular prism method has more control on the residual saturation
   distribution than the other fractal and statistical parameters.
   Subsequently, the relative permeability ratios were determined using the
   simplified Corey equation for fracture systems and the conditions
   causing deviations from the ``cubic ratio{''} behavior were clarified
   qualitatively and quantitatively for four different displacement cases
   (water-gas, gas-water, oil-water, and water-oil).
   In the liquid-liquid cases, the deviations were due to a combined effect
   of wettability and roughness. Highly granular (and porous) limestone
   samples, with the smallest grain size out of the seven samples,
   presented the biggest deviation from the ``cubic ratio{''} in the water
   displacing oil and gas cases. The semi-quantitative analysis presented
   in this paper is expected to give new insights into residual phase
   saturation development and the deviations of relative permeabilities
   from the traditionally accepted ``cubic ratio{''} behavior. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Available studies on the shear strength of lightweight steel fiber
   reinforced concrete (SFRC) members without stirrups are scarce.
   Meanwhile, the overall depth of reported specimens in these prior
   studies did not exceed h = 300 mm, preventing verification of a
   so-called size effect in shear for lightweight SFRC. In this paper, the
   laboratory results of six large-scale lightweight SFRC specimens without
   stirrups having overall heights from 308 to 1,000 mm and shear span to
   effective depth ratios of 3.0 are reported. The specimens contained 1 \%
   volume-fraction of hooked-end steel fibers and different longitudinal
   reinforcement ratios. It was observed that the normalized shear stress
   at failure decreases with an increase in the member depth. This
   indicates that a size effect in shear is present for lightweight SFRC
   members without stirrups. Nevertheless, for all specimens, the observed
   shear capacities were higher than the shear strengths predicted by the
   ACI 318-11 and CSA A23.3-04 standards for geometrically similar
   reinforced lightweight plain concrete members. The fib MC2010 models for
   lightweight SFRC gave more accurate predictions of strength compared to
   the ACI 318-11 and CSA A23.3-04 models for lightweight RC members
   without steel fibers.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{791-817}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Unequally sampled data pose a practical and significant problem for
   geostatistical modeling. Multivariate transformations are frequently
   applied in modeling workflows to reproduce the multivariate
   relationships of geological data. Unfortunately, these transformations
   may only be applied to data observations that sample all of the
   variables. In the case of unequal sampling, practitioners must decide
   between excluding incomplete observations and imputing (inferring) the
   missing values. While imputation is recommended by missing data
   theorists, the use of deterministic methods such as regression is
   generally discouraged. Instead, techniques such as multiple imputation
   (MI) are advocated to increase the accuracy, decrease the bias, and
   capture the uncertainty of imputed values. As missing data theory has
   received little attention within geostatistical literature and practice,
   MI has not been adapted from its conventional form to be suitable for
   geological data. To address this, geostatistical algorithms are
   integrated within an MI framework to produce parametric and
   non-parametric methods. Synthetic and geometallurgical case studies are
   used to demonstrate the feasibility of each method, where techniques
   that use both spatial and colocated information are shown to outperform
   the alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical model is developed and applied to investigate
   the fluid flow and heat and mass transfer in a counter-cross-flow
   liquid-to-air membrane energy exchanger (LAMEE). An iterative
   finite-difference method is used to solve two-dimensional steady-state
   flow field and the coupled heat and moisture transfer equations for the
   liquid desiccant and air streams. The model is validated with
   experimental data, and the agreement is within +/- 10\%. The results of
   the numerical model show that the phase change energy plays a key role
   in the establishment of the temperature and moisture content
   distributions in the LAMEE. In the process of air cooling and
   dehumidification, the liquid desiccant temperature is increased not only
   by the sensible heat transfer, but also by the moisture transfer. Also,
   the capacity of the liquid desiccant to absorb moisture from the air is
   shown to be affected by the sensible energy transfer between the two
   fluids. Moreover, it is shown that the counter-cross-flow LAMEE
   effectiveness is between the effectiveness of pure counter-flow and pure
   cross-flow LAMEEs with the same membrane area. It is recommended for a
   practical design that the aspect ratio and entrance ratio should be less
   than 0.2 and 0.1 respectively, in order to achieve a high performance of
   the counter-cross-flow design that approaches within 2\% the performance
   of a counter-flow design. Alternately, the membrane area of the
   practical design can be increased slightly (by 10\%) so that the
   counter-cross-flow LAMEE has the same performance as a counter-flow
   LAMEE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Buoyancy-driven exchange flow between two adjacent building zones
   connected with top and bottom vents}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{278-291}},

Abstract = {{We examine the buoyancy driven flow between two adjacent building zones
   separated by top and bottom vents with and without a source of buoyancy.
   In the absence of a source, by opening the vents, the pressure
   difference between the two zones drives the exchange flow. When there is
   an isolated source of buoyancy, two distinct flow regimes are defined: a
   ventilation-dominated regime in which the flow that is generated by the
   initial temperature difference, and a source-dominated regime in which
   the flow is principally governed by the source. Here, we restrict
   attention to the former case. Thus in each zone our analytical model
   assumes a horizontal interface that separates the upper layer, which is
   comprised of fluid having the initial density of the light zone, from
   the lower layer, comprised of fluid whose density is larger than that of
   the light zone. The transient evolution of such interfaces along with
   the stratification and buoyancy in each zone are predicted. Attention is
   focused on the influence of the effective area, source buoyancy flux and
   the time during which the source is switched on. Because the interface
   elevations change significantly at early times, a non-monotonic behavior
   is predicted for the evolution of stratification in the light zone. We
   also find that the terminal stratification and buoyancy in both zones
   are not impacted by the number of connecting vents; however, this number
   has a strong influence on how quickly steady state is achieved.
   Similitude laboratory experiments help to corroborate key predictions.

Abstract = {{A general method for reliability evaluation of multistate network is
   using minimal path vectors. A minimal path (MP) vector to system state d
   is called a d-MP. Most reported works on generating d-MPs are for a
   particular d value. However, if all d-MPs for all possible integer d
   values are required, we need to call such methods multiple times with
   respect to all d values. A more efficient method is desirable to
   generate all d-MPs. In this paper, we develop a recursive algorithm
   based on breadth-first search to search for all the d-MPs for all
   possible d values. The relationships among d-MPs for different d levels
   are revealed. Each d-MP candidate can be generated by a combination of
   one (d-1)-MP and the vector form of one binary minimal path. Thus, we
   can use binary MPs as building blocks to generate 2-MP candidates, and
   use 2-MPs and binary MPs as building blocks to generate 3-MP candidates
   ... and so forth. When the d-MPs with respect to the maximum d value
   have been found, all the d-MPs for all possible d values are obtained. A
   heuristic for pre-processing the MPs is proposed to improve the
   efficiency of the algorithm. Through computational experiments, it is
   found that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing
   algorithms for finding all d-MPs for all possible d values. In addition,
   we show that the proposed algorithm can also be used to generate a
   subset of d-MPs for all or some d values given a subset of MPs. The
   generated subset of d-MPs can be used for lower reliability bound
   evaluation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to optimize biological fixation of CO2 using
   Chlorella kessleri cultivated in oil sands process water (OSPW). A
   lab-scale closed raceway photobioreactor was designed and assembled for

   rate was developed based on batch kinetics identified in our previous
   study, and was successfully validated against experimental data. A
   model-based optimization method was used to calculate the optimal
   feeding strategies for CO2, phosphate and light intensity which resulted
   in a 1.5-fold increase in the final biomass concentration and a 2-fold
   increase in the average CO2 uptake rate in 240 h (10 days) compared to
   the initial fed-batch experiment over 432 h (18 days). Finally, scale-up
   to large-scale continuous operation was considered, and the optimal
   hydraulic retention time (HRT) and feeding strategy for maximum

Abstract = {{For solid oxide fuel cell with La0.4Ce0.6O1.8-La0.4Sr0.6TiO3 +/-delta
   (LDC-L4ST) impregnated anodes, the electrochemical oxidation rates of
   H-2 and CH4 were significantly improved when H2S (0.5\%) was present in
   the feeds as evidenced by the substantially decreased polarization
   resistance and the improved power density of the cell although H2S did
   not predominantly function as a fuel. Conductivity measurements of
   various anode component materials implied that the addition of H2S into

   performance improvement have been confirmed, three distinct regions for

   atomic force microscopy (AFM). The rheology measurement of the
   interfacial layer by double-wall ring interfacial rheometry under

   processing, from bitumen extraction to sedimentation in mature fine
   tailings (MFT). Here, we report the direct mapping and quantification of
   surface charges on clay nanoparticles using Kelvin probe force
   microscopy (KPFM) and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM). The
   morphology of clean kaolinite clay nanoparticles shows a layered
   structure, while the corresponding surface potential map shows a
   layer-dependent charge distribution. More importantly, a surface charge
   density of 25 nC/cm(2) was estimated for clean kaolinite layers by using
   EFM measurements. On the other hand, the EFM measurements show that the
   clay particles obtained from the tailings demonstrate a reduced surface
   charge density of 7 nC/cm(2), which may be possibly attributed to the
   presence of various bituminous compounds residing on the clay surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of a two dimensional heterogeneous
   computational model for the catalytic reverse flow reactor for the
   combustion of lean methane mixtures. A uniform design method is used to
   generate a table of 41 operating points. The results from these points
   were used to generate a simple empirical model for the reactor at a
   single specified value of the superficial gas velocity. Stability maps
   that show the envelope for operation that satisfy a minimum level of
   conversion and a maximum operating temperature are generated using the
   empirical model. These maps delineate all possible combinations of
   methane concentration, switch time and mass extraction rate that are
   capable of giving stable operating conditions that meet these two
   criteria. The model is potentially useful in model predictive control of
   the reactor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   supercapacitor electrodes}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{38}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{The nucleation and growth of electrodeposited Mn oxide rods has been
   investigated by preparing deposits on Au coated Si at varying deposition
   times between 0.5 s and 10 min. The deposits were investigated using
   high resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy. A model
   for the nucleation and growth of Mn oxide rods has been proposed.
   Nucleation begins as thin sheets along Au grain boundaries and triple
   points. As these nucleation sites are consumed, nucleation spreads
   across the grains. Nucleation of sheets in close proximity causes
   agglomeration and the formation of rounded particles. Some of these
   rounded particles then accelerate in growth, initially in all directions
   and then primarily in the direction normal to the sample surface.
   Accelerated growth normal to the sample surface leads to the formation
   of rods. As rods grow, the growth of other particles accelerates and
   they become rods themselves. Eventually the entire sample surface is
   covered with rods 15-20 mu m long and about 2 mu m wide. The sheet-like
   morphology of the deposits is retained at all stages of deposition.
   Electron diffraction analysis of 3 s and 6 s deposits shows that the
   sheets are initially amorphous and then begin to crystallize into a
   cubic spinel Mn3O4 crystal structure. High resolution imaging of the 6 s
   sample shows small crystalline regions (similar to 5 nm in size) within
   an amorphous matrix.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},

Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{The hot deformation behavior of an as-extruded ZM31+6Y alloy containing
   18R-LPSO (long-period stacking ordered) phase was studied via
   compression testing in the temperature and strain ranges of 200-400
   degrees C and 0.001-1.0 s(-1), respectively, with particular emphasis on
   the deformation mechanisms of LPSO phase. Both the peak stress and
   Zener-Hollomon parameter increased with decreasing temperature and
   increasing, strain rate. At lower temperatures and higher strain rates
   an early shear fracture at similar to 45 degrees relative to the
   compression axis was observed. The activation energy evaluated using
   Sellars and McTegart equation was about 275.9 kJ/mol, which was higher
   than that in the conventional magnesium alloys due to the presence of
   LPSO phase. A modified Sellars and McTegart equation was also used to
   identify the effect of temperature and strain rate on the deformation
   behavior. The activation energy appeared to decrease with increasing
   deformation temperature and strain rate. The microstructural change in
   different deformation conditions could be well understood in terms of
   dynamic recrystallization (DRX) and kink band formation in the LPSO
   phase due to the motion of dislocation pairs having opposite signs. The
   well-deformable LPSO phase was observed to experience thinning instead
   of coarsening due to kinking at elevated temperatures. The
   highly-coherent interface between the magnesium matrix and LPSO phase
   essentially eliminated the potential debonding or micro-cracking which
   was beneficial for ductility. These results revealed a good potential
   for the elevated temperature applications of ZM31+6Y alloy. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Organic composite particles were prepared by first emulsifying an
   aqueous sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solution in a nonaqueous
   ethylcellulose (EC) solution, followed by dehydrating emulsified water
   droplets. CMC and EC are both biodegradable nontoxic materials, but have
   contrasting properties. CMC is a charged water-soluble polymer, while EC
   is an uncharged interfacially active water-insoluble polymer. The simple
   preparative method does not consume unnecessary chemical reagents and
   produces no waste material. The composite particles prepared by
   dehydrating emulsion droplets are readily dispersed in organic media due
   to its biwettable surface terminated with interfacially active EC
   molecules, which allows composite particles to preferentially adsorb at
   the oil water droplet interface. The surface of composite particles,
   furthermore, is water-permeable, which allows water to be absorbed from
   emulsified droplets. The size, composition, and structure of the
   synthesized composite particles are ideally suited for absorption of
   stabilized water droplets from oil-continuous emulsions. The use of the
   composite absorbent particles, described herein, presents another viable
   strategy for dewatering water-in-oil emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{We report a simple approach to fabricate zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire based
   electricity generators on three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks by
   utilizing a commercial polyurethane (PU) sponge as a structural
   template. Here, a 3D network of graphene oxide is deposited from
   solution on the template and then is chemically reduced. Following steps
   of ZnO nanowire growth, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) backfilling and
   electrode lamination completes the fabrication processes. When compared
   to conventional generators with 2D planar geometry, the sponge template
   provides a 3D structure that has a potential to increase power density
   per unit area. The modified one-pot ZnO synthesis method allows the
   whole process to be inexpensive and environmentally benign. The
   nanogenerator yields an open circuit voltage of similar to 0.5 V and
   short circuit current density of similar to 2 mu A/cm(2), while the
   output was found to be consistent after similar to 3000 cycles. Finite
   element analysis of stress distribution showed that external stress is
   concentrated to deform ZnO nanowires by orders of magnitude compared to
   surrounding PU and PDMS, in agreement with our experiment. It is shown
   that the backfilled PDMS plays a crucial role for the stress
   concentration, which leads to an efficient electricity generation.}},

Abstract = {{The fluid coking process is an example of an upgrading process that uses
   hot solids to heat and crack bitumen into more valuable products. When
   feed liquid is sprayed into a fluid bed of hot solids, the solids tend
   to agglomerate, giving simultaneous heating, reaction, and
   disintegration processes. The reaction of mixtures of three Athabasca
   vacuum residues and fluid coke particles was investigated by heating
   them in Curie point reactors in an induction furnace up to 530 degrees
   C. Small scale reactors with machined wells were fabricated from Curie
   point alloy. The yield of coke was measured as a function of the ratio
   of liquid to solid, heating rate, and feed type. Coke yields were
   insensitive to heating rates from 5 to 120 degrees C/s, at a constant
   final temperature. Bubbling was observed as the ratio of liquid feed in
   the mixture was raised above a threshold, depending on the reactivity of
   the feed used. Bubbling was observed to increase with greater heating
   rates, but it had little effect on ultimate coke yield. Coke yield
   increased with the fraction of bitumen on particles for all feed types
   tested. When the coke yields were normalized using the microcarbon
   residue content of the feeds, the results did not give a single trend
   when plotted with fraction of feed present in the mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Sequential dissection is a technique used to investigate loads
   experienced by articular tissues. When the joint of interest is tested
   in an unconstrained manner, its kinematics change with each tissue
   removal. To address this limitation, sufficiently rigid robots are used
   to constrain joint kinematics. While this approach can quantify loads
   experienced by each tissue, it does not assure similar results when
   removal order is changed. Specifically, structure loading is assumed to
   be independent of removal order if the structure behaves linearly (i.e.
   principle of superposition applies), but dependent on removal order when
   response is affected by material and/or geometry nonlinearities and/or
   viscoelasticiy (e.g. biological tissues). Therefore, this experiment was
   conducted to evaluate if structure loading created through robotic
   testing is dependent on the order in which connectors are removed. Six
   identical models were 3D printed. Each model was composed of 2 rigid
   bodies and 3 connecting structures with nonlinear time-dependent
   behavior. To these models, pure rotations were applied about a
   predefined static center of rotation using a parallel robot. A unique
   dissection sequence was used for each of the six models and the same
   movements applied robotically after each dissection. When comparing the
   moments experienced by each structure between different removal
   sequences, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was
   observed. These results suggest that even in an optimized.environment,
   the sequence in which nonlinear viscoelastic structures are removed
   influence model loading. These findings support prior work suggesting
   that tissue loads obtained from robotic testing are specific to removal
   order. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, a sol-gel-synthesized tricalcium magnesium
   silicate powder was coated on Ti-6Al-4V alloys using plasma spray
   method. Composition of feed powder was evaluated by X-ray diffraction
   technique before and after the coating process. Scanning electron
   microscopy and atomic force microscopy were used to study the morphology
   of coated substrates. The corrosion behaviors of bare and coated
   Ti-6Al-4V alloys were examined using potentiodynamic polarization test
   and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in stimulated body fluids.
   Moreover, bare and coated Ti-6Al-4V alloys were characterized in vitro
   by culturing osteoblast and mesenchymal stem cells for several days.
   Results demonstrated a meaningful improvement in the corrosion
   resistance of Ti-6Al-4V alloys coated with tricalcium magnesium silicate
   compared with the bare counterparts, by showing a decrease in corrosion
   current density from 1.84 mu A/cm(2) to 0.31 mu A/cm(2). Furthermore,
   the coating substantially improved the bioactivity of Ti-6Al-4Valloys.
   Our study on corrosion behavior and biological response of Ti-6Al-4V
   alloy coated by tricalcium magnesium silicate proved that the coating
   has considerably enhanced safety and applicability of Ti-6Al-4V alloys,
   suggesting its potential use in permanent implants and artificial

Title = {{A size-dependent structural evolution of ZnS nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Recently, ZnS quantum dots have attracted a lot of attention since they
   can be a suitable alternative for cadmium-based quantum dots, which are
   known to be highly carcinogenic for living systems. However, the
   structural stability of nanocrystalline ZnS seems to be a challenging
   issue since ZnS nanoparticles have the potential to undergo uncontrolled
   structural change at room temperature. Using the molecular dynamics
   technique, we have studied the structural evolution of 1 to 5 nm
   freestanding ZnS nanoparticles with zinc-blende and wurtzite crystal
   structures. Simulation results revealed that relaxed configurations of
   ZnS nanoparticles larger than 3 nm consist of three regions: a) a
   crystalline core, b) a distorted network of 4-coordinated atoms
   environing the crystalline core, and c) a surface structure made
   entirely of 3-coordinated atoms. Decreasing the size of ZnS nanoparticle
   to 2 nm will cause the crystalline core to disappear. Further reducing
   the size will cause all of the atoms to become 3-coordinated. Dipole
   moments of zinc-blende and wurtzite nanoparticles are in the same range
   when the nanoparticles are smaller than 3 nm. Increasing the size makes
   dipole moments converge to the bulk values. This makes zinc-blende and
   wurtzite nanoparticles less and more polar, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Clays, in tailings, are a significant ongoing environmental concern in
   the mining and oilsands production industries, and clay rehabilitation
   following contamination poses challenges episodically. Understanding the
   fundamentals of clay behavior can lead to better environmental impact
   mitigation strategies. Systematic calorimetric measurements are shown to
   provide a framework for parsing the synergistic and antagonistic impacts
   of trace (i.e., parts per million level) components on the surface
   compositions of clays. The enthalpy of solution of as-received and
   ``contaminated{''} clays, in as-received and ``contaminated{''} organic
   solvents and water, at 60 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, provides
   important illustrative examples. Clay contamination included
   pre-saturation of clays with water and organic liquids. Solvent
   contamination included the addition of trace water to organic solvents
   and trace organic liquids to water. Enthalpy of solution outcomes are
   interpreted using a quantitative mass and energy balance modeling
   framework that isolates terms for solvent and trace contaminant
   sorption/desorption and surface energy effects. Underlying surface
   energies are shown to dominate the energetics of the solvent clay
   interaction, and organic liquids as solvents or as trace contaminants
   are shown to displace water from as-received clay surfaces. This
   approach can be readily extended to include pH, salts, or other effects
   and is expected to provide mechanistic and quantitative insights
   underlying the stability of clays in tailings ponds and the behaviors of
   clays in diverse industrial and natural environments.}},

   studies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Through sustainable water management, oil sands companies are working to
   reduce their reliance on fresh water by minimizing the amount of water
   required for their operations and by recycling water from tailings
   ponds. This study was the first pilot-scale testing of a hybrid
   technology consisting of froth flotation combined with filtration
   through precoated submerged stainless steel membranes used to treat
   recycle water from an oil sands facility. The results indicated that the
   most important factor affecting the performance of the hybrid system was
   the influent water quality. Any rise in the levels of suspended solids
   or total organic carbon of the feed water resulted in changes of
   chemical consumption rates, flux rates, and operating cycle durations.
   The selections of chemical type and dosing rates were critical in
   achieving optimal performance. In particular, the froth application rate
   heavily affected the overall recovery of the hybrid system as well as
   the performance of the flotation process. Optimum surfactant usage to
   generate froth (per liter of treated water) was 0.25 mL/L at
   approximately 2000 NTU of influent turbidity and 0.015 mL/L at
   approximately 200 NTU of influent turbidity. At the tested conditions,
   the optimal coagulant dose was 80 mg/L (as Al) at approximately 2000 NTU
   of influent turbidity and <40 mg/L (as Al) at approximately 200 NW of
   influent turbidity. Precoat loading per unit membrane surface area
   tested during the pilot study was approximately 30 g/m(2). The results
   of this study indicated that this hybrid technology can potentially be
   considered as a pre-treatment step for reverse osmosis treatment of
   recycle water. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a Ni-P-WC nanocomposite coating was prepared by
   electroless deposition methods, modifying the typical Ni-P coating
   through the addition of WC nano-particles. The morphology, structure,
   microhardness and corrosion resistance of the Ni-P-WC coating and
   conventional Ni-P coating were analyzed by using the optical
   stereoscopic microscopy (OSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), anodic
   polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It
   was observed that WC nano-particles and Ni-P deposited homogeneously on
   the Ni-P matrix, electroless deposited composite coatings exhibit an
   amorphous structure of the nickel matrix in which crystalline tungsten
   carbide is incorporated. The microhardness of the coating increased due
   to the existence of the nano-particles, and it will be improved after
   heat treatment. According to the results of corrosion testing in the 3.5
   wt.\% sodium chloride solution, the electroless Ni-P-WC coatings showed
   significantly improved corrosion resistance due to its special
   structure, compared to a conventional Ni-P electroless coating, even
   after 40 days immersion, it also exhibited good corrosion resistance
   ability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Rational design of block copolymer micelles to control burst drug
   release at a nanoscale dimension}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{127-139}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{To circumvent the problem of burst drug release from polymeric micelles,
   we designed three layered ABC micelles consisting of methoxy
   poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) as the shell layer (A block); poly(lactic
   acid) (PLA) of different stereo-chemistries as the outer core (B block)
   and poly(alpha-benzylcarboxylate-epsilon-caprolac tone) (PBCL) or
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) as the inner core (C block). The
   micelles were used to encapsulate a model hydrophobic drug, nimodipine.
   The effect of PLA (B block) incorporation and stereochemistry on the
   formation of semi crystalline outer cores in ABC triblock copolymer
   micelles, micelle stability, drug loading and release was then assessed
   in comparison to diblock copolymer micelles. The PLA outer core was
   expected to act as a barrier lowering the rate of drug diffusion out of
   the micellar carrier owing to a high Flory Huggins interaction parameter
   between nimodipine and PLA (chi = 1.35). Introduction of PEA outer cores
   in ABC block copolymer micelles reduced the burst release of nimodipine
   from polymeric micelles without jeopardizing its high encapsulation
   efficiency. In ABC polymeric micelles with stereo-regular PEA blocks;
   semi-crystalline outer PEA cores were not formed, which was in contrast
   to PEO-PLA diblock copolymer micelles. Accordingly, PEA stereo-chemistry
   had no significant effect on drug release in ABC polymeric micelles. In
   contrast to diblock copolymers, no sign of stereo-complexation in mixed
   micelles composed of a 50:50 mixture of PDLA and PLLA containing ABC
   triblock copolymers was observed. The results showed the capability of
   properly designed ABC triblock copolymer micelles as reservoirs for drug
   solubilization and depot release at nanoscale dimensions.
   Statement of Significance
   Polymeric micelles are core-shell nanostructures that are widely used
   for drug delivery. Their hydrophobic core accommodates poor water
   soluble drugs and their hydrophilic shell allows the whole structure to
   be water soluble. A common problem with the use of polymeric micelles is
   leakage of the incorporated drug from these carriers. Here we have shown
   that a properly designed three layered (ABC) block copolymer micelle
   with drug compatible blocks at the inner core and drug incompatible
   blocks at the outer core can be used to reduce the initial fast rate of
   drug release while providing high amount of drug encapsulated in the
   core. Moreover, changes in the chemical structure of the inner core may
   be used to modify the stability of these systems. (C) 2015 Acta

Title = {{A comparison of the adsorptive behaviour of ETS-10, 13X, and highly

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{214}},

Abstract = {{A proposal for the differences in the adsorption characteristic for
   ETS-10 is created by contrasting the adsorption properties of
   as-synthesized ETS-10 with 13X and highly siliceous ZSM-5. ETS-10 is a
   unique structure type in that the walls of the channels where adsorption
   takes place are made entirely of silica, while the chains of titania
   octahedra in the structure impart a negative charge that is offset by
   exchangeable cations; a portion of which intrude into the channels. To
   determine whether adsorption on Na-ETS-10 is driven predominately by
   cationic or van der Waals effects, the adsorption affinity for several
   gases was measured on all three adsorbents. The adsorption mechanism was
   probed by using the isotherms to calculate the enthalpy and entropy of
   adsorption as a function of loading and by contrasting the behaviour of
   ETS-10 against both 13X and highly siliceous ZSM-5. The results of the
   analysis indicate that ETS-10 has, simultaneously, a high affinity for
   molecules both with and without strong quadrupole moments. This
   behaviour is believed to result from a sparse number of highly
   deshielded cations that exist in the otherwise non-polar channels. This
   bi-functional nature is borne out of the crystal structure of ETS-10
   where the cations are located in discrete bands within the unit cell
   rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the structure. (C)

Abstract = {{Porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric membranes with inclusion
   of Fe2O3 nanoparticles and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were
   developed for the Fenton-like catalytic degradation of organic
   contaminants at neutral pH. The PVDF was modified by in situ
   polymerization with methyl methacrylate to improve its hydrophilicity,
   and a range of membranes with different Fe2O3 and MWCNTs loadings were
   casted. The effect of these compositions on membrane morphology, surface
   functionality and hydrophilicity was investigated by microscopic,
   spectroscopic and surface characterization techniques. Contact angle
   measurements showed that MWCNTs did not change the membrane
   hydrophilicity, while the Fe2O3 was effective in increasing
   hydrophilicity. The optimum combination of 0.2\% MWCNTs and 1\% Fe2O3
   induced pore formation and improved membrane permeability. The removal
   efficiency of cyclohexanoic acid (CHA) and humic acids (HAs) were
   evaluated. Batch studies revealed that 48\% of CHA was degraded after 24
   h of membrane exposure with H2O2. For HAs, removal with H2O2 addition
   was significantly higher than without at 53.1 +/- 4.4\% and 281 +/-
   4.1\%, respectively. These membranes also showed a significant reduction
   in membrane fouling. Overall, the permeate flux achieved with H2O2 was
   four times higher as compared to without H2O2 addition which is ascribed
   to the catalytic oxidation of organic molecules which accumulated at the
   membrane surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We provide first large scale analysis of the peculiarities of surface
   areas of 5658 dissimilar (below 50\% sequence similarity) proteins with
   known 3D-structures that bind to proteins, DNA or RNAs. We show here
   that area of the protein surface is highly correlated with the protein
   length. The size of the interface surface is only modestly correlated
   with the protein size, except for RNA-binding proteins where larger
   proteins are characterized by larger interfaces. Disordered proteins
   with disordered interfaces are characterized by significantly larger
   per-residue areas of their surfaces and interfaces when compared to the
   structured proteins. These result are applicable for proteins involved
   in interaction with DNA, RNA, and proteins and suggest that disordered
   proteins and binding regions are less compact and more likely to assume
   extended shape. We demonstrate that disordered protein binding residues
   in the interfaces of disordered proteins drive the increase in the per
   residue area of these interfaces. Our results can be used to predict in
   silico whether a given protomer from the DNA, RNA or protein complex is
   likely to be disordered in its unbound form. (C) 2015 Federation of

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model to perform energy balances and estimate
   hydrogen conversion efficiency from UCG-based syngas. The model was
   developed for H-2 production from UCGbased syngas with and without CCS,
   along with the co-production of electricity and steam in a conventional
   combined cycle plant. In this paper, at base case conditions (H2O-to
   -O-2 injection ratio of 2 and a steam-to-carbon ratio of 3), the
   coal-to-H-2 conversion efficiency is estimated to be 58.1\% for UCG with
   and without CCS. For the plant configuration involving no CCS, in
   addition to H-2 production, approximately 4.7\% of coal energy is
   converted to electricity that is exported to the grid. In the case of
   UCG CCS, a minor energy penalty is incurred; wherein the electrical
   energy exported per unit coal energy is around 2.4\%, with a CO2 capture
   efficiency of 91.6\% being achieved. The H-2 conversion efficiency
   decreases with rise in H2O to -O-2 injection ratio, but increases with
   fall in steam-to-carbon ratio. Effect of ground water influx in UCG on
   the H-2 conversion efficiency is minor, whereas H-2 separation
   efficiency in the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit has a major
   effect. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published

Abstract = {{Ni nanopillar structures were fabricated on glassy carbon electrodes
   (Ni-GLAD/GC) using glancing angle deposition (GLAD). Thin, conformal
   layers of Pt were deposited by a rotating substrate, self-limiting, high
   current density galvanostatic deposition to form Ni-GLAD\{Pt\}/GC
   deposits. The Pt loading in the Ni-GLAD\{Pt\}/GC deposits was
   systematically varied by interrupting the deposition at various
   coverages, and the series of the Ni-GLAD\{Pt\}/GC deposits were
   evaluated as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in O-2
   saturated, 0.1 M HClO4 at room temperature. The optimum amount of Pt
   (initial wt. ratio similar to Pt0.22Ni0.78) was deposited over 800 to
   1500 seconds. These deposits, after dealloying, were about 30 times more
   active by mass and by surface area than a \{Pt\}/GC electrode prepared
   by deposition of Pt onto GC under the same conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the coupled dynamics of the local hydrodynamics and
   global electric response of an electrodialysis system, which consists of
   an electrolyte solution adjacent to a charge selective membrane under
   electric forcing. Under a dc electric current, counterions transport
   through the charged membrane while the passage of co-ions is restricted,
   thereby developing ion concentration polarization (ICP) or gradients. At
   sufficiently large currents, simultaneous measurements of voltage drop
   and flow field reveal several distinct dynamic regimes. Initially, the
   electrodialysis system displays a steady Ohmic voltage difference (Delta
   V-ohm), followed by a constant voltage jump (Delta V-c). Immediately
   after this voltage increase, microvortices set in and grow both in size
   and speed with time. After this growth, the resultant voltage levels off
   around a fixed value. The average vortex size and speed stabilize as
   well, while the individual vortices become unsteady and dynamic. These
   quantitative results reveal that microvortices set in with an excess
   voltage drop ( above Delta V-ohm + Delta V-c) and sustain an
   approximately constant electrical conductivity, destroying the initial
   ICP with significantly low viscous dissipation.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decades, technological advances and mining requirements
   have led to larger, more complex and more costly equipment. This trend
   in mining equipment has resulted in changing maintenance strategies from
   unplanned and scheduled maintenance to a condition-based maintenance
   (CBM) strategy. However, condition monitoring techniques used in CBM
   programmes are more than a maintenance management tool; they can provide
   the means to improve machine performance, production capacity and
   overall mine production. Vibration monitoring is usually the dominant
   technique of CBM programmes for critical machines such as electric rope
   shovels. It has been demonstrated that abnormal machine behaviour can be
   diagnosed using vibration monitoring techniques. However, this article
   aims to show the applicability of vibration monitoring of electric rope
   shovels for post-blast assessment rather than maintenance management. As
   a result, an electric rope shovel's vibrations experienced by its boom
   during different operating conditions are measured by a tri-axial
   accelerometer mounted inside an enclosure on the side of shovel's boom.
   The results show that the amount of apparent energy experienced by the
   tri-axial accelerometer can be used as an indirect measure of muck-pile
   digging conditions. Additionally, instantaneous and/or averaged
   vibration can be used as part of a system to monitor operator
   performance which potentially leads towards a machine with higher
   reliability, availability and maintainability and with higher
   productivity.}},

Abstract = {{In block-mode transmission, single carrier frequency domain
   equalisation-based ultra-wide-band technique is a promising
   physical-layer candidate scheme. Here, the authors address the noise
   variance estimation problem for signal-to-noise ratio estimation in such
   systems. Our investigations focus on the estimation schemes both robust
   to the pilot sequence and the channel type. First, the authors,
   respectively, define the correlated noise samples and the uncorrelated
   ones, where the difference signals or the sum signals of two adjacent
   received pilot signals are included. Then, with the help of the
   Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) theorem, the authors either use the
   correlated or the uncorrelated samples to estimate the noise variance
   based on the difference signals and the sum signals, respectively,
   regardless of the pilot sequences. The corresponding CRLBs are also
   given and analysed. Finally, under either the correlated or the
   uncorrelated noise samples, the authors propose to linearly combine the
   estimator of the difference signals with that of the sum signals where
   the weight coefficients are optimised. Since the proposed two combined
   estimators are not only robust to the pilot sequence but also
   automatically adapt the weights to the channel condition, they can
   significantly outperform the existing estimators.}},

Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new method to detect correlated alarms and
   quantify the correlation level to improve the management of industrial
   alarm systems. The method is mainly composed of three parts. First, a
   so-called occurrence delay is defined as the main cause leading to
   erroneous conclusions from existing methods to detect correlated alarms.
   In order to tolerate the presence of occurrence delays, a mechanism is
   presented to generate continuous-valued pseudo alarm signals. Second, a
   novel approach is given to estimate the correlation delay between alarm
   signals, so that the correlation delay can be separated from occurrence
   delays to obtain real occurrence delays (ROD). Third, a statistical test
   based on the ROD is proposed to determine whether two alarm signals are
   correlated or not, and the Pearson's correlation coefficient is applied
   to quantify the correlation level. Numerical examples and industrial
   case studies are provided to support the proposed method. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The ability to assess geometric asymmetry in the torsos of individuals
   is important for detecting Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). A
   markerless technique using Surface Topography (ST) has been introduced
   as a non-invasive alternative to standard diagnostic radiographs. The
   technique has been used to identify asymmetry patterns associated with
   AIS. However, the presence and nature of asymmetries in the healthy
   population has not been properly studied. The purpose of this study is
   therefore to identify asymmetries and potential relationships to
   development factors such as age, gender, hand dominance and unilateral
   physical activity in healthy adolescents. Full torso scans of 83
   participants were analyzed. Using Geomagic, deviation contour maps
   (DCMs) were created by reflecting the torso along the best plane of
   sagittal symmetry with each spectrum normalized. Two classes of
   asymmetry were observed: twist and thickness each with subgroupings.
   Averaged interobserver and intraobserver Kappas for twist subgroupings
   were 0.84 and 0.84, respectively, and for thickness subgroupings were
   0.53 and 0.63 respectively. Further significant relationships were
   observed between specific types of asymmetry and gender such as females
   displaying predominately twist asymmetry, and males with thickness
   asymmetry. However, no relationships were found between type of
   asymmetry and age, hand dominance or unilateral physical activity.
   Understanding asymmetries in healthy subjects will continue to enhance
   assessment ability of the markerless ST technique.}},

Abstract = {{Finding the location of an object has become very popular in recent
   years. Several control and monitoring solutions for commercial and
   industrial applications are introduced in the literature. Many of them
   use wireless networks or GSM cellular data to find the physical location
   of an object or a wireless node with respect to a reference point. This
   paper presents a new line-of-sight technique for passive localization
   based on a transmitting multifrequency antenna array and a receiver.
   Objects equipped with an appropriate receiver are enabled to discover
   their location within a certain area dictated by the transmitted signal.
   Both frequency and phase variation are used in order to give a highly
   accurate and precise estimation of the range and the angle between the
   transmitter and the receiver(s). Extensive analysis and simulations are
   conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and the precision of the proposed
   self-localization technique. It can be adopted for different frequency
   bands. However, 2.4-GHz frequency is selected where several wireless

Abstract = {{The development of photovoltaic devices, solar cells, plays a key role
   in renewable energy sources. Semiconductor colloidal quantum dots
   (CQDs), including lead chacolgenide CQDs that have tunable electronic
   bandgaps from infrared to visible, serve as good candidates to harvest
   the broad spectrum of sunlight. CQDs can be processed from solution,
   allowing them to be deposited in a roll-to-roll printing process
   compatible with low-cost fabrication of large area solar panels.
   Enhanced multi-exciton generation process in CQD, compared with bulk
   semiconductors, enables the potential of exceeding Shockley-Queisser
   limit in CQD photovoltaics. For these advantages, CQDs photovoltaics
   attract great attention in academics, and extensive research works
   accelerate the development of CQD based solar cells. The record
   efficiency of CQD solar cells increased from 5.1\% in 2011 to 9.9\% in
   2015. The improvement relies on optimized material processing, device
   architecture and various efforts to improve carrier collection
   efficiency. In this review, we have summarized the progress of CQD
   photovoltaics in year 2012 and after. Here we focused on the theoretical
   and experimental works that improve the understanding of the device
   physics in CQD solar cells, which may guide the development of CQD
   photovoltaics within the research community.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{1091-1106}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results in the literature indicate that the water
   solubility in the oleic (L) phase (x(wL)) can be high at reservoir
   conditions in thermal oil recovery processes. However, the effect of
   x(wL) on oil recovery has not been fully understood, especially for
   steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) for in-situ bitumen recovery.
   This research presents a framework for reliable characterization of
   water/reservoir oil mixtures for numerical simulation of steam injection
   processes. The Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR ECG) is used with the
   van der Waals mixing rules.
   A new correlation is developed for binary interaction parameters (BIPs)
   for water with n-alkanes. Unlike previously proposed BIP values, the new
   correlation is based on optimization of three-phase predictions for
   water/n-alkane binaries, including upper critical endpoints (UCEPs). In
   the characterization method proposed for water-containing reservoir oil,
   the developed correlation serves as the well-defined upper limit for
   BIPs of water with hydrocarbon components. A SAGD simulation case study
   for Athabasca bitumen shows that bitumen recovery can be substantially
   affected by x(wL) through the L-phase mobility. The characterization
   method developed in this research can be used with at least one measured
   x(wL) value for a reliable phase-behavior model for steam injection
   simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing is widely applied in tight reservoir
   exploitation. Production is enhanced significantly if hydraulic
   fractures can connect to sweet spots with enhanced permeability due to
   the presence of micro- (and induced) fractures. However, less than 50\%
   of fracturing fluids are typically recovered. This study models the
   mechanisms of water loss and retention in fracture-matrix system and
   investigates their associated time scales under different reservoir
   conditions. Numerical simulation results are analyzed to identify
   circumstances under which these phenomena might be beneficial or
   detrimental to subsequent production.
   A series of mechanistic simulation models consisting of both hydraulic
   fractures and stochastically-distributed secondary fractures are
   constructed to simulate imbibition, fluid re-distribution, and flow-back
   during shut-in and cleanup. Water imbibition into the matrix would help
   to displace hydrocarbons into nearby micro- and hydraulic fractures, and
   this process could lead to an increase in initial rate. Although other
   mechanisms including water loss in desiccated matrix and water trapping
   in induced secondary fractures were proposed in literature, detailed
   understanding of these water-trapping mechanisms is still lacking.
   Fluid-loss and retention mechanisms in matrix and induced fractures are
   systematically investigated. Impacts of secondary fracture distributions
   and properties, matrix permeability, multiphase flow functions, initial
   saturation, water injection rate and shut-in duration on fluid retention
   and the associated time scales are assessed.
   This work presents a quantitative study of the controlling factors of
   water retention. It investigates the roles of multi-scale fractures in
   flow-back behavior and ensuing recovery performance. The results
   highlight the crucial interplay between shut-in duration and properties
   of connected fractures in the short- and long-term production
   performances. The results would have considerable impacts on
   understanding and improving current industry practice on fracturing
   design and assessment of stimulated reservoir volume. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In ultra low permeability reservoirs, the movable fluid parameters
   (including movable fluid percentage and movable fluid porosity) are very
   important measures in that they can provide realistic assessment of the
   amount of fluid that can flow in the porous media. In this study, the
   movable fluid percentage and movable fluid porosity 01 264 core samples
   obtained from the Yanchang group of Ordos basin (China) are determined
   using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NNW) technique. The test results
   show that the T-2 distributions present five typical patterns: bimodal
   distribution with higher left peak and lower right peak (occupying
   26.52\%), bimodal distribution with lower left peak but higher right
   peak (occupying 37.50\%), bimodal distribution with similar amplitudes
   of the two peaks (occupying 35.23\%), unimodel distribution (occupying
   0.38\%), and triple-peak distribution (occupying 0.38\%). The pore
   throat radius exists mainly over the ranges of 1-10 mu m and 10-100 mu
   m, while the T-2 cutoff value is found to mainly distribute between 5.34
   and 20.00 ms. The average movable fluid percentage and average movable
   fluid porosity of the 264 core samples are 48.35\% and 5.43\%,
   respectively. The movable fluid percentage shows almost no correlation
   with porosity; it varies dramatically when the permeability is low and
   tends to converge to a higher value with an increase in permeability.
   The movable fluid porosity exhibits a relatively good correlation with
   core porosity as well as core permeability. There is obvious difference
   between the movable fluid parameters and physical property in different
   reservoirs because of the difference in wettability, microcrack and pore
   structure. The movable fluid parameters are comprehensive reflection of
   micro-characteristics of ultra-low permeability reservoir. Crown

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Principal component analysis has been widely used in the process
   industries for the purpose of monitoring abnormal behaviour. The process
   of reducing dimension is obtained through PCA, while T-tests are used to
   test for abnormality. Some of the main contributions to the success of
   PCA is its ability to not only detect problems, but to also give some
   indication as to where these problems are located. However, PCA and the
   T-test make use of Gaussian assumptions which may not be suitable in
   process fault detection. A previous modification of this method is the
   use of independent component analysis (ICA) for dimension reduction
   combined with kernel density estimation for detecting abnormality; like
   PCA, this method points out location of the problems based on linear
   data-driven methods, but without the Gaussian assumptions. Both ICA and
   PCA, however, suffer from challenges in interpreting results, which can
   make it difficult to quickly act once a fault has been detected online.
   This paper proposes the use of Bayesian networks for dimension reduction
   which allows the use of process knowledge enabling more intelligent
   dimension reduction and easier interpretation of results. The dimension
   reduction technique is combined with multivariate kernel density
   estimation, making this technique effective for non-linear relationships
   with non-Gaussian variables. The performance of PCA, ICA and Bayesian
   networks are compared on data from an industrial scale plant. (C) 2015

Title = {{Efficiency of Steam-Over-Solvent-Injection-in-Fractured-Reservoirs
   (SOS-FR) Method Considering Oil Recovery and Solvent Retrieval:
   Core-Scale Experimentation}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Sole injection of steam or solvent into heterogeneous reservoirs usually
   yields an inefficient recovery performance. The
   steam-over-solvent-injection-in-fractured-reservoirs (SOS-FR) method was
   suggested as a solution to improve the efficiency of heavy-oil/bitumen
   recovery from fractured carbonates and oil-sands reservoirs after cold
   production (Al-Bahlani and Babadagli 2008). The method consists of three
   phases: Phase 1, where steam is injected at low temperatures to heat the
   matrix and condition the oil for subsequent solvent injection; Phase 2,
   when solvent-injection dilutes matrix oil by diffusion and enhances
   gravity-drainage recovery rate; and Phase 3, when low-temperature (at
   approximately the boiling point of solvent) steam injection retrieves
   the solvent diffused into matrix.
   Previous research was focused on the effectiveness of Phases 1 and 2 of
   the method (Al-Bahlani and Babadagli 2009a, b), and positive responses
   were reported at the field scale (Al-Bahlani and Babadagli 2010) with
   high ultimate recoveries. The efficiency of this process, however, is
   determined purely by the amount of solvent retrieved at the end of the
   process. This paper, therefore, focuses on Phase 3, which is performed
   mainly for solvent retrieval (additional oil is also produced during
   this phase). Twenty-two static core experiments were performed on
   water-and oil-wet sandstone and limestone. After saturating the rock
   samples with different heavy oils, they were immersed into different
   liquid solvents-hexane, heptane, decane, and diluent oil. Diluent oil
   used in this study is a distillate that was obtained from a
   heavy-oil-upgrading unit in Canada. Once the ultimate recovery was
   achieved by diffusion and gravity drainage (Phase 2), the samples were
   exposed to different temperatures of hot water (Phase 3) and the amount
   of solvent retrieved was measured through volumetric and weight
   measurements and refractometer readings. The retrieval of solvent
   diffused into matrix was caused mainly by two reasons: (1) evaporation
   of solvent at elevated temperature and (2) imbibition of hot water into
   rock (if oil-wet samples become more water-wet during Phase 2).
   The amount of solvent retrieved through these processes was determined,
   and the efficiencies were analyzed for different parameters, including
   rock wettability, oil viscosity, solvent type, solvent-soaking period,
   rock type, boundary conditions, different combinations of steam/solvent
   cycle, and temperature applied.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of chloride and thiosulfate ions on localized corrosion of
   alloy 800 are investigated through dynamical observation of the change
   in phase image of the diffusion layer during passive film breakdown
   using digital holography. The results indicate that solution chemistry
   has a significant effect on film breakdown and diffusion layer. The
   phase distribution changes at different applied potentials show that in
   the process of film breakdown, dissolution of metal ions from pitting is
   not remarkable in chloride-only solution, whereas dissolution of metal
   ions is significantly high in thiosulfate and chloride solution.
   Thiosulfate has a combined effect with chloride ions in passive film
   degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The trend of growing interest in alternative source of energy focuses on
   renewable products worldwide. However, the situation of petroleum
   industries in many countries needs much concern in improving the oil
   recovery technique. Chemical method, especially microemulsion flooding,
   plays an important role in enhanced oil recovery technique due to its
   ability to reduce interfacial tension between oil and water to a large
   extent as well as alter wettability of reservoir rocks. Surfactant-based
   chemical systems have been reported in many academic studies and their
   technological implementations are potential candidates in enhanced oil
   recovery activities. This paper reviews the role of different types of
   surfactants in enhanced oil recovery, structure of microemulsion, phase
   behavior of oil-brine-surfactant/cosurfactant systems with variation of
   different parameters such as salinity, temperature, pressure and
   physicochemical properties of microemulsions including solubilization
   capacity, interfacial tension, viscosity and density under reservoir
   conditions. The enhanced oil productivity by microemulsion flooding with
   different surfactant/cosurfactant systems has also been discussed in
   this paper. This review introduces a new opening in enhanced oil
   recovery by microemulsion flooding with some new aspects.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A dynamic fundamental model was developed linking processes from the
   microscopic scale to the equipment scale for batch froth flotation.
   State estimation, fault detection, and disturbance identification were
   implemented using the extended Kalman filter (EKF), which reconciles
   real-time measurements with dynamic models. The online measurements for
   the EKF were obtained through image analysis of froth images that were
   captured and analyzed using the commercial package VisioFroth
   (Metso((R)) Minerals). The extracted image features were then correlated
   to recovery using principal component analysis and partial least squares
   regression. The performance of real-time state estimation and fault
   detection was validated using batch flotation of pure galena at various
   operating conditions. The image features that were strongly
   representative of recovery were identified, and calibration and
   validation were performed against off-line measurements of recovery. The
   EKF successfully captured the dynamics of the process by updating the
   model states and parameters using the online measurements. Finally,
   disturbances in the air flow rate and impeller speed were introduced
   into the system, and the dynamic behavior of the flotation process was
   successfully tracked and the disturbances were identified using state
   estimation.}},

Journal = {{BIOMASS \& BIOENERGY}},

Abstract = {{A process model was developed to determine the net energy ratio (NER)
   for both regular and steam-pretreated pellet production from
   ligno-cellulosic biomass. NER is a ratio of the net energy output to the
   total net energy input from non-renewable energy source into the system.
   Scenarios were developed to measure the effect of temperature and level
   of steam pretreatment on the NER of both production processes. The NER
   for the base case at 6 kg h(-1) is 1.29 and 5.0 for steam-pretreated and
   regular pellet production respectively. However, at the large scale NER
   would improve. The major factor for NER is energy for steam and drying
   unit. The sensitivity analysis for the model shows that the optimum
   temperature for steam pretreatment is 200 degrees C with 50\%
   pretreatment (Steam pretreating 50\% feed stock, while the rest is
   undergoing regular pelletization). Uncertainty result for
   steam-pretreated and regular pellet is 1.35 +/- 0.09 and 4.52 +/- 0.34
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{5595-5599}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Viscosity of bitumen solutions in heptol (80:20) and heptane above the
   onset of asphaltene precipitation decreases continually with aging for
   up to 30 days, while in toluene, there was no detectable change in the
   viscosity. The decrease of the viscosity at these conditions was related
   to the formation of asphaltene aggregates and aggregate dusters, which
   precipitated out and, as a result, decreased the bitumen (asphaltene)
   content of the solution. The observed time dependence of the viscosity
   reduction suggests that the asphaltene aggregation/precipitation is a
   continuous process with the time scale of weeks. The asphaltene
   aggregation/precipitation rate depends upon the aromaticity of the
   diluent, with higher rates observed for heptane compared to heptol
   (80:20). These results add to the current understanding of the relation
   between aggregation of asphaltenes and viscosity of diluted bitumen,
   which is important for improving heavy oil extraction and processing
   technologies.}},

   is calculated by using the measured magnetic fields associated with the
   power line currents. The proposed method is a non-contact and power
   disturbance-free device. Its theory and basic operation principle are
   presented. The results of the simulation studies carried out for

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a point-of-care biosensor design. The
   uniqueness of our design is in its capability for detecting a wide
   variety of target biomolecules and the simplicity of nanoparticle
   enhanced electrical detection. The electrical properties of
   interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) and the mechanism for gold
   nanoparticle-enhanced impedance-based biosensor systems based on these
   electrodes are simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics software.
   Understanding these properties and how they can be affected is vital in
   designing effective biosensor devices. Simulations were used to show
   electrical screening develop over time for IDEs in a salt solution, as
   well as the electric field between individual digits of electrodes.
   Using these simulations, it was observed that gold nanoparticles bound
   closely to IDEs can lower the electric field magnitude between the
   digits of the electrode. The simulations are also shown to be a useful
   design tool in optimizing sensor function. Various different conditions,
   such as electrode dimensions and background ion concentrations, are
   shown to have a significant impact on the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A microwave planar resonator with a very high quality factor is
   presented for sensing applications. The proposed resonator uses an
   active feedback loop with a microwave amplifier to generate negative
   resistance to compensate the resonator's loss and increases the loaded
   quality factor of the system. This high quality resonator is based on a
   planar microstrip resonator with a primary quality factor of 200. The
   active loop technique increases the primary quality factor up to 15,480
   with no other material in its surrounding environment when measured at
   1.55 GHz resonance frequency. The high quality factor of the designed
   resonator provides very high resolution for detection of permittivity
   variation in its ambient environment with a theoretical resolution of
   0.1 ppb (10(-10)). It is experimentally demonstrated that the small
   permittivity variations such as that of foam (with permittivity very
   close to air) can be detected. The circuit demonstrated a resolution of
   26 dB in amplitude for a 1 MHz variation in the frequency domain. (C)

Abstract = {{Pipeline hydro-transport is an alternative to truck delivery of
   agricultural residue (lignocellulosic) biomass. Pipeline hydro-transport
   benefits from economies of scale, reduces total delivery costs, and
   enables bio-based energy facilities to achieve higher capacities. In
   this study, the empirical correlation based on experimentally developed
   data for pipeline transport of agricultural residue-water mixtures
   (slurry) was used to develop a data-intensive techno-economic model to
   estimate the cost of pipeline hydro-transport of wheat straw and corn
   stover to a bioethanol refinery. The total cost of pipeline
   hydro-transport was found to be lowest at 8.8\% dry matter slurry solid
   mass content and 2.5 m s(-1) slurry velocity. At this biomass slurry
   solid mass content and velocity, the pipeline hydro-transport of biomass
   was found to be economically more viable than truck delivery at
   capacities of 0.45 M dry t yr(-1) or more for a one-way pipeline and 1.4
   M dry t yr(-1) or more for a two-way pipeline (with the return of the
   carrier liquid). The ability to economically hydro-transport
   agricultural residue biomass in pipes offers the opportunity to develop
   large-scale bioethanol plants. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and

Title = {{Gravity current flow over sinusoidal topography in a two-layer ambient}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We report upon a laboratory experimental study of dense full-and
   partial-depth locks released gravity currents propagating through a
   two-layer ambient and over sinusoidal topography of amplitude A and
   wavelength lambda. Attention is restricted to a Boussinesq flow regime
   and the initial (or slumping) stage of motion. Because of the presence
   of the topography, the lower layer depth and channel depth vary in the
   downstream direction by as much as +/- 52\% and +/- 40\%, respectively.
   Despite such large variations, the instantaneous gravity current front
   speed typically changes by only a small amount from its average value,
   (U) over bar. We conclude that the reason for this unexpected
   observation is a counterbalancing between the contraction/expansion of
   the channel on one hand and along-slope variations of the buoyancy force
   on the other hand. Compared to the case of gravity current flow over a
   horizontal surface, the topography has a retarding effect on (U) over
   bar; we characterize the variation of (U) over bar with the following
   parameters: A, A/lambda, the interface height, the height of gravity
   current fluid inside the lock, and the layer densities as characterized
   by S equivalent to (rho(1) - rho(2))/(rho(0) - rho(2)) where rho(0) is
   the gravity current density, rho(1) is the lower ambient layer density,
   and rho(2) is the upper ambient layer density. The topography also
   alters the structure of the gravity current head by inducing
   large-scaleKelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortices directly downstream of
   regions of significant shear. These vortices are transient flow
   features; after formation and saturation, they relax at which point
   gravity current fluid sloshes back and forth in the topographic troughs.
   A simple geometric model is presented that prescribes the minimum number
   of topographic peaks a gravity current fluid will overcome. As in the
   horizontal bottom case, the forward advance of the gravity current can
   excite a downstream-propagating interfacial disturbance, which is more
   prominent for larger S. We identify when the gravity current front will
   travel faster (supercritical flow) or slower (subcritical flow) than the
   interfacial disturbance based on S and A/lambda. Unlike in the
   horizontal-bottom case, however, we typically also observe interfacial
   oscillations far ahead of the gravity current front. These have
   wavelength approximately equal to. and are due to spatial variations in
   the speed of the ambient return flow. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The development and baseline operation of an acoustic view cell for
   observing fluids, and fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfaces in porous
   media over the frequency range of 10-5000 Hz is described. This range
   includes the industrially relevant frequency range 500-5000 Hz that is
   not covered by existing devices. Pressure waveforms of arbitrary shape
   are generated in a 17.46 mm ID by 200 mm and 690.5 mm long glass tubes
   at flow rates up to 200 ml/min using a syringe pump. Peak-to-peak
   amplitudes exceeding 80 kPa are readily realized at frequencies from 10
   to 5000 Hz in bubble free fluids when actuated with 20 Vpp as
   exemplified using castor oil. At resonant frequencies, peak-to-peak
   pressure amplitudes exceeding 500 kPa were obtained (castor oil at 2100
   Hz when actuated with 20 Vpp). Impacts of vibration on macroscopic
   liquid-liquid and liquid-vapour interfaces and interface movement are
   illustrated. Pressure wave transmission and attenuation in a fluid
   saturated porous medium, randomly packed 250-330 mu m spherical silica
   beads, is also demonstrated. Attenuation differences and frequency
   shifts in resonant peaks are used to detect the presence and generation
   of dispersed micro-bubbles (< 180 mu m diameter), and bubbles within
   porous media that are not readily visualized. Envisioned applications
   include assessment of the impacts of vibration on reaction, mass
   transfer, and flow/flow pattern outcomes. This knowledge will inform
   laboratory and pilot scale process studies, where nuisance vibrations
   may affect the interpretation of process outcomes, and large scale or in
   situ processes in aquifers or hydrocarbon reservoirs where imposed
   vibration may be deployed to improve aspects of process performance.
   Future work will include miscible interface observation and quantitative
   measurements in the bulk and in porous media where the roles of
   micro-bubbles comprise subjects of special interest. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{In northern riverside communities, breakup ice jam flooding is an annual
   threat to properties and human lives. In this study, the peak snowmelt
   runoff during breakup was assessed as an indicator of breakup flood
   severity. Due to the sparse network of hydrometeorolocial data in remote
   northern regions, a Mamdani-type fuzzy logic system (FLS) was developed
   and tested with the limited historical data. Three input variables were
   defined from the precipitation, air temperature and daily water level
   data. All of these variables are known similar to 3 to 4 weeks before
   breakup enabling a long lead-time forecast. The process of system
   development is demonstrated by a case study of the Town of Hay River,
   NWT Canada. A series of experiments were designed to select the best
   system configuration, which also provided a way to conduct a sensitivity
   analysis for different choices in each system component. It was found
   that the system shows very good performance on the historical data using
   the qualitative error index. The results of the sensitivity analysis
   suggest the system performance is dependent on the choices of fuzzy
   logic inference operators and defuzzification method. As a long lead
   system, the short-term meteorological factors that would affect the
   system output were analyzed and the possible error range was assessed.
   Preliminary model validation, based on three years of testing, shows
   promising performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to provide a solution for detection and diagnosis of
   drift type faults in linear time invariant systems using the generalized
   likelihood ratio (GLR) test. The main goal of this study is to deal with
   more realistic ramp type faults instead of abrupt jumps. In this regard,
   several ramp type fault scenarios are considered: pure ramps, truncated
   ramps and steptype faults which behave as ramp faults during
   inter-sample intervals. In addition, a modified GLR-based approach that
   is capable of accurately detecting the time of occurrence of the fault
   is used in this study. The proposed method uses statistical fault
   detection and confirmation tests to obtain a crude estimate of time of
   occurrence of the fault (TOF) and then refines the estimated TOF using
   an extended data window and the GLR test. The closed form solutions for
   all possible scenarios are provided. The proposed method is evaluated by
   application to an LTI system using Monte Carlo simulations and the
   results reveal the efficacy of this method in dealing with drift type
   faults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study evaluated how the flexural strength and fracture
   behavior of a zirconia-based ceramic (Y-TZP) were affected by pre- and
   post-sintering mechanical and thermal treatments.
   Methods. Treatments included sandblasting with different particle size
   and type (30 mu m SiO2; 50 and 110 mu m Al2O3) and thermal conditioning.
   Two hundred bar-shaped specimens of pre-sintered Y-TZP ceramic (Lava
   Frame, 3M) were prepared (specimen dimensions: 25 mm length x 4 mm width
   x 0.7 mm thickness) and divided into three groups (before sintering,
   after sintering and after sintering with heating treatment). The before
   sintering group specimens were airborne-particle abraded prior to dense
   sintering. Specimens from the after sintering group were
   airborne-particle abraded after sintering. The after sintering with
   heating treatment group specimens were submitted to a heating procedure
   after airborne-particle abrasion. The controls were the specimens that
   were sintered and not treated with any conditioning procedures. The
   specimens from all experimental conditions were analyzed by SEM, CLSM
   and XRD. All specimens were tested in four-point bending. Data were
   statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Post Hoc tests (alpha =
   0.05). A Weibull analysis was used to analyze the strength reliability.
   Results. Sandblasting pre-sintered zirconia before sintering
   significantly decreased the flexural strength, except when the smallest
   blasting particles were used (30 mu m SiO2). Phase transformation (t-m)
   was observed after sandblasting and reverse transformation (m-t) was
   observed after heating.
   Significance. Sandblasting with 30 mu m SiO2 and 50 mu m Al2O3 allowed
   lower phase transformation. However, 30 mm SiO2 presented better
   reliability. (C) 2015 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fracture toughness (K-Ic), Vickers hardness, and constitutive equation
   under tensile loading for high strength rail steel were determined at
   -40, -10 and 23 degrees C. K-Ic and hardness were directly determined
   from experimental testing, while the constitutive equation also relying
   on finite element (FE) modelling because of the non-uniform deformation
   during the necking process. The constitutive equation was verified by
   enabling the FE model of tensile specimen to regenerate the
   experimentally measured load-elongation curve and cross-section
   reduction, and applied to the FE model of Vickers indentation to mimic
   the load-depth relationship. This paper also discusses relevance of the

Abstract = {{This paper develops a framework for vessel surveillance video uploading
   via maritime wideband communication networks. A broadband wireless
   network utilizing a time-division-multiple-access (TDMA)-based media
   access control protocol is employed to establish a shore-side network
   infrastructure, and a packet store-carry-forward routing mechanism is
   adopted to achieve intermittent network connectivity in maritime
   communications. To provide high-quality videos to the administrative
   authority, a resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the
   throughput priority-based video transmission problem, subject to the
   intermittent network connections and the time indexes such as the
   release time and deadline of each video packet. To reduce computational
   complexity, time-capacity mapping is applied to transform the original
   resource allocation problem into a two-machine nonpreemptive scheduling
   problem. Three offline scheduling algorithms are proposed, namely, a
   time-capacity-mapping- based two-phase (TMTP) algorithm for a single
   machine, a TMTP algorithm for two machines, and an interval
   graph-theory-based job relay selection (IGTJRS) algorithm. It is
   mathematically proved that the IGTJRS algorithm has an approximation
   ratio (i.e., the ratio of the throughput of an optimal schedule to that
   of the IGTJRS algorithm) of 2 and time complexity of O(n(2)).
   Simulations results validate the performance of the proposed algorithms,
   based on real ship route traces obtained from navigation software
   BLM-Shipping.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the power allocation problem in a multiuser

   interaction among the users and the access point. In each iteration of
   this game, the users first submit bids for buying other users' power and
   asks for selling its own power, and then, the access point determines
   the power allocation based on users' bids and asks. We propose a
   distributed algorithm for the implementation of the IDA-based power
   allocation. We also show that the proposed algorithm achieves a weighted
   sum signal-to-noise ratio (sum-SNR)-optimal solution. Simulation results
   are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 captured from large emitters has
   been identified and demonstrated on a pilot and commercial scale as a
   viable means for reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel
   based power generation and other industrial processes such as cement and
   steel making. In particular, CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers has
   been identified as having the greatest capacity and widest global
   distribution. Although the captured stream will be ``overwhelmingly
   CO2{''}, any number of source and/or process associated impurities may
   be co-injected, with the potential of additional impurities initially
   present in the aquifer being incorporated in the plume of stored CO2
   post-injection. Impurities may make the injected phase more reactive
   than pure CO2 and will also change the physical properties of the
   injected CO2 stream. This paper documents the progress since the IPCC
   Special Report on CCS in understanding the fate and geochemical effects
   of these impurities when co-injected in an impure CO2 stream into deep
   saline aquifers. The presence of inert or non-condensable impurities in
   the injected CO2 stream, such as Ar, N-2 and CH4, will have no or
   negligible geochemical effects in the subsurface, notwithstanding a
   reduction in CO2 storage capacity.
   The presence of acid gases such as SO, (and NOR) will likely have a
   negative effect particularly in the near-well region due to their
   tendency to accumulate in acidic forms in the water (and mineral phases)
   around the injection well. Other impurities that may be present in the
   CO2 stream, such as O-2 and H2S, may or may not have a negative effect,
   depending on aquifer's mineral composition. The severity of these
   effects should be evaluated through appropriate modelling of the
   impure-CO2/water/rock system. In extreme cases this may impose more
   severe limitations than those imposed by transportation systems on the
   type and amount of certain impurities present in the CO2 stream. In
   general, further development of the work performed to date will continue
   to yield valuable results dealing with impure-CO2/ aquifer interactions.
   Future research will benefit from closer integration between the various
   research communities to better define the myriad chemical environments
   which may develop due to the injection of impure CO2 streams.
   Exploration of the post-injection interactions in the vicinity of
   injection wells is one avenue which should be explored more vigorously.

Volume = {{52}},

Pages = {{563-582}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an explicit feature-based level-set topology
   optimization method involving polyline-arc profiling and 2.5D machining
   processes. This method relies on a feature fitting algorithm
   incorporated into the boundary evolvement process in order to regulate
   the noisy velocity fields and thus introduce new explicit feature
   primitives; once inserted, the feature-based shape optimization
   algorithm is implemented to determine the optimum part shape and
   topology. The research novelty lies in that, the best-fit feature
   primitives are inserted during the topology optimization process while
   other researchers so far have reported only manipulating some existing
   features with the conventional level-set methods. Therefore,
   feature-based design can be realized without special requirement of
   initial input or any post-processing. From the perspective of potential
   applications, the engineering information embedded in those feature
   primitives can be extracted and integrated into the optimization
   formulation. Such potential integration can make the topology
   optimization even more useful and practical. This effort is an extension
   of level-set topology optimization into a domain of structural
   optimization for manufacturing (OFM).}},

Abstract = {{Nanogels are prominent examples of ``smart{''} nanomaterials, which are
   designed to incorporate biologically relevant (macro)molecules for
   systemic delivery. Although these systems are carefully engineered, only
   a handful of studies discuss the blood compatibility of nanogels, and no
   systematic studies are available on how the presence of net or surface
   charges impacts the hemocompatibility of these nanomaterials. Therefore,
   in this study, temperature responsive, galactose based nanogels bearing
   net positive, negative, or neutral charges, either in the core or shell
   of nanogels, are prepared and are subsequently evaluated for their blood
   compatibility profiles. The nanogels containing neutral core and shell,
   cationic core with neutral shell, anionic core with neutral shell,
   neutral core with cationic shell, and neutral core with anionic shell
   are prepared by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)
   polymerization approach. The evaluation of complement activation, blood
   clot formation, platelet activation, red blood cells aggregation, and
   hemolysis provides a detailed analysis of structure activity
   relationship of blood compatibility profile of these nanogels. The data
   reveal that the physical and biological (blood compatibility) properties
   can be carefully tuned by embedding the charges in the core of
   temperature-responsive nanomaterials, protected by neutral carbohydrate

Abstract = {{Highly efficient, specific, and nontoxic gene delivery vector is
   required for gene therapy to the liver. Hepatocytes exclusively express
   asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), which can recognize and bind to
   galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine. Galactosylated polymers are
   therefore explored for targeted gene delivery to the liver. A library of
   safe and stable galactose-based glycopolymers that can specifically
   deliver genes to hepatocytes were synthesized having different
   architectures, compositions, and molecular weights via the reversible
   addition fragmentation chain transfer process. The physical and chemical
   properties of these polymers have a great impact on gene delivery
   efficacy into hepatocytes, as such block copolymers are found to form
   more stable complexes with plasmid and have high gene delivery
   efficiency into ASGPR expressing hepatocytes. Transfection efficiency
   and uptake of polyplexes with these polymers decreased significantly by
   preincubation of hepatocytes with free asialofetuin or by adding free
   asialofetuin together with polyplexes into hepatocytes. The results
   confirmed that polyplexes with these polymers were taken up specifically
   by hepatocytes via ASGPR-mediated endocytosis. The results from
   transfection efficiency and uptake of these polymers in cells without
   ASGPR, such as SK Hep1 and HeLa cells, further support this mechanism.
   Since in vitro cytotoxicity assays prove these glycopolymers to be
   nontoxic, they may be useful for delivery of clinically important genes
   specifically to the liver.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to study the cold flow properties of JCB
   (Jatropha curcas biodiesel) and WCB (Waste cooking oil biodiesel). For
   the purpose two methods were examined experimentally viz. winterization
   and blending of biodiesel samples with petro diesel and kerosene.
   Winterization was found to be effective as it improved the cold flow
   properties of biodiesel samples but at the same time decreased the yield
   and stability due to partially removal of saturated fatty acids.
   Blending was found to be more favorable for improvement in cold flow
   properties of biodiesel without any effect on yield, however, the
   biodiesel become more stable after blending. The CF and PP (pour point)
   for JCB for B20 blends with petro diesel were reported as 14.9 degrees C
   and 14 degrees C respectively, however, for WCB it was 12 degrees C and
   11.5 degrees C respectively. Kerosene K20 samples was showing best
   result as the reported CP and PP were -1 degrees C and -2.2 degrees C
   respectively for JCB. However in case of WCB blends with kerosene, the
   reported CP and PP for K20 blends are -10.5 degrees C and -12 degrees C
   respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial point processes are commonly used to model the placement and the
   number of interferers in modern wireless networks, where the ad hoc
   deployment of transmitters is common. The homogeneous Poisson point
   process (PPP) is the most popular spatial point process used to model
   co-channel interference. Optimum combining (OC) is the diversity
   combining technique that maximizes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio at the receiver. The performance of OC in cooperative relaying in
   an interferer field modeled by a homogeneous PPP is analyzed. Both
   decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relay protocols are
   studied. Multirelay transmission and relay selection techniques are
   considered. Accurate approximations for the outage probability are
   derived for DF and AF relaying when the destination is able to estimate
   the noise-plus-interference correlation matrix (NICM) perfectly. An
   approximation for the outage probability of DF relaying is obtained when
   the destination only estimates the channel state information of the
   closest interferer. Relay selection outperforms multirelay transmission
   in both DF and AF relaying protocols. The interference correlation at
   the relays significantly degrades the outage performance. Limited
   estimation of the NICM results in better performance than conventional
   maximal-ratio combining, although it fails to achieve diversity gains.}},

Title = {{Some insights into a sequential resource allocation mechanism for en
   route air traffic management}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a game theoretic model of a sequential capacity
   allocation process in a congestible transportation system. In this
   particular application, we investigate the governing principles at work
   in how airlines will time their requests for en route resources under
   capacity shortfalls and uncertain conditions, when flights are not able
   to take their preferred route at their preferred departure time slot due
   to the shortfalls. We examine a sequential ``First Submitted First
   Assigned{''} (FSFA) capacity allocation process within an en route air
   traffic flow management (ATFM) program such as the Collaborative
   Trajectory Options Program (CTOP), which is a Federal Aviation
   Administration initiative that aims to manage en route capacity
   constraints brought on by inclement weather and capacity/demand
   imbalances. In the FSFA process, flights are assigned the best available
   routes and slots available at the time flight operators submit their
   preference requests during the planning period, in a sequential manner.
   Because flight operators compete with one another for resources, in such
   an allocation process they would be expected to make their requests as
   early as possible. However, because weather and traffic conditions - and
   therefore, the values of resources - can change significantly, flight
   operators may prefer to request resources later in the process rather
   than earlier. We use a game theoretic setup to understand how flight
   operators might tradeoff these conflicts and choose an optimal time to
   submit their preferences for their flights, as submission times are
   competitive responses by flight operators looking to maximize their
   benefits. We first develop a loss function that captures the expected
   utility of submitting preferences under uncertainty about operating
   conditions. Then, a conceptual model of the FSFA process is constructed
   using a simultaneous incomplete information game, where flight operators
   compete for the ``prizes{''} of having submitted their inputs before
   others. A numerical study is performed in which it is demonstrated that
   preference submission times are heavily influenced by the general
   uncertainty surrounding weather and operational conditions of the ATFM
   program, and each flight operator's internal ability to handle this
   uncertainty. A key finding is that, in many of the scenarios presented,
   an optimal strategy for a flight operator is to submit their preferences
   at the very beginning of the planning period. If air traffic managers
   could expect to receive more submissions at the beginning of the
   planning period, they could more easily coordinate the ATFM program with
   other ATFM programs taking place or scheduled to take place, and they
   would have more opportunity to call another FSFA allocation route before
   the ATFM program begins, should conditions change enough to warrant
   this. Outputs of the model may provide some general insights to flight
   operators in planning submission strategies within competitive
   allocation processes such as FSFA. Also, this work may have a broader
   application to other sequential resource allocation strategies within
   congestible and controlled transportation systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A redundant system usually consists of primary and standby modules. The
   so-called spare gate is extensively used to model the dynamic behavior
   of redundant systems in the application of dynamic fault trees (DFTs).
   Several methodologies have been proposed to evaluate the reliability of
   DFTs containing spare gates by computing the failure probability.
   However, either a complex analysis or significant simulation time are
   usually required by such an approach. Moreover, it is difficult to
   compute the failure probability of a system with component failures that
   are not exponentially distributed. Additionally, probabilistic common
   cause failures (PCCFs) have been widely reported, usually occurring in a
   statistically dependent manner. Failure to account for the effect of
   PCCFs overestimates the reliability of a DFT. In this paper, stochastic
   computational models are proposed for an efficient analysis of spare
   gates and PCCFs in a DFT. Using these models, a DFT with spare gates
   under PCCFs can be efficiently evaluated. In the proposed stochastic
   approach, a signal probability is encoded as a non-Bernoulli sequence of
   random permutations of fixed numbers of ones and zeros. The component's
   failure probability is not limited to an exponential distribution, thus
   this approach is applicable to a DFT analysis in a general case. Several
   case studies are evaluated to show the accuracy and efficiency of the
   proposed approach, compared to both an analytical approach and Monte
   Carlo (MC) simulation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops ordering heuristics to improve the efficiency of
   reliability evaluation for multistate two-terminal networks given all
   minimal path vectors (d-MPs for short). In the existing methods, all

   d-MP is different, and different orderings affect the efficiency of
   reliability evaluation. Based on the above observations, we introduce
   the length definitions for d-MPs in a multistate two-terminal network,
   and develop four ordering heuristics, called O1, O2, O3, and O4, to
   improve the efficiency of the Recursive Sum of Disjoint Products (RSDP)
   method for evaluating network reliability. The results show that the
   proposed ordering heuristics can significantly improve the reliability
   evaluation efficiency, and O1 performs the best among the four methods.
   In addition, an ordering heuristic is developed for the reliability
   evaluation of multistate two-terminal networks given all minimal cut

Abstract = {{In this study, we used a wide spectrum of bioinformatics techniques to
   evaluate the extent of intrinsic disorder in the complete proteomes of
   genotypes of four human dengue virus (DENV), to analyze the
   peculiarities of disorder distribution within individual DENV proteins,
   and to establish potential roles for the structural disorder with
   respect to their functions. We show that several proteins (ER, E, 1, 2A
   and 4A) are predicted to be mostly ordered, whereas four proteins (C,
   2k, NS3 and NS5) are expected to have high disorder levels. The profiles
   of disorder propensities are similar across the four genotypes, except
   for the NS5 protein. Cleavage sites are depleted in polymorphic sites,
   and have a high propensity for disorder, especially relative to
   neighboring residues. Disordered regions are highly polymorphic in type
   1 DENV but have a relatively low number of polymorphic sites in the type
   4 virus. There is a high density of polymorphisms in proteins 2A and 4A,
   which are depleted in disorder. Thus, a high density of polymorphism is
   not unique to disordered regions. Analysis of disorder/function
   association showed that the predominant function of the disordered
   regions in the DENV proteins is protein-protein interaction and binding
   of nucleic acids, metals and other small molecules. These regions are
   also associated with phosphorylation, which may regulate their function.}},

   quality factor of 22,000 at 1.4 GHz for real-time sensing of fluid
   properties is presented. The core of the sensor has a planar microstrip
   resonator, which is enhanced using an active feedback loop. The
   resonance frequency and quality factor of the sensor show clear
   differentiation between analytes composed of common solvents. To
   evaluate the sensor for water based concentration detection, we have
   demonstrated that KOH dilutions as low as 0.1 mM are detectable. The
   proposed sensor has advantages of inexpensiveness and high resolution as
   well as capability for miniaturization and CMOS compatibility.}},

Abstract = {{A design method, for hypersonic forebody configuration with blunt edges,
   was developed by lift body and waverider. Experimental study was
   conducted. It was showed that the difference of pressure coefficient, at
   centre-line and side-line on forebody precompression surface, was
   between 2.5\% and 16.7\% within the Mach number 5 to 7 and attack angle
   0 to 12. These differences were slightly bigger than those of
   non-blunt-edges forebody. However, experimental data also show that the
   present configuration can achieve the closed shockwave, and can also
   realize the automatic overflow of boundary layer on forebody
   pre-compression surface. It is also observed that the present forebody
   gets a good aerodynamic performance at high Mach numbers. But with
   increasing attack angle, the advantage was weakened gradually. And, at
   the degree of side-slip exceeding 8, the side-line pressure is higher
   than that of center-line, which indicates that the forebody boundary
   layer does not achiev automatically overflowing to side surface.}},

Abstract = {{Female ticks of the family Ixodidae increase their mass up to 100-fold
   during the 7-10 day feeding period. We determined the material
   properties of the alloscutal cuticle of female Amblyomma hebraeum from
   the time of moulting through to full engorgement. The material
   properties of the cuticle were evaluated by a Kelvin-Voigt analysis of
   compliance determined from the stretch of loops of cuticle under stress.
   There was a 3-fold increase in cuticle dry mass during the first 3 weeks
   post-moult, during which the ductility and stiffness of the cuticle
   increased substantially. Under stress, the cuticle displayed
   time-dependent stretch, with a plastic (non-recoverable) and
   viscoelastic (recoverable) component. Plastic deformation was reasonably
   constant in the range 10-15\% over a wide range of induced stress above
   similar to 0.6 MPa. The plastic component of tick alloscutal cuticle was
   about 5-10 times higher than that of unsclerotized insect cuticle. Tick
   cuticle is far more ductile than unsclerotized insect cuticle. Material
   properties of the cuticle did not change significantly as a function of
   cuticular water content over the normal range throughout the feeding
   cycle (13-37\% wet mass). Injected dopamine (DA) reduced one measure of
   the viscosity of the cuticle by 38\%. Plastic deformability of the
   cuticle was reduced by 70\% after an in vitro stretch, but restored in
   fully engorged ticks, and in in vitro stretched loops by treatment with
   DA and reduced pH. Thinning of the cuticle by half during the rapid
   phase of engorgement requires plastic deformation (irreversible strain)
   in two orthogonal dimensions in excess of 40\%. Treatment with DA
   increased plastic deformation and enabled extensibility (strain at the
   point of rupture) above 40\%.}},

Abstract = {{Proton density and transverse relaxation (T2)-weighted fast spin echo
   images are frequently acquired. T2 quantification is commonly performed
   by applying an exponential fit to these two images, despite recent
   evidence that an exponential fit is insufficient to correctly quantify
   T2 in the presence of imperfect RF refocusing due to standard 2D slice
   selection or use of reduced refocusing angles. Here we examine the
   feasibility of accurate two echo fitting using standard proton density
   and T2-weighted images by utilizing Bloch equation simulations and prior
   knowledge of refocusing angles. This method is demonstrated in
   simulation, phantom, and human brain experiments, in comparison to the
   exponential approach, and to a 32 echo multiple-echo spin echo approach.
   Comparison to single spin echo is also performed in phantom experiments.
   The two echo method, which compensates for indirect and stimulated
   echoes, enables accurate quantitative T2 over a wide range of flip angle
   and T2 values using standard MRI methods, provided there is adequate SNR
   and flip angle knowledge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: This in-vitro study presents the development and
   validation of an artificial tooth-periodontal ligament-bone complex
   (ATPBC) and comparison of its behavior with that of rigid dowels during
   third-order torque simulation. Methods: ATPBCs were coupled using a 1:1
   mixture of room-temperature vulcanization silicone and gasket sealant to
   act as a periodontal ligament simulant (PDLS). PDLS thicknesses ranging
   from 0.2 to 0.7 mm, in increments of 0.1 mm (n = 5 for each thickness),
   were tested using a linear crown displacement procedure. A suitable PDLS
   thickness was selected for use in third-order torque simulations to
   compare ATPBC (n = 29) and rigid (n = 24) dowel behavior. Their results
   were compared for archwire rotations up to 20 degrees for both loading
   and unloading curves with repeated-measures analysis of variance.
   Results: When used in third-order torque simulations, the ATPBC dowels
   with a 0.5-mm PDLS thickness showed a statistically significant
   difference from rigid dowels (P = 0.020), with a 95\% confidence
   interval (0.254, 2.897 N.mm) and a mean difference of 1.575 N.mm.
   Conclusions: Inclusion of a PDLS in an ATPBC resulted in a statistical
   difference when compared with rigid dowels; however, the region where
   behavior differed was at low angles of archwire rotation, and the
   resultant torque was arguably outside a clinically relevant range.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of high-speed, high-resolution whole slide
   histology digital scanners, glass slides of tissue specimen can now be
   digitised at high magnification to create the whole slide image.
   Quantitative image analysis tools are then desirable to help the
   pathologist for their routine examination. Epidermis area is a very
   important observation area for the cancer diagnosis. Therefore, in order
   to build up a computer-aided diagnosis system, segmentation of the
   epidermis area is often the very first and crucial step. An improved
   computer-aided epidermis segmentation technique for the whole slide skin
   histopathological image is proposed in this study. The proposed
   technique first obtains an initial segmentation result with the help of
   global thresholding and shape analysis. A template matching method, with
   adaptive template intensity value, is then applied. Finally, a threshold
   is calculated based on the probability density function of the response
   value image. Experimental results show that the proposed technique
   overcomes the limitation of the existing technique and provides superior
   performance, with sensitivity of 95.68\%, specificity of 99.41\% and
   precision of 93.13\%. The performance of the proposed technique is
   satisfactory for future clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiency of winter operations is essential for cities in cold regions
   because fiscal budgets are limited and excessive amounts of street sand
   and salt can negatively impact the environment. A review of winter
   maintenance policies in major Canadian cities has shown that freeways,
   business areas, and routes to transit and emergency venues are treated
   as priority. On these routes, snow is piled on the roadsides until it
   narrows the road width and decreases drivers' visibility. At such time,
   the snow piles are hauled to specific snow storage or eliminator
   locations. In cities with relatively warmer climatic conditions, such as
   Ottawa, Toronto, and Montreal, high amounts of street salt are used
   annually. In cities with extremely cold winters, such as Edmonton,
   Calgary, and Winnipeg, Canada, sanding is more common. Friction
   measurement devices, which have been developed in a number of diverse
   models, can provide data to compare and improve winter maintenance
   operations. Road friction measuring devices are not used for operations
   in Canada, but highway agencies and municipalities have begun
   researching and evaluating different devices and their effectiveness in
   optimizing winter operations. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Title = {{Utilization of 3D Visualization of Mobile Crane Operations for Modular
   Construction On-Site Assembly}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In heavy industrial construction, the on-site approach to construction
   is being gradually replaced by the off-site (modular-based) construction
   method, which is faster, results in better-quality products, and is more
   environmentally friendly. Given this trend, cranes have an increasingly
   strong influence on successful completion of modular-based construction
   projects with respect to project productivity and safety. However, in
   order to achieve safe and efficient equipment utilization, lift
   engineers and project managers face the challenge of designing
   collision-free crane operations prior to construction. This paper
   proposes a methodology whereby a dynamic graphical description of
   three-dimensional (3D) visualization is applied to simulate various
   scenarios with different crane models and types in order to select the
   most effective and efficient crane operation. It also presents the
   capabilities and limitations of 3D visualization in the application of
   crane lift planning. The case study demonstrates that the significant
   values of 3D visualization from the design stage to actual
   implementation of the project are: (1) to improve productivity by
   eliminating uncertainties; (2) to facilitate better communication,
   understanding, collaboration, and decision making; and (3) to assist
   project practitioners in performing critical lifts successfully during
   actual construction. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) offers interesting avenue to handle
   high order information and uncertainty in decision support system (DSS)
   when dealing with both extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of uncertainty.
   Recently, multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems with
   interval type-2 fuzzy information have received increasing attentions
   both from researchers and practitioners. As a result, a number of
   interval type-2 fuzzy MADM methods have been developed. In this paper,
   we extend the VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacijia I Kompromisno
   Resenje, in Serbian) method based on the prospect theory to accommodate
   interval type-2 fuzzy circumstances. First, we propose a new distance
   measure for IT2FS, which is comes as a sound alternative when being
   compared with the existing interval type-2 fuzzy distance measures.
   Then, a decision model integrating VIKOR method and-prospect theory is
   proposed. A case study concerning a high-tech risk evaluation is
   provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. In
   addition, a comparative analysis with interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS
   method is also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Influence of loading history on the mechanical properties for
   polyethylene (PE) was examined through an experimental study, in which
   each specimen was subjected to two short-term tensile tests that were
   conducted at least 1 month apart. The first test was to apply various
   loading histories to specimens, and the second test to characterize the
   corresponding change in mechanical properties. The results show clearly
   that the loading history introduced in the first test affects mechanical
   properties measured from the second test. In particular, the initial
   tangent modulus and stress response to deformation from the second test
   show a noticeable decrease with the increase of the applied strain
   introduced in the first test, even at the applied strain for the first
   test as low as 0.05. Change in mechanical properties was also found to
   depend on loading mode (cyclic and monotonic) and crosshead speed (1
   mm/min and 5 mu m/min) used in the first test. The above changes are
   explained based on the microstructural concept of interphase that is
   located in the interlamellar region and has a less ordered
   microstructure than the crystalline lamella. Based on results from this
   study, further investigation is planned to obtain direct evidence to
   support the idea. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:2002-2010, 2015. (c) 2014 Society

Abstract = {{It is hard to treat fine tailings resulting from oil sands extraction
   processes. No current fine tailings treatment technology can completely
   eliminate tailings ponds, despite considerable efforts to address the
   slow settling of fines and to facilitate the consolidation of sediments.
   Some treatments use coagulants and coarse solids to form composite or
   consolidated tailings; others use polymer flocculants. The performance
   of polymer flocculants is evaluated empirically, with fine tailings
   often being considered as a black box. Some fundamental studies use
   single clay systems, such as kaolinite suspended in water, as models to
   evaluate the performance of polymer flocculants. While it is easier to
   relate polymer performance to specific conditions in these simpler
   systems, it is difficult to translate these results to the treatment of
   the much more complex tailings environment. For the rational design of
   polymer flocculants, one must understand the interactions between
   polymers and the several components in tailings. With this information
   in hand, one can optimize the molecular structure of polymer flocculants
   to treat oil sands tailings efficiently. In this review, we summarize
   the published research on flocculation performance within the context of
   complex fine tailings systems. Furthermore, we describe the
   compositional complexity of mature fine tailings to help the design of
   more representative model tailings systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an experimental and modelling investigation of a

   12 Fluid Dynamics. Turbulence is modelled using the large eddy
   simulation, and the discrete particle model is used to predict the
   particle separation. It is shown by experimentation and modelling that
   increasing the vortex finder length results in an increase in the
   recovery of light particles in the overflow. The recovery of light
   particles increases as their size increases. Increasing the feed flow
   rate and decreasing the solid concentration in the feed also improves
   light particle recovery. A computational model based on LES gave close

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty in a natural resource model represents risk that should be
   minimized for improved management. Natural resources are components of
   complex earth science systems, which can be exhaustively sampled,
   numerically modeled with Monte Carlo simulation, or both, to understand
   their underlying nature. A numerical model represents relationships
   between a response variable and predictor variables. Uncertainty in a
   response variable can be observed directly, but understanding the
   importance of each predictor variable requires further post-processing
   of the numerical model. A methodology of local sensitivity analysis,
   based on linear and quadratic regression models, is developed to help
   understand the uncertainty contribution of each predictor variable to
   the response model. Sensitivity coefficients, predicted response values,
   and summary statistics with model utility tests for the regression
   models are evaluated. The importance of standardized sensitivity
   coefficients and other measures are developed. Standardized sensitivity
   coefficients represent the contribution of uncertainty in the predictor
   variables to uncertainty in model response. Results of the sensitivity
   analysis are visually summarized in the form of extended tornado charts.
   The proposed methodology is applied to representative petroleum and
   mining case studies. The methodology is robust, efficient, descriptive,
   and straightforward. Understanding of the contribution of each predictor
   variable to the response variable is useful for minimization of model
   response uncertainty, decision-making, and further study.}},

Abstract = {{Current robotic systems have achieved great sophistication in kinematic
   motion, control, and neural processing. One of the most challenging
   limitations imposed on modern robotics is the portable power source
   needed to sustain tether-free operation. Energy storage devices such as
   batteries and combustion engines may be heavy, require a great deal of
   space, and invariably have a finite energy capacity. Methods to control
   such devices may also impose limitations as most robotic systems rely on
   either tethered or radiative communication. The unavoidable repercussion
   of these limitations is the ultimate reduction of mobility and operation
   time to achieve specific tasks. To address these challenges, we apply
   our quasi-wireless powering methodology to show the operation of two
   robotic devices over a 1x1 m(2) surface. Both power and control signals
   are transmitted simultaneously, producing seamless storage-free
   functionality over the entire area with a communication technique that
   is not line-of-sight or radiation dependent. We demonstrate an average
   power transfer efficiency of 93\% using commercially available toy
   robots and discuss parameters relating to the power and communication

Title = {{A novel CACD/CAD/CAE integrated design framework for fiber-reinforced

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel CACD/CAD/CAE integrated framework for design,
   modeling, and optimization of fiber-reinforced plastic parts, which can
   greatly enhance the current design practice by realizing partial
   automation and multi-stage optimization. To support this framework, a
   new heterogeneous feature model (HFM) has been developed to model the
   fiber-reinforced objects and to be transferred between engineering
   modules. To be specific, the CACD (computer-aided conceptual design)
   module employs the level-set structure and material optimization to
   produce the initial design with thickness control, and also the initial
   HFM; the CAD (computer-aided design) module allows manual editing on the
   HFM to reflect various design intents; then, the injection molding CAE
   (computer-aided engineering) simulates the manufacturing process, and
   the response surface method (RSM) is applied to optimize the process
   parameters of gate location, injection flow rate, mold temperature and
   melt temperature, to approach the manufactured fiber orientation
   distribution close to the optimized result produced by the CACD module;
   besides, the structural analysis CAE module generates the mechanical
   performance result to support the CACD module, as well as to validate
   the final design. By applying this framework, the final structural
   design including the fiber orientation distribution, will perform better
   in mechanical properties, and consume less matrix and fiber materials;
   besides, the design maturity can be approached in shorter time. To prove
   the effectiveness, a plastic gripper design will be comprehensively
   studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Jaw tremor as a physiological biomarker of bruxism}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1746-1753}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if sleep bruxism is associated with abnormal
   physiological tremor of the jaw during a visually-guided bite force
   control task.
   Methods: Healthy participants and patients with sleep bruxism were given
   visual feedback of their bite force and asked to trace triangular target
   trajectories (duration = 20 s, peak force <35\% maximum voluntary
   force). Bite force control was quantified in terms of the power spectra
   of force fluctuations, masseter EMG activity, and force-to-EMG
   coherence.
   Results: Patients had greater jaw force tremor at similar to 8 Hz
   relative to controls, along with increased masseter EMG activity and
   force-to-EMG coherence in the same frequency range. Patients also showed
   lower force-to-EMG coherence at low frequencies (<3 Hz), but greater
   coherence at high frequencies (20-40 Hz). Finally, patients had greater
   6-10 Hz force tremor during periods of descending vs. ascending force,
   while controls showed no difference in tremor with respect to force
   dynamics.
   Conclusion: Patients with bruxism have abnormal jaw tremor when engaged
   in a visually-guided bite force task.
   Significance: Measurement of jaw tremor may aid in the
   detection/evaluation of bruxism. In light of previous literature, our
   results also suggest that bruxism is marked by abnormal or mishandled
   peripheral feedback from the teeth. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Inference of locally varying anisotropy fields from diverse data sources}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{170-182}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A locally varying anisotropy (LVA) field characterizes the magnitude and
   direction of anisotropy in a modelling domain and can provide valuable
   information to geostatistical modeling methodologies that account for
   non-linear spatial features, in particular, second order
   non-stationarities that are observed in complex geological formations.
   In this framework, the primary variable to model (i.e. grade, porosity,
   concentration, etc) is measured at discrete spatial locations and there
   may or may not be exhaustively sampled gridded secondary information.
   Existing geostatistical techniques require knowledge of the magnitude of
   anisotropy (correlation lengths) and local orientations (strike, dip,
   and plunge) exhaustively in the domain. Inference of these parameters
   from samples of the primary variable is difficult when anisotropy varies
   locally; the correlation lengths and orientations of the discrete
   primary variable must be estimated at all locations in a domain and are
   not globally constant. Estimation of the required LVA field parameters
   depends on the available data and is unique to the type of information
   available. This work proposes three different methodologies for LVA
   field inference, including (1) use of a correlated exhaustively sampled
   secondary variable (2) use of direct point measurements of the
   orientation of the primary variable, and (3) use of a geological model
   that displays the desired LVA characteristics. Often a gridded
   exhaustively sampled secondary variable is available from geophysical
   surveys and displays similar spatial features as the primary variable.
   An adaptive moving window technique is proposed to infer the required
   LVA field from correlated exhaustive secondary information. The local
   anisotropy orientation is obtained from the gradient of the secondary
   information and the appropriate window size is calculated automatically,
   which is important when the scale of features vary in the domain.
   Secondly, direct angle measurements of orientation may be available from
   dip meter or borehole images, however, these data are axial in nature
   (when plunge is assumed to be 0 degrees) or they represent a 3D
   coordinate system (when considering strike, dip and plunge);
   preprocessing is required before the LVA field can be estimated from
   point measurements of orientation because of the wrapping effect at 0
   degrees. The proposed technique treats point measurements of orientation
   as quaternions and assigns weights to nearby samples to estimate the
   exhaustive LVA field. In addition to the proposed methodologies for
   exhaustive and point data, a skeletonization technique is implemented to
   determine orientations from geological interpretations. The geological
   object is reduced to a spline curve and the direction of the curve is
   used as the local LVA field orientation. The suite of proposed LVA
   inference techniques are implemented in both 2D and 3D and illustrated
   on several data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The study is concerned with a design of granular fuzzy models. We
   exploit a concept of information granularity by developing a model
   coming as a network of intuitively structured collection of interval
   information granules described in the output space and a family of
   induced information granules (in the form of fuzzy sets) formed in the
   input space. In contrast to most fuzzy models encountered in the
   literature, the results produced by granular models are information
   granules rather than plain numeric entities. The design of the model
   concentrates on a construction of information granules that form a
   backbone of the overall construct. Interval information granules
   positioned in the output space are built by considering intervals of
   equal length, equal probability, and developing an optimized version of
   the intervals. The induced fuzzy information granules localized in the
   input space are realized by running a conditional Fuzzy C-Means (FCM).
   The performance of the model is assessed by considering criteria of
   coverage and information specificity (information granularity). Further
   optimization of the model is proposed along the line of an optimal
   re-distribution of input information granules induced by the individual
   interval information granules located in the output space. Experimental
   results involve some synthetic low-dimensional data and publicly
   available benchmark data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A system dynamics-based simulation gaming model, developed as a
   component of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Invitational Drought
   Tournament (IDT; Hill et al., 2014), is introduced in this paper as a
   decision support tool for drought management at the river-basin scale.
   This IDT Model provides a comprehensive and integrated overview of
   drought conditions, and illustrates the broad effects of socioeconomic
   drought and mitigation strategies. It is intended to provide a safe,
   user-friendly experimental environment with fast run-times for testing
   management options, and to promote collaborative decision-making and
   consensus building. Examples of model results from several recent IDT
   events demonstrate potential effects of drought and the short-to
   longer-term effectiveness of policies selected by IDT teams; such
   results have also improved teams' understanding of the complexity of
   water resources systems and their management trade-offs. The IDT Model
   structure and framework can also be reconfigured quickly for application

Abstract = {{This study investigated the application of polyaluminum chloride (PACI)
   for the treatment of the oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). These
   coagulants are commonly used in water treatment with the most effective
   species reported to be Al-13. PACl with 83.6\% Al-13 was synthesized
   using the slow base titration method and compared with a commercially
   available PACl in terms of aluminum species distribution,
   coagulation/flocculation (CF) performance, floc morphology, and
   contaminant removal. Both coagulants were effective in removing
   suspended solids, achieving over 96\% turbidity removal at all applied
   coagulant doses (0.5-3.0 mM Al). The removal efficiencies of metals
   varied among different metals depending on their pK(a) values with metal
   cations having pKa values (Fe, Al, Ga, and Ti) below OSPW pH of 6.9-8.1
   (dose dependent) being removed by more than 90\%, while cations with
   higher pK(a) values (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Ni) had removals of less than
   40\%. Naphthenic acids were not removed due to their low molecular
   weights, negative charges, and hydrophilic characteristics at the OSPW
   pH. At the highest applied coagulant dose of 3.0 mM Al, the synthetic
   PACl reduced Vibrio fischeri inhibition effect to 43.3 +/- 3.0\% from
   49.5 +/- 0.4\% in raw OSPW. In contrast no reduction of toxicity was
   found for OSPW treated with the commercial PACl. Based on water quality
   and floc analyses, the dominant CF mechanism for particle removal during
   OSPW treatment was considered to be enmeshment in the precipitates
   (i.e., sweep flocculation). Overall, the CF using synthesized PAC1 can
   be a valuable pretreatment process for OSPW to create wastewater that is
   more easily treated by downstream processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Optimized face recognition algorithm using radial basis function neural
   networks and its practical applications}},
Journal = {{NEURAL NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{111-125}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a hybrid method of face recognition by using
   face region information extracted from the detected face region. In the
   preprocessing part, we develop a hybrid approach based on the Active
   Shape Model (ASM) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm.
   At this step, we use a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) camera to acquire a
   facial image by using AdaBoost and then Histogram Equalization (HE) is
   employed to improve the quality of the image. ASM extracts the face
   contour and image shape to produce a personal profile. Then we use a PCA
   method to reduce dimensionality of face images. In the recognition part,
   we consider the improved Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF NNs)
   to identify a unique pattern associated with each person. The proposed
   RBF NN architecture consists of three functional modules realizing the
   condition phase, the conclusion phase, and the inference phase completed
   with the help of fuzzy rules coming in the standard `if-then' format. In
   the formation of the condition part of the fuzzy rules, the input space
   is partitioned with the use of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering. In the
   conclusion part of the fuzzy rules, the connections (weights) of the RBF
   NNs are represented by four kinds of polynomials such as constant,
   linear, quadratic, and reduced quadratic. The values of the coefficients
   are determined by running a gradient descent method. The output of the
   RBF NNs model is obtained by running a fuzzy inference method. The
   essential design parameters of the network (including learning rate,
   momentum coefficient and fuzzification coefficient used by the FCM) are
   optimized by means of Differential Evolution (DE). The proposed P-RBF
   NNs (Polynomial based RBF NNs) are applied to facial recognition and its
   performance is quantified from the viewpoint of the output performance
   and recognition rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Corrosion fatigue crack growth behavior of pipeline steel under
   underload-type variable amplitude loading schemes}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{159-169}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{This investigation attempts to rationalize various near-neutral pH
   corrosion fatigue (CF) failure scenarios found during pipeline
   operations, which continues to be a major consideration in pipeline
   integrity. The phenomenon is often referred to as stress corrosion
   cracking (SCC) but as will be discussed is more properly considered as
   CF. Existing CF (SCC) models predict a service life of more than 100
   years for gas pipelines, as compared with the 20-30 years typically seen
   in the field when these mechanisms are operative. It has been identified
   from analyzing pressure fluctuations recorded in the field that the
   underload-type variable amplitude loading schemes often found within 30
   km downstream of a compressor station are the most prone to crack
   growth, and these locations comprise more than 70\% of all-service and
   hydrostatic-test failures attributed to stress cracking. In this
   investigation, underload-type variable amplitude loading schemes were
   designed and used for crack growth measurements in pipeline steel in
   near-neutral pH environments. Crack growth enhancement by a factor of 10
   was found under the underload-type variable amplitude cyclic loading, as
   compared with the constant amplitude cyclic loading. There also exist
   two distinct regimes of crack growth behavior over the range of loading
   frequency from 5.0 x 10(-1) Hz to 10(-5) Hz under such variable
   amplitude fatigue. Crack growth rate was found to increase with
   decreasing loading frequency down to 10(-5) Hz, while it remained
   constant below 10(-3) Hz. This critical loading frequency was
   successfully modeled based on the crack growth mechanisms identified.
   The outcome of the investigation agrees well with the failures
   experienced in the field. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1497-1501}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this letter, we consider signals with a low-rank co-variance matrix
   which reside in a low-dimensional subspace and can be written in terms
   of a finite (small) number of parameters. Although such signals do not
   necessarily have a sparse representation in a finite basis, they possess
   a sparse structure which makes it possible to recover the signal from
   compressed measurements. We study the statistical performance bound for
   parameter estimation in the low-rank signal model from compressed
   measurements. Specifically, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for a
   generic low-rank model and we show that the number of compressed samples
   needs to be larger than the number of sources for the existence of an
   unbiased estimator with finite estimation variance. We further consider
   the applications to direction-of-arrival (DOA) and spectral estimation
   which fit into the low-rank signal model. We also investigate the effect
   of compression on the CRB by considering numerical examples of the DOA
   estimation scenario, and show how the CRB increases by increasing the
   compression or equivalently reducing the number of compressed samples.}},

Title = {{Transient measurement of the effective particle density of cigarette
   smoke}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{63-74}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The real-time effective particle density of cigarette smoke was
   determined using a Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyzer (CPMA) and
   Differential Mobility Spectrometer (DMS). A Puff Inhale Exhale (PIE)
   simulator was used to produce the smoke from various research and
   commercial cigarettes following the International Standard Organization
   (ISO) puffing parameters (35 ml puff of 2 s duration, every 60 s) or the
   Health Canada Intense (HCI) puffing parameters (55 ml puff of 2s
   duration, every 30 s). The impact of modifying parameters, such as smoke
   mass, cigarette format, filter type, inhalation volume and mouth hold
   period, on the effective particle density was also investigated. All of
   the effective density functions were found to be independent of particle
   size within the bias uncertainty of the measurement system, indicating
   that the cigarette smoke particles likely had a spherical morphology.
   Trends in the average effective particle densities were observed for the
   different cigarettes and puffing parameters. While all of these shifts
   were within the bias uncertainty of the CPMA-DMS system, two-sample
   t-tests and the Tukey method were used to identify where the shifts were
   statistically probable. However due to the complexity of cigarette
   smoke, the aerosol mechanisms behind most of these shifts were unknown
   and require further investigation. For all of the tested cases the
   average effective particle density, considering puffs 3-6, varied from
   1090 to 1518 kg/m(3), with a majority (9 out of 16 cases) falling within
   1300 to 1394 kg/m(3). The Tukey method identified no statistical change
   in the effective particle density over the duration of an ISO puff, but
   it did identify significant differences between effective densities
   produced by different cigarettes. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Leachate from a humidity cell experiment provided a geochemical
   framework to evaluate the early evolution of weathering of the same
   waste rock in an Arctic environment. Comparison of laboratory and field
   results indicates the hydrogeochemical system within the higher sulfide
   (0.01-0.27 wt.\% S) waste rock pile has attained a peak weathering
   state, indicated by a shift to acid neutralization by weathering
   products of Al-bearing minerals, stabilization of the pH near 4.5,
   mobility of metals from sulfide and Al-bearing minerals, and a highly
   correlated relation between SO4 release and outflow from the waste rock
   pile. Further weathering of the waste rock should be driven by external
   environmental factors of temperature and precipitation/infiltration
   instead of internal factors of wetting and transient acid-neutralization
   processes. An evaluation of sulfide depletion indicates that 4\% of the
   sulfide in the <63-mm fraction of this waste rock pile, corresponding to
   2\% of the sulfide in the <50-nun fraction, has been removed through
   oxidation and leaching as SO4. Weathering is strongly seasonal because
   of the Arctic climate, which produced a daily sulfide-depletion rate
   corresponding 0-0.02\% and a peak annual depletion of 100 kg or 1.5\% of
   the remaining sulfide content in the <6.3-mm fraction. Peak sulfide
   weathering is expected to continue until about 15\% of the available
   sulfide is depleted, similar to an observed decrease in sulfide
   weathering in the laboratory. Estimates of the reactive surface area of
   the sulfide minerals and a peak rate constant were used to evaluate the
   sulfide percent in the fine fraction of rock in the pile undergoing
   weathering during the annual freeze-thaw cycle, which can be used to
   estimate a climate rate factor to adjust the weathering mass through the
   seasonal changes. For modeling of future leachate, laboratory results
   indicate that an exponential rate limiting factor is necessary to
   account for slowing of sulfide oxidation after peak weathering because
   of the formation of secondary minerals that inhibit element release. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a probabilistic approach for designing
   nonlinear optimal robust tracking controllers for unmanned aerial
   vehicles. The controller design is formulated in terms of a
   multi-objective optimization problem that is solved by using a
   bio-inspired optimization algorithm, offering high likelihood of finding
   an optimal or near-optimal global solution. The process of tuning the
   controller minimizes differences between system outputs and optimal
   specifications given in terms of rising time, overshoot and steady-state
   error, and the controller succeed in fitting the performance
   requirements even considering parametric uncertainties and the
   nonlinearities of the aircraft. The stability of the controller is
   proved for the nominal case and its robustness is carefully verified by
   means of Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Two moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were operated to treat raw
   (untreated) and 30 mg/L ozone-treated oil sands process-affected water
   (OSPW). After 210 days, the MBBR process showed 18.3\% of
   acid-extractable fraction (AEF) and 34.8\% of naphthenic acids (NAs)
   removal, while the ozonation combined MBBR process showed higher removal
   of AEF (41.0\%) and NAs (78.8\%). Biodegradation of raw and ozone
   treated OSPW showed similar performance. UPLC/HRMS analysis showed a
   highest NAs removal efficiency with a carbon number of 14 and a - Z
   number of 4. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed thicker
   biofilms in the raw OSPW MBBR (97 +/- 5 mu m) than in the ozonated OSPW
   MBBR (71 +/- 12 mu m). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR)
   results showed higher abundance of gene copies of total bacteria and
   nitrogen removal relevant bacteria in the ozonated OSPW MBBR, but no
   significant difference was found. MiSeq sequencing showed
   Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Acidobacteria were dominant. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We study the exterior stress field in a three-phase circular inclusion

   interphase layer. All three phases belong to a particular class of
   compressible hyperelastic materials of harmonic type. We focus on the
   design of a harmonic elastic inclusion which by definition, does not
   disturb the sum of the normal stresses in the surrounding matrix. We
   show that in order to make the coated inclusion harmonic, certain
   inequalities concerning the material and geometric parameters of the
   three-phase composite must first be satisfied. The corresponding remote
   loading parameters can then be uniquely determined while keeping the
   associated phase angles arbitrary. Our results allow for both uniform
   and non-uniform remote loading. We show that the stress field inside the
   inclusion is uniform when the remote loading is uniform.}},

Title = {{An experimental study of circular sand-water wall jets}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTIPHASE FLOW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{34-44}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were carried out to study the effects of sand
   particles on circular sand-water wall jets. Mean and turbulence
   characteristics of sand particles in the sand-water wall jets were
   measured for different sand concentrations c(0) ranging from 0.5\% to
   2.5\%. Effects of sand particle size on the centerline sand velocity of
   the jets were evaluated for sand size ranging from 0.21 mm to 0.54 mm.
   Interesting results with the range of measurements are presented in this
   paper. It was found that the centerline sand velocity of the wall jets
   with larger particle size were 15\% higher than the jets with smaller
   particle size. Concentration profiles in the vertical direction showed a
   peak value at x/d = 5 (where x is the longitudinal distance from the
   nozzle and d is the nozzle diameter) and the sand concentration
   decreased linearly for x/d > 5. Experimental results showed that the
   turbulence level enhanced from the nozzle to x/d = 10. For sand-water
   wall jets with a higher concentration (c(0) = 1.5-2.5\%), the turbulence
   intensity became smaller than the corresponding single-phase wall jets
   by 34\% due to turbulent modulation. A modified logarithmic formulation
   was introduced to model the longitudinal turbulent intensity at the
   centerline and along the axis of the jet. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{An experimental investigation of settling velocity of natural sands in
   water using Particle Image Shadowgraph}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{281}},
Pages = {{184-192}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Considering the extensive industrial usage of sands and the benefits of
   improving the effectiveness of such applications, a detailed
   experimental study on settling of quartz sands in water is conducted. In
   this study, 980 quartz sand particles under four sieve sizes in the
   range of 035 mm-1.18 mm are used. Particle Image Shadow-graph (PIS), an
   accurate and efficient technique, is employed to determine the settling
   velocity of the particles. Using PIS in this novel application, the
   particle dimensions are characterized in terms of centricity,
   major/minor axes, and equivalent circular diameter. Using the
   shadowgraph results, an empirical model for settling velocity is
   developed based on a dimensionless diameter and Reynolds number. The
   dimensionless diameter is calculated from the equivalent circular
   diameter (D-c) for the actual projected area of the particle.
   Furthermore, a simplistic empirical model based on equivalent circular
   radius (R-ce) is proposed in which the particles are considered to be
   elliptical. Both models require only two-dimensional size parameters
   that can be easily measured. In this work, drag coefficient (C-d) versus
   Reynolds number curve for sand particles in the intermediate regime is
   also presented. It is observed that C-d attains an approximate value of
   0.95 at Re-p > 160. Also, for particles within a particular sieve
   diameter range, a large variance (1635\% to 92.35\%) in settling
   velocity is observed. Based on the experimental measurement a
   correlation between mean sieve diameter and equivalent circular diameter
   (D-c) is developed which assists in more accurately predicting settling
   velocity. The new empirical models when compared with data in the
   literature predict the settling velocity with an average absolute error
   of 4.1\% and 6.5\%, respectively, for sieve sizes of 0.35 mm-1.18 mm.

Abstract = {{For high-power PWM current-source motor drive systems, due to the low
   converter switching frequency and the relative small dc choke for
   reduced cost/weight, the converters' switching harmonics may interact
   through dc link and produce interharmonics in the entire system. Such
   harmonics interaction phenomenon may give rise to the system resonance
   at certain motor speeds, which degrades the grid-side power quality and
   generates excessive torque ripples on the motor side. The resonance
   caused by the harmonics interaction in high-power PWM current-source
   motor drives is investigated in previous study. In addition, to actively
   suppress such resonance, the basic idea of a dc-link virtual
   impedance-based suppression method has also been proposed. This paper
   extends the previous study to thoroughly analyze the mechanism and
   realization of resonance suppression by the dc-link virtual
   impedance-based method. The in-depth analysis shows that the dc-link
   virtual impedance-based method successfully enables the active
   interharmonics compensation capability of high-power PWM current-source
   drives, which is not addressed in previous researches. Moreover,
   simulations and experiments demonstrate that, by following the selection
   of coefficient in the suppression method discussed in this paper, the
   dc-link virtual impedance-based method can effectively enhance the
   attenuation effect of dc link in high-power PWM current-source drive
   systems so as to suppress the resonance due to the harmonics interaction
   under all resonance conditions.}},

Title = {{An analytical solution to slip buckling slope failure triggered by

Abstract = {{Slip buckling failure often occurs in slopes intersected by a set of
   discontinuities with approximately parallel to the surface.
   Post-earthquake investigations indicate that some slip buckling failures
   occurred during 2008 Wenchuan event. However, it is still difficult to
   evaluate the slip budding failure triggered by earthquakes. In this
   paper, we give a thorough mechanical analysis to slip buckling slope,
   and present an analytical solution on slip buckling slope failure which
   fully considers both the effect of earthquake and pore water pressure
   based on energy equilibrium theory. Then we apply the methodology to
   Tangjiashan landslide. Comprehensive retrospective study indicates that
   Tangjiashan landslide is a typical buckling failure case triggered by
   Wenchuan earthquake. The application shows that the analytical solution
   can be used to evaluate the stability of the slope with potential
   buckling failure during earthquake. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Large scale physics-based reservoir models are employed routinely in the
   prediction of the behavior of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
   processes under different operational situations. However, parametric
   uncertainty persists in these models even after history matching with
   production data. This uncertainty, and the computational cost associated
   with the full-scale reservoir simulations, makes it challenging to use
   reservoir simulators in closed-loop control of reservoirs. As an
   alternative strategy, we present in this work a dynamic proxy model for
   the reservoirs based on system identification and the prediction error
   method using only injection and production data. These proxy models are
   validated against field data from a SAGD reservoir and simulated
   synthetic reservoir data and shown to be appropriate for use in model
   predictive control. We also provide evidence that the predictive power
   of these models can be improved by the appropriate design of input
   signals (injection rates and pressures).}},

Title = {{Bacterial floc mediated rapid streamer formation in creeping flows}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{One of the central puzzles concerning the interaction of low Reynolds
   number (Re << 1) fluid transport with bacterial biomass is the formation
   of filamentous structures called streamers. In this manuscript, we
   report our discovery of a new kind of low Re bacterial streamers, which
   appear from pre-formed bacterial flocs. In sharp contrast to the
   biofilm-mediated streamers, these streamers form over extremely small
   timescales (less than a second). Our experiments, carried out in a
   microchannel with micropillars rely on fluorescence microscopy
   techniques to illustrate that floc-mediated streamers form when a
   freely-moving floc adheres to the micropillar wall and gets rapidly
   sheared by the background flow. We also show that at their inception the
   deformation of the flocs is dominated by recoverable large strains
   indicating significant elasticity. These strains subsequently increase
   tremendously to produce filamentous streamers. Interestingly, we find
   that these fully formed streamers are not static structures and show
   viscous response at time scales larger than their formation time scales.
   Finally, we show that such novel streamer formation can lead to rapid
   clogging of microfluidic devices.}},

Title = {{New approach for extraordinary transmission through an array of
   subwavelength apertures using thin ENNZ metamaterial liners}},
Journal = {{OPTICS EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{20356-20365}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Extraordinary transmission (ET) through a periodic array of
   subwavelength apertures on a perfect metallic screen has been studied
   extensively in recent years, and has largely been attributed to
   diffraction effects, for which the periodicity of the apertures, rather
   than their dimensions, dominates the response. The transmission
   properties of the apertures at resonance, on the other hand, are not
   typically considered `extraordinary' because they may be explained using
   more conventional aperture-theoretical mechanisms. This work describes a
   novel approach for achieving ET in which subwavelength apertures are
   made to resonate by lining them using thin, epsilon-negative and
   near-zero (ENNZ) metamaterials. The use of ENNZ metamaterials has
   recently proven successful in miniaturizing circular waveguides by
   strongly reducing their natural cutoff frequencies, and the theory is
   adapted here for the design of subwavelength apertures in a metallic
   screen. We present simulations and proof-of-concept measurements at
   microwave frequencies that demonstrate ET for apertures measuring
   one-quarter of a wavelength in diameter and suggest the potential for
   even more dramatic miniaturization simply by engineering the ENNZ
   metamaterial dispersion. The results exhibit a fano-like profile whose
   frequency varies with the properties of the metamaterial liner, but is
   independent of period. It is suggested that similar behaviour can be
   obtained at optical frequencies, where ENNZ metamaterials may be
   realized using appropriately arranged chains of plasmonic nanoparticles.

Title = {{Chemistry, mineralogical, and residence of arsenic in a typical high
   arsenic coal}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{61-67}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{The arsenic chemistry, mineral association and distributions in coal
   were evaluated using density fraction and a low temperature ashing
   process. A high arsenic coal from Guizhou province in southwestern China
   was chosen in the study. The results show that light mineral (<2.89
   g/cm(3)) fraction and heavy mineral (>2.89 g/cm(3)) fraction were
   successfully separated from Guizhou coal by means of the process.
   Phase-mineral composition in low temperature ash and light mineral
   fraction are almost the same, mostly quartz and kaolinite. In contrast,
   pyrite dominates in the heavy mineral fraction. Arsenic concentration in
   Guizhou coal is as high as 265 Rig. An obvious enrichment of arsenic in
   heavy mineral fraction is observed, and the arsenic concentration is
   approaching to 650 mu g/g. Modes of occurrence of arsenic exhibit as
   multiple forms. Both organic and inorganic associated arsenic in Guizhou
   coal have been identified. The organic associated arsenic accounts for
   28.40\% (wt.\%) of the total arsenic. The inorganic associated arsenic
   mostly occurs in pyrite. Direct evidence by using the EDX analysis on 27
   pyrite particles confirms that arsenic is occurring in pyrite. Each
   distinct pyrite particle contains a certain amount of arsenic with an
   average of 3.5\% (wt.\%), while the maximum is reaching to 6.7\%
   (wt.\%). Endemic arseniasis is highly suspected to be link to the
   frequent use of coal-burning stove for heating and/or food drying,
   inhalation of indoor air polluted by arsenic derived from coal
   combustion in houses, and the contaminated water in Guizhou province,
   southwestern China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The particulate matter (PM) emitted from a single-cylinder
   compression-ignition, natural-gas engine fitted with a High-Pressure
   Direct-Injection (HPDI) system distinctly different from a duel fuel
   engine was investigated, and characterized by size distribution,
   morphology, mass-mobility exponent, effective density, volatility,
   mixing state, and primary particle size using transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), and tandem measurements from differential mobility
   analyzers (DMA) and a centrifugal particle mass analyzer (CPMA). Six
   engine conditions were selected with varying load, speed, exhaust gas
   recirculation (EGR) fraction, and fuel delivery strategy. An increase in
   engine load increased both the number concentration and the geometric
   mean diameter of the particulate. The fraction of the number of purely
   volatile particles to total number of particles (number volatile
   fraction, NVF) was found to decrease as load increased, although at the
   lower speed, partially premixed mode, the lowest NVF. All size
   distributions were also found to be unimodal. The size-segregated ratio
   of the mass of internally mixed volatile material to total particle mass
   (mass volatile fraction, MVF) decreased with load and with particle
   mobility-equivalent diameter. A roughly constant amount of volatile
   material is likely produced at each engine mode, and the decrease in MVF
   is due to the increase in PM number with load. Effective density and
   mass-mobility exponent of the non-volatile soot at the different engine
   loads were the same or slightly higher than soot from traditional diesel
   engines. Denuded effective density trends were observed to collapse to
   approximately the same line, although engine modes with higher MVFs had
   slightly higher effective densities suggesting that the soot structures
   have collapsed into more dense shapes-a suspicion that is confirmed with
   TEM images. TEM results also indicated that primary particle size first
   decreases from low to medium load, then increases from medium to high
   load. An increase in EGR was also seen to increase primary particle
   size. Coefficients were determined for a relation that gives primary
   particle diameter as a function of projected area equivalent diameter. A
   decrease in load or speed results in a stronger correlation.

Abstract = {{Grid-based location problems (GBLPs) can be used to solve location
   problems in business, engineering, resource exploitation, and even in
   the field of medical sciences. To solve these decision problems, an
   integer linear programming (ILP) model is designed and developed to
   provide the optimal solution for GBLPs considering fixed cost criteria.
   Preliminary results show that the ILP model is efficient in solving
   small to moderate-sized problems. However, this ILP model becomes
   intractable in solving large-scale instances. Therefore, a decomposition
   heuristic is proposed to solve these large-scale GBLPs, which
   demonstrates significant reduction of solution runtimes. To benchmark
   the proposed heuristic, results are compared with the exact solution via
   ILP. The experimental results show that the proposed method
   significantly outperforms the exact method in runtime with minimal (and
   in most cases, no) loss of optimality.}},

Title = {{Characterizing the Effects of Lean Zones and Shale Distribution in
   Steam-Assisted-Gravity-Drainage Recovery Performance}},
Journal = {{SPE RESERVOIR EVALUATION \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{329-345}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Performance of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is influenced
   significantly by the distributions of lean zones and shale barriers,
   which tend to impede the vertical growth and lateral spread of a steam
   chamber. Previous literature has partially addressed their effects on
   SAGD performance; however, a comprehensive and systematic investigation
   of the heterogeneous distribution (location, continuity, size,
   saturation, and proportions) of shale barriers and lean zones is still
   lacking.
   In this study, numerical simulations are used to model the SAGD process.
   Capillarity and relative permeability effects, which were ignored in
   many previous simulation studies, are incorporated to model bypassed
   oil. Numerous ranking schemes are formulated to analyze various aspects
   of SAGD performance. A detailed sensitivity analysis is performed by
   varying the location, continuity, size, proportions, and saturation of
   these heterogeneous features. Lean zones and shale lenses (imbedded in a
   region of degraded rock properties) with different sizes and degrees of
   continuity are placed in areas above the injector, below the producer,
   or in between the well pair. It is noted that among numerous parameters
   that influence the ultimate recovery, remaining bypassed oil, chamber
   advancement, and heat loss, continuity and position of these features in
   relation to the well pair play a particularly crucial role. Neural
   network modeling is subsequently used for constructing data-driven
   models to identify and propose a set of input variables for correlating
   relevant parameters or measures, which are descriptive of the
   heterogeneity and properties of the shale barriers and lean zones, to
   recovery and ranking results.
   This work provides a guideline for assessing the impacts of reservoir
   and saturation heterogeneities on SAGD performance. A set of input
   variables and parameters that have significant impacts on the ensuing
   recovery response is identified. One can define readily the proposed set
   of variables from well logs and apply immediately in data-driven models
   with field data and scaleup analysis of experimental models to assist
   field-operation design and evaluation. One can also extend the approach
   presented in this paper to analyze other solvent-assisted SAGD
   processes.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The abundant hydrocarbon resources in low-permeability formations are
   now technically accessible because of advances in the drilling and
   completion of multilateral/multifractured horizontal wells. However,
   measurement and modeling of petrophysical properties, required for
   reserves estimation and reservoi-rengineering calculations, are the
   remaining challenges for the development of tight formations. In
   particular, characterizing wett-ability (wetting affinity) of tight
   rocks is challenging because of their complex pore structure, which can
   be either in hydrophobic organic materials or in hydrophilic inorganic
   materials.
   We conduct comparative and systematic imbibition experiments on 10 twin
   core plugs from the Montney tight gas formation, which is an enormous
   tight gas fairway in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Both
   contact-angle and imbibition data indicate that the formation has a
   stronger affinity to oil than to water. However, the ratio between oil
   and water uptake of these samples is usually higher than what
   capillary-driven imbibition models predict. This discrepancy can be
   explained by the strong adsorption of oil on the surface of a
   well-connected organic-pore network that is partly composed of degraded
   bitumen. We also define a wettability index on the basis of the
   equilibrium oil and water uptake of the twin samples. Oil-wettability
   index is positively correlated with total organic carbon and clay
   content of the rocks, which generally increase from the upper Montney to
   the lower Montney.}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on
   orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption is believed to be
   brought about through mechanical signals induced by the low-intensity
   pulsed ultrasound. However, the stimulatory mechanism triggering dental
   cell response has not been clearly identified yet. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate possible relations between the amounts of new cementum
   regeneration and ultrasonic parameters such as pressure amplitude and
   time-averaged energy density. We used the finite-element method to
   simulate the previously published experiment on ultrasonic wave
   propagation in the dentoalveolar structure of beagle dogs. Qualitative
   relations between the thickness of the regenerated cementum in the
   experiment and the ultrasonic parameters were observed. Our results
   indicated that the areas of the root surface with greater ultrasonic
   pressure were associated with larger amounts of cementum regeneration.
   However, the establishment of reliable quantitative correlations between
   ultrasound parameters and cementum regeneration requires more
   experimental data and simulations. (E-mail: vafaeian@ualberta.ca) (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents an informatics framework to apply feature-based
   engineering concept for cost estimation supported with data mining
   algorithms. The purpose of this research work is to provide a practical
   procedure for more accurate cost estimation by using the commonly
   available manufacturing process data associated with ERP systems. The
   proposed method combines linear regression and data-mining techniques,
   leverages the unique strengths of the both, and creates a mechanism to
   discover cost features. The final estimation function takes the user's
   confidence level over each member technique into consideration such that
   the application of the method can phase in gradually in reality by
   building up the data mining capability. A case study demonstrates the
   proposed framework and compares the results from empirical cost
   prediction and data mining. The case study results indicate that the
   combined method is flexible and promising for determining the costs of
   the example welding features. With the result comparison between the
   empirical prediction and five different data mining algorithms, the ANN
   algorithm shows to be the most accurate for welding operations. (C) 2015

   study were obtained from theoretical model named FUNNEL-GHG-OS

Abstract = {{Resonant glassy nanostrings have been employed for the detection of
   biomolecules. These devices offer high sensitivity and amenability to
   large array integration and multiplexed assays. Such a concept has
   however been impaired by the lack of stable and biocompatible linker
   chemistries. Diazonium salt reduction-induced aryl grafting is an
   aqueous-based process providing strong chemical adhesion. In this work,
   diazonium-based linker chemistry was performed for the first time on
   glassy nanostrings, which enabled the bio-functionalization of such
   devices. Large arrays of nanostrings with ultra-narrow widths down to 10
   nm were fabricated employing electron beam lithography. Diazonium
   modification was first developed on SiCN surfaces and validated by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. Similarly modified nanostrings were then
   covalently functionalized with anti-rabbit IgG as a molecular probe.
   Specific enumeration of rabbit IgG was successfully performed through
   observation of downshifts of resonant frequencies. The specificity of
   this enumeration was confirmed through proper negative control
   experiments. Helium ion microscopy further verified the successful
   functionalization of nanostrings.}},

Abstract = {{The development of nonwoven meshes based on cellulose acetate (CA)
   reinforced by cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) is reported. The meshes were
   electrospun from 15 wt\% CA (M-n = 30,000) in dimethylacetamide/ acetone
   (1:2, w/w) solutions with various concentrations of CNC dispersions. The
   investigated six levels of CNC dispersions in CA solutions were: 0,
   0.075, 0.147, 0.225, 0.300 and 0.382 wt\%, which corresponded to 0,
   0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 1.99 and 2.55 wt\% of CNC in solid fibers. The basis
   of the impact of CNC nano-particles on fiber diameter and morphology was
   explored by assessing their contributions to the viscosity, conductivity
   and homogeneity of CA/CNC solutions. CA/CNC nonwoven meshes spun from
   suspensions with 0.075 wt\% CNC had best results in morphology and fiber
   uniformity. Additionally, mechanical properties of CA nonwoven meshes
   with five levels of CNC loading (0, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50 and 1.99 wt\%) were
   examined. The CA nonwoven mesh with 0.50 wt\% CNC showed best mechanical
   properties, and its elastic modulus (E) was improved to an average value
   of 1.68 GPa from 1.17 GPa of neat CA nanofiber nonwoven mesh. These
   improved meshes would have applications such as separation membranes,
   supports for catalysts and sensors, engineered tissues and other smart
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{The Earth's outer core is a rotating ellipsoidal shell of compressible,
   stratified and self-gravitating fluid. As such, in the treatment of
   geophysical problems a realistic model of this body needs to be
   considered. In this work, we consider compressible and stratified fluid
   core models with different stratification parameters, related to the
   local Brunt-Vaisala frequency, in order to study the effects of the
   core's density stratification on the frequencies of some of the
   inertial-gravity modes of this body. The inertial-gravity modes of the
   core are free oscillations with periods longer than 12 hr. Historically,
   an incompressible and homogeneous fluid is considered to study these
   modes and analytical solutions are known for the frequencies and the
   displacement eigenfunctions of a spherical model. We show that for a
   compressible and stratified spherical core model the effects of
   non-neutral density stratification may be significant, and the
   frequencies of these modes may change from model to model. For example,
   for a spherical core model the frequency of the spin-over mode, the (2,
   1, 1) mode, is unaffected while that of the (4, 1, 1) mode is changed
   from-0.410 for the Poincare core model to -0.434, -0.447 and -0.483 for
   core models with the stability parameter beta = -0.001, -0.002 and
   -0.005, respectively, a maximum change of about 18 per cent when beta =
   -0.005. Our results also show that for small stratification parameter,
   vertical bar beta vertical bar <= 0.005, the frequency of an
   inertial-gravity mode is a nearly linear function of beta but the slope
   of the line is different for different modes, and that the effects of
   density stratification on the frequency of a mode is likely related to
   its spatial structure, which remains the same in different Earth models.
   We also compute the frequencies of some of the modes of the ` PREM'
   (spherical shell) core model and show that the frequencies of these
   modes may also be significantly affected by non-zero beta.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF PLASMAS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{We have re-examined the pump-coupling term of the growth rate, in the
   fluid-Maxwell theory for the weak-damping limit of the two-plasmon decay
   instability of an electromagnetic wave (pump) in a homogeneous plasma.
   We found that the maximum pump coupling is obtained as
   (k(0)nu(0)/4)(2T(L)/ IT - 1) for electron temperatures T exceeding
   T-L{[} (2/9) (1 - 4n/n(c))(mc(2))]. The well-known result for the pump
   coupling as k(0)nu(0)/4 is only valid for T < T-L. We found that the
   configuration of electron plasma waves is described by a lemniscate (an
   8-shaped curve) for T > T-L and by a hyperbola for T < T-L. Thus, the
   pump coupling is reduced by electron heating and vanishes at the
   temperature equal to 2T(L). The temperature-dependent pump coupling can
   occur even for a relatively cold plasma because the boundary temperature
   T-L can be small if the electron density n is sufficiently close to the
   quarter critical (n(c)/4). Here, k(0) is the pump wavenumber, nu(0) is
   the velocity amplitude of an electron oscillating under the pump
   electric field, n(c)(omega(2)(0)m/4 pi e(2)) is the critical density, m
   is the electron particle mass, c is the speed of light in free space,
   omega(0) is the pump angular frequency, and e is the electron particle
   charge. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Construction engineering and management research takes advantage of
   proven technologies and turns them into cost-effective solutions in the
   construction field. This paper describes our efforts in the development
   of a new alignment control and machine guidance system for tunnel-boring
   operations. Steering a tunnel boring machine (TBM) in tunnel projects
   normally relies on a laser station which projects a laser beam onto a
   laser target board mounted on the TBM. However, current practice lacks
   accuracy and requires tedious, time-consuming calibrations, thus
   potentially leading to quality defects, schedule delay, and cost overrun
   in tunnel construction. This research has developed an automated system
   called ``virtual laser target board (VLTB){''} in order to facilitate
   field construction. Through automation and technology integration, a
   commonly available survey tool -namely the robotic total station is
   transformed into a construction control robot, which is capable of
   precisely positioning and tracking the TBM in the underground space. By
   applying innovative computing algorithms, the exact coordinates of the
   cutter head center on the working TBM can be derived in millimeter-level
   accuracy. Thus, the invisible cutter head center can be visualized in a
   tablet interface in relation to the as-designed alignment. The VLTB
   system was field tested on a 1,000 m long sewage tunneling project in
   the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The tunnel test bed showcases the
   future of technology integration and automation in construction.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of femtoscale displacements in the ultrasonic frequency
   range is attractive for advanced material characterization and sensing,
   yet major challenges remain in their reliable transduction using
   non-optical modalities, which can dramatically reduce the size and
   complexity of the transducer assembly. Here we demonstrate femtoscale
   displacement transduction using an AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field effect
   transistor-integrated GaN microcantilever that utilizes piezoelectric
   polarization-induced changes in two-dimensional electron gas to
   transduce displacement with very high sensitivity. The piezotransistor
   demonstrated an ultra-high gauge factor of 8,700 while consuming an
   extremely low power of 1.36 nW, and transduced external excitation with
   a superior noise-limited resolution of 12.43 fm Hz(-1/2) and an
   outstanding responsivity of 170 nV fm(-1), which is comparable to the
   optical transduction limits. These extraordinary characteristics, which
   enabled unique detection of nanogram quantity of analytes using
   photoacoustic spectroscopy, can be readily exploited in realizing a
   multitude of novel sensing paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer behavior of electro-active species from bulk solution
   to a metal surface (Alloy 800) under subcooled boiling and fully
   developed nucleate boiling conditions was investigated using a novel
   pool-boiling device. The electro-chemical method was used to measure the
   mass transfer rate on a boiling surface. Potassium ferricyanide and
   hydrogen peroxide were used as the nonvolatile and volatile reaction
   species, respectively. It was found that for both volatile and
   nonvolatile species, the mass transfer rate was increased in the
   subcooled nucleate boiling region where the subcooled electrolyte
   temperature varied between 80 degrees C and 95 degrees C. This was a
   result of the enhanced micromixing effect. On the other hand, under the
   fully developed nucleate boiling region where the electrolyte
   temperature remained relatively constant at 96 degrees C, the increase
   in mass transfer rate with increasing heat flux was attributed to the
   increased macromixing effects. Also, the mass transfer rate for hydrogen
   peroxide was found to increase at higher rate than that of ferricyanide
   ions because of the volatile nature of hydrogen peroxide, allowing it to
   be transferred through both liquid and vapor phases during the reaction.}},

   (WAG). Experimental results show that, relatively speaking, at the
   initial oil saturation condition, the moderate pore throats contain the
   highest amount of oil. The water flood recovery degree is higher from
   larger pore throats (average recovery degree of 98.57\%) than that from
   moderate pore throats (average recovery degree of 78.29\%). The water
   flood efficiency in different cores is found to be dependent on the
   degree of heterogeneity in pore throat distribution. After water flood,
   the residual oil is mainly located in smaller pore throats. CO2-foam
   flood shows good performance in tapping the residual oil contained in
   smaller pore throats, while the WAG can recover more oil from larger
   pore throats. Furthermore, it is found that the combination of CO2-foam
   flood and WAG provides the highest recovery efficiency since it is
   effective in reducing the oil saturation in pore throats with varied
   sizes. Based on this investigation on the residual oil saturation in
   pore throats subjected to secondary and tertiary floods, it is possible
   to design an optimum flood scheme which suits the microscope pore throat
   characteristics for a given reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{After successful isolation of the most interfacially active subtraction
   of asphaltenes (IAAs) reported in the first part of this series of
   publications, comprehensive chemical analyses including ES-MS, elemental
   analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry were used to determine how the
   molecular fingerprint features of IAAs are different from those of the
   remaining asphaltenes (RAs). Compared with the RAs, the IAA molecules
   were shown to have higher molecular weight and higher contents of
   heteroatoms (e.g., three times higher oxygen content). The analysis on
   the elemental content and FTIR spectroscopy suggested that IAAs
   contained higher contents of high-polarity sulfoxide groups than the
   RAs. The results of ES-MS, NMR, FTIR, and elemental analyses were used
   to construct average molecular representations of IAA and RA molecules.
   These structures were used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to
   study interfacial and aggregation behaviors of the proposed molecules.
   The MD simulation study showed little affinity of representative RA
   molecules to the oil/water interface, while the representative IAA
   molecules had much higher interfacial activity, reflecting the
   extraction method. The aggregation of IAA molecules in the bulk oil
   phase and their adsorption at oil/water interface were not directly
   related to the ring system, but rather to the associations between or
   including sulfoxide groups. During the simulation, the IAA molecules
   were found to be self-assembled in solvent, forming supramolecular
   structures and a porous network at the oil/water interface, as suggested
   in our previous work. The results obtained in this study provide a
   better understanding of the role of asphaltenes in stabilizing petroleum
   emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{Asphaltene aggregation and deposition are common concerns in reservoirs,
   and during production, transport, and refining of petroleum fluids.
   Polymer addition provides one approach for the modification and control
   of asphaltene behavior. Asphaltene nanoaggregates are stable in toluene,
   but when a nonadsorbing polymer like polystyrene is added, two liquid
   phases, one enriched in asphaltenes and toluene, and one enriched in
   toluene and polymer, are formed due to depletion flocculation. This
   phase separation mechanism impacts nanoaggregate but not molecular
   behaviors. In this work, an experimental phase diagram for Athabasca
   asphaltene + toluene + polystyrene mixtures including a two-phase
   critical point is presented, at 298 K. The compositions of phases and
   the critical point are compared with those arising in equivalent
   mixtures with Maya asphaltenes published previously. These experimental
   outcomes are also interpreted using a modified Fleer-Tuinier model, and
   the possibility of the development of an asphaltene separation process
   based on the depletion flocculation mechanism is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Polystyrene, a non-adsorbing polymer, has been shown to cause Maya and
   Athabasca asphaltene + toluene mixtures to split into two stable liquid
   phases at room temperature. One phase is enriched in polystyrene and
   toluene. The other phase is enriched in asphaltene and toluene. The
   phase boundaries, tie lines, and critical points for Maya asphaltene +
   toluene + polystyrene (M-w = 393 000 and 700 000 g/mol) and Athabasca
   asphaltene + toluene + polystyrene (M-w = 393 000 g/mol) have also been
   simulated at room temperature using a modified Fleer-Tuinier colloid
   phase behavior model. In this work, the temperature dependence of the
   depletion flocculation-driven phase behavior is investigated for Maya
   asphaltene + toluene + polystyrene (M-w = 393 000 g/mol) mixtures both
   experimentally and theoretically. The coincidence of experimental
   two-phase to one-phase boundaries, including liquid liquid critical
   points and tie lines at 248 and 298 K, illustrates the
   temperature-independent nature of this phase behavior. This outcome is
   interpreted and predicted in terms of the known temperature dependence
   of the radius of gyration of polymer molecules, possible impacts of
   temperature variation on mean asphaltene aggregate size, and relative
   importance of steric repulsion and depletion attraction effects in
   determining the phase behavior of asphaltene + toluene + polystyrene
   mixtures. Experimental and modeling outcomes are discussed.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Friedel-Crafts alkylation as a strategy to convert asphaltenes to
   maltenes was investigated. It was postulated that conversion of polar
   hydroxyl groups in the asphaltenes would make the product more soluble
   in light hydrocarbons. Reactions were performed with oilsands
   bitumen-derived materials using FeCl3 as a catalyst and o-xylene and
   methanol, separately. Only the reaction of o-xylene with asphaltenes was
   mildly beneficial; it resulted in 6\% conversion of asphaltenes to
   maltenes and an increase of 9\% in straight-run distillate and vacuum
   gas oil. The reactions of o-xylene with maltenes and bitumen were
   detrimental, as was all alkylation reactions with methanol. To better
   understand the nature of the conversion, the reactions were repeated
   with model compounds. With 2-naphthol, it was found that dimerization of
   2-naphthol to produce (1,1'-binaphthalene)-2,2'-diol (BINOL) and the
   subsequent coordination with iron were the two dominant reactions. The
   adverse consequences of FeCl3-catalyzed conversion could be explained by
   such intermolecular addition reactions. The reaction of 2-naphthol with
   methanol and FeCl3 also caused some chlorination of the product. The
   possibility that FeCl3 as a catalyst affected ethers was explored by
   performing the reaction with dibenzyl ether as feed. It was found that
   the ether bonds were cleaved. In the presence of o-xylene, ether
   cleavage was followed by C-alkylation. The increase in maltenes after
   the reaction of o-xylene with asphaltenes was better explained by
   C-alkylation following ether cleavage than the reaction between o-xylene
   and the hydroxyl groups in the asphaltenes. The reaction of dibenzyl
   ether with methanol produced benzaldehyde, rearrangement products, and
   heavy gums.}},

Abstract = {{Given a set of positions for wireless nodes, the interference
   minimization problem is to assign a transmission radius (i.e., a power
   level) to each node such that the resulting communication graph is
   connected while minimizing the maximum (respectively, average)
   interference. We consider the model introduced by von Rickenbach et al.
   (2005), in which each wireless node is represented by a point in
   Euclidean space on which is centered a transmission range represented by
   a ball, and edges in the corresponding graph are symmetric. The problem
   is NP-complete in two or more dimensions (Buchin 2008), and no
   polynomial-time approximation algorithm is known. We show how to solve
   the problem efficiently in settings typical for wireless ad hoc
   networks. If nodes are represented by a set P of n points selected
   uniformly and independently at random over a d-dimensional rectangular
   region, then the topology given by the closure of the Euclidean minimum
   spanning tree of P has O(log n) maximum interference with high
   probability and O(1) expected interference. We extend the first bound to
   a general class of communication graphs over a broad set of probability
   distributions. We present a local algorithm that constructs a graph from
   this class; this is the first local algorithm to provide an upper bound
   on expected maximum interference. Finally, we disprove a conjecture of
   Devroye and Morin (2012) relating the maximum interference of the
   Euclidean minimum spanning tree to the optimal maximum interference
   attainable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of thermal performance
   for four types of heat sinks. The investigated heat sinks were: extruded
   uncoated longitudinal fin heat sink, extruded coated longitudinal fin
   heat sink by aluminum nanoparticles, rectangular block of commercially
   available aluminum metallic foam, and the innovative heat sink using
   water as a working fluid with the velocity of 1.17 m/s, aluminum
   nanocoated metallic foams, and uncoated metallic foams. Each heat sink
   was cooled by a confined stream of ambient air. The experiments were
   done in a wind tunnel where the free stream velocity ranged from 1 m/s
   to 3 m/s. Temperatures were measured at the base of heat sinks to
   represent the Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) chip
   temperature. The effects of air flow velocity on the thermal resistance
   of the heat sinks were also investigated. The thermal resistances of the
   four heat sinks were compared as well. The results showed that the
   innovative heat sink with aluminum nanoparticles had the best
   performance in comparison to the above mentioned heat sinks used for the
   study. Although the metallic foam heat sink had better performance than
   uncoated heat sinks, it cannot be an economic replacement for industrial
   applications due to its high price and dirt absorbing property. (C) 2015

   facilitates thermally induced charge carrier trapping in the surface
   states, which affects its electrical resonance response. Electrical
   resonance response of the nanowire varies significantly depending on the
   photothermal spectrum of the adsorbed molecules. We demonstrate highly
   selective detection of mid-IR photothermal spectral signatures of
   femtogram level molecules physisorbed on a nanowire by monitoring
   internal dissipation response at its electrical resonance.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of tissue water
   is a sensitive and specific indicator of acute brain ischemia, where
   reductions of the diffusion of tissue water are observed acutely in the
   stroke lesion core. Although these diffusion changes have been long
   attributed to cell swelling, the precise nature of the biophysical
   mechanisms remains uncertain.
   Methods-The potential cause of diffusion reductions after stroke was
   investigated using an advanced DWI technique, oscillating gradient
   spin-echo DWI, that enables much shorter diffusion times and can improve
   specificity for alterations of structure at the micron level.
   Results-Diffusion measurements in the white matter lesions of patients
   with acute ischemic stroke were reduced by only 8\% using oscillating
   gradient spin-echo DWI, in contrast to a 37\% decrease using standard
   DWI. Neurite beading has recently been proposed as a mechanism for the
   diffusion changes after ischemic stroke with some ex vivo evidence. To
   explore whether beading could cause such differential results,
   simulations of beaded cylinders and axonal swelling were performed,
   yielding good agreement with experiment.
   Conclusions-Short diffusion times result in dramatically reduced
   diffusion contrast of human stroke. Simulations implicate a combination
   of neuronal beading and axonal swelling as the key structural changes
   leading to the reduced apparent diffusion coefficient after stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume on
   magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly being used as a surrogate
   outcome measure in clinical trials. We aimed to characterize the
   evolution of DWI lesion volumes within 30 days of symptom onset after
   minor stroke.
   Methods-Minor stroke patients with DWI lesions on magnetic resonance
   imaging within 48 hours of symptom onset were prospectively followed
   with magnetic resonance imaging brain scan at 7 and 30 days. Change in
   the lesion volume was defined as the difference between day 30
   Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery and baseline DWI lesion volumes.
   Results-Three patterns of infarct evolution were observed: reduction (72
   {[}63\%]), no change (26 {[}23\%]), and growth (16 {[}14\%]). Patients
   with infarct reduction at 30 days had larger baseline DWI lesion volumes
   (2.5 {[}0.9-8.5] mL) than those with stable infarcts (0.5 {[}0.3-0.9]
   mL; P=0.01). Complete DWI reversal at day 30, was seen in only 6 (5.3\%)

   Conclusions-The most common pattern of infarct evolution in patients
   with minor stroke is a reduction in volume, but complete resolution is
   uncommon.}},

   formation process was recorded by two independent optical methods. Dried
   particles in a size range of 10-30 mu m were collected for morphology
   analysis, showing hollow, elongated particles whose structure was
   dependent on the drying gas temperature and initial solution
   concentration. The setup allowed comprehensive measurements of the

   examined by comparing the EOF mobility for varying ratios of pore

Abstract = {{In general, in order to compensate the thermal error or the positioning
   error of a ball screw feed drive system, the actual temperature or
   positioning data feedback was needed. The traditional thermal error
   compensation system of ball screw feed drive is highly dependent on the
   feedback temperature or positioning data. Because of the overdependence
   to measuring technique, increasing of compensation system cost and
   decreasing of productivity level will be an inevitable trend in a
   machine tool. This paper presents a new approach in ball screw thermal
   error compensation system which can work without any temperature or
   positioning feedback. As the parts of the thermal error compensation
   system, component heat generation, compensation method, thermal model,
   mathematic model and calculation method were studied respectively. In
   order to verify correctness and generality of the developed thermal
   model and the thermal error compensation system, a series of simulations
   was carried out in several kinds of working condition. Through the
   series of simulations with the thermal model, calculation method and
   simulation conditions, deformation characteristics and thermal behavior
   of the prototype ball screw system have been obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Railways across the Canadian Cordillera have long histories of losses
   associated with ground hazards. The hazards most frequently reported are
   rockfalls, which are ubiquitous along the steep rock cuts required to
   accommodate the railway alignment. Several hazard control measures can
   be adopted in rockfall areas. However, when rockfall frequencies cannot
   be controlled, protective structures may be necessary to decrease
   rockfall-related risks to tolerable levels. Designs of protective
   structures require knowing rockfall trajectory heights and kinetic
   energies. This information is difficult to obtain even at locations
   where comprehensive rockfall records are kept. We present a method to
   calculate rockfall trajectory heights and velocities based on
   three-dimensional, lumped mass, rockfall simulations. Rockfall source
   location, model parameters and model calibration are also discussed. In
   this regard, the model should be calibrated against observed values of
   rockfall heights and velocities, and the design parameters should be
   validated before proceeding with the design of rockfall mitigation
   measures. The method is illustrated with the analysis of a section of a
   railway along the Canadian Cordillera. Furthermore, a probabilistic
   approach is adopted to calculate rockfall trajectory heights and
   velocities when intersecting the railway alignment. This is consistent
   with the natural variability of rockfall trajectories and falling block
   volumes. We illustrate the use of probability distributions of rockfall
   velocities and volumes to calculate the distribution of kinetic energy
   at three locations along the study section. The calculated rockfall
   trajectory heights are also presented in probabilistic terms and
   discussed. The rockfall kinetic energy distributions are used to assess
   the type of protective structures that could be required for further
   reduction of risk levels.}},

Abstract = {{The inability to voluntarily control the trunk musculature is a major
   problem following spinal cord injury as it can compromise functional
   independence and produce unwanted secondary complications. Recent
   developments suggest that neuroprostheses utilizing functional
   electrical stimulation (FES) may be able to facilitate or restore trunk
   control during sitting, standing, and other tasks involving postural
   control. In spite of these efforts, no study to date has used
   low-intensity FES to increase multidirectional trunk stiffness and
   damping in an attempt to bolster stability while minimizing muscle
   fatigue. Therefore, we set out to investigate how multidirectional trunk
   stiffness changes in response to low-intensity FES of a few selected
   trunk muscles. Fifteen healthy participants sitting naturally were
   randomly perturbed in eight horizontal directions. Trunk stiffness and
   damping during natural and FES-supported sitting conditions were
   quantified using force and trunk kinematics in combination with two
   models of a mass-spring-damper system. Our results indicate that
   low-intensity FES can increase trunk stiffness in healthy individuals,
   and this specifically for directions associated with the stimulated
   muscles. In contrast, trunk damping was not found to be altered during
   FES. The presented results suggest that low-intensity FES is a simple
   and effective method for increasing trunk stiffness on demand. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In principle component pursuit (PCP), the essential idea is to replace
   the original non-convex optimization problem of the matrix rank and the
   count of non-zero entries by a convex optimization problem of the
   nuclear and l(1) norms. In the PCP literature, it is rigorously proved
   that the validity of this idea depends on the coherence of the
   uncontaminated data. Specifically, the lower the coherence is, the
   equivalence of the convex optimization problem to the original
   non-convex one will hold by a larger probability. Although the coherence
   index is fixed for a given data set, it is possible to adjust this index
   by introducing different scalings to the data. The target of this work
   is thus to find the optimal scaling of the data such that the coherence
   index is minimized. Based on the analysis of the PCP problem structure,
   a non-convex optimization problem with implicit dependence on the
   scaling parameters is firstly formulated. To solve this problem, a
   coordinate descent algorithm is proposed. Under mild conditions on the
   structure of the data matrix, the convergence of the algorithm to a
   global optimal point is rigorously proved by treating the algorithm as a
   discrete-time dynamic system and utilizing a Lyapunov-type approach.
   Monte Carlo simulation experiments are performed to verify the
   effectiveness of the developed results.}},

Title = {{An Efficient Application Mapping Approach for the Co-Optimization of

Abstract = {{In this paper, an efficient application mapping approach is proposed for
   the co-optimization of reliability, communication energy, and
   performance (CoREP) in network-on-chip (NoC)-based reconfigurable
   architectures. A cost model for the CoREP is developed to evaluate the
   overall cost of a mapping. In this model, communication energy and
   latency (as a measure of performance) are first considered in energy
   latency product (ELP), and then ELP is co-optimized with reliability by
   a weight parameter that defines the optimization priority. Both
   transient and intermittent errors in NoC are modeled in CoREP. Based on
   CoREP, a mapping approach, referred to as priority and ratio oriented
   branch and bound (PRBB), is proposed to derive the best mapping by
   enumerating all the candidate mappings organized in a search tree. Two
   techniques, branch node priority recognition and partial cost ratio
   utilization, are adopted to improve the search efficiency. Experimental
   results show that the proposed approach achieves significant
   improvements in reliability, energy, and performance. Compared with the
   state-of-the-art methods in the same scope, the proposed approach has
   the following distinctive advantages: 1) CoREP is highly flexible to
   address various NoC topologies and routing algorithms while others are
   limited to some specific topologies and/or routing algorithms; 2)
   general quantitative evaluation for reliability, energy, and performance
   are made, respectively, before being integrated into unified cost model
   in general context while other similar models only touch upon two of
   them; and 3) CoREP-based PRBB attains a competitive processing speed,
   which is faster than other mapping approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a real-time analytical space harmonic model of
   permanent magnet synchronous machines with shaped poles. The goal of
   this configuration is to produce an air-gap flux density distribution as
   close to sinusoidal as possible to enhance the machine performance. The
   analytical model is derived to predict the magnetic fields and the
   machine behavior by solving Maxwell's equations and applying the
   superposition theorem. The digital hardware realization of the model is
   developed on the field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in a paralleled
   and pipelined paradigm for an efficient hardware design. Such real-time
   emulation on FPGA can be used in the design procedure and the assessment
   of newly prototyped controllers and drive systems in the
   hardware-in-the-loop platform. In this paper, the analytical model of
   the machine is simulated in real time on 7.5 ns input FPGA clock cycles,
   and the achieved executive time is 1.8 mu s. The captured real-time
   analytical results demonstrate the good accuracy of the emulator in
   comparison with the offline 2-D time-stepping transient finite-element
   solution obtained by JMAG software.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in CMOS technology have made digital circuits and systems very
   sensitive to manufacturing variations, aging, and/or soft errors.
   Fault-tolerant techniques using hardware redundancy have been
   extensively investigated for improving reliability. Quadded logic (QL)
   is an interwoven redundant logic technique that corrects errors by
   switching them from critical to subcritical status; however, QL cannot
   correct errors in the last one or two layers of a circuit. In contrast
   to QL, quadded transistor (QT) corrects errors while performing the
   function of a circuit. In this brief, a technique that combines QL with
   QT is proposed to take advantage of both techniques. The proposed
   quadded logic with quadded transistor (QLQT) technique is evaluated and
   compared with other fault-tolerant techniques, such as triple modular
   redundancy and triple interwoven redundancy, using stochastic
   computational models. Simulation results show that QLQT has a better
   reliability than the other fault-tolerant techniques (except in the very
   restrictive case of small circuits with low gate error rates and very
   short paths from primary inputs to primary outputs). These results
   provide a new insight for implementing efficient fault-tolerant
   techniques in the design of reliable circuits and systems.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical alternations in cardiac action potential duration have been
   shown to be a precursor to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Through
   the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling, the presence of
   electrical alternans induces alternations in the heart muscle
   contractile activity. Also, contraction of cardiac tissue affects the
   process of cardiac electric wave propagation through the mechanism of
   the so-called mechanoelectrical feedback. Electrical excitation and
   contraction of cardiac tissue can be linked by an electromechanical
   model such as the Nash-Panfilov model. In this work, we explore the
   feasibility of suppressing cardiac alternans in the Nash-Panfilov model
   which is employed for small and large deformations. Several electrical
   pacing and mechanical perturbation feedback strategies are considered to
   demonstrate successful suppression of alternans on a one-dimensional
   cable. This is the first attempt to combine electrophysiologically
   relevant cardiac models of electrical wave propagation and contractility
   of cardiac tissue in a synergistic effort to suppress cardiac alternans.
   Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility and the
   effects of the proposed algorithms to suppress cardiac alternans. (C)

Abstract = {{Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are reported to be the
   most common category of nonfatal occupational injuries that result in
   days away from work and are also a leading cause of temporary and
   permanent disability. One of the most effective approaches to preventing
   WMSDs is to evaluate ergonomics considerations early in the design and
   construction planning stage before the worker encounters the unsafe
   conditions. However, a lack of tools for identifying potential ergonomic
   risks in a proposed workplace design has led to difficulties in
   integrating safety and health into workplace design practice. In an
   effort to address this issue, this study explores a motion data-driven
   framework for ergonomic analysis that automates and visualizes the
   evaluation process in a virtual workplace. This is accomplished by
   coupling the ergonomic analysis with three-dimensional (3D) virtual
   visualization of the work environment. The proposed approach uses motion
   data from the 3D model of the jobsite to evaluate the risk factors that
   can produce excessive physical loads on the human body through a
   biomechanical analysis. A global risk assessment of musculoskeletal
   disorders is performed on worker motions first, and a biomechanical
   simulation is then used to further analyze unsafe motions by estimating
   internal loads on each selected body joint of the worker and redesigning
   the motion and workplace accordingly. As a case study, several tasks
   taking place in a construction prefabrication shop are modeled and
   analyzed to modify the workplace and ensure improved ergonomic safety.
   The results indicate that the proposed approach enables identification
   and minimization of awkward worker postures in the virtual model to
   mitigate ergonomic risk during workplace design. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel low-cost, rapid substrate-bonding technique is
   successfully applied to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microfluidics
   bonding for the first time. This technique uses a thin intermediate
   metallic microwave susceptor layer at the interface of the bonding site
   (microchannels) which produces localized heating required for bonding
   during microwave irradiation. The metallic susceptor pattern is designed
   using a multiphysics simulation model developed in ANSYS Multiphysics
   software (high-frequency structural simulation (HFSS) coupled with
   ANSYS-Thermal). In our experiments, the required microwave energy for
   bonding is delivered using a relatively inexpensive, widely accessible
   commercial microwave oven. Using this technique, simple PMMA
   microfluidics prototypes are successfully bonded and sealed in less than
   35 seconds with a minimum measured bond strength of 1.375 MPa.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of trailers with very poor aerodynamics are hauled long
   distances across a vast North American highway system. Our goal was to
   use preliminary smoke-wire flow visualizations to learn: the
   characteristic flow patterns over models representing modern
   Vehicle-Trailer Systems (VTS); what improvements need to be made in the
   experimental setup; and if there is an opportunity for reduction in
   aerodynamic drag. Visualization tests were done in an open circuit wind
   tunnel, with a cross-sectional area of 0.093 m(2). Detailed models of
   light-duty trucks and trailers were used at a Reynolds number of 13,700.
   Images of the streaklines indicated two characteristic features. One was
   the presence of a stagnation point on the leading face of the trailer
   followed by a separation bubble on its top. The other feature was an
   unexpected separation bubble on the hood of the towing vehicle. We
   determined that it did not have a significant effect on the downstream
   flow pattern. By adding a small wedge deflector on the cab of the
   vehicle, it was concluded that there was an opportunity for significant
   improvement of the VTS aerodynamics.}},

Journal = {{AICHE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2618-2633}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A numerical approach is developed to gain fundamental insight in
   liquid-liquid dispersion formation under well-controlled turbulent
   conditions. The approach is based on a free energy lattice Boltzmann
   equation method, and relies on detailed resolution of the interaction of
   the dispersed and continuous phase at the microscopic level, including
   drop breakup and coalescence. The capability of the numerical technique
   to perform direct numerical simulations of turbulently agitated
   liquid-liquid dispersions is assessed. Three-dimensional simulations are
   carried out in fully periodic cubic domains with grids of size
   1003to10003. The liquids are of equal density. Viscosity ratios
   (dispersed phase over continuous phase) are in the range 0.3-1.0. The
   dispersed phase volume fraction varies from 0.001 to 0.2. The process of
   dispersion formation is followed and visualized. The size of each drop
   in the dispersion is measured in-line with no disturbance of the flow.
   However, the numerical method is plagued by numerical dissolution of
   drops that are smaller than 10 times the lattice spacing. It is shown
   that to mitigate this effect it is necessary to increase the resolution
   of the Kolmogorov scales, such as to have a minimum drop size in the
   range 20-30 lattice units {[}lu]. Four levels of Kolmogorov length scale
   resolution have been considered K=1, 2.5, 5, and 10 {[}lu]. In addition,
   the numerical dissolution reduces if the concentration of the dispersed
   phase is increased. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{The capacity of a protein to form and stabilize foams and emulsions
   depends on its structural characteristics and its physicochemical
   properties. The structural properties of lentil legumin-like protein
   including molecular weight, hydrodynamic size, surface charge and
   hydrophobicity, and conformation were studied in relation to its
   air-water interfacial behaviors. Kinetics study suggested that the
   foaming stability was closely related to the surface conformation of the
   protein that strongly affected adsorption and reorganization of the
   protein layer at the air-water interface. Foams prepared at neutral pH
   showed dense and strong networks at the interface, where combination of
   the a-helix secondary structure, medium hydrodynamic molecular size, and
   balance between solubility/hydrophobicity all contributed to the
   formation of such strong protein network at the interface. At pH 5.0,
   the protein formed a dense and thick network composed of randomly
   aggregated protein particles at the air-water interface. Whereas at pH
   3.0, the unordered structure increased intra-protein flexibility
   producing a less compact and relaxed interface that reduces elasticity
   modulus with time and reduced foam resistance against collapse. This
   research revealed that lentil legumin-like protein could form long-life
   foams at mild acidic and neutral pH. The potential for use of lentil
   protein as a novel foaming plant-based stabilizer is demonstrated in
   food and non-food applications where stable, long-life foams are
   required. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of block copolymers based on methoxy poly(ethylene
   oxide)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL), PEO-b-PCL bearing
   side groups of benzyl carboxylate (PEO-b-PBCL), or free carboxyl
   (PEO-b-PCCL) on the PCL backbone with increasing degrees of
   polymerization of the PCL backbone were synthesized. Prepared block
   copolymers assembled to polymeric micelles by co-solvent evaporation.
   The physical stability of prepared micelles was assessed by measuring
   their tendency toward aggregation over time using dynamic light
   scattering (DLS). The resistance of micelles against dissociation in the
   presence of a micelle destabilizing agent, i.e., sodium dodecyl sulfate
   (SDS), was also investigated using DLS. The rate of micellar core
   degradation was determined using H-1 NMR for polymer molecular weight
   measurement upon incubation of micelles in PBS (pH = 7.4) at 37 degrees
   C followed by dialysis of the remaining polymer at different time
   intervals. The effect of pendent group chemistry in the micellar core on
   the adsorption of serum proteins to micellar structure was then
   evaluated using Bradford Protein assay kit. Finally, the effect of
   micellar core structure on the induction of bone marrow derived
   dendritic cell (BMDC) maturation and secretion of IL-12 was studied as a
   measure of micellar immunogenicity. The results showed micelle
   structures from polymers with higher degree of polymerization in the
   hydrophobic block and/or those with more hydrophobic substituents on the
   core-forming block, to be more stable. This was reflected by a decreased
   tendency for micellar aggregation, reduced dissociation of micelles in
   the presence of SDS, and diminished core degradation. All micelles were
   shown to have insignificant adsorption of serum protein suggesting that
   the hydrophilic PEO shell provided sufficient protection of the core.
   However, the protein adsorption increased with increase in the
   hydrophobicity and molecular weight of the core-forming block.
   Irrespective of the micellar core structure, all tested micelles were
   found to be non-immunogenic in BMDCs. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the application of a surface acoustic wave (SAW)
   sensor for characterizing the adhesion of SU-8 thin films. The proposed
   sensor consists of a thin aluminum nitride (AlN) film deposited on a
   silicon substrate with two sets of interdigital (IDT) electrodes
   patterned on the AlN film in a delay line configuration. The SU-8 layer
   is patterned between the input and output IDT electrodes. A theoretical
   model for calculating the wave dispersion profile for the SU-8/AlN/Si
   configuration is developed. The effect of changing the adhesion of the
   SU-8 film on the wave velocity is implemented by assuming the SU-8/AlN
   interface consists of a layer of distributed massless springs. Different
   levels of adhesion are accounted for by changing the stiffness of the
   interfacial springs and the corresponding changes in the wave dispersion
   profiles are plotted. Four designs for the SAW sensor are fabricated,
   for each design two sensor configurations are developed to investigate
   the change in adhesion of the SU-8 film. In the first configuration, a
   thin gold film is patterned above the AlN film prior to patterning the
   SU-8 layer. In the second configuration, an Omnicoat layer is patterned
   above the gold film prior to SU-8 patterning. Omnicoat is an adhesion
   promoter commonly used to increase the adhesion of SU-8 to gold. The
   shift in the center frequency values from both configurations is used to
   characterize the adhesion of SU-8. The theoretical model is then used to
   find the equivalent spring stiffness values that fit the theoretical to
   the measured wave velocities.}},

Abstract = {{Website fingerprinting attack can identify the visited websites by
   analyzing the side-channel information of the network traffic even
   though it is transferred through an encrypted tunnel. The security of
   web browsing can be evaluated by quantifying the side-channel
   information leaks. However, most of the current leak quantification
   measures focus on web applications and may be impractical in web
   browsing due to their time complexity. Although the revised models were
   proposed to simplify computations, their assumptions may not be suitable
   for web browsing. In this paper, the problem of website fingerprinting
   is analyzed from the viewpoint of pattern classification. The data
   complexity measures, which quantify the difficulty of separating classes
   in a classification problem, are applied to describe the leak
   quantification. The performance of these data complexity measures in
   representing information leaks is discussed and compared with the
   existing approaches. This comparative analysis is realized conceptually
   and through experiments by using two website fingerprinting
   countermeasures: traffic morphing and BuFLO. Moreover, the parameter
   selection model based on the leak quantification is proposed to estimate
   suitable parameters for the website fingerprinting countermeasure. The
   experimental results confirm that the countermeasures with parameters
   selected according to the data complexity measures are more secure than
   other leak quantification measures.}},

   mining industry represents a unique aspect of the construction and

Abstract = {{Ammonia was observed as a potential significant factor to manipulate the
   abundance and activity of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs) in
   water environments. For the first time, this study confirmed this
   phenomenon by laboratory cultivation. In a series of estuarine
   sediment-coastal water microcosms, we investigated the AOM's
   phylogenetic composition and activity change in response to ammonia
   concentration. Increase of ammonia concentration promoted bacterial amoA
   gene abundance in a linear pattern. The ratio of transcribed
   ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA gene/ammonia-oxidizing archaea
   (AOA) amoA gene increased from 0.1 to 43 as NH4 (+)-N increased from
   less than 0.1 to 12 mg L-1, and AOA amoA transcription was undetected
   under 20 mg NH4 (+)-N L-1. The incubation of stable isotope probing
   (SIP) microcosms revealed a faster C-13-NaHCO3 incorporation rate of AOA
   amoA gene under 0.1 mg NH4 (+)-N L-1 and a sole C-13-NaHCO3 utilization
   of the AOB amoA gene under 20 mg NH4 (+)-N L-1. Our results indicate
   that ammonia concentration manipulates the structure of AOM. AOA prefers
   to live and perform higher amoA transcription activity than AOB in
   ammonia-limited water environments, and AOB tends to take the first
   contributor place in ammonia-rich ones.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparison of the activity for methane oxidation
   of selected commercial platinum, palladium, and platinum-palladium
   supported catalysts. Precious metal loadings are typical of those found
   in the catalytic converters for lean-burn natural gas engines.
   Experiments are presented for de-greened as well as hydrothermally aged
   catalysts, both in the presence and the absence of water. For the
   platinum catalyst, fraction conversion of methane is shown to be
   independent of methane concentration, while for the palladium-containing
   catalysts a dependence of conversion on methane partial pressure is
   observed. For catalysts containing palladium, reduction in hydrogen
   gives an increase in methane conversion activity, although the increase
   is subsequently lost in the oxidizing atmosphere. Hydrothermal aging of
   the platinum catalyst causes a relatively large and permanent loss in
   methane oxidation activity, while the palladium-based catalysts showed
   more resistance to deactivation. Adding a small amount of palladium to
   the platinum catalyst provides an overall improvement in performance.}},

Abstract = {{Shale oil is a key resource that could mitigate the impending energy
   shortage in the future. Despite its abundance in China, studies on shale
   oil are still at the preliminary stage. Shale oil development through
   CO2 flooding has been successfully implemented in the United States.
   Therefore, the mechanics of CO2 flooding in shale oil reservoirs should
   be investigated. This study applies a simulation method to evaluate the
   development efficiency of CO2 flooding in shale oil reservoirs.
   Near-miscible CO2 flooding can effectively develop shale oil. After 20
   years, recovery could improve by up to 9.56\% as a result of depletion
   development under near-miscible CO2 flooding with 0.5\% pore volume gas
   injection. Horizontal well injection is better than vertical well
   injection in terms of sweep efficiency and recovery. Cyclic gas
   injection is superior to continuous gas injection because the former
   reduces gas channelling. Thus, the use of horizontal wells with
   near-miscible cyclic gas injections has the potential to effectively
   develop shale oil reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the dynamic behavior of complex structural
   systems experimental testing is indispensable and real-time
   pseudodynamic (PSD) and real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) are versatile
   testing methods to address this need. Accurate control of hydraulic
   actuators is essential for the accuracy and stability of these methods.
   This paper introduces a nonlinear state-space controller to control
   hydraulic actuators under displacement control, specifically for
   real-time testing applications. The proposed control design process uses
   the nonlinear state-space model of the system, and utilizes state
   feedback linearization through a transformation of the state variables.
   As such, it can efficiently handle the nonlinearities associated with
   the servo-hydraulic system and the test structure. Comparisons of
   numerical simulation results for linear state-space and nonlinear
   state-space controllers are provided. The improved tracking performance
   of the proposed controller will contribute to more accurate real-time
   test results, which in turn will enable a more accurate assessment of

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{32-38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the problem of state estimation incorporating
   infrequent, delayed and integral measurements. In chemical process,
   there often exist two types of measurements. On one hand, the
   measurements for process variables such as flow rates and pressures are
   sampled frequently and are available nearly instantaneously. On the
   other hand, the measurements for quality variables such as concentration
   are sampled infrequently and are available with a delay due to long
   analysis time involved. Moreover, due to the interval time taken by
   chemical sample collection, the measurements for some quality variables
   have another important characteristic: it is a function of the states of
   the compositions over a period of time. This paper formulates the
   process with infrequent, delayed and integral measurements as an
   equivalent variable dimension system, whose measurements are both delay
   and integration free. Based on the new model, a variable dimension
   unscented Kalman filter (VD-UKF) is proposed to estimate the states.
   Furthermore, the stability of the proposed VD-UKF is analyzed. Compared
   with the existing results, the proposed stability condition is
   significantly relaxed and the invertibility condition of Jacobian
   matrices is no longer needed. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates
   the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an improved interacting multiple-model ((IMM)-M-2)
   algorithm with inaccurate transition probabilities (TPs) for fault
   detection and diagnosis (FDD). We first study the influence of
   inaccurate TPs by inspecting the expectation and covariances of residual
   error vectors in the traditional IMM method. It shows that Kalman
   filters can be retained as subfilters in the presence of mismodeled TPs,
   and the effect of TPs can be removed naturally if all of the
   probabilities of true modes are equal to one. In view of this, a
   modification operator is proposed to make the real mode probabilities
   heuristically approach one. The modification degree is governed by a
   parameter determined by the online measurements. When the modification
   parameter calculated is identical to one, the (IMM)-M-2 method reduces
   to the conventional IMM algorithm. An experiment designed through a
   ball-and-tube testbed is presented to demonstrate that the
   (IMM)-M-2-based FDD method can provide more reliable FDD results and
   reduce the possibility of false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{The hygroscopic growth of particles, produced from a University of
   Kentucky 3R4F reference cigarette smoked following Health Canada Intense
   (HCI) puffing parameters (55 mL puff of 2 s duration, every 30 s), was
   measured in terms of the electrical mobility diameter and particle mass,
   using a Hygroscopic Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA) and
   Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyzer (CPMA) system. Both the particle
   mobility diameter and mass growth factors were found to agree with
   previously determined values and hygroscopicity models. The mobility
   diameter growth factor of the particles produced from either a
   University of Kentucky 3R4F or 1R5F reference cigarette, following HCI
   puffing parameters, were found to be very similar. As the relative
   humidity (RH) approached saturation, the effects of the initial particle
   size on the mobility growth factor became more dominant, with larger
   particles growing proportionally larger than smaller particles. From the
   measured mobility diameter and mass growth factors, the density growth
   factor was calculated. This parameter showed that the particle density
   increased as the sample relative humidity increased. This case is only
   possible, given that the dried smoke particle density (1109 +/- 118
   kg/m(3)) was determined to be greater than the density of water, if the
   water condensation on the smoke particle dissolves at least a portion of
   it, resulting in a significant increase in mass with only a small
   increase volume. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting system failures can be of great benefit to managers that get
   a better command over system performance. Data that systems generate in
   the form of logs is a valuable source of information to predict system
   reliability. As such, there is an increasing demand of tools to mine
   logs and provide accurate predictions. However, interpreting information
   in logs poses some challenges. This study discusses how to effectively
   mining sequences of logs and provide correct predictions. The approach
   integrates different machine learning techniques to control for data
   brittleness, provide accuracy of model selection and validation, and
   increase robustness of classification results. We apply the proposed
   approach to log sequences of 25 different applications of a software
   system for telemetry and performance of cars. On this system, we discuss
   the ability of three well-known support vector machines - multilayer
   perceptron, radial basis function and linear kernels - to fit and
   predict defective log sequences. Our results show that a good analysis
   strategy provides stable, accurate predictions. Such strategy must at
   least require high fitting ability of models used for prediction. We
   demonstrate that such models give excellent predictions both on
   individual applications - e.g., 1 \% false positive rate, 94 \% true
   positive rate, and 95 \% precision - and across system applications - on
   average, 9 \% false positive rate, 78 \% true positive rate, and 95 \%
   precision. We also show that these results are similarly achieved for
   different degree of sequence defectiveness. To show how good are our
   results, we compare them with recent studies in system log analysis. We
   finally provide some recommendations that we draw reflecting on our
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, and the
   pathological examination remains the gold standard for the final
   diagnosis. Traditionally, the histopathology slides are examined under a
   microscope by pathologists which typically leads to inter- and
   intra-observer variations. In addition, it is time consuming and tedious
   to analyze a whole glass slide manually. In this paper, we propose an
   efficient technique for automated analysis and diagnosis of the skin
   whole slide image. The proposed technique consists of five modules:
   epidermis segmentation, keratinocytes segmentation, melanocytes
   detection, feature construction and classification. Since the epidermis,
   keratinocytes and melanocytes are important cues for the pathologists,
   these regions are first segmented. Based on the segmented regions of
   interest, the spatial distribution and morphological features are
   constructed. These features, representing a skin tissue, are classified
   by a multi-class support vector machine classifier. Experimental results
   show that the proposed technique is able to provide a satisfactory
   performance (with about 90\% classification accuracy) and is able to
   assist the pathologist for the skin tissue analysis and diagnosis. (C)

   surface analytical techniques}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{345}},
Pages = {{249-255}},

Abstract = {{The adhesion and removal of ceria particles to a silica surface was
   investigated with the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and auger electron spectroscopy (AES)
   measurements. A model is presented based on electrophoretic mobility
   measurements of ceria slurry and silica particles at different pH's. XPS
   results show that at acidic pH values, ceria is present on silica
   surfaces, but at alkaline pH values, far less ceria is present, or no
   ceria is present in the extreme case. SEM results corroborated the XPS
   results showing uniform distribution of ceria particles on silica
   surface at pH 6 while a clean silica surface is observed at pH 12.
   However, SEM images show agglomeration of ceria particles occurring at
   the isoelectric point of ceria at similar to pH 9.6. High resolution Ce
   3d XPS analysis indicates that ceria present on the surface is composed
   similar to 31\% Ce(III) and similar to 69\% Ce(IV). AES mapping done at
   specific points on the silica surface validated both XPS and SEM
   results. Based on XPS, SEM and AES analyses, it is clear that an
   alkaline pH is necessary to minimize particulate contamination of silica
   surface by ceria. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrawideband (UWB) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as a tool for oil
   well perforation monitoring is experimentally investigated in this
   paper. Experiments are conducted on a lab prototype that emulates the
   small section of an oil well. Oil well perforations are scanned using
   the designed UWB radar system for different experimental conditions.
   High-resolution images in both down-range and cross-range are obtained
   by using UWB pulses and signal processing. High-quality images are
   constructed using SAR processing algorithm with the proposed
   modifications. Experiments are carried out for different perforation
   conditions such as open, partially clogged and fully clogged cases. It
   is shown by the experiments that the proposed radar technique and the
   data processing methods are capable of providing more revealing
   high-quality images. This approach can be applied effectively to monitor
   the oil well medium and detect well impairment locations.}},

Title = {{Effect of Osmotic Pressure on the Stability of Whole Inactivated
   Influenza Vaccine for Coating on Microneedles}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Enveloped virus vaccines can be damaged by high osmotic strength
   solutions, such as those used to protect the vaccine antigen during
   drying, which contain high concentrations of sugars. We therefore
   studied shrinkage and activity loss of whole inactivated influenza virus
   in hyperosmotic solutions and used those findings to improve vaccine
   coating of microneedle patches for influenza vaccination. Using
   stopped-flow light scattering analysis, we found that the virus
   underwent an initial shrinkage on the order of 10\% by volume within 5 s
   upon exposure to a hyperosmotic stress difference of 217
   milliosmolarity. During this shrinkage, the virus envelope had very low
   osmotic water permeability (1-6x10(-4) cm s(-1)) and high Arrhenius
   activation energy (E-a = 15.0 kcal mol(-1)), indicating that the water
   molecules diffused through the viral lipid membranes. After a
   quasi-stable state of approximately 20 s to 2 min, depending on the
   species and hypertonic osmotic strength difference of disaccharides,
   there was a second phase of viral shrinkage. At the highest osmotic
   strengths, this led to an undulating light scattering profile that
   appeared to be related to perturbation of the viral envelope resulting
   in loss of virus activity, as determined by in vitro hemagglutination
   measurements and in vivo immunogenicity studies in mice. Addition of
   carboxymethyl cellulose effectively prevented vaccine activity loss in
   vitro and in vivo, believed to be due to increasing the viscosity of
   concentrated sugar solution and thereby reducing osmotic stress during
   coating of microneedles. These results suggest that hyperosmotic
   solutions can cause biphasic shrinkage of whole inactivated influenza
   virus which can damage vaccine activity at high osmotic strength and
   that addition of a viscosity enhancer to the vaccine coating solution
   can prevent osmotically driven damage and thereby enable preparation of
   stable microneedle coating formulations for vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{A broadly cross-protective influenza vaccine that can be administrated
   by a painless self-immunization method would be a value as a potential
   universal mass vaccination strategy. This study developed a
   minimally-invasive microneedle (MN) patch for skin vaccination with
   virus-like particles containing influenza virus heterologous M2
   extracellular (M2e) domains (M2e5xVLPs) as a universal vaccine candidate
   without adjuvants. The stability of M2e5x VLP-coated microneedles was
   maintained for 8 weeks at room temperature without losing M2e
   antigenicity and immunogenicity. MN skin immunization induced strong
   humoral and mucosal M2e antibody responses and conferred
   cross-protection against heterosubtypic H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza
   virus challenges. In addition, M2e5x VLPMN skin vaccination induced
   T-helper type 1 responses such as IgG2a isotype antibodies and IFN-gamma
   producing cells at higher levels than those by conventional
   intramuscular injection. These potential immunological and logistic
   advantages for skin delivery of M2e5x VLP MN vaccines could offer a
   promising approach to develop an easy-to-administer universal influenza
   vaccine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IET COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1404-1411}},

Abstract = {{Balanced codes (also called DC-free codes) are widely used in binary
   communication systems to increase the likelihood of accurate symbol
   recovery with practical demodulators. Guided scrambling (GS) is
   recognised as a viable approach to efficiently generate DC-free binary
   sequences. In this study the authors extend the use of GS to generate
   balanced sequences of quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK) symbols by
   using arithmetic from the ring of polynomials defined over the Galois
   field of four elements. In addition to ensuring adequate timing
   information and consistent decision thresholds to improve the
   performance of practical demodulators, balanced encoding of QPSK symbol
   sequences creates a null at DC in the spectrum of the equivalent complex
   baseband signal. This corresponds to a null at the centre frequency of
   the bandpass QPSK signal that enables the insertion of a pilot tone and
   avoidance of narrowband interference without filtering or distortion of
   the signal. The authors outline sufficient conditions for the generation
   of balanced GS QPSK sequences, and based upon these conditions the
   authors recommend scrambling polynomials and quotient selection
   criteria. The authors then present analytical and simulation results
   that confirm the generation of balanced sequences using this approach.}},

Abstract = {{An electronic nose (e-nose) for identification and quantification of
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) vapor mixtures was developed using
   nanoporeenhanced opto-calorimetric spectroscopy. Opto-calorimetric
   spectroscopy based on specific molecular vibrational transitions in the

   selective detection of VOCs vapor mixtures. Nanoporous anodic aluminum
   oxide (AAO) microcantilevers, fabricated using a two-step anodization
   and simple photolithography process, were utilized as highly sensitive
   thermomechanical sensors for opto-calorimetric signal transduction. The
   AAO microcantilevers were optimized by fine-tuning AAO nanopore diameter
   in order to enhance their thermomechanical sensitivity as well as their
   surface area. The thermomechanical sensitivity of a bilayer AAO
   microcantilever with a 60 nm pore diameter was approximately 1 mu m/K,
   which is far superior to that of a bilayer plain silicon (Si)
   microcantilever. The adsorbed molecules of VOCs mixtures on the AA
   microcantilever were fully recognized and quantified by variations of
   peak positions and amplitudes in the opto-calorimetric IR spectra as
   well as by shifts in the resonance frequency of the AAO microcantilever
   with the adsorbed molecules. Furthermore, identification of complex
   organic compounds with a real industrial sample was demonstrated by this

Abstract = {{In the realm of modern day optical computing prospects, plasmonics
   provides a unique means of consolidating electronics and photonics in a
   nanoscale platform. For advanced optical information processing
   applications, there is a pressing need for configurable plasmonic
   platforms that mimic the functionalities of their electrical
   counterparts. In such a pursuit, the ability to actively manipulate
   plasmonic phenomena must first be realized via an electrical stimulus.
   An attractive architecture is realized by incorporating magneto-optical
   materials into devices, as the degree of electrical control they provide
   is unattainable by other material systems. Properties of the material
   are influenced by external magnetic fields, which can be conveniently
   generated by current passing through nearby metallic structures. While
   ferromagnetic metals are far too lossy for plasmonic integration,
   magnetic garnets can facilitate a robust and tunable architecture in a
   waveguide geometry. Here, we investigate a bismuth-substituted yttrium
   iron garnet platform for a high bandwidth active optical phase shifter.
   Our device is capable of imparting a large nonreciprocal phase shift of
   6.99 rad/mm, while confining 70\% of the modal power to the 0.081 mu m2
   cross-sectional area of the core. By considering the
   Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert formalism, we show that the magnetoplasmonic
   phase shifter is operable in both underdamped and critically damped
   modes, and is fully tunable through the applied magnetic fields and
   pulsewidth. This magnetoplasmonic building block opens doors to a new
   class of nanoplasmonic devices, such as optical phase modulators,
   isolators, and optical clocks that will satisfy key applications in
   nanoscale optical information networks. (C) 2015 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric aluminum nitride thin films were deposited on

Abstract = {{This work describes in vitro measurement of the total pressure loss at
   varying flow rate through anatomically realistic conducting airway
   replicas of 10 children, 4 to 8 years old, and 5 adults. Experimental
   results were compared with analytical predictions made using published
   airway resistance models. For the adult replicas, the model proposed by
   van Ertbruggen et al. (2005. J. Appl. Physiol. 98, 970-980) most
   accurately predicted central conducting airway resistance for
   inspiratory flow rates ranging from 15 to 90 L/min. Models proposed by
   Pedley et al. (1970. J. Respir. Physiol. 9,371-386) and by Katz et al.
   (2011. J. Biomech. 44,1137-1143) also provided reasonable estimates, but
   with a tendency to over predict measured pressure loss for both models.
   For child replicas, the Pedley and Katz models both provided good
   estimation of measured pressure loss at flow rates representative of
   resting tidal breathing, but under predicted measured values at high
   inspiratory flow rate (60 L/min). The van Ertbruggen model, developed
   based on flow simulations performed in an adult airway model, tended to
   under predict measured pressure loss through the child replicas across
   the range of flow rates studied (2 to 60 L/min). These results are
   intended to provide guidance for selection of analytical pressure loss
   models for use in predicting airway resistance and ventilation
   distribution in adults and children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study describes a new class of couplers using single-layer
   microstrip lines that reduce the occupied area, suppress the harmonic
   components and provide arbitrary power division ratios. It consists of
   lumped reactances between transmission lines to reach realisable
   impedances and shorten line lengths. To provide a design guideline,
   closed-form formulas are derived and five different designs are produced
   and built to investigate the couplers performance and design accuracy.
   The simulation results prove to be in good agreement with measurements.
   More than 70\% size reduction with respect to the conventional
   structures, 12 dB harmonic suppression and high power division ratios
   (9:1) achieved in various presented branch line, rat race and
   multi-section Wilkinson dividers. This proposed class of coupler
   structures can effectively be used in miniaturised and/or arbitrary

Abstract = {{Aromatic naphthenic acids (NAs) have been shown to be more toxic than
   the classical NAs found in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). To
   reduce this toxicity, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida
   were used to determine their ability to biodegrade aromatic compounds
   including treatments considering the impacts of external carbon and iron
   addition. Results showed that with added carbon Pseudomonas fluorescens
   and P. putida have the capability of biodegrading these aromatics. In
   the presence of external carbon, gene expression of a functional
   PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD alpha) was determined
   through reverse transcription real-time PCR, suggesting active
   degradation of OSPW aromatic compounds. Although no significant
   classical NAs removal was observed during this process, toxicity was
   reduced by 49.3\% under optimal conditions. OSPW toxicity was eliminated
   with the combination of ozonation at a dose of 80 mg/L followed by
   biodegradation, indicating that it is a promising combined OSPW
   treatment approach for the safe discharge to the aquatic environment.

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{29-37}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Integration of solvent deasphalting and asphaltenes gasification has
   been reported as a convenient alternative to coker based upgrading of
   bitumen, derived from oil sands. However, very limited work has been
   carried out on pyrolysis and gasification of asphaltenes at entrained
   flow conditions. The present study aims at addressing this gap, and
   provides a better understanding of the major intermediate in
   gasification process - char. Chars were prepared at different operating
   conditions in an atmospheric entrained flow reactor. Extensive
   characterization techniques were used to identify the changes in
   morphology, structure and composition of chars. We estimated the global
   gasification reactivity of chars with steam and CO2. Chars exhibited an
   internally hollow structure with porous walls. The nominal size of
   individual char particles and degree of fragmentation were greatly
   influenced by the operating conditions. H/C ratio, aromaticity and
   macro-porosity of chars increased with an increase in operating
   temperature, while content of heteroatoms and global reactivity showed a
   gradual decrease. Increase in residence time had marginal effect on char
   composition, morphology and global reactivity. V and Ni tend to
   accumulate in chars; however, their effect on global reactivity could
   not be established. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Phenomenological modelling of tensile fracture in PE pipe by considering
   damage evolution}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS \& DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{72-82}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Tensile fracture of polyethylene (PE) pipe in the hoop direction has
   been investigated using a phenomenon-based, hybrid approach of combining
   experimental testing and FE simulation. A modified D-split test was used
   for the experimental testing, at three crosshead speeds of 0.01, 1, and
   100 mm/min. The test results were then used to establish the governing
   equation for the specimen deformation so that the FE model can
   regenerate the data obtained from the experimental testing. Two
   approaches were considered for the FE simulation, one with separate
   expressions for deformation and damage evolution, and the other without.
   Results from the FE simulation suggest that the former approach enables
   the FE model to simulate both large deformation and ductile fracture of
   the test, while the latter can only mimic the large deformation before
   the final stress drop. Although the expression established in this study
   is unlikely to be unique for the damage evolution, it provides a
   qualitative means to depict the damage evolution during the test. Using
   parameters in the expression for damage evolution as variables, with the
   stress-strain relationship fixed, the FE simulation provides results to
   characterize the influence of damage evolution rate on the load-stroke
   curve generated from the D-split test. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We elucidated the effect of inhomogeneity in solutes on the aggregation
   of our representative polyaromatic (PA) compounds through a series of
   molecular dynamics simulations. Two kinds of solutes, a single type of
   PA compounds and a mixture of four types of PA compounds, were simulated
   in toluene, n-heptane, and heptol (mixture Of toluene and n-heptane).
   The geometries of the resultant aggregates were quantified using
   gyradius ratios. Our results revealed that in toluene, while a single
   type of PA compound can only form Short-cylinder-like aggregates, by
   having a solute mixture, parallel stacking of PA cores is enhanced,
   leading to the formation of one-dimensional (1D) rodlike structure. The
   enhanced stacking is caused by collective arrangement of the PA
   molecules; i.e., PA compounds of different types appear in an
   alternating manner in the aggregate. In addition, while the aggregated
   geometries of a single type of PA compounds were found to be affected by
   the composition of the solvents, the existence of the ID structure
   formed by mixture seems to be insensitive to the solvents. On the other
   hand, the longest range of stacking is achieved by having a small amount
   of toluene ({''}good{''} solvent) in n-heptane ({''}bad{''} solvent).}},

Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic surfaces are usually characterized by a high apparent
   contact angle of water drops in air. Here we analyze the inverse
   situation: Rather than focusing on water repellency in air, we measure
   the attractive interaction of air bubbles and superhydrophobic surfaces
   in water. Forces were measured between microbubbles with radii R of
   40-90 mu m attached to an atomic force microscope cantilever and
   submerged superhydrophobic surfaces. In addition, forces between
   macroscopic bubbles (R = 1.2 mm) at the end of capillaries and
   superhydrophobic surfaces were measured. As superhydrophobic surfaces we
   applied soot-templated surfaces, nanofilament surfaces, micropillar
   arrays with flat top faces, and decorated micropillars. Depending on the
   specific structure of the superhydrophobic surfaces and the presence and
   amount of entrapped air, different interactions were observed.
   Soot-templated surfaces in the Cassie state showed superaerophilic
   behavior: Once the electrostatic double-layer force and a hydrodynamic
   repulsion were overcome, bubbles jumped onto the surface and fully
   merged with the entrapped air. On nanofilaments and micropillar arrays
   we observed in addition the formation of sessile bubbles with finite
   contact angles below 90 degrees or the attachment of bubbles, which
   retained their spherical shape.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of residual water droplets from produced fluids of petroleum is
   a challenging task because the emulsified water droplets with size of a
   few micrometers are extremely stable. A focused beam reflectance
   measurement (FBRM) was used for on-line monitoring of emulsified water
   droplet size distribution in petroleum emulsion systems and chemical
   demulsification process. After establishing the feasibility of using
   FBRM to measure droplet size distributions in petroleum emulsions,
   factors influencing the average size of water droplets were investigated
   to evaluate the demulsification dynamics by ethyl cellulose
   demulsifiers. The FBRM is proven to be a valuable tool for monitoring
   demulsification process in situ in real time to understand
   demulsification mechanisms, which sheds the lights on improving the
   current technology of demulsifying water-in-oil emulsions of petroleum
   industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The effects of silver nanoparticles on intact wastewater biofilms}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) have strong antibacterial properties,
   which may adversely affect biological wastewater treatment processes. To
   determine the overall effect, intact biofilm samples were collected from
   the rotating biological contactor at the local wastewater treatment
   plant and treated with 200 mg Ag/L Ag-NPs for 24 h. The biofilm uptake
   of Ag-NPs was monitored with transmission electron microscopy.
   Forty-five minutes after Ag-NP application, Ag-NPs were seen in the
   biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). After 24 h, Ag-NPs had
   entered certain microbial cells, while other cells contained no
   observable Ag-NPs. Some cells were dying after the uptake of Ag-NPs.
   However, there was no significant reduction in cultivable bacteria in
   the biofilms, based on heterotrophic plate counts (HPC). While this may
   indicate that wastewater biofilms are highly resistant to Ag-NPs, the
   HPC represents only a small portion of the total microbial population.
   To further investigate the effects of Ag-NPs, a GeoChip microarray was
   used to directly detect changes in the functional gene structure of the
   microbial community in the biofilm. A clear decrease (34.6\% decreases
   in gene number) in gene diversity was evident in the GeoChip analysis.
   However, the complete loss of any specific gene was rare. Most gene
   families present in both treated and untreated biofilms. However, this
   doesn't necessarily mean that there was no change in these families.
   Signal intensity decreased in certain variants in each family while
   other variants increased to compensate the effects of Ag-NPs. The
   results indicate that Ag-NP treatment decreased microbial community
   diversity but did not significantly affect the microbial community
   function. This provides direct evidence for the functional redundancy of
   microbial community in engineered ecosystems such as wastewater
   biofilms.}},

Abstract = {{Functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) constitute a new class of
   nanostructured materials that have vast applications in CNT purification

   years. Of particular interest is the hybridization of single- or
   double-stranded nucleic acid (NA) with CNT. Nucleobases, as the building
   blocks of NA, interact with CNT and contribute strongly to the stability
   of the NA-CNT hybrids and their properties. In this work, we present a
   thorough review of previous studies on the binding of nucleobases with
   graphene and CNT, with a focus on the simulation works that attempted to
   evaluate the structure and strength of binding. Discrepancies among
   these works are identified, and factors that might contribute to such

Title = {{The influence of the unsaturated soil zone on 2-D and 3-D slope
   stability analyses}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{374-383}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{It is commonly understood that a 2-D slope stability analysis will
   provide a lower factor of safety than a 3-D slope stability analysis.
   The difference in the calculated factors of safety between a 2-D and a
   3-D analysis is generally less than 15\% for simple slope geometries.
   Most past comparative studies between 2-D and 3-D stability analyses
   have ignored the effect of negative pore-water pressures (i.e., matric
   suctions) in the soil zone above the ground-water table. In this paper,
   a comparison is made between 2-D and 3-D slope stability analyses on
   soil slopes where a portion of the soil profile has matric suctions. The
   factors of safety on simple geometry slopes and complex geometry slopes
   (i.e., slopes which have two intersecting slope surfaces), are
   investigated for a range of shear strength parameters and groundwater
   conditions. For simple slopes with a low slope angle, the difference in
   factor of safety between a 2-D and a 3-D slope stability analysis,
   (i.e., Delta Fs/Fs(2-D)), generally ranges from 9\% to 16\% when phi(b)
   is equal to 15 degrees. The value of Delta Fs/Fs(2-D) for a steep,
   simple slope is generally larger than for a low angle, simple slope.
   When phi(b) is 15 degrees, the values of Delta Fs/Fs(2-D) for the
   simple, steep slope generally range from 12 to 18\%. The difference
   between a 2-D and a 3-D stability analysis was most pronounced for
   concave geometries where a portion of the soil profile contained
   unsaturated soils. The values of Delta Fs/Fs(2-D) for corner angle
   concave slopes with angles ranging between 180 to 270 degrees can be as
   large as 20 to 59\% when phi(b) is equal to 15 degrees. Two case
   histories, (i.e., the highwall stability failure at the Poplar River
   coal mine and the Kettleman Hills landfill slope failure), were used to
   illustrate the effect of the unsaturated zone on changes in the factors
   of safety. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In situ high temperature measurements of plasma transferred arc welding
   (PTAW) deposition of overlays are required in order to optimize the
   process. Infrared (IR) cameras have the capability for making these
   measurements. The reliability of the quantitative data is often in
   question due to changes in emissivity with temperature, surface
   condition and phase change. Thus, the quantitative temperature values
   received from IR cameras are not reliable in these circumstances. In
   this study, several IR cameras were used to collect measurements on
   Ni-WC based metal matrix overlays deposited by PTAW. In addition, a
   methodology is developed to make quantitative measurements. It was found
   that only after the arc is extinguished can temperature values be
   collected in the region of interest. Arc reflectance and radiation
   negated obtaining any measurements from the surface of the deposit. The
   methodology developed applies the coupled use of differential scanning
   calorimetry, laser reflectance pyrometry, IR thermography and a
   correction algorithm. Using corrected emissivities, the effect of
   various process variables on the temperature of the PTAW deposit is
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) are a promising nanoparticle
   platform to develop safe vaccines for many viruses. Herein, we describe
   a novel and rapid protein transfer process to enhance the potency of
   enveloped VLPs by decorating influenza VLPs with exogenously added
   glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored immunostimulatory molecules
   (GPI-ISMs). With protein transfer, the level of GPI-ISM incorporation
   onto VLPs is controllable by varying incubation time and concentration
   of GPI-ISMs added. ISM incorporation was dependent upon the presence of
   a GPI-anchor and incorporated proteins were stable and functional for at
   least 4 weeks when stored at 4 degrees C. Vaccinating mice with
   GPI-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
   (GM-CSF)-incorporated-VLPs induced stronger antibody responses and
   better protection against a heterologous influenza virus challenge than
   unmodified VLPs. Thus, VLPs can be enriched with ISMs by protein
   transfer to increase the potency and breadth of the immune response,
   which has implications in developing effective nanoparticle-based
   vaccines against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses.
   From the Clinical Editor: The inherent problem with current influenza

Abstract = {{Artificial mixtures of bitumen with three natural clay standards,
   dominated by illite, kaolinite, and chlorite, were reacted for several
   days and washed three times each with cyclohexane to remove bitumen from
   the clays. The main goal was to determine and better understand the
   effect of nonswelling clay minerals (illite, kaolinite, and chlorite) on
   nonaqueous solvent bitumen extraction. The experimental results showed
   that the total amount of residual cyclohexane insoluble organic carbon
   (CIOC) measured for clay-bitumen mixtures after nonaqueous solvent
   bitumen removal is a function of intrinsic resistance of high molecular
   weight (MW) organic compounds to cyclohexane extraction and the nature
   of nonswelling clays. The intrinsic resistance of high MW organic
   compounds to cyclohexane extraction accounted for 42-80\% of the total
   CIOC content. The nonswelling clays retained from 20 to 58\% of CIOC of
   the total CIOC content primarily on the external surfaces (basal planes
   and edges) of clay mineral particles in the form of patches rather than
   continuous coatings. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and specific surface
   area (SSA) were reduced by the reaction with bitumen due to organic
   coatings on the clay mineral surfaces and/or due to bridging of clay
   particles to aggregates. The results indicate that the SSA is the
   primary controlling parameter affecting the amount of CIOC retained on
   the nonswelling clays within the studied experimental conditions. Higher
   amounts of CIOC resist on clays which have larger SSAs. CEC and layer
   charge density (LCD) are contributing parameters possibly affecting the
   extractability of bitumen from studied clays. It seems that, with
   increasing CEC and LCD, the CIOC was bonded more strongly to the clay
   mineral surface; consequently, more CIOC resisted nonaqueous solvent
   bitumen removal.}},

Abstract = {{Displacements of bitumen from silica surfaces were studied using various
   solvents and binary mixtures of ethanol. It was found that
   single-component solvents, including water, toluene, cyclohexane, and
   ethanol, were not able to completely remove bitumen on silica. However,
   adding 5\% ethanol to toluene greatly enhanced its ability to displace
   bitumen from the silica surface. Surface vibrational spectra obtained by
   sum frequency,generation vibrational spectroscopy showed that no trace
   of bitumen could be detected on silica after treatment with the 5\%,
   ethanol-toluene mixture. Similar effects were observed for cyclohexane
   with 10\% ethanol. The results suggested that binary solutions with
   amphiphilic components, such as ethanol, are effective solvents for
   release of bitumen from the mineral surface. This expectation was
   confirmed by batch extraction experiments on Athabasca oil sands samples
   using cyclohexane-ethanol solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature air oxidation affects many aspects of the fuels buses:
   weathering, storage stability, hardening, and fouling. Addition
   reactions taking place during the autoxidation of different heterocydic
   compound classes were studied at 130 degrees C. This investigation
   reports on the conversion, product selectivity, nature of addition
   products, and plausible mechanisms that would explain the observations
   subsequent to the oxidation of indole, 2,3-dihydroindole, quinoline,
   benzofuran, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, and thianaphthene. Of these, indole
   is known to be prone to oxidative addition; Among the five-membered
   heterocyclic compounds, the propensity to form oxidative addition
   products increased in the order: S << O < N. Addition took place mainly
   through C-C bond formation. In comparison to hydrocarbons, it was
   surprising to find that indole and 2,3-dihydroindole were less prone to
   oxidative addition than the five-membered naphtheno-aromatic hydrocarbon
   analogues indene and indan. On the basis of the work, some implications
   for low temperature oxidation processes, and free radical processes in
   general, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Even inherently brittle hollow silicon nanoparticles (NPs) can withstand
   larger strain to failure than solid NPs. However, the influence of wall
   thickness on the mechanical behavior of hollow Si NPs is not fully
   understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the
   compressive behavior of hollow Si NPs. Three distinct failure mechanisms
   of hollow NPs are uncovered, and their strength and deformability are
   analyzed quantitatively. For extra-thick-walled NPs, dislocations will
   nucleate below the contact area and cut through the particles till
   failure. For mid-thick-walled NPs, however, dislocations will emit from
   the inner surface and slip towards the outer surface. For thin-walled
   NPs, elastic buckling is the cause of failure. Compared to solid NPs,
   hollow NPs with wall thickness being around half of its outer radius can
   achieve significant improvement in both strength and deformability. (C)

Abstract = {{Recently, we proposed a paradigm shift in light confinement strategy
   showing how relaxed total internal reflection and photonic skin-depth
   engineering can lead to sub-diffraction waveguides without metal
   {[}Optica 1, 96 (2014)]. Here, we show that such extreme-skin-depth
   (e-skid) waveguides can counterintuitively confine light better than the
   best-case all-dielectric design of high index silicon waveguides
   surrounded by vacuum. We also establish analytically that figures of
   merit related to light confinement in dielectric waveguides are
   fundamentally tied to the skin depth of waves in the cladding, a
   quantity surprisingly overlooked in dielectric photonics. We contrast
   the propagation characteristics of the fundamental mode of e-skid
   waveguides and conventional waveguides to show that the decay constant
   in the cladding is dramatically larger in e-skid waveguides, which is
   the origin of sub-diffraction confinement. We also propose an approach
   to verify the reduced photonic skin depth in experiment using the
   decrease in the Goos -Hanschen phase shift. Finally, we provide a
   generalization of our work using concepts of transformation optics where
   the photonic skin-depth engineering can be interpreted as a
   transformation on the momentum of evanescent waves. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{In this study, galactose-based nanogels were prepared by reversible
   addition fragmentation chain transfer process to facilitate the targeted
   delivery of iodoazomycin arabinofuranoside (IAZA), a clinical drug for
   imaging solid hypoxic tumors, and evaluate its role in hypoxia-selective
   (radio)theranostic (therapy + diagnostic) management of
   therapy-resistant cancer cells. The nanogels have a cross-linked
   temperature-responsive core and a dense carbohydrate shell. Their
   thermoresponsive nature allowed the controlled encapsulation of IAZA
   drug for targeted delivery and release in hypoxic hepatocellular
   carcinoma via asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated uptake. The
   synthesized nanogel-IAZA delivery systems demonstrated a stable,
   nonburst release of IAZA over 10 h with up to 0.6 mM loading capacity of
   IAZA within the nanogel. The cytotoxicity evaluations of the nanogels
   demonstrated that they are relatively nontoxic in multiple cell lines.
   The radiosensitization studies indicated that IAZA in encapsulated form
   offers a superior radiosensitization of hypoxic cells (sensitizer
   enhancement ratio for IAZA alone, 1.33; 1.62 for nanogel encapsulated
   IAZA). These studies suggest that galactose-based nanogels may serve as
   a versatile drug delivery system for IAZA (and other azomycin-based
   agents) and enable its hypoxia-selective multimodal theranostic
   applications to manage hypoxic solid (hepatocellular) tumors by
   facilitating position/single photon emission tomography-based imaging,
   external beam radiation therapy, and in situ molecular radiotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The Markov chain statistical technique was employed to fill few missing
   values of daily precipitation observed at nine long-term (50years of
   data) climate stations of Western Canada. Statistical properties of the
   gap filled precipitation data are compared with those of the original
   data to ensure that this approach preserves the statistical
   characteristics of the historical data. After gap filling missing data,
   10 precipitation indices that represent magnitude and frequency of
   precipitation properties were computed from those 9 stations and the
   other 20 stations without missing records. Next, the Wilcoxon rank-sum
   test was used to detect possible change points of these precipitation
   indices. Based on the analysed results, there had been an increasing
   trend in the maximum number of consecutive wet days and the annual
   maximum 1-day precipitation and a decrease in the maximum number of
   consecutive dry days over most of British Columbia (BC). The annual
   total precipitation index of many stations had increased in southern BC
   and decreased in central parts of Canadian Prairies. Similar change was
   detected in the number of days when precipitation is equal and greater
   than 10 or 20mm, and indices for the annual monthly maximum 1-day
   precipitation-precipitation that exceeds the 95 and 99 percentiles-and
   the simple precipitation intensity index. On the basis of the above
   results, the diurnal temperature range (DTR) of Western Canada has
   decreased, and predominant negative correlations between precipitation
   indices and DTR, it seems that Western Canada has generally become
   wetter since the middle of the 20th century partly because increase in
   the minimum daily temperature has been higher than the increase in the
   maximum daily temperature, leading to a decrease in DTR, which is likely
   related to climatic warming.}},

Journal = {{AAPG BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1245-1259}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Ore grade is one of the primary variables controlling the economic
   recovery of bitumen from oil sands reservoirs, hence there is a need for
   fast and reliable quantification of total bitumen content (TBC). This is
   typically achieved through laboratory-based Dean-Stark analyses of drill
   core samples. However, this method is time and labor intensive and
   destructive to the core sample. Hyperspectral imaging is a remote
   sensing technique that can be defined as reflectance spectroscopy with a
   spatial context, where high-resolution digital imagery (similar to 1
   mm/pixel {[}0.04 in./pixel]) is acquired and reflectance measurements
   are collected in each pixel of the image. This study compares two
   hyperspectral models for the determination of TBC from imagery of both
   fresh and dry core samples. For three out of four suites of fresh core,
   TBC was predicted within +/- 1.5 wt. \% of the Dean-Stark data with both
   spectral models achieving correlations of R-2 > 0.97. For a fourth fresh
   core and the dry core, larger margins of error were found because of
   some instances of overestimation. Surface roughness because of uneven
   oil distribution and small-scale fracturing is a potential source of
   error in some of the spectral TBC results, particularly for the dry
   core. Producing results within minutes with the additional benefit of
   being nondestructive to the core sample, hyperspectral imaging shows
   great potential to become a viable alternative method for bitumen
   content determination in oil sands.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative macro-Raman spectroscopy was applied to the analysis of the
   bulk composition of pharmaceutical drug powders. Powders were extracted
   from seven commercial lactose-carrier-based dry-powder inhalers:
   Flixotide 50, 100, 250, and 500 mu g/dose (four concentrations of
   fluticasone propionate) and Seretide 100, 250, and 500 mu g/dose (three
   concentrations of fluticasone propionate, each with 50 mu g/dose
   salmeterol xinafoate). Also, a carrier-free pressurized metered-dose
   inhaler of the same combination product, Seretide 50 (50 mu g
   fluticasone propionate and 25 mu g salmeterol xinafoate per dose) was
   tested. The applicability of a custom-designed dispersive macro-Raman
   instrument with a large sample volume of 0.16 mu L was tested to
   determine the composition of the multicomponent powder samples. To
   quantify the error caused by sample heterogeneity, a Monte Carlo model
   was developed to predict the minimum sample volume required for
   representative sampling of potentially heterogeneous samples at the
   microscopic level, characterized by different particle-size
   distributions and compositions. Typical carrier-free respirable powder
   samples required a minimum sample volume on the order of 10(-4) mu L to
   achieve representative sampling with less than 3\% relative error. In
   contrast, dosage forms containing non-respirable carriers (e.g.,
   lactose) required a sample volume on the order of 0.1 mu L for
   representative measurements. Error analysis of the experimental results
   showed good agreement with the error predicted by the simulation.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, several active traffic control methods have
   been proposed to improve freeway efficiency at bottleneck locations.
   Variable speed limit (VSL) is one of these effective controls. Previous
   studies have evaluated VSL control, but primarily during recurrent
   congestion only. This study focuses on evaluating the performance of VSL
   control for both recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. To assess the
   effectiveness of a previously proposed VSL control in a real-world
   situation, this study has three evaluation objectives: (1) examine the
   control performance when recurrent and (or) non-recurrent congestion
   occurs; (2) assess the effectiveness of the control when a queue
   encounters the VSL sign; and (3) consider the impact of system detection
   delay in VSL control. Comparative experiments for Whitemud Drive in
   Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, are simulated in the VISSIM platform, and
   traffic performance is compared among scenarios with and without
   control. The simulation results show that VSL improves mobility for both
   recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. The VSL control reduces total
   travel time, and improves total travel distance and total flow.
   Furthermore, it slows down the shockwave propagation speed, improves the
   average speed on most of the freeway segments, and reduces the duration
   of traffic recovery.}},

Abstract = {{A method to measure liquid level and electrical properties based on
   ultra-wideband pulsed radar is developed in this paper. Current methods
   of material property measurement using free-space radar typically use
   computationally intensive frequency-domain analysis or finite
   time-domain methods. The method presented is modified from
   layer-stripping algorithms and includes several improvements over
   previous techniques, such as an antenna array that allows measurement in
   a metallic tank environment and a method of calibration that
   characterizes path-loss and near-field effects for accurate
   amplitude-distance prediction. The method presented here also estimates
   the material loss properties and uses accumulated power with noise
   compensation to predict reflected pulse power. The method extends the
   use of pulsed radar for liquid-level measurement in tanks to the
   evaluation of liquid permittivity and the estimation of liquid height in
   liquids consisting of multiple layers. The accuracy of the presented
   method is evaluated using a transmitting single antenna element, a
   four-element antenna array, and an eight-element antenna array for
   measurement in a metallic tank environment. Accuracy is improved with
   larger antenna arrays, but the calibration becomes more critical. The
   accuracy for varying layer heights and materials is investigated to
   demonstrate the method reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Tracer studies were performed on cobalt and iron Fischer-Tropsch
   catalysts using a synthesis gas containing a 20:80 mixture of (13)C18O
   and (CO)-C-12-O-16. The objective of the work was to investigate the
   antecedents of the C-O bonds in alcohols and CO2 formed during
   Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. It was found that chain growth proceeded
   by a CO insertion mechanism over both cobalt and iron catalysts. Over
   the cobalt catalyst, the dominant pathway for methanol synthesis
   involved a partial hydrogenation of CO as well as CO2 by a reaction
   pathway separate from the Fischer-Tropsch pathway. Over the iron
   catalyst, the majority of the methanol was formed by partial
   hydrogenation of only CO through the FT reaction pathway. Iron is active
   for water gas shift conversion, which produced CO2. Oxygen exchange
   reactions of CO2 were likely over both catalysts and complicated the
   interpretation of the results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the first Bragg-grating-based transducer
   system for application to trauma biomechanics, more specifically
   head-helmet contact force measurements secondary to headform impact. The
   transducer comprises an aluminum superstructure designed to withstand
   typical impact forces in helmeted impact and to have resonances that
   allow the overall sensor system to capture all relevant spectral
   components of force transients in impact. Structural finite-element
   models and strain-optic relationships are used to predict transducer
   sensitivity to impact force as well as mechanical resonances. The model
   predictions are verified through experimental calibration, and
   calibration results are, on average, within 10\% of model predictions of
   force sensitivity. The model predicted first mechanical resonance is 72
   kHz. The impact force transducer is also validated for helmeted impacts
   using an industry standard impact experiment and test headform. Results
   indicate excellent repeatability: maximum standard deviation of force
   measurements of 0.4\% of the net force applied to the impacted headform
   and average error in the time duration of the force transients of only
   4\%. Transient impact forces measured with the Bragg grating transducer
   are in agreement with magnitudes inferred from work of previous
   researchers. The presented transducer can be applied with both helmet
   test and anthropomorphic headforms to measure distributions of transient
   forces and therefore hypotheses related to helmet performance and head
   injury.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The need for precise temperature control at small scales has provided a
   formidable challenge to the lab-on-chip community. It requires, at once,
   good thermal conductivity for high speed operation, good thermal
   isolation for low power consumption and the ability to have small
   (mm-scale) thermally independent regions on the same substrate. Most
   importantly, and, in addition to these conflicting requirements, there
   is a need to accurately measure the temperature of the active region
   without the need for device-to-device calibrations. We have developed
   and tested a design that enables thermal control of lab-on-chip devices
   atop silicon substrates in a way that could be integrated with the
   standard methods of mass-manufacture used in the electronics industry
   (i.e. CMOS). This is a significant step towards a single-chip
   lab-on-chip solution, one in which the microfluidics, high voltage
   electronics, optoelectronics, instrumentation electronics, and the
   world-chip interface are all integrated on a single substrate with
   multiple, independent, thermally-controlled regions based on active
   heating and passive cooling.}},

Volume = {{131}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Gas injection is a widely used method for enhanced oil recovery. Oil
   bypassing by gas occurs at different scales because of micro and
   macroscopic heterogeneities, gravity segregation, and front instability.
   Part of the bypassed oil can be recovered by crossflow between the
   bypassed and flowing regions. This characteristic of reservoir flow is
   referred to as capacitance flow behavior in the literature. Modeling of
   such flow behavior at the sub-grid scale is challenging in the
   conventional flow simulation since fluids are perfectly mixed and in
   equilibrium within individual grid blocks under the local equilibrium
   assumption.
   This research investigates capacitance flow behavior in compositional
   reservoir simulation. An efficient two-step method is presented to model
   bypassed oil recovery in multiphase compositional flow simulation of gas
   floods. The oil bypassing is first quantified by use of the
   dual-porosity flow with two dimensionless groups; bypassed fraction and
   throughput ratio. To represent bypassed oil recovery in single-porosity
   flow, a new flow-based fluid characterization is applied to part of the
   heavy fractions of the fluid model used. Properties for pseudo
   components can be determined based on the throughput ratio estimated in
   the dual-porosity flow. Case studies for various reservoir/fluid
   properties show that single-porosity flow with the new method reasonably
   represents bypassed oil recovery observed in core floods and fine-scale
   heterogeneous simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   properties of self-oscillatory feedback loops. It is shown that in the
   presence of random disturbances, the oscillation due to the controller
   has a varying amplitude and phase even though the oscillation frequency
   is constant. The autocorrelation function of these types of oscillatory
   signals has a decay ratio and does not have a deterministic amplitude of
   oscillation. These properties can be utilized in distinguishing between
   the controller induced and externally introduced oscillations. Two

Abstract = {{Weak grids/microgrids are gaining considerable attention due to the
   installation of renewable power generation resources in areas that are
   remote from load centers. This paper presents a multivariable-droop
   synchronous current converter control strategy for current management of
   weak grid/microgrid applications, and offers a systematic and
   straightforward design approach using the loop shaping technique. The
   controller integrates current regulation, management, and limitation
   that are applicable to weak grids and microgrids (MGs). The
   multivariable synchronous current converter enables superior decoupling
   of d- and q-axis currents in weak grids and/or resistive grids where
   these control variables are highly coupled due to converter operation at
   large load-angles. Therefore, stable connection of weak (high impedance)
   resistive MGs to utility grids is feasible. The multivariable droop
   concept also realizes real power sharing by simultaneous drooping of
   both frequency and voltage amplitude, which enhances load sharing
   accuracy in resistive and/or weak grids. Similar to its predecessor,
   synchronous converters, the controller can eliminate phase-locked loop
   (PLL) and provides a unified controller, PLL, and load manager in one
   simple control methodology. This can facilitate grid
   auto-synchronization, which can improve the stability of voltage source
   converters in weak grid applications. Also, the controller can
   participate in the power system frequency, and voltage regulation and
   control. To evaluate the performance of the controller, several
   simulations are conducted under various typical scenarios and
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are one of the major
   health issues that workers frequently experience due to awkward postures
   or forceful exertions during construction tasks. Among available job
   analysis methods, biomechanical models have been widely applied to
   assess musculoskeletal risks that may contribute to the development of
   WMSDs based on motion data during occupational tasks. Recently, with the
   advent of vision-based motion capture approaches, it has become possible
   to collect the motion data required for biomechanical analysis under
   real conditions. However, vision-based motion capture approaches have
   not been applied to biomechanical analysis because of compatibility
   issues in body models of the motion data and computerized biomechanical
   analysis tools. To address this issue, automated data processing is
   focused on to convert motion data into available data in existing
   biomechanical analysis tools, given the BVH motion data from
   vision-based approaches. To examine the feasibility of the proposed
   motion data processing, an experiment for both static and dynamic
   biomechanical analyses was conducted on lifting tasks. The results
   indicate that vision-based motion capture data-converted as proposed in
   this paper-can provide a sufficient level of detail on human kinematics
   to conduct biomechanical analysis, thus allowing for the identification
   of particular body parts where excessive forces are placed during tasks.
   The issues and directions of future research are also discussed to
   perform on-site biomechanical analysis during construction tasks. (C)

   Gravity Drainage Reservoir Characterization and History Matching Within
   Ensemble Kalman Filter Framework}},

Abstract = {{Distributed temperature sensing (DTS), an optical fiber down-hole
   monitoring technique, provides a continuous and permanent well
   temperature profile. In steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)
   reservoirs, the DTS plays an important role to provide depth-and-time
   continuous temperature measurement for steam management and production
   optimization. These temperature observations provide useful information
   for reservoir characterization and shale detection in SAGD reservoirs.
   However, use of these massive data for automated SAGD reservoir
   characterization has not been investigated. The ensemble Kalman filter
   (EnKF), a parameter estimation approach using these real-time
   temperature observations, provides a highly attractive algorithm for
   automatic history matching and quantitative reservoir characterization.
   Due to its complex geological nature, the shale barrier exhibits as a
   different facies in sandstone reservoirs. In such reservoirs, due to
   non-Gaussian distributions, the traditional EnKF underestimates the
   uncertainty and fails to obtain a good production data match. We
   implemented discrete cosine transform (DCT) to parameterize the facies
   labels with EnKF. Furthermore, to capture geologically meaningful and
   realistic facies distribution in conjunction with matching observed
   data, we included fiber-optic sensor temperature data. Several case
   studies with different facies distribution and well configurations were
   conducted. In order to investigate the effect of temperature
   observations on SAGD reservoir characterization, the number of DTS
   observations and their locations were varied for each study. The
   qualities of the history-matched models were assessed by comparing the
   facies maps, facies distribution, and the root mean square error (RMSE)
   of the predicted data mismatch. Use of temperature data in conjunction
   with production data demonstrated significant improvement in facies
   detection and reduced uncertainty for SAGD reservoirs. The RMSE of the
   predicted data is also improved. The results indicate that the
   assimilation of DTS data from nearby steam chamber location has a
   significant potential in significant reduction of uncertainty in steam
   chamber propagation and production forecast.}},

Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{18-25}},

Abstract = {{Full Bayesian (FB) before-after evaluation is a newer approach than the
   empirical Bayesian (EB) evaluation in traffic safety research. While a
   number of earlier studies have conducted univariate and multivariate FB
   before-after safety evaluations and compared the results with the EB
   method, often contradictory conclusions have been drawn. To this end,
   the objectives of the current study were to (i) perform a before-after
   safety evaluation using both the univariate and multivariate FB methods
   in order to enhance our understanding of these methodologies, (ii)
   perform the EB evaluation and compare the results with those of the FB
   methods and (iii) apply the FB and EB methods to evaluate the safety
   effects of reducing the urban residential posted speed limit (PSL) for
   policy recommendation. In addition to three years of crash data for both
   the before and after periods, traffic volume, road geometry and other
   relevant data for both the treated and reference sites were collected
   and used. According to the model goodness-of-fit criteria, the current
   study found that the multivariate FB model for crash severities
   outperformed the univariate FB models. Moreover, in terms of statistical
   significance of the safety effects, the EB and FB methods led to
   opposite conclusions when the safety effects were relatively small with
   high standard deviation. Therefore, caution should be taken in drawing
   conclusions from the EB method. Based on the FB method, the PSL
   reduction was found effective in reducing crashes of all severities and
   thus is recommended for improving safety on urban residential collector
   roads. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bilateral teleoperation system stability with non-passive and strictly
   passive operator or environment}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{45-60}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A bilateral teleoperation system comprises a human operator, a
   teleoperator, and an environment. Without exact models for the
   teleoperator's terminations (i.e., human operator and the environment),
   it is typically assumed that they are passive but otherwise arbitrary.
   Based on this assumption, the stability of the teleoperation system is
   investigated through Llewellyn's absolute stability criterion for the
   teleoperator. However, the assumption of passivity of the terminations
   is less than accurate and may be violated in practice. Using Mobius
   transformations, this paper develops a new powerful stability analysis
   tool for a two-port network coupled to a passive termination and another
   termination that is (a) input strictly passive (ISP), (b) output
   strictly passive (OSP), (c) input non-passive (INP), or (b) disc-like
   non-passive (DNP). While this new stability criterion is applicable to
   any two-port network, we apply it to bilateral teleoperation systems
   with position-error-based (PEB) and direct-force-reflection (DFR)
   controllers. Simulations and experiments are reported for a pair of
   Phantom haptic robots. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The selective withdrawal of two-layer stratified flows with a point sink
   was investigated, considering the effect of the boundary. An analytical
   expression was developed for predicting the incipient Froude number as a
   function of the distance from the sink to the boundary (scaled by the
   distance from the sink and the interface). The effect of the boundary
   becomes significant when the relative distance is less than 2. The
   incipient Froude number reduces to 1.27 from 2.54 as the point sink
   approaches to the reservoir bottom. An analytical expression for
   computing the discharge ratio when both the layers withdraw was
   formulated and the velocity within each layer can be predicted. The
   analytical results were compared with the computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) results. The CFD solver can successfully model velocities and the

Abstract = {{In this study, reactive magnesia (MgO)- and carbide slag (CS)-activated

   the main hydration products of CS-GGBS stabilised soil included calcium
   silicate hydrates (CSH), calcium aluminate hydrates (CAH), and
   ettringite. For MgO-GGBS stabilised soils, CSH was the only hydration
   product detected. These hydration products had different microstructure
   and binding ability, affecting the strength of stabilised soils. There
   was an optimum MgO or CS content, in a range of 10-20\%, for yielding
   the highest UCS of MG-GGBS or CS-GGBS stabilised soil at the same age.
   The 90-day UCS of the optimum MgO-GGBS and CS-GGBS stabilised soils was
   3.0-3.2 and 2.4-3.2 times that of the PC stabilised soil, respectively.

Abstract = {{Over a decade ago, Xu and Masliyah pioneered an approach to characterize
   the interactions between particles in dynamic environments of
   multicomponent systems by measuring zeta potential distributions of
   individual components and their mixtures. Using a Zetaphoremeter, the
   measured zeta potential distributions of individual components and their
   mixtures were used to determine the conditions of preferential
   attachment in multicomponent particle suspensions. The technique has
   been applied to study the attachment of nano-sized silica and alumina
   particles to sub-micron size bubbles in solutions with and without the
   addition of surface active agents (SOS, DAH and DF250). The degree of
   attachment between gas bubbles and particles is shown to be a function
   of the interaction energy governed by the dispersion, electrostatic
   double layer and hydrophobic forces. Under certain chemical conditions,
   the attachment of nano-particles to sub-micron size bubbles is shown to
   be enhanced by in-situ gas nucleation induced by hydrodynamic cavitation
   for the weakly interacting systems, where mixing of the two individual
   components results in negligible attachment. Preferential interaction in
   complex tertiary particle systems demonstrated strong attachment between
   micron-sized alumina and gas bubbles, with little attachment between
   micron-sized alumina and silica, possibly due to instability of the
   aggregates in the shear flow environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

   (TAOs), commonly called naphthenic acids (NAs), was investigated. An
   indigenous microbial culture containing algae and bacteria was taken
   from the surface of a tailings pond and incubated over the course of 120
   days. The influence of light, oxygen and the presence of indigenous
   algae and bacteria, and a diatom (Navicula pelliculosa) on the TAO
   removal rate were elucidated. The highest biodegradation rate was
   observed with bacteria growth only (without light exposure) with a
   half-life (t(1/2)) of 203 days. The algae-bacteria consortium enhanced
   the detoxification process, however, bacterial biomass played the main
   role in toxicity reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) conducted
   on FT-IR spectra, identified functional groups and bonds (representing
   potential markers for biotransformation of TAOs) as follows: hydroxyl,
   carboxyl and amide groups along with C-H, aryl-H, aryl-OH and N-H bonds.

Abstract = {{In this paper, failure analysis was carried out based on the available
   documents, metallo-graphic studies and corrosion behavior of the welded
   joint pipe sample made of AISI 1518 low carbon steel. Nondestructive
   evaluations including penetration test (PT) and radiographic test (RT)
   were performed on the as-received pipeline and results indicated the
   presence of micro-and macro-cracks. Optical microscopic images and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed various
   microstructures in the base metal (BM), heat affected zone (HAZ) and
   weld metal (WM). The microstructural variations may result in galvanic
   feature and lead to failure and rupture of the weld joint during the
   service. Microhardness measurements showed that hardness value was about
   260 HV in the WM, while it declined in the HAZ and BM. Qualitative
   chemical analyses such as X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and SEM
   equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the
   presence of corrosive media during weld joint rupture. Additionally, SEM
   and optical investigations indicated that micro-cracks were formed in
   HAZ due to residual stress as a consequence of improper welding
   condition. Surface fracture studies showed that the crack initiation,
   crack growth and finally crack propagation took place in the WM/HAZ
   interface. Electrochemical studies were conducted on the BM, HAZ and WM
   to investigate corrosion behavior of the failed joint sample. Finally, a
   proper corrosion mechanism is proposed based on the failure analyses and
   electrochemical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce the low-order harmonics produced by the high-power
   pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) converters, selective harmonic elimination
   (SHE) scheme is commonly used due to its superior harmonic performance
   at low switching frequency. However, as an off-line modulation
   technique, the SHE scheme itself lacks the capability to realize the
   active compensation of the grid background harmonics. To enable the
   active compensation ability of the SHE-modulated PWM converters, this
   paper proposes an active compensation method through the jittering of
   SHE phase angle. The proposed method can realize the real-time
   compensation of the preexisting system background harmonics in
   high-power PWM converters' system. An application example on a
   high-power PWM current-source rectifier (CSR) system is provided in this
   paper. Experimental results show that the proposed method can
   effectively attenuate the line current harmonics caused by the grid
   background harmonics in the high-power PWM CSR systems.}},

Abstract = {{The X-ray crystal structure-based models of I-a cellulose nanocrystals
   (CNC), both pristine and containing surface sulfate groups with negative
   charge 0-0.34 e/nm(2) produced by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of softwood
   pulp, feature a highly polarized ``crystal-like{''} charge distribution.
   We perform sampling using Molecular dynamics (MD) of the structural
   relaxation of neutral pristine and negatively charged sulfated CNC of
   various lengths in explicit water solvent and then employ the
   statistical mechanical 3D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation to
   evaluate the solvation structure and thermodynamics of the relaxed CNC
   in ambient aqueous NaCl solution at a concentration of 0.0-0.25 mol/kg.
   The MD sampling induces a right-hand twist in CNC and rearranges its
   initially ordered structure with a macrodipole of high-density charges
   at the opposite faces into small local spots of alternating charge at
   each face. This surface charge rearrangement Observed for both neutral
   and charged CNC significantly affects the distribution of'ions around
   CNC in aqueous electrolyte solution. The solvation free energy (SFE) of
   charged sulfated CNC has a minimum at a particular electrolyte
   concentration depending on the surface charge density, whereas the SFE
   of neutral CNC increases linearly with NaCl concentration. The SFE
   contribution from Na+ counterions exhibits behavior similar to the NaCl
   concentration dependence of the whole SFE. An analysis of the 3D maps of
   Na+ density distributions shows that these model CNC particles exhibit
   the behavior of charged nanocolloids in aqueous electrolyte solution: an
   increase in electrolyte concentration shrinks the electric interfacial
   layer and weakens the effective repulsion between charged CNC particles.
   The 3D-RISM-KH method readily treats solvent and electrolyte Of a given
   nature and concentration to predict effective interactions between CNC
   particles in electrolyte solution. We provide CNC structural models and
   a modeling procedure for studies of effective interactions and the
   formation of ordered phases of CNC suspensions in electrolyte solution.}},

   operating at 5.25 GHz with a quality factor of 224, to perform SRMC and
   TRMC measurements. Our method consists of measuring the resonance
   frequency (f(0)) and Q-factor of the microwave resonator with the sample
   to be probed placed in a defined sensitive region Of the resonator where
   the microwave field is highly concentrated. We also provide proof of
   concept measurements of the time-resolved microwave photoresponse of
   anatase-phase TiO2 nanotube array membranes (TNTAMs) using the planar
   microstrip resonator. An unusual observation was the persistence of
   charged pair states in TNTAMs for several hours at room temperature
   under ambient conditions. Fast (120-220 s), slow (1300-2850 s), and very
   slow (6-26 h) components were extracted from the long-lived
   photoconductive decays of TNTAMs in response to 365, 250, and 405 nm

Year = {{2015}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Automatic segmentation of the epidermis area in skin histopathological
   images is an essential step for computer-aided diagnosis of various skin
   cancers. This paper presents a robust technique for epidermis
   segmentation in the whole slide skin histopathological images. The
   proposed technique first performs a coarse epidermis segmentation using
   global thresholding and shape analysis. The epidermis thickness is then
   measured by a series of line segments perpendicular to the main axis of
   the initially segmented epidermis mask. If the segmented epidermis mask
   has a thickness greater than a predefined threshold, the segmentation is
   assumed to be inaccurate. A second pass of fine segmentation using
   k-means algorithm is then carried out over these coarsely segmented
   result to enhance the performance. Experimental results on 64 different
   skin histopathological images show that the proposed technique provides
   a superior performance compared to the existing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Two distinct uniform hybrid particles, with similar hydrodynamic
   diameters and comparable zeta potentials, were prepared by
   copolymerizing N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and styrene. These
   particles differed in their styrene to NIPAM (S/N) mass ratios of 1 and
   8 and are referred to as S/N 1 and S/N S, respectively. Particle S/N 1
   exhibited a typical behavior of soft particles; that is, the particles
   shrank in bulk aqueous solutions when the temperature was increased. As
   a result, S/N 1 particles were interfacially active. In contrast,
   particle S/N 8 appeared to be rigid in response to temperature changes.
   In this case, the particles showed a negligible interfacial activity.
   Interfacial shear rheology tests revealed the increased rigidity of the
   particle-stabilized film formed at the heptane water interface by S/N 1
   than S/N 8 particles. As a result, S/N 1 particles were shown to be
   better emulsion stabilizers and emulsify a larger amount of heptane, as
   compared with S/N 8 particles. The current investigation confirmed a
   better performance of emulsion stabilization by soft particles (S/N 1)
   than by rigid particles (S/N 8), reinforcing the importance of
   controlling softness or deformability of particles for the purpose of
   stabilizing emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{Electric vehicle charging by renewable energy can help reduce greenhouse
   gas emissions. This paper presents a data-intensive techno-economic
   model to estimate the cost of charging an electric vehicle with a
   battery capacity of 16 kW h for an average travel distance of 65 km from
   small-scale renewable electricity in various jurisdictions in Canada.
   Six scenarios were developed that encompass scale of operation, charging
   time, and type of renewable energy system. The costs of charging an
   electric vehicle from an off-grid wind energy system at a charging time
   of 8 h is 56.8-58.5 cents/km in Montreal, Quebec, and 58.5-60.0 cents/km
   in Ottawa, Ontario. However, on integration with a small-scale hydro,
   the charging costs are 9.4-11.2 cents/km in Montreal, 9.5-11.1 cents/km
   in Ottawa and 10.2-12.2 cents/km in Vancouver, British Columbia. The
   results show that electric vehicle charging from small-scale hydro
   energy integration is cost competitive compared charging from
   conventional grid electricity in all the chosen jurisdictions.
   Furthermore, when the electric vehicle charging time decreases from 8 to
   4 h, the cost of charging increases by 83\% and 11\% from wind and hydro
   energy systems, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{63}},

Pages = {{3251-3265}},

Abstract = {{Classical methods of DOA estimation such as the MUSIC algorithm are
   based on estimating the signal and noise subspaces from the sample
   covariance matrix. For a small number of samples, such methods are
   exposed to performance breakdown, as the sample covariance matrix can
   largely deviate from the true covariance matrix. In this paper, the
   problem of DOA estimation performance breakdown is investigated. We
   consider the structure of the sample covariance matrix and the dynamics
   of the root-MUSIC algorithm. The performance breakdown in the threshold
   region is associated with the subspace leakage where some portion of the
   true signal subspace resides in the estimated noise subspace. In this
   paper, the subspace leakage is theoretically derived. We also propose a
   two-step method that improves the performance by modifying the sample
   covariance matrix such that the amount of the subspace leakage is
   reduced. Furthermore, we introduce a phenomenon named as root-swap which
   occurs in the root-MUSIC algorithm in the low sample size region and
   degrades the performance of the DOA estimation. A new method is then
   proposed to alleviate this problem. Numerical examples and simulation
   results are given for uncorrelated and correlated sources to illustrate
   the improvement achieved by the proposed methods. Moreover, the proposed
   algorithms are combined with the pseudo-noise resampling method to
   further improve the performance.}},

Abstract = {{Lap joint friction stir welding (FSW) between dissimilar AZ31B and Al
   6061 alloys sheets was conducted using various welding parameters
   including tool geometry, rotation and travel speeds. Tapered threaded
   pin and tapered pin tools were applied to fabricate FSW joints, using
   different rotation and travel speeds. Metallurgical investigations
   including X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD), optical microscopy images
   (OM), scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA)
   were used to characterize joints microstructures made with different
   welding parameters. Intermetallic phases were detected in the weld zone
   (WZ). Various microstructures were observed in the stir zone which can
   be attributed to using different travel and rotation speeds. Mechanical
   evaluation including lap shear fracture load test and microhardness
   measurements indicated that by simultaneously increasing the tool
   rotation and travel speeds, the joint tensile strength and ductility
   reached a maximum value. Microhardness studies and extracted results
   from stress-strain curves indicated that mechanical properties were
   affected by FSW process. Furthermore, phase analyses by XRD indicated
   the presence of intermetallic compounds in the weld zone. Finally, in
   the Al/Mg dissimilar weld, fractography studies showed that
   intermetallic compounds formation in the weld zone had an influence on
   the failure mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address problems of description and prediction of time
   series by developing architectures of granular time series. Granular
   time series are models of time series formed at the level of information
   granules expressed in the representation space and time. With regard to
   temporal granularity, time series is split into temporal windows leading
   in this way to the formation of temporal information granules.
   Information granules are also quantified and constructed over the space
   of amplitude and change of amplitude of the series collected over time
   windows. In the description of time series we involve clustering
   techniques and build information granules in the representation space
   (viz, the space of amplitude and change of amplitude) of the temporal
   data. Fuzzy relations forming the essence of the prediction model are
   optimized using particle swarm optimization. Experimental results are
   reported for a number of publicly available time series. (C) 2015

   ontology is used for online reputation analysis, a crucial task of
   reputation management, with the goal to follow the online conversation
   going on around an organization to discover and monitor its reputation.

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Air dense medium fluidized bed technique has been proposed as a viable
   technique for dry coal beneficiation with acceptable separation
   efficiency. In the current work, CFD simulation has been used to provide
   deeper understanding of the bed hydrodynamics in this system. The
   simulation results have been compared with the experimental data from
   sedimentation or flotation of 3.675 mm coal particles in a bed of
   Geldart group B silica sand particles (390 mu m, 2600 kg/m(3)). The
   superficial velocity has been adjusted (between minimum fluidization and
   minimum bubbling) to keep the bed in the particulate regime. The results
   of several 2D and 3D Eulerian multiphase CFD models have been evaluated
   and compared with the experimental data of bed expansion, bubble pattern
   and frequency, and coal particles density classes. It was found that the
   modification of the coefficients of Syamlal-O'Brien drag model to 0.52
   and 5.30369 and solid-solid restitution coefficient of 0.9 would enhance
   model predictions for both sand fluidized bed and coal segregation
   compared to the experimental data. Comparison of the simulation results
   with experiments showed that 3D simulation model performed 29.1\% better
   than similar 2D models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the observation of terahertz (THz) electric field induced
   conductivity modulation in sub-wavelength gold plasmonic media. Through
   all-THz pump-probe time-resolved transmission spectroscopy, we
   demonstrate that the presence of induced surface charges influences
   near-field mediated light propagation. The phenomenon is ascribed to the
   enhanced metal conductivity due to enhanced surface density of
   conduction electrons. The surface induced charge dynamics are revealed
   via phase-dependent time-resolved signatures. The phenomenon is a
   prelude to a wide class of ultrafast active THz plasmonic devices and
   paves the way for plasmonic field effects devices, similar to

Abstract = {{An experimental study of convective-diffusive transport in polymer
   electrolyte fuel cell (PEFCs) porous materials is presented. The study
   is used to estimate through-plane viscous permeability and effective
   molecular diffusivity of different gas diffusion layers (GDLs). A
   diffusion bridge based experimental setup is used for molecular
   diffusivity measurements, with oxygen and nitrogen flowing across the
   bridge. The pressure difference across the bridge is adjusted to control
   convective transport. The oxygen transport across porous media is
   measured using an oxygen sensor, and experimental data is fitted to a
   combined Fick's and Darcy's model to estimate effective diffusivity. To
   measure permeability, a variation of the diffusion bridge is used, where
   a single gas is forced to go through the GDL. The pressure drop across
   the GDL is measured, and fitted to Darcy's law to estimate viscous
   permeability. Through-plane permeability and effective molecular
   diffusivity are measured for several Toray samples with different
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) loading. Results show that permeability
   varies with PTFE loading between 1.13 x 10(-11) -0.35 x 10(-11) m(2) and
   diffusibility between 0.209 - 0.071. Increase in the PTFE content in
   GDLs was found to have an adverse effect on permeability and
   diffusibility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a unified design framework for data-driven
   optimality-based generalized iterative learning control (DDOGILC),
   including data-driven optimal ILC (DDOILC), data-driven optimal
   point-to-point ILC (DDOPTPILC), and data-driven optimal terminal ILC
   (DDTILC). First, a dynamical linearization in the iteration domain is
   developed. Then three specific DDOGILC approaches are proposed. Both
   design and analysis of the controller only require the measured I/O data
   without relying on any explicit model information. The optimal learning
   gain can be updated iteratively, which makes the proposed DDOGILC more
   adaptable to the changes in the plant. Furthermore, the proposed
   DDOPTPILC and DDOTILC only depend on the tracking error at specific
   points, and thus they can deal with the scenario when the system outputs
   are measured only at some time instants. Moreover, the proposed
   DDOPTPILC and DDOTILC approaches do not need to track the unnecessary
   output reference points so that the convergence performance is improved.

Abstract = {{There have been numerous research efforts directed towards the synthesis
   of gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) and the understanding of their
   formation, so that their size, shape, and stability can be well
   controlled for desired applications. Here, we report a dry photo-reduced
   method of Au NP formation directly on a membrane, such as a carbon thin
   film or a quartz slide. The evolution of Au NP formation was revealed by
   ex-situ experiments in an aberration-corrected scanning transmission
   electron microscope. The membranes were immersed in Au3+ solution before
   being taken out and quickly dried in ambient air at room temperature,
   then irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light with wavelengths of 189 nm
   and 254 nm in a low-pressure chamber. The results show that Au3+ ions
   and ion clusters self-assembled on the membrane surface before UV
   irradiation and that solid Au NPs with sizes of 3 nm-12 nm were formed
   after UV irradiation. Annealing at 40 degrees C for about 30 min helped
   to further stabilize the nanoparticles. The Au NPs were uniform and well
   dispersed, and should find applications in the electron microscopy
   field, for example.}},

Title = {{Development of a standardized testing system for orthodontic sliding
   mechanics}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ORTHODONTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: The primary objective of this study was to develop a
   computer-controlled three-dimensional friction measuring system, the
   orthodontic friction simulator (OFS). A clinically-based in vitro
   experiment considering wet and dry friction for conventionally and
   self-ligated brackets is presented to elucidate debate surrounding
   sliding mechanics and illustrate capabilities of the OFS.
   Methods: The OFS was designed and manufactured using sound engineering
   principles and with the primary concern of being able to measure all
   forces and moments generated during sliding mechanics. This required the
   implementation of a six-axis load cell. A variety of translation and
   rotation stages were also incorporated to allow for precise positioning
   of the bracket relative to the archwire. Once designed and built, the
   OFS was then used to compare conventional and self-ligation methods in
   both the wet and dry state. Damon Q brackets and 0.018 `' x 0.025 `'
   stainless steel wires were used for all tests with a sample size of n =
   65 for each ligation method. Archwires were pulled at a speed of 0.1
   mm/s in 11 increments of 0.1 mm. At each increment, the bracket would be
   rotated 0.5 degrees resulting in a total archwire travel of 1.1 mm and a
   second-order bracket angle range of 0 degrees-5 degrees. A repeated
   measures ANOVA was conducted to determine if ligation method and/or
   addition of moisture effected resulting orthodontic loads.
   Results: The developed equipment for studying orthodontic sliding
   mechanics was able to measure forces and moments in all three
   directions; a capability not previously realized in the literature.
   Additionally, it was found that passive ligation significantly reduced
   resistance to sliding, P <= 0.05, while the dry/wet state did not.
   Conclusions: The OFS certainly proved to be an adequate instrument for
   the scientific evaluation of orthodontic sliding mechanics. It is
   capable of measuring loads generated in all directions and is a fully
   automated apparatus allowing for simple and repeatable friction tests to
   be conducted. Furthermore, the addition of saliva was not found to
   significantly influence the loads generated during sliding mechanics
   regardless of ligation method.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater treatment is an integral component in the sustainable
   development of our society. Optimal control and operation is critical to
   the efficiency and economics of a wastewater treatment plant. In this
   work, we apply economic model predictive control (EMPC) to a wastewater
   treatment plant and compare its performance with two commonly used
   control methods. Specifically, we take advantage of the benchmark
   simulation model no. 1 provided by the International Water Association
   to simulate a biological wastewater treatment plant. A computationally
   efficient EMPC developed recently is adopted in this work to optimize
   the effluent quality and operating cost directly. The performance of the
   EMPC is compared with a proportional-integral (PI) control scheme and a
   regular tracking model predictive control (MPC) scheme from different
   perspectives including effluent quality and operating cost. The
   simulation results demonstrate that EMPC has the potential to
   significantly improve effluent quality and reduce operating cost
   simultaneously compared with PI and MPC schemes.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{3210-3218}},

Abstract = {{High spin polarization materials or spin filters are key components in
   spintronics, a niche subfield of electronics where carrier spins play a
   functional role. Carrier transmission through these materials is spin
   selective, that is, these materials are able to discriminate between up
   and down spins. Common spin filters include transition metal
   ferromagnets and their alloys, with typical spin selectivity (or,
   polarization) of approximate to 50\% or less. Here carrier transport is
   considered in an archetypical one-dimensional molecular hybrid in which
   a single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is wrapped around by single
   stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA). By magnetoresistance
   measurements it is shown that this system can act as a spin filter with
   maximum spin polarization approaching approximate to 74\% at low
   temperatures, significantly larger than transition metals under
   comparable conditions. Inversion asymmetric helicoidal potential of the
   charged ssDNA backbone induces a Rashba spin-orbit interaction in the
   SWCNT channel and polarizes carrier spins. The results are consistent
   with recent theoretical work that predicted spin dependent conductance
   in ssDNA-SWCNT hybrid. Ability to generate highly spin polarized
   carriers using molecular functionalization can lead to magnet-less and
   contact-less spintronic devices in the future. This can eliminate the
   conductivity mismatch problem and open new directions for research in
   organic spintronics.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the particular distribution of mass deposited on the
   surface of a nanomechanical resonator can be estimated by tracking the
   evolution of the device's resonance frequencies during the process of
   desorption. The technique, which relies on analytical models we have
   developed for the multimodal response of the system, enables mass
   sensing at much higher levels of accuracy than is typically achieved
   with a single frequency-shift measurement and no rigorous knowledge of
   the mass profile. We report on a series of demonstration experiments, in
   which the explosive molecule 1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)
   is vapor deposited along the length of a silicon nitride nanostring to
   create a dense, random covering of RDX crystallites on the surface. In
   some cases, the deposition is biased to produce distributions with a
   slight excess or deficit of mass at the string midpoint. The added mass
   is then allowed to sublimate away under vacuum conditions, with the
   device returning to its original state over about 4 h (and the resonance
   frequencies, measured via optical interferometry, relaxing back to their
   pre-mass-deposition values). Our claim is that the detailed time trace
   of observed frequency shifts is rich in information-not only about the
   quantity of RDX initially deposited but also about its spatial
   arrangement along the nanostring. The data also reveal that sublimation
   in this case follows a nontrivial rate law, consistent with mass loss
   occurring at the exposed surface area of the RDX crystallites.}},

Abstract = {{High-chromium cast irons (HCCIs) are widely used in many industrial
   processes involving wear and corrosion, such as oil sands mining and
   slurry handling in the oil sands industry. In very harsh mining
   environment and severe working conditions, conventional HCCIs, however,
   often exhibit a short service life. Great efforts have been made to
   improve the performance of HCCIs. One of the trials is to extend the
   chromium content to a higher level, e.g., 45 wt\%, and widen the carbon
   content to a range of 1-6 wt\%. In this study, we investigated the wear
   behavior of 45-series (Fe-45 wt\% Cr with 1-6 wt\% C) and observed that
   45-4 HCCI (Fe-45 wt\% Cr-4 wt\% C) had the highest hardness and
   exhibited remarkably high resistance to abrasion and erosion.
   Microstructure analysis showed that the primary carbides in 45-4 had a
   core-shell structure. The outer shell was M23C6, while the inner core
   was harder M7C3, confirmed by the EBSD technique. The ferrous matrix was
   eutectic colony with martensite and fine M23C6 carbides.
   Micro-mechanical probing in combination with finite element analysis
   demonstrated that the core-shell structure helped reduce the interfacial
   stress, thus enhancing the hardness and overall wear resistance of the
   material.}},

Title = {{Engineering 3D Cellularized Collagen Gels for Vascular Tissue
   Regeneration}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{100}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Synthetic materials are known to initiate clinical complications such as
   inflammation, stenosis, and infections when implanted as vascular
   substitutes. Collagen has been extensively used for a wide range of
   biomedical applications and is considered a valid alternative to
   synthetic materials due to its inherent biocompatibility (i.e., low
   antigenicity, inflammation, and cytotoxic responses). However, the
   limited mechanical properties and the related low hand-ability of
   collagen gels have hampered their use as scaffold materials for vascular
   tissue engineering. Therefore, the rationale behind this work was first
   to engineer cellularized collagen gels into a tubular-shaped geometry
   and second to enhance smooth muscle cells driven reorganization of
   collagen matrix to obtain tissues stiff enough to be handled.
   The strategy described here is based on the direct assembling of
   collagen and smooth muscle cells (construct) in a 3D cylindrical
   geometry with the use of a molding technique. This process requires a
   maturation period, during which the constructs are cultured in a
   bioreactor under static conditions (without applied external dynamic
   mechanical constraints) for 1 or 2 weeks. The ``static bioreactor{''}
   provides a monitored and controlled sterile environment (pH,
   temperature, gas exchange, nutrient supply and waste removal) to the
   constructs. During culture period, thickness measurements were performed
   to evaluate the cells-driven remodeling of the collagen matrix, and
   glucose consumption and lactate production rates were measured to
   monitor the cells metabolic activity. Finally, mechanical and
   viscoelastic properties were assessed for the resulting tubular
   constructs. To this end, specific protocols and a focused know-how
   (manipulation, gripping, working in hydrated environment, and so on)
   were developed to characterize the engineered tissues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the methodology and challenges experienced in the

   spring piezoelectric energy harvester. A variety of challenges were
   overcome in the fabrication of the energy harvesters, such as the

   issues. A packaging and integration methodology was developed to allow
   for the characterizing the harvesters under a base vibration. The
   conditioning circuitry developed allowed for a complete energy
   harvesting system, consisting a harvester, a voltage doubler, a voltage
   regulator and a NiMH battery. A feasibility study was undertaken with
   the designed conditioning circuitry to determine the effect of the input
   parameters on the overall performance of the circuit. It was found that
   the maximum efficiency does not correlate to the maximum charging
   current supplied to the battery. The efficiency and charging current
   must be balanced to achieve a high output and a reasonable output
   current. The development of the complete energy harvesting system allows
   for the direct integration of the energy harvesting technology into

Title = {{Design of a Thermoacoustic Sensor for Low Intensity Ultrasound
   Measurements Based on an Artificial Neural Network}},

Abstract = {{In therapeutic ultrasound applications, accurate ultrasound output
   intensities are crucial because the physiological effects of therapeutic
   ultrasound are very sensitive to the intensity and duration of these
   applications. Although radiation force balance is a benchmark technique
   for measuring ultrasound intensity and power, it is costly, difficult to
   operate, and compromised by noise vibration. To overcome these
   limitations, the development of a low-cost, easy to operate, and
   vibration-resistant alternative device is necessary for rapid ultrasound
   intensity measurement. Therefore, we proposed and validated a novel
   two-layer thermoacoustic sensor using an artificial neural network
   technique to accurately measure low ultrasound intensities between 30
   and 120 mW/cm(2). The first layer of the sensor design is a cylindrical
   absorber made of plexiglass, followed by a second layer composed of
   polyurethane rubber with a high attenuation coefficient to absorb extra
   ultrasound energy. The sensor determined ultrasound intensities
   according to a temperature elevation induced by heat converted from
   incident acoustic energy. Compared with our previous one-layer sensor
   design, the new two-layer sensor enhanced the ultrasound absorption
   efficiency to provide more rapid and reliable measurements. Using a
   three-dimensional model in the K-wave toolbox, our simulation of the
   ultrasound propagation process demonstrated that the two-layer design is
   more efficient than the single layer design. We also integrated an
   artificial neural network algorithm to compensate for the large
   measurement offset. After obtaining multiple parameters of the sensor
   characteristics through calibration, the artificial neural network is
   built to correct temperature drifts and increase the reliability of our
   thermoacoustic measurements through iterative training about ten
   seconds. The performance of the artificial neural network method was
   validated through a series of experiments. Compared to our previous
   design, the new design reduced sensing time from 20 s to 12 s, and the
   sensor's average error from 3.97 mW/cm(2) to 1.31 mW/cm(2) respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Misalignment error of gear pair will affect the load distribution along
   the tooth-width and have a great effect on dynamic characteristics. For
   the planetary gear set, it is complicated to model the misalignment
   error of carrier as, when this error is present, the planets and the
   carrier are tilted and contacts between sun-planet and ring-planet along
   tooth width are skewed. In this paper, a new lumped parameter model is
   set up to quasi-statically and dynamic analyze the planetary gear set
   with the position-dependent line of action due to the misalignment of
   the carrier. In the analytical model, each potential line of contact on
   the gear mesh is discretized into finite independent time-varying
   stiffness. External and internal gear stiffness is obtained through the
   potential energy method. The dynamic responses, load distribution along
   the tooth width, load sharing between planets, trajectories of sun gear
   are simulated and analyzed with carrier misalignment error in planetary

Abstract = {{The major concentration of this study is on developing a control scheme
   with parameter- and load-insensitive features capable of precise angular
   speed regulation of a permanent magnet (PM) DC motor in the presence of
   modeling uncertainties. Towards this objective, first, an appropriate
   nonlinear dynamic model of friction, the modified LuGre model, is opted
   and incorporated into the mathematical model of a PM DC motor. Then a
   sliding mode observer (SMO) is designed to estimate the state variable
   of the friction model. Next, a model reference adaptive control system
   into which estimated values of the friction state and parameters are fed
   is designed to track the desired speed trajectory while alleviating the
   adverse effects of model uncertainties and friction. Stability of the
   proposed SMO-based MRAC system is discussed via the Lyapunov stability
   theorem, and its asymptotic stability is verified. In addition to
   simulation studies, the algorithm is implemented on a new variable
   structure test-bed which gives us the ability to simulate desired
   parameter variations and external disturbance changes in experiment. The
   main contribution of the proposed scheme is the bounded estimation of
   the system's friction parameter. While similar control solutions do
   estimate these parameters, there is no guarantee that they will estimate
   the correct value of friction parameters. However, in the proposed
   method, by properly choosing the design parameters, if certain criteria
   is satisfied, the estimated friction parameters will be in the bounded
   vicinity of their actual values. The obtained results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm and its robustness
   against load and system parameters' variations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   Tin is one of most promising SIB anode materials, which alloys with up
   to 3.75 Na, leading to a charge storage capacity of 847 mAh g(-1). In
   this Account, we outline the state-of-the-art understanding regarding
   the sodiation-induced phase transformations and the associated
   performance in a range of Sn-based systems, treating metallic Sn and its
   alloys, tin oxide (SnO2), tin sulfide (SnS2/SnS), and tin phosphide
   (Sn4P3). We first detail what is known about the sodiation sequence in
   metallic Sn, highlighting the most recent insight into the reactions
   prior to the terminal equilibrium Na15Sn4 intermetallic. We explain why
   researchers argue that the equilibrium (phase diagram) series of phase
   transitions does not occur in this system, and rather why
   sodiation/desodiation proceeds through a series of metastable
   crystalline and amorphous structures. We also outline the recent
   modeling-based insight regarding how this phase transition profoundly
   influences the mechanical properties of the alloy, progressively
   changing the bonding and the near neighbor arrangement from
   ``Sn-like{''} to ``Na-like{''} in the process. We then go on to discuss
   the sodiation reactions in SnO2. We argue that while a substantial
   amount of experimental work already exists where the focus is on
   synthesis and testing of tin oxide based nanocomposites, the exact
   sodiation sequence is just beginning to be understood. Unlike in Sn and
   Sn alloys, where capacities near the theoretical are reached at least
   early during cycling, SnO2 never quite achieves anything close to the
   1398 mAh g(-1) that would be possible with a combination of fully
   reversible conversion and alloying reactions. We highlight recent work
   demonstrating that contrary to general expectations, it is the Sn to
   Na15Sn4 alloying reaction that is incomplete and hence limits the
   capacity of the electrode. We also describe how the oxide conversion
   reaction goes through an intermediate SnO phase, and how its
   reversibility in a half-cell is highly dependent on the terminal anodic
   voltage. We then present what is known about sodiation of tin sulfide
   and of tin phosphide phases, including emerging microstructural evidence
   that may explain why both the sulfides and the phosphides are unable to
   achieve their highly promising theoretical capacities under conventional
   electrode testing conditions. Finally, we provide a broad comparison of
   the capacity (cycling and rate) performance for a range of Sn based
   anode materials, and show that there may be indeed an optimum
   microstructural architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The wettability of fine solids in Alberta oil sands is one of the most
   important factors affecting nonaqueous bitumen extraction and subsequent
   solvent recovery from the extraction gangue. However, there is Some
   controversy as to which method is most suitable for wettability
   determination of fine solids isolated from the oil sands. In thiS paper,
   four different methods-i.e., particle partition, static sessile drop
   contact angle coupled with penetration time, Washbum capillary rise, and
   film flotation-were investigated and compared in order to determine
   suitable methods to examine the wettability of these fine solids. Two
   model samples, high-purity kaolinite (hydrophilic) and bitumen-treated
   kaolinite (hydrophobic), were used to investigate the suitability of the
   above four methods. These methods were then used to measure the surface
   wettability of fine solids isolated from the oil sands (marine clay)
   after toluene extraction, either untreated or heated at 400 degrees C
   for 2 h. The results showed that the Washburn capillary rise method was
   not applicable. In addition, the particle partition and static Sessile
   drop contact angle coupled with penetration time methods had some
   deficiencies and were not very suitable to determine the wettability of
   fine solids isolated from the oil sands. The film flotation method was
   determined to be the most appropriate method, because (i) it was
   sufficiently sensitive to distinguish solid surface hydrophilicity and
   hydrophobicity; (ii) it could quantify the hydrophilicity and
   hydrophobicity, based on the measured ``mean critical surface
   tension{''}; and (iii) it could be used to determine the surface
   heterogeneity of the solids, based on the standard deviation of the
   measurements: By using the film flotation method, the mean critical
   surface tensions of fine solids was >68.1 mN/m, while that of the
   heat-treated Solids was >72.0 mN/m, and the standard deviation of the
   critical surface tensions of the floating particles (0-25.9 wt \%) for
   fine Solids was 405 mN/m which indicated that heat treatment caused the
   fine solids to become more hydrophilic and the hydrophobicity of the
   fine solids was heterogeneous. In addition to direct application of the
   four standard methods, we have further developed the methods and gained
   some new insights into them.}},

Title = {{Effect of Direct Coal Liquefaction Conditions on Coal Liquid Quality}},
Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3649-3657}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Solvent extraction of coal was investigated with a focus on the quality
   of the coal liquids rather than coal conversion. The aim was to
   determine how the hydrogen/carbon ratio and other quality measures were
   influenced by liquefaction conditions. Liquefaction was performed using
   Canadian Bienfait lignite in the temperature range of 350-450 degrees C,
   4 MPa H-2, solvent/coal ratio of 2:1, and residence times up to 30 min
   at liquefaction temperature. An industrial hydrotreated coal liquid was
   used as the solvent. The hydrogen/carbon ratio of the coal liquids
   decreased with an increase in coal conversion, so that coal liquid
   quality decreased with an increase in the maximum liquefaction
   temperature. Selective extraction of hydrogen-rich material during the
   initial stages of liquefaction could be explained in terms of the low
   solubility parameter of the solvent, the weaker association of less
   polar molecules, and the limited extent of hydrogen transfer between
   phases. At longer residence times, especially at higher temperature, the
   coal liquids became heavier (>550 degrees C boiling material) and more
   aromatic and had a higher density and refractive index. These changes
   were partly due to increased coal conversion and partly due to increased
   time for hydrogen transfer, cracking, and recombination reactions to
   take place. It was further found that the nitrogen content of the coal
   liquids increased with increasing temperature and residence time. Some
   industrial implications of the changes in coal liquid quality on process
   development for coal liquefaction were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of solution chemistry on microbial transport was examined
   using the strictly anaerobic trichloroethene (TCE) bioaugmentation
   culture KB-1 (R). A column was employed to determine transport behaviors
   and deposition kinetics of three distinct functional species in KB-1
   (R), Dehalococcoides, Geobacter, and Methanomethylovorans, over a range
   of ionic strengths under a well-controlled anaerobic condition. A
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was utilized to enumerate
   cell concentration and complementary techniques were implemented to
   evaluate cell surface electrokinetic potentials. Solution chemistry was
   found to positively affect the deposition rates, which was consistent
   with calculated Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interaction
   energies. Retained microbial profiles showed spatially constant colloid
   deposition rate coefficients, in agreement with classical colloid
   filtration theory (CFT). It was interesting to note that the three KB-1
   (R) species displayed similar transport and retention behaviors under
   the defined experimental conditions despite their different cell
   electrokinetic properties. A deeper analysis of cell characteristics
   showed that factors, such as cell size and shape, concentration, and
   motility were involved in determining adhesion behavior. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The demand for hydrogen is likely to increase in the next decade to
   satisfy the projected growth of the bitumen upgrading industry in
   western Canada. This paper presents GHG (greenhouse gas) abatement costs
   and the GHG abatement potential in producing hydrogen from UCG
   (underground coal gasification) along with CCS (carbon capture and
   sequestration). Seven hydrogen production scenarios are considered to
   assess the competitiveness of implementing UCG compared to SMR (steam
   methane reforming). The analysis is completed through a LCA (life cycle
   assessment) of large-scale hydrogen production from UCG and SMR with and
   without CCS. Considering SMR technology without CCS as the base case,
   the GHG abatement costs of implementing the UCG-CCS technology is
   calculated to be in the range of 41-109 \$CAD/tonne-CO2-eq depending on
   the transportation distance to the CCS site from the UCG-H-2 production
   plant. Life cycle GHG emissions are higher in UCG than in SMR. The GHG
   abatement costs for SMR-CCS-based scenarios are higher than for
   UCG-CCS-based scenarios; they range from 87 to 158 \$CAD/tonne-CO2-eq in
   a similar manner to UCG-CCS. Consideration of revenues for selling the
   CO2 captured for EOR (enhanced oil recovery) reduces the GHG abatement
   costs. An opportunity for revenue generation is realized in the UCG-CCS
   case. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Successful analytical formulas have been previously proposed to
   calculate the losses in tank regions of transformers assuming linear
   permeabilities in the analyzed boundary-valued problem. This has
   resulted in easy-to-implement and low-cost computational design
   procedures from a transformer factory economical point of view. However,
   designers and analysts of transformers are constantly seeking new ways
   of reducing transformer losses in actual power networks with thousands
   of transformers. As a result, this paper has focused on proposing new
   analytical formulas to determine the electromagnetic field in bushing
   regions of transformers, taking account of the true nature of the
   nonlinear permeability behavior of the tank wall. This way, the
   nonlinear Maxwell's equations in the regions surrounding the bushings
   are solved using an integral equation formulation that properly includes
   boundary conditions. A practical iterative procedure is thus proposed to
   solve the resulting nonlinear equation. The iterative scheme shows
   excellent numerical convergence properties with a very low computational
   demand as compared with finite-element (FE) nonlinear models. A
   comparison between our analytical results and those of 3-D FE
   simulations reveals a close match for a wide range of conductor
   currents. Hence, our new formulas can be used to improve the design of
   transformers, increasing their efficiency.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We report a significant fractal-scaled increase in inductance for
   conductive pathways oriented in a fractal loop-based layout for a suite
   of planar inductors, which effectively occupy the same layout space and
   require only a single fabrication layer. These are closely predicted
   using a fractal scaling model for generalized loop-based inductors
   elucidated in this paper. Single-layer planar fractal structures were
   investigated with the loop inductor serving as the base construct. Thin
   sub-200 nm Cr/Au metal films compatible with flexible and stretchable
   substrates were used. It was found that while higher fractal orders did
   improve the inductive performance (over nine times from zeroth to third
   order), it is met with increased resistance. However, when compared with
   its equivalent series orientation, the effective sheet resistance of the
   simple fractal strategy demonstrated a clear advantage of up to four
   times. When the inductor is normalized for thickness, a quality factor Q
   greater than 40 is observed for all structures. Finally, the inductance
   quality gain figure of merit showing the optimal geometrical approach is
   introduced to quantify the quality of the structure's inductance over
   its resistance.}},

   probability requirement, imperfect CSI and fairness in terms of minimum
   rate requirement are considered. A unified analytical framework is
   proposed for the optimization problem, where the near optimal
   cooperative bargaining resource allocation strategy is derived based on
   Lagrangian dual decomposition by introducing time-sharing variables and
   recalling the Lambert-W function. The existence, uniqueness, and
   fairness of the solution to this game model are proved. A cooperative
   Nash bargaining resource allocation algorithm is developed, and is shown
   to converge to a Pareto-optimal equilibrium for the cooperative game.
   Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed cooperative game algorithm for efficient and fair resource
   allocation in cognitive small cell networks.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo methods are heuristic algorithms that use probabilities to
   select an outcome among several possible events in a given process.
   Monte Carlo methods are useful in polymer reaction engineering because
   they can predict the molecular architecture of polymers with details
   that cannot be easily captured by any other modeling technique. One of
   the advantages of Monte Carlo simulation is that one does not need to
   solve differential or algebraic equations to predict the microstructures
   of polymers. This article reviews the literature on steady-state and
   dynamic Monte Carlo methods in polymer reaction engineering. We hope to
   convince the readers that playing dice regularly can be a great asset to
   polymer reactors engineers.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a nonlinear piezoelectric energy harvester with
   intent to scavenge energy from diverse mechanical motions. The harvester
   consists of four piezoelectric cantilever beams, a cylindrical track,
   and a ferromagnetic ball, with magnets integrated to introduce the
   magnetic coupling between the ball and the beams. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the harvester is able to collect energy from
   various directions of vibrations. For the vibrations perpendicular to
   the ground, the maximum peak voltage is increased by 3.2V and the
   bandwidth of the voltage above 4V is increased by more than 4Hz compared
   to the results obtained when using a conventional design. For the
   vibrations along the horizontal direction, the frequency up-conversion
   is realized through the magnetic coupling. Moreover, the proposed design
   can harvest energy from the sway motion around different directions on
   the horizontal plane. Harvesting energy from the rotation motion is also
   achieved with an operating bandwidth of approximately 6 Hz. (c) 2015 AIP

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Interaction between ATP, a multifunctional and ubiquitous nucleotide,
   and proteins initializes phosphorylation, polypeptide synthesis and ATP
   hydrolysis which supplies energy for metabolism. However, current
   knowledge concerning the mechanisms through which ATP is recognized by
   proteins is incomplete, scattered, and inaccurate. We systemically
   investigate sequence and structural motifs of proteins that recognize
   ATP. We identified three novel motifs and refined the known p-loop and
   class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase motifs. The five motifs define five
   distinct ATP-protein interaction modes which concern over 5\% of known
   protein structures. We demonstrate that although these motifs share a
   common GXG tripeptide they recognize ATP through different functional
   groups. The p-loop motif recognizes ATP through phosphates, class II
   aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase motif targets adenosine and the other three
   motifs recognize both phosphates and adenosine. We show that some motifs
   are shared by different enzyme types. Statistical tests demonstrate that
   the five sequence motifs are significantly associated with the
   nucleotide binding proteins. Large-scale test on PDB reveals that about
   98\% of proteins that include one of the structural motifs are confirmed
   to bind ATP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, measurements of a considerable portion of the phase diagram
   for the quaternary system water-ethylene glycol-sucrose-NaCl were
   published (Han et al., 2010). In that article, the data were used to
   evaluate the accuracy of two non-ideal multi-solute solution theories:
   the Elliott et al. form of the multi-solute osmotic virial equation and
   the Kleinhans and Mazur freezing point summation model. Based on this
   evaluation, it was concluded that the freezing point summation model
   provides more accurate predictions for the water-ethylene
   glycol-sucrose-NaCl system than the multi-solute osmotic virial
   equation. However, this analysis suffered from a number of issues,
   notably including the use of inconsistent solute-specific coefficients
   for the multi-solute osmotic virial equation. Herein, we reanalyse the
   data using a recently-updated and consistent set of solute-specific
   coefficients (Zielinski et al., 2014). Our results indicate that the two
   models have very similar performance, and, in fact, the multi-solute
   osmotic virial equation can provide more accurate predictions than the
   freezing point summation model depending on the concentration units
   used. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Missed-detection probability expressions for energy detectors often
   involve infinite series and do not provide quick insights into the
   effects of operating conditions. To overcome these limitations, we
   develop novel asymptotic analyses by proposing an approximate
   probability density function (PDF) of a random variable beta, which, in
   general, can characterize fading channels in diverse operating
   conditions. The coefficients of the proposed approximate PDF of beta are
   obtained by matching the coefficients of the approximate PDF's series
   expansion (or coefficients of the approximate PDF's moment generating
   function (MGF)) with those of the exact PDF (or MGF) of beta. By using
   the proposed approximation, a unified closed-form asymptotic
   missed-detection probability is derived. Its usefulness is then
   demonstrated for fading channels without and with antenna diversity, for
   cooperative detection, and in co-channel interference. For each case,
   the sensing gain, which reveals the effect of the operating conditions
   on the detection performance, is determined explicitly. Furthermore, the
   asymptotic complementary area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve, an alternative performance metric, is derived, and
   found to reveal the sensing gain. Numerical results verify the accuracy
   of our derived asymptotic expressions over a wider signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) range compared to the existing asymptotic solution, which is
   accurate only for high SNRs.}},

Abstract = {{This article develops a Bayesian method for fault detection and
   isolation using a sparse reconstruction framework. The normal/training
   data is assumed to follow a signal-plus-noise model, and an indicator
   matrix is used to show whether the test data is from a faulty process.
   The distribution of the indicator matrix is modeled by a Laplacian
   distribution, which forces the indicator matrix to be a sparse one, and
   a Gibbs sampler is derived to obtain the estimation/reconstruction of
   the indicator matrix, the unobserved signals, and other parameters like
   signal mean, covariance, and noise variance. The faulty variables can
   then be detected and isolated by inspecting whether corresponding rows
   of the indicator matrix are zero. The proposed Bayesian approach is data
   driven; it allows for simultaneous fault detection and isolation. A
   simulation study and an industrial case study are used to test the
   performance of the proposed method. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Volume = {{64}},

Pages = {{673-686}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop an integrated prognostics method considering a
   time-varying operating condition, which integrates physical gear models
   and sensor data. By taking advantage of stress analysis in finite
   element modeling (FEM), the degradation process governed by Paris' law
   can adjust itself immediately to respond to the changes of the operating
   condition. The capability to directly relate the load to the damage
   propagation is a key advantage of the proposed integrated prognostics
   approach over the existing data-driven methods for dealing with
   time-varying operating conditions. In the proposed method, uncertainties
   in material parameters are considered as sources responsible for
   randomness in the predicted failure life. The joint distribution of
   material parameters is updated as sensor data become available. The
   updated distribution better characterizes the material parameters, and
   reduces the uncertainty in life prediction for the specific individual
   unit under condition monitoring. The update process is realized via
   Bayesian inference. To reduce the computational effort, a polynomial
   chaos expansion (PCE) collocation method is applied in computing the
   likelihood function in the Bayesian inference and the predicted failure
   time distribution. Examples based on crack propagation in a spur gear
   tooth are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
   In addition, the example also shows that the proposed approach is
   effective even when the current loading profile is different from the
   loading profile under which historical data were collected.}},

Abstract = {{Importance measures in reliability engineering are used to identify weak
   components of a system and signify the roles of components in
   contributing to proper functioning of the system. Recently, an
   integrated importance measure (IIM) has been proposed to evaluate how
   the transition of component states affects the system performance based
   on the probability distributions and transition rates of component
   states. In the system operation phase, the bathtub curve presents the
   change of the transition rate of component states with time, which can
   be described by three different Weibull distributions. The behavior of a
   system under such distributions can be modeled by the semi-Markov
   process. So, based on the reported IIM equations of component states,
   this paper studies how the transition of component states affects system
   performance under the semi-Markov process. This measure can provide
   useful information for preventive actions (such as monitoring
   enhancement, construction improvement, etc.), and provide support to
   improve system performance. Finally, a simple numerical example is
   presented to illustrate the utilization of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Conical involute gears, which are also known as beveloid gears, are the
   involute gears with cone-shape gear body rather than cylindrical gear
   body. Generally, conical gears are used in anti-backlash transmission
   systems and marine transmission systems. In marine transmission system,
   in order to obtain optimal propulsive force, 7-14 degree inclination
   angle was needed. In this paper, a 7 degree cone angle conical gear used
   in 375 kW class marine power transmission system was selected as
   research objective. And in order to establish the design theory of
   conical gear, a design system named conical gear modular modeling system
   was developed. The prototype conical gear was developed by the above
   design system to be used to simulate in a certain condition. The
   simulated and optimized prototype conical gear was manufactured which is
   as a specimen to complete a series of performance tests which contains
   gear tooth profile test and contact rate test. As the results, the
   developed conical gear can well meet the performance requirements of the
   375 kW class marine power transmission system.}},

Journal = {{MINERALS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{34-41}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of amyl xanthate on sphalerite in NaCl solutions of
   different concentrations and in saline water (viz, simulated sea water)
   and the surface properties of treated minerals were investigated. The
   interactions between xanthate treated sphalerite particles and air
   bubbles were examined using induction time measurement, which revealed
   that the salt ions could inhibit the adsorption of xanthate on
   sphalerite due to the competitive adsorption, but also could compress
   the electrical double layer at mineral/water interface. The induction
   time of sphalerite treated in potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) with saline
   water was shorter than that of sphalerite treated in PAX with NaCl of
   the same ion concentration, which implies that the water composition
   (e.g. Ca2+, Mg2+) could play an important role in the bubble-particle
   interaction. The hydrophobicity, chemical composition, and charge
   property of PAX treated sphalerite surfaces were characterized using
   contact angle measurement, Cryo-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   (Cryo-XPS) and zeta potential determination, respectively, which support
   the inhibition effect of salt ions on the xanthate adsorption on
   sphalerite. In the case of saline water, the xanthate decomposition
   products were confirmed by XPS, which could further lower the
   hydrophobicity of the treated sphalerite. Our results provide insights
   into the basic understanding of the salinity effects on the xanthate
   adsorption on sphalerite and the bubble-mineral interactions in
   flotation. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Disruptions at any stage of a supply chain system can cause mammoth
   operational and financial losses to a firm. When there is a disruption
   with a supply chain system, it is highly desired that the system quickly
   recover. The ability of recovery is, in short, called resilience. This
   paper proposes a new measure of the resilience of a supply chain system
   based on the concept of survival and, subsequently, a survival model
   {[}Cox proportional hazard (Cox-PH) model]. The survival model
   represents a time interval or period from the time the system failed to
   function to the time the system gets back with its function (i.e.,
   recovery). The input to the model is, thus, a failure event; the output
   from the model is the recovery time. This model has been implemented.
   There is a case study to illustrate how the model is used to give a
   quantitative measurement of resilience, in terms of recovery time.}},

Abstract = {{In this brief, three nonvolatile flip-flop (FF)/SRAM cells that utilize
   a single magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) as nonvolatile resistive
   element are proposed. These cells have the same core (i.e., 6T) but they
   employ different numbers of MOSFETs to implement the so-called instantly
   ON, normally OFF mode of operation. The additional transistors are
   utilized for the restore operation to ensure that the data stored in the
   nonvolatile circuitry can be written back into the FF core once the
   power is made available. These three cells (7T, 9T, and 11T) are
   extensively analyzed in terms of their operations in 32 nm technology,
   such as operational delays (for the write, read, and restore
   operations), the static noise margin (SNM), critical charge and process
   variations (in both the MOSFETs and the resistive element). Simulation
   results show that an increase in the number of MOSFETs in the cells
   causes improvements in critical charge and tolerance to process
   variations at the expense of an increase in power dissipation. The SNM
   and the delay of the restore operation, however, do not necessarily
   increase with the number of MOSFETs in the cell, but rather on the
   control of access to the storage nodes from the single MTJ.}},

   4528-4539). The hybrid framework integrates genetic algorithm with
   orthogonal arrays and response surface proxies for better convergence
   behavior and higher computational efficiency. The SOS-FR technique
   consists of a heating phase using steam injection, subsequent solvent
   injection, and low temperature steam injection for solvent retrieval and
   additional oil recovery. Solvent injection can be continuous or cyclic
   where the solvent is injected, soaked, and then fluids are produced.
   This paper studies both scenarios over single and multiple matrix field
   scaled reservoirs by adjusting the injections' durations and rates. As a
   result, about 30 design elements for four base benchmark models are
   optimized, and the profit and efficiency is doubled comparing with the
   benchmark models using optimal injection scheme suggested by our
   optimization framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the concept of Dugdale crack model and Yoffe model is
   extended to propose a moving Dugdale interfacial crack model, and the
   interfacial crack between dissimilar magnetoelectroelastic materials
   under anti-plane shear and in-plane electric and magnetic loadings is
   investigated considering the magneto-electro-mechanical nonlinearity. It
   is assumed that the constant moving crack is magneto-electrically
   permeable and the length of the crack keeps constant. Fourier transform
   is applied to reduce the mixed boundary value problem of the crack to
   dual integral equations, which are solved exactly. The explicit
   expression of the size of the yield zone is derived, and the crack
   sliding displacement (CSD) is explicitly expressed. The result shows
   that the stress, electric and magnetic fields in the cracked
   magnetoelectroelastic material are no longer singular and the CSD is
   dependent on the loading, material properties and crack moving velocity.
   The current model can be reduced to the static interfacial crack case
   when the crack moving velocity is zero.}},

Abstract = {{The development of biodegradation treatment processes for oil sands
   process-affected water (OSPW) has been progressing in recent years with
   the promising potential of biofilm reactors. Previously, the granular
   activated carbon (GAC) biofilm process was successfully employed for
   treatment of a large variety of recalcitrant organic compounds in
   domestic and industrial wastewaters. In this study, GAC biofilm
   microbial development and degradation efficiency were investigated for
   OSPW treatment by monitoring the biofilm growth on the GAC surface in
   raw and ozonated OSPW in batch bioreactors. The GAC biofilm community
   was characterized using a next-generation 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing
   technique that revealed that the phylum Proteobacteria was dominant in
   both OSPW and biofilms, with further in-depth analysis showing higher
   abundances of Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria sequences. Interestingly,
   many known polyaromatic hydrocarbon degraders, namely, Burkholderiales,
   Pseudomonadales, Bdellovibrionales, and Sphingomonadales, were observed
   in the GAC biofilm. Ozonation decreased the microbial diversity in
   planktonic OSPW but increased the microbial diversity in the GAC
   biofilms. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed similar bacterial gene
   copy numbers (> 10(9) gene copies/g of GAC) for both raw and ozonated
   OSPW GAC biofilms. The observed rates of removal of naphthenic acids
   (NAs) over the 2-day experiments for the GAC biofilm treatments of raw
   and ozonated OSPW were 31\% and 66\%, respectively. Overall, a
   relatively low ozone dose (30 mg of O-3/liter utilized) combined with
   GAC biofilm treatment significantly increased NA removal rates. The
   treatment of OSPW in bioreactors using GAC biofilms is a promising
   technology for the reduction of recalcitrant OSPW organic compounds.}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1119-1125}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the liquid properties on packing efficiency were
   investigated experimentally. Tests were performed in a column packed
   with ceramic Intalox((R)) saddles, 7mm in diameter. The distillation
   column was operated under total reflux and at atmospheric pressure
   (94kPa). Surface tension positive (methanol/water, n-heptane/toluene),
   surface tension negative (benzene/n-heptane), and surface tension
   neutral (methanol/isopropanol and cyclohexane/n-heptane) systems were
   selected to examine the wide range liquid property effects on the height
   of equivalent to a theoretical tray (HETP). The surface tension gradient
   was found to be the dominant factor affecting HETP in surface tension
   positive systems, but had no effect for the surface tension negative
   system. For the surface tension neutral system, it was found that the
   liquid diffusivities and viscosities had the greatest effect on HETP.
   The measured HETP data was also compared with tray results obtained from
   literature, to determine if packing and tray efficiencies are affected
   in a similar manner by the liquid properties. It was concluded that the
   surface tension gradient, liquid diffusivities, and viscosity have
   similar effects on the efficiency of packed and tray columns.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{An essential requirement for efficient heavy oil production is
   liberation of heavy oil from host rocks, which is determined by the
   wettability of the rocks, and the interfacial tension and viscosity of
   heavy oil. Recent progress on the design of an online visualization flow
   cell allows capture of dynamic heavy oil liberation processes from the
   surfaces of sand grains in real time under a water flooding environment.
   However, the accurate assessment of heavy oil liberation remains a
   challenge, due to uncertainties in defining oil-free areas of heavy oil
   contaminated rock surfaces. In this study, three new image-processing
   algorithms of modified empirical, Gridding, and Edge-covering methods
   were applied to image transformation for heavy oil liberation analysis.
   These methods were found to be more accurate and robust in determining
   the threshold value distinguishing liberated from unliberated sand
   surfaces. The use of wavelet transform theory in the Gridding and
   Edge-covering methods led to faster calculations with a typical error of
   less than 2 \% in the quantitative analysis on the threshold value
   determination and the degree of heavy oil liberation. Among these three
   methods, the Gridding method with a sound theoretical foundation was
   shown to be the most reliable. The results showed that the threshold
   value determined was highly dependent on the types of ores and the image
   capture settings such as lighting conditions, exposure time, and
   microscope magnification.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{889-900}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Nebulizers are the oldest modern method of delivering
   aerosols to the lungs for the purpose of respiratory drug delivery.
   While use of nebulizers remains widespread in the hospital and home
   setting, certain newer nebulization technologies have enabled more
   portable use. Varied fundamental processes of droplet formation and
   breakup are used in modern nebulizers, and these processes impact device
   performance and suitability for nebulization of various formulations.
   Areas covered: This review first describes basic aspects of nebulization
   technologies, including jet nebulizers, various high-frequency vibration
   techniques, and the use of colliding liquid jets. Nebulizer use in
   hospital and home settings is discussed next. Complications in aerosol
   droplet size measurement owing to the changes in nebulized droplet
   diameters due to evaporation or condensation are discussed, as is
   nebulization during mechanical ventilation.
   Expert opinion: While the limelight may often appear to be focused on
   other delivery devices, such as pressurized metered dose and dry powder
   inhalers, the ease of formulating many drugs in water and delivering
   them as aqueous aerosols ensures that nebulizers will remain as a viable
   and relevant method of respiratory drug delivery. This is particularly
   true given recent improvements in nebulizer droplet production
   technology.}},

   silver-containing dressings, as well as dressings containing
   chlorhexidine, iodine and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). The
   materials were tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
   aureus and Candida albi cans for their ability to prevent micro-organism
   adherence, eliminate planktonic micro-organisms and disrupt/eliminate
   mature biofilms generated using the MBECTM assay within 24 h of
   microbial exposure. Only the Ag5IO6-containing dressings were able to
   prevent adherence and eliminate surrounding planktonic micro-organisms
   for all species tested for >= 28 days of elution with log reductions >4.
   Two other silver dressings succeeded against P. aeruginosa only after 28
   elution days, whilst the PHMB dressing succeeded after 28 days of
   elution against C. albi cans only. Ag5IO6-containing dressings were able
   to generate >4 log reductions against all biofilms tested. The only
   commercial dressings able to generate >4 log reductions against biofilms
   were iodine against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, and PHMB against S.
   aureus. The Ag5IO6 dressings demonstrated complete kill (>4 log
   reduction) in a standard 30-min planktonic log reduction assay against
   all species. These results demonstrate that Ag5IO6 has superior activity
   to a number of antimicrobials, with broad-spectrum efficacy that
   includes long-term prevention of microbial adherence, rapid kill of
   planktonic micro-organisms, and the ability to disrupt and eliminate
   mature biofilms. Thus, Ag5IO6 may be a valuable antimicrobial agent for
   use in a number of medical device applications, including wound
   dressings, various catheters or implants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and the

Abstract = {{A clock tower in St. Albert, Alberta, Canada, was outfitted with a
   remote monitoring system to record the vertical deformations of its
   masonry cavity wall enclosures due to temperature and moisture changes.
   Monitoring the deformations of masonry wall enclosures is a unique
   application that is expected to provide new information on the causes of
   distress of brick veneers, which has traditionally been attributed to
   excessive expansion of the brick. Preliminary observations for clay
   brick veneer masonry suggest that reversible moisture-related strains
   could be significant and that radiation-induced temperature spikes could
   be much higher than what is accounted for by current design standards
   and codes. Most observed reversible moisture-induced strains were within
   the limits prescribed in the Canadian masonry standard and the national
   building code of Canada.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-degree of freedom micro-energy harvester has been designed,
   fabricated, and tested and sub 100 Hz natural frequencies have been
   achieved. This design's resonant frequencies at its first three mode
   shapes are within the low ambient vibration frequency range. The
   structure is fabricated from a silicon substrate with Aluminum Nitride
   (AIN) energy harvesting elements on thin silicon beams and uses a chip
   as a proof mass. The nonlinear stiffness due to stretching strain in the
   structure provides a wider harvestable frequency bandwidth in each mode.
   The nonlinear load-deflection equation for the second mode shape of the
   device, which corresponds to vertical oscillation and maximum harvester
   deflection, has been modeled using finite element simulation. The first
   three natural frequencies of 71.8, 84.5, and 188.4Hz were measured
   experimentally for the presented harvester. A frequency bandwidth of 10
   Hz has been obtained for the second mode shape under a base excitation
   of 0.2g. A maximum open circuit voltage of 1 V and power output of 136
   nW with a load resistance of 2 M Omega have been measured using this
   harvester. Using a synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI)
   electrical interface and Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT), simulations
   estimate that the power output could be improved to similar to 3.1 mu W.

Journal = {{APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{140-156}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The oxidation of sulfide minerals in waste rock has the potential to
   generate low-quality drainage that can present a significant challenge
   to mine owners, regulators, and other stakeholders. Challenges involved
   in managing waste rock include the large volume of waste rock produced
   and the difficulty in predicting the quality and quantity of leach water
   due to the chemical and physical heterogeneities in the waste rock, and
   the highly non-linear coupling of geochemical and physical processes.
   Many important studies have been conducted over the past decade,
   particularly at the field scale, that have investigated the geochemical,
   hydrological, microbiological, and gas and heat transport aspects of
   waste-rock. These studies show that although the parameters and
   processes that influence AMD generation and solute release are
   fundamentally similar between different waste-rock piles, major
   differences in the dominant mechanisms of water, gas and heat transport
   result from differences in the physical and mineralogical properties of
   the rock piles, and the climatic conditions, including the amount of
   precipitation and prevailing temperatures. Accurate prediction of the
   leach water quality from waste-rock requires a detailed characterization
   of the properties of the rock piles and the coupling of processes
   specific to the particular conditions. This paper provides a review of
   the physical and mineralogical characteristics of waste-rock piles,
   followed by a discussion of the principal processes related to sulfide
   oxidation and solute loading, and concluding with a discussion on acid
   mine drainage prediction and prevention techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many performance monitoring algorithms (or monitors) have been developed
   to assess control performance and detect problems with specific
   components; however, these algorithms monitor single components as
   stand-alone experts and can be influenced by other problems that they
   were not meant to detect. Thus, the occurrence of a problem can lead to
   flood of abnormal monitor outputs and alarms which can be difficult to
   interpret. This work focuses on how to combine information from the many
   different monitoring algorithms and some of process knowledge in order
   to obtain a more reliable diagnosis. While traditional statistical or
   data-based methods need data from all abnormal cases that they should
   diagnose/isolate, this work focuses on how to improve the Bayesian
   control loop diagnosis by integrating process knowledge and training
   data when some of the abnormality data are sparse or not available in
   historical database. Simulation of the proposed Bayesian diagnostic
   system on the Tennessee Eastman challenge problem is presented. It is
   demonstrated that the diagnosis is possible even when there are no
   training data (or only few samples) from some abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds offer diverse pricing options,
   including on-demand and reserved instances with various discounts to

   brokerage service that reserves a large pool of instances from cloud
   providers and serves users with price discounts. The broker optimally
   exploits both pricing benefits of long-term instance reservations and
   multiplexing gains. We propose dynamic strategies for the broker to make
   instance reservations with the objective of minimizing its service cost.
   These strategies leverage dynamic programming and approximation
   algorithms to rapidly handle large volumes of demand. Our extensive
   simulations driven by large-scale Google cluster-usage traces have shown
   that significant price discounts can be realized via the broker.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-circuit television (CCTV) is the most widely used visual
   inspection method for sewers. Given the amount of public money spent on
   these inspections in Canada annually, productivity improvements may
   represent significant financial savings to the public. This paper
   presents a study based on several sewer mainline CCTV surveys in
   Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The overall objective is to enhance sewer
   CCTV inspection production rate through the duration reduction of
   non-value added activities. The methodology includes performing a work
   measurement study and using a travel route optimization algorithm. The
   first section of the paper presents the results of the work measurement
   study conducted on 214 CCTV operations, as well as the calculated time
   allotment for each work component in the process. In the second section,
   an optimization technique is applied to CCTV truck movements considering
   the two traveling path types of road distance (actual distance traveled)
   and linear distance (straight distance between two points on a map)
   distances used to find an optimal route. As traveling to target manholes
   and locating those manholes are identified in the first section of the
   paper as the most time-consuming, non-value added activities in CCTV
   operations, this study investigates the application of the traveling
   salesman problem (TSP) as a traveling path optimization technique for
   daily CCTV inspections. Through the analysis of the effect of actual
   road distances on the CCTV inspection cycle time, this study shows that
   the application of a TSP solver for preplanning traveling paths can
   improve the inspection production rate of both daily CCTV activities and
   the CCTV inspection of entire neighborhoods by about 13\%. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{AimsWe developed a computer-aided technique to study nuclear atypia
   classification in high-power field haematoxylin and eosin stained
   images.
   Methods and resultsAn automated technique for nuclear atypia score (NAS)
   calculation is proposed. The proposed technique uses sophisticated
   digital image analysis and machine-learning methods to measure the NAS
   for haematoxylin and eosin stained images. The proposed technique first
   segments all nuclei regions. A set of morphology and texture features is
   extracted from presegmented nuclei regions. The histogram of each
   feature is then calculated to characterize the statistical information
   of the nuclei. Finally, a support vector machine classifier is applied
   to classify a high-power field image into different nuclear atypia
   classes. A set of 1188 digital images was analysed in the experiment. We
   successfully differentiated the high-power field image with NAS1 versus
   non-NAS1, NAS2 versus non-NAS2 and NAS3 versus non-NAS3, with area under
   receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.90, 0.86 and 0.87,
   respectively. In three classes evaluation, the average classification
   accuracy was 78.79\%. We found that texture-based feature provides best
   performance for the classification.
   ConclusionThe automated technique is able to quantify statistical
   features that may be difficult to be measured by human and demonstrates
   the future potentials of automated image analysis technique in
   histopathology analysis.
   Lay description The aim of this study is to develop a novel
   computer-aided framework to study nuclear atypia classification in

   offered a novel technique to automatically analyse the nuclei atypia
   degree in digital image. The automated technique proposed to utilize
   high-lever statistical information that may be difficult to be measured
   by human and is able to provide good nuclear atypia classification
   performance. It showed great potential to be used as an adjunct in

Abstract = {{Formation and flow of emulsions in porous media are common in all
   enhanced oil recovery techniques. In most cases, oil-in-water (O/W)
   emulsions are formed in porous media due to oil-water interaction. Even
   now, detailed flow mechanisms of emulsions through porous media are not
   well understood. In this study, variation of rate of flow of O/W
   emulsions with pressure drop was studied experimentally, and rheological
   parameters were calculated. The pressure drop increases with an increase
   in oil concentration in the O/W emulsion due to high viscosity. The
   effective viscosity of the emulsion was calculated from the derived
   model and expressed as a function of shear rate while flowing through
   porous media. Flow of O/W emulsions of different concentrations was
   evaluated in sand packs of different sand sizes. Emulsions were
   characterized by analyzing their stability, rheological properties, and
   temperature effects on rheological properties.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we study joint user-relay selection and association in
   multi-user multi-relay cooperative wireless relay uplinks with
   multi-antenna nodes. For non-regenerative and altruistic relays we
   propose a low-complexity joint scheme, which simultaneously selects
   multiple relays and users for cooperation as well as assigns the
   selected users to different selected relays for service. The proposed
   scheme is sub-optimal and utilizes only the channel gains between the
   nodes, which leads to reduced feedback and overhead in comparison to
   schemes that require full channel knowledge. Furthermore, the complexity
   of the scheme scales linearly as the product of the total number of
   relays, the total number of users and the number of selected users.
   Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint
   scheme compared to a scheme with neither user-relay selection nor
   user-relay association and another scheme with user-relay association,
   but no user-relay selection. The favorable performance and
   low-complexity of the proposed scheme make it very attractive for
   possible implementation in emerging broadband wireless relay networks
   (e.g., LTE-Advanced).}},

Abstract = {{The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) often fails to reproduce realistic
   facies distribution and proportion corresponding to the prior spatial
   distribution. In this paper, a new step is proposed for inclusion in the
   history matching of multiple facies reservoir models using EnKF. The new
   step consists of constructing a facies probability map and application
   of probability field (P-Field) simulation to re-sample a new ensemble.
   After certain number of assimilation steps in EnKF, the updated ensemble
   members are used to propose a probability map for facies distribution.
   P-Field simulation is performed subsequently using the facies
   probability map to generate a new ensemble, which honors the static
   geologic data and is more consistent with the early production data.
   After the re-sampling step, the forecast model is applied to the new
   ensemble from the beginning. EnKF is again applied on the ensemble
   members to assimilate the remaining production history. Two case studies
   with different facies distribution and well configurations were
   conducted. Initial ensemble was created using known facies
   classification at the well locations and populating binary facies data
   throughout the reservoir using prior information of spatial facies
   distribution and facies proportions. The qualities of the
   history-matched models were assessed by comparing the spatial facies
   distribution and proportions of the updated ensemble, in addition to the
   root mean square error of the predicted data mismatch. Implementation of
   EnKF together with re-sampling of the new realizations using probability
   maps demonstrates reasonable improvement in the history matching and
   uncertainty assessment of multiple facies reservoir models.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{94-102}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, acoustic emission (AE) energies recorded during 73
   uniaxial compression tests on weak to very strong rock specimens have
   been analyzed by looking at the variations in b-values, total recorded
   acoustic energy and the maximum recorded energy for each test.
   Using 3D Particle Flow Code (PFC3D), uniaxial compression tests have
   been conducted on discrete element models of rocks with various strength
   and stiffness properties. An algorithm has also been used to record the
   AE data in PFC3D models based on the change in strain energy upon each
   bond breakage.
   The relation between the total released acoustic energy and total
   consumed energy by the specimens has been studied both for the real data
   and numerical models and as a result, a linear correlation is suggested
   between the released AE energy per volume and consumed energy per volume
   of the intact rocks.
   Comparing the recorded acoustic energies in numerical models with real
   data, suggestions are made for getting realistic AE magnitudes due to
   bond breakages (cracks) from PFC3D models by proposing a modification on
   Gutenberg-Richter formula that has been originally proposed for large
   scale shear induced earthquakes along faults.
   Also, using the numerical model, an attempt has been made to quantify
   the damage to the intact rock by proposing a damage parameter defined as
   the total crack surface observed during the tests divided by the total
   crack surface possible based on size of particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Total internal reflection (TIR) is a ubiquitous phenomenon used in
   photonic devices ranging from waveguides and resonators to lasers and
   optical sensors. Controlling this phenomenon and light confinement are
   keys to the future integration of nanoelectronics and nanophotonics on
   the same silicon platform. We introduced the concept of relaxed TIR, in
   2014, to control evanescent waves generated during TIR. These unchecked
   evanescent waves are the fundamental reason photonic devices are
   inevitably diffraction limited and cannot be miniaturized. Our key
   design concept is the engineered anisotropy of the medium into which the
   evanescent wave extends, thus allowing for skin depth engineering
   without any metallic components. In this paper, we give an overview of
   our approach and compare it to key classes of photonic devices such as
   plasmonic waveguides, photonic crystal waveguides, and slot waveguides.
   We show how our work can overcome a long-standing issue in photonics,
   namely, nanoscale light confinement with fully transparent dielectric
   media.}},
