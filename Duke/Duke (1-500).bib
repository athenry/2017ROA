Title = {{Global sensitivity analysis in stochastic simulators of uncertain

Abstract = {{Stochastic models of chemical systems are often subjected to
   uncertainties in kinetic parameters in addition to the inherent random
   nature of their dynamics. Uncertainty quantification in such systems is
   generally achieved by means of sensitivity analyses in which one
   characterizes the variability with the uncertain kinetic parameters of
   the first statistical moments of model predictions. In this work, we
   propose an original global sensitivity analysis method where the
   parametric and inherent variability sources are both treated through
   Sobol's decomposition of the variance into contributions from arbitrary
   subset of uncertain parameters and stochastic reaction channels. The
   conceptual development only assumes that the inherent and parametric
   sources are independent, and considers the Poisson processes in the
   random-time-change representation of the state dynamics as the
   fundamental objects governing the inherent stochasticity. A sampling
   algorithm is proposed to perform the global sensitivity analysis, and to
   estimate the partial variances and sensitivity indices characterizing
   the importance of the various sources of variability and their
   interactions. The birth-death and Schlogl models are used to illustrate
   both the implementation of the algorithm and the richness of the
   proposed analysis method. The output of the proposed sensitivity
   analysis is also contrasted with a local derivative-based sensitivity
   analysis method classically used for this type of systems. Published by
   AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{MoS2 presents a promising low-cost catalyst for the hydrogen evolution
   reaction (HER), but the understanding about its active sites has
   remained limited. Here we present an unambiguous study of the catalytic
   activities of all possible reaction sites of MoS2, including edge sites,
   sulfur vacancies, and grain boundaries. We demonstrate that, in addition
   to the well-known catalytically active edge sites, sulfur vacancies
   provide another major active site for the HER, while the catalytic
   activity of grain boundaries is much weaker. The intrinsic turnover
   frequencies (Tafel slopes) of the edge sites, sulfur vacancies, and
   grain boundaries are estimated to be 7.5 s(-1) (65-75 mV/dec), 3.2 s(-1)
   (65-85 mV/dec), and 0.1 s(-1) (120-160 mV/dec), respectively. We also
   demonstrate that the catalytic activity of sulfur vacancies strongly
   depends on the density of the vacancies and the local crystalline
   structure in proximity to the vacancies. Unlike edge sites, whose
   catalytic activity linearly depends on the length, sulfur vacancies show
   optimal catalytic activities when the vacancy density is in the range of
   7-10\%, and the number of sulfur vacancies in high crystalline quality
   MoS2 is higher than that in low crystalline quality MoS2, which may be
   related with the proximity of different local crystalline structures to
   the vacancies.}},

Abstract = {{Using finite-temperature phonon calculations and machine-learning
   methods, we assess the mechanical stability of about 400 semiconducting

   temperatures-including 36 not mentioned in the literature so far-for
   which we calculate the thermal conductivity. We show that the thermal
   conductivity is generally smaller in fluorides than in oxides, largely
   due to a lower ionic charge, and describe simple structural descriptors
   that are correlated with its magnitude. Furthermore, we show that the
   thermal conductivities of most cubic perovskites decrease more slowly
   than the usual T-1 behavior. Within this set, we also screen for
   materials exhibiting negative thermal expansion. Finally, we describe a
   strategy to accelerate the discovery of mechanically stable compounds at

Abstract = {{A plasma electrochemical method is used to synthesize cuprous oxide
   nanoparticles (Cu2O NPs). In this system, a gaseous discharge plasma is
   used to replace the usual solid electrode in a conventional
   electrodeposition, and Cu2+ ions are released from anodic dissolution
   and take a form of Cu-2(OH)(2+) in the solution. The Cu-2(OH)(2+) moves
   to the cathode reaction zone and then is reduced to the Cu2O monomer by
   reductants generated from the plasma-liquid interactions. Consequently,
   Cu2O NPs are formed in the solution by the combination of Cu2O monomers.
   The results indicate that the morphology and Cu valence in the
   nanoparticles are tuned by the added surfactant of glucose or ascorbic
   acid. Moreover, the Cu2O NPs synthesized with a suitable concentration
   of ascorbic acid demonstrate strong visible light photocatalytic
   activity on the methyl orange degradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The interfaces in devices made of two-dimensional materials such as MoS2
   can effectively control their optoelectronic performance. However, the
   extent and nature of these deterministic interactions are not fully
   understood. Here, we investigate the role of substrate interfaces on the
   photodetector properties of Mo(S)2 devices by studying its photocurrent
   properties on both SiO2 and self-assembled monolayer-modified
   substrates. Results indicate that while the photoresponsivity of the
   devices can be enhanced through control of device interfaces, response
   times are moderately compromised. We attribute this trade-off to the
   changes in the electrical contact resistance at the device
   metal-semiconductor interface. We demonstrate that the formation of
   charge carrier traps at the interface can dominate the device
   photoresponse properties. The capture and emission rates of deeply
   trapped charge carriers in the substrate-semiconductor-metal regions are
   strongly influenced by exposure to light and can dynamically dope the
   contact regions and thus perturb the photodetector properties. As a
   result, interface-modified photodetectors have significantly lower
   dark-currents and higher on-currents. Through appropriate interfacial
   design, a record high device responsivity of 4.5 x 10(3) A/W at 7 V is
   achieved, indicative of the large signal gain in the devices and
   exemplifying an important design strategy that enables highly responsive
   two-dimensional photodetectors.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{327}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Numerical techniques in time domain are widespread in seismic and
   acoustic modeling. In some applications, however, frequency-domain
   techniques can be advantageous over the time-domain approach when narrow
   band results are desired, especially if multiple sources can be handled
   more conveniently in the frequency domain. Moreover, the medium
   attenuation effects can be more accurately and conveniently modeled in
   the frequency domain. In this paper, we present a spectral-element
   method (SEM) in frequency domain to simulate elastic and acoustic waves
   in anisotropic, heterogeneous, and lossy media. The SEM is based upon
   the finite-element framework and has exponential convergence because of
   the use of GLL basis functions. The anisotropic perfectly matched layer
   is employed to truncate the boundary for unbounded problems. Compared
   with the conventional finite element method, the number of unknowns in
   the SEM is significantly reduced, and higher order accuracy is obtained
   due to its spectral accuracy. To account for the acoustic-solid
   interaction, the domain decomposition method (DDM) based upon the
   discontinuous Galerkin spectral-element method is proposed. Numerical
   experiments show the proposed method can be an efficient alternative for
   accurate calculation of elastic and acoustic waves in frequency domain.

Abstract = {{We present a metamaterial element designed as an efficient radiator for
   waveguide-fed metasurface antennas. The metamaterial element is an
   electrically-small, complimentary electric-LC (cELC) resonator designed
   to exhibit large radiated power while maintaining low ohmic losses. The
   shape of the element is tapered to simultaneously achieve broadband
   operation and suppression of cross polarization radiation. Full-wave
   numerical studies at the K-band are conducted to examine its performance
   when etched into a microstrip line. In this configuration, the element
   shows a radiation efficiency of 90.2\% and a fractional bandwidth of
   8.7\%. To investigate the potential benefits of the proposed element in
   two-dimensional platforms, the radiative characteristics of the element
   are calculated when the element is embedded in a dielectric-filled
   parallel-plate waveguide. This efficient metamaterial element has
   potential application as a building block for metasurface devices used
   in imaging, sensing, wireless power transfer, and wireless communication
   systems. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

   direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes by microRNAs}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{We have recently shown that a combination of microRNAs, miR combo, can
   directly reprogram cardiac fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes in
   vitro and in vivo. Reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts by miR combo in
   vivo is associated with improved cardiac function following myocardial
   infarction. However, the efficiency of direct reprogramming in vitro is
   relatively modest and new strategies beyond the traditional
   two-dimensional (2D) culture should be identified to improve
   reprogramming process. Here, we report that a tissue-engineered
   three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel environment enhanced miR combo
   reprogramming of neonatal cardiac and tail-tip fibroblasts. This was
   associated with significantly increased MMPs expression in 3D vs. 2D
   cultured cells, while pharmacological inhibition of MMPs blocked the
   effect of the 3D culture on enhanced miR combo mediated reprogramming.
   We conclude that 3D tissue-engineered environment can enhance the direct
   reprogramming of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes via a MMP-dependent
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Earth-observing remote sensing data, including aerial photography and

   distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, of which there is limited
   public data on solar PV deployments at small geographic scales. We
   created a dataset of solar PV arrays to initiate and develop the process
   of automatically identifying solar PV locations using remote sensing
   imagery. This dataset contains the geospatial coordinates and border
   vertices for over 19,000 solar panels across 601 high-resolution images
   from four cities in California. Dataset applications include training
   object detection and other machine learning algorithms that use remote
   sensing imagery, developing specific algorithms for predictive detection
   of distributed PV systems, estimating installed PV capacity, and

Title = {{An Activity-Based Dissolution Model for Solute-Containing Microdroplets}},

Pages = {{12749-12759}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{When a solute is present in an aqueous droplet, the water activity in
   the droplet and the rate of droplet dissolution are both decreased (as
   compared to a pure water droplet). One of the main parameters that
   controls this effect is the dynamically changing solute concentration,
   and therefore water activity and chemical potential, at the droplet
   interface. This work addresses the importance of understanding how water
   activity changes during solution droplet dissolution. A model for
   dissolution rate is presented that accounts for the kinetic effects of
   changing water activity at the droplet interface during the. dissolution
   of an aqueous salt solution microdroplet into a second immiscible liquid
   phase. The important underlying question in this model is whether the
   dissolving component can be considered in local equilibrium on both
   sides of the droplet interface and whether this assumption is sufficient
   to account for the kinetics of dissolution. The dissolution model is
   based on the Epstein-Plesset equation, which has previously been applied
   to pure gas (bubble) and liquid (droplet) dissolution into liquid
   phases, but not to salt solutions. The model is tested by using the
   micropipet technique to form and observe the dehydration of single NaCl
   solution microdroplets in octanol or butyl acetate. The model
   successfully predicts the droplet diameter as a function of time in both
   organic solvents. The NaCl concentration in water is measured well into
   the supersaturated area >5.4 M, and the supersaturation limit at which
   NaCl nucleation happens is reported to be 10.24 +/- 0.31 M.}},

Abstract = {{A major roadblock to understanding how microbes in the gastrointestinal
   tract colonize and influence the physiology of their hosts is our
   inability to genetically manipulate new bacterial species and
   experimentally assess the function of their genes. We describe the
   application of population-based genomic sequencing after chemical
   mutagenesis to map bacterial genes responsible for motility in
   Exiguobacterium acetylicum, a representative intestinal Firmicutes
   bacterium that is intractable to molecular genetic manipulation. We
   derived strong associations between mutations in 57 E. acetylicum genes
   and impaired motility. Surprisingly, less than half of these genes were
   annotated as motility-related based on sequence homologies. We confirmed
   the genetic link between individual mutations and loss of motility for
   several of these genes by performing a large-scale analysis of
   spontaneous suppressor mutations. In the process, we reannotated genes
   belonging to a broad family of diguanylate cyclases and
   phosphodiesterases to highlight their specific role in motility and
   assigned functions to uncharacterized genes. Furthermore, we generated
   isogenic strains that allowed us to establish that Exiguobacterium
   motility is important for the colonization of its vertebrate host. These
   results indicate that genetic dissection of a complex trait, functional
   annotation of new genes, and the generation of mutant strains to define
   the role of genes in complex environments can be accomplished in
   bacteria without the development of species-specific molecular genetic
   tools.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is usually considered to be an important
   reagent in green chemistry since water is the only by-product in H2O2
   involved oxidation reactions. Early studies show that direct synthesis
   of H2O2 by plasma-water interactions is possible, while the factors
   affecting the H2O2 production in this method remain unclear. Herein, we
   present a study on the H2O2 synthesis by atmospheric pressure
   plasma-water interactions. The results indicate that the most important
   factors for the H2O2 production are the processes taking place at the
   plasma-water interface, including sputtering, electric field induced
   hydrated ion emission, and evaporation. The H2O2 production rate reaches
   similar to 1200 mu mol/h when the liquid cathode is purified water or an
   aqueous solution of NaCl with an initial conductivity of 10500 mu S
   cm(-1).}},

Title = {{Strongly Confined Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons Waveguiding Enabled
   by Planar Staggered Plasmonic Waveguides}},
Journal = {{Scientific Reports}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a novel route to achieving highly efficient and strongly
   confined spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) waveguides at
   subwavelength scale enabled by planar staggered plasmonic waveguides
   (PSPWs). The structure of these new waveguides consists of an ultrathin
   metallic strip with periodic subwavelength staggered double groove
   arrays supported by a flexible dielectric substrate, leading to unique
   staggered EM coupling and waveguiding phenomenon. The spoof SPP
   propagation properties, including dispersion relations and near field
   distributions, are numerically investigated. Furthermore, broadband
   coplanar waveguide (CPW) to planar staggered plasmonic waveguide (PSPW)
   transitions are designed to achieve smooth momentum matching and highly
   efficient spoof SPP mode conversion. By applying these transitions, a
   CPW-PSPW-CPW structure is designed, fabricated and measured to verify
   the PSPW's propagation performance at microwave frequencies. The
   investigation results show the proposed PSPWs have excellent performance
   of deep subwavelength spoof SPPs confinement, long propagation length
   and low bend loss, as well as great design flexibility to engineer the
   propagation properties by adjusting their geometry dimensions and
   material parameters. Our work opens up a new avenue for development of
   various advanced planar integrated plasmonic devices and circuits in
   microwave and terahertz regimes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a method to integrate target behavior into the
   multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) likelihood ratio. In particular, a
   periodic track appraisal based on behavior is introduced. The track
   appraisal uses elementary topological data analysis coupled with basic
   machine-learning techniques, and it adjusts the traditional kinematic
   data association likelihood (i.e., track score) using an established
   formulation for feature-aided data association. The proposed method is
   tested and demonstrated on synthetic vehicular data representing an
   urban traffic scene generated by the Simulation of Urban Mobility
   package. The vehicles in the scene exhibit different driving behaviors.
   The proposed method distinguishes those behaviors and shows improved
   data association decisions relative to a conventional, kinematic MHT.}},

   previous studies on higher order VSIE, our scheme, which is reported for
   the first time in VSIE, is much more flexible. In comparison with the
   conventional low-order scheme, our scheme requires much less memory and
   computational time for the same accuracy level. Numerical results are

   frequency selective surfaces (AFSSs), especially when building
   electronically steerable antennas based on AFSS. In this communication,
   a broadband tunable bandpass AFSS is presented. The tunable ability is
   achieved by the varactors mounted on the surface. The proposed design
   has zigzag resonant current flows through multiple unit cells. Thus, the
   magnetic field coupling between unit cells is enhanced and the resonant
   frequency tunable range is extended. The measured resonant frequency
   tunable range is from 935 MHz to 2.405 GHz. Another advantage of this
   design is that no additional bias grid is required. Furthermore, this
   design has stable response under different angles of incidence because
   it has subwavelength dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical procedures are traditionally performed by two or more surgeons
   along with staff nurses: one serves as the primary surgeon and the other
   as his/her assistant. Introducing surgical robots into the operating
   room has significantly changed the dynamics of interaction between the
   surgeons and with the surgical site. In this paper, we design a surgical
   robotic system to support the collaborative operation of multiple
   surgeons. This Raven IV surgical robotic system has two pairs of
   articulated robotic arms with a spherical configuration, each arm
   holding an articulated surgical tool. It allows two surgeons to
   teleoperate the Raven IV system collaboratively from two remote sites.
   To optimize the mechanism design of the Raven IV system, we configure
   the link architecture of each robotic arm, along with the position and
   orientation of the four bases and the port placement with respect to the
   patient's body. The optimization considers seven different parameters,
   which results in 2.3 x 10(10) system configurations. We optimize the
   common workspace and the manipulation dexterity of each robotic arm. We
   study here the effect of each individual parameter and conduct a brute
   force search to find the optimal set of parameters. The parameters for
   the optimized configuration result in an almost circular common
   workspace with a radius of 150 mm, accessible to all four arms.}},

Abstract = {{Digital (droplet-based) microfluidic technology offers an attractive
   platform for implementing a wide variety of biochemical laboratory
   protocols, such as point-of-care diagnosis, DNA analysis, target
   detection, and drug discovery. A digital microfluidic biochip consists
   of a patterned array of electrodes on which tiny fluid droplets
   aremanipulated by electrical actuation sequences to perform various
   fluidic operations, for example, dispense, transport, mix, or split.
   However, because of the inherent uncertainty of fluidic operations, the
   outcome of biochemical experiments performed on-chip can be erroneous
   even if the chip is tested a priori and deemed to be defect-free. In
   this article, we address an important error recoverability problem in
   the context of sample preparation. We assume a cyberphysical
   environment, in which the physical errors, when detected online at
   selected checkpoints with integrated sensors, can be corrected through
   recovery techniques. However, almost all prior work on error
   recoverability used checkpointing-based rollback approach, that is,
   re-execution of certain portions of the protocol starting from the
   previous checkpoint. Unfortunately, such techniques are expensive both
   in terms of assay completion time and reagent cost, and can never ensure
   full error-recovery in deterministic sense. We consider imprecise
   droplet mix-split operations and present a novel roll-forward approach
   where the erroneous droplets, thus produced, are used in the
   error-recovery process, instead of being discarded or remixed. All
   erroneous droplets participate in the dilution process and they mutually
   cancel or reduce the concentration-error when the target droplet is
   reached. We also present a rigorous analysis that reveals the role of
   volumetric-error on the concentration of a sample to be prepared, and we
   describe the layout of a lab-on-chip that can execute the proposed
   cyberphysical dilution algorithm. Our analysis reveals that fluidic
   errors caused by unbalanced droplet splitting can be classified as being
   either critical or non-critical, and only those of the former type
   require correction to achieve error-free sample dilution. Simulation
   experiments on various sample preparation test cases demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{The quantity of small scale solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays in the United
   States has grown rapidly in recent years. As a result, there is
   substantial interest in high quality information about the quantity,
   power capacity, and energy generated by such arrays, including at a high
   spatial resolution (e.g., cities, counties, or other small regions).
   Unfortunately, existing methods for obtaining this information, such as
   surveys and utility interconnection filings, are limited in their
   completeness and spatial resolution. This work presents a computer
   algorithm that automatically detects PV panels using very high
   resolution color satellite imagery. The approach potentially offers a
   fast, scalable method for obtaining accurate information on PV array
   location and size, and at much higher spatial resolutions than are
   currently available. The method is validated using a very large (135
   km(2)) collection of publicly available (Bradbury et al., 2016) aerial
   imagery, with over 2700 human annotated PV array locations. The results
   demonstrate the algorithm is highly effective on a per-pixel basis. It
   is likewise effective at object-level PV array detection, but with
   significant potential for improvement in estimating the precise
   shape/size of the PV arrays. These results are the first of their kind
   for the detection of solar PV in aerial imagery, demonstrating the
   feasibility of the approach and establishing a baseline performance for
   future investigations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Satisficing in Split-Second Decision Making Is Characterized by
   Strategic Cue Discounting}},

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Much of our real-life decision making is bounded by uncertain
   information, limitations in cognitive resources, and a lack of time to
   allocate to the decision process. It is thought that humans overcome
   these limitations through satisficing, fast but ``good-enough{''}
   heuristic decision making that prioritizes some sources of information
   (cues) while ignoring others. However, the decision-making strategies we
   adopt under uncertainty and time pressure, for example during
   emergencies that demand split-second choices, are presently unknown. To
   characterize these decision strategies quantitatively, the present study
   examined how people solve a novel multicue probabilistic classification
   task under varying time pressure, by tracking shifts in decision
   strategies using variational Bayesian inference. We found that under low
   time pressure, participants correctly weighted and integrated all
   available cues to arrive at near-optimal decisions. With increasingly
   demanding, subsecond time pressures, however, participants
   systematically discounted a subset of the cue information by dropping
   the least informative cue(s) from their decision making process. Thus,
   the human cognitive apparatus copes with uncertainty and severe time
   pressure by adopting a ``drop-the-worst{''} cue decision making strategy
   that minimizes cognitive time and effort investment while preserving the
   consideration of the most diagnostic cue information, thus maintaining
   ``good-enough{''} accuracy. This advance in our understanding of
   satisficing strategies could form the basis of predicting human choices
   in high time pressure scenarios.}},

Title = {{Closure Schemes for Stably Stratified Atmospheric Flows without

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4817-4832}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Two recently proposed turbulence closure schemes are compared against
   the conventional Mellor-Yamada (MY) model for stably stratified
   atmospheric flows. The Energy and Flux-Budget (EFB) approach solves the
   budgets of turbulent momentum and heat fluxes and turbulent kinetic and
   potential energies. The Cospectral Budget (CSB) approach is formulated
   in wavenumber space and integrated across all turbulent scales to obtain
   flow variables in physical space. Unlike the MY model, which is subject
   to a ``critical gradient Richardson number,{''} both EFB and CSB models
   allow turbulence to exist at any gradient Richardson number R-t and
   predict a saturation of flux Richardson number (R-f -> R-fm) at
   sufficiently large R-i. The CSB approach further predicts the value of
   Rim and reveals a unique expression linking the Rotta and von Karman
   constants. Hence, all constants in the CSB model are nontunable and
   stability independent. All models agree that the dimensionless sensible
   heat flux decays with increasing R-i. However, the decay rate and
   subsequent cutoff in the MY model appear abrupt. The MY model further
   exhibits an abrupt cutoff in the turbulent stress normalized by vertical
   velocity variance, while the CSB and EFB models display increasing
   trends. The EFB model produces a rapid increase in the ratio of
   turbulent potential energy and vertical velocity variance as Rim is
   approached, suggesting a strong self-preservation mechanism. Vertical
   anisotropy in the turbulent kinetic energy is parameterized in different
   ways in MY and EFB, but this consideration is not required in CSB.
   Differences between EFB and CSB model predictions originate from how the
   vertical anisotropy is specified in the EFB model.}},

Abstract = {{Software rejuvenation is a proactive software control technique that is
   used to improve a computing system performance when it suffers from
   software aging. In this paper, a two-granularity inspection-based
   software rejuvenation policy, which works as a closed-loop control
   technique, is proposed. This policy mitigates the negative impact of
   two-level software aging. The two levels considered are the user-level
   applications and the operating system. A Markov regenerative process
   model is constructed based on the system condition. We obtain the
   degradation rate of the application software and operating system from
   fault injection experiments. The diagnostic accuracy of the adopted
   monitor and analysis system, which is applied to inspect the application
   software and operating system, is considered as we provide the optimal
   rejuvenation strategies. Finally, the availability and the overall loss
   probability with their corresponding optimal inspection time intervals
   are obtained numerically based on the parameter values estimated from
   the experiments. Experimental results show that two-granularity software
   rejuvenation is much more effective than traditional single-level
   software rejuvenation. In our experimental study, when two-granularity
   software rejuvenation is used, the unavailability and the overall loss
   probability of the system were reduced by 17.9\% and 2.65\%,
   respectively, in comparison with the single-level rejuvenation.}},

   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres from dichloromethane
   (DCM) solutions, measuring the loading capacity and solubility limits of
   Ibp in typical PLGA microspheres. Formed in phosphate buffered saline
   (PBS), pH 7.4, Ibp/PLGA/DCM microdroplets were uniformly solidified into
   Ibp/PLGA microparticles up to drug loadings (DL) of 41\%. However, at DL
   50 wt\% and above, microparticles showed a phase separated pattern.
   Working with single microparticles, we also estimated the dissolution
   time of pure Ibp microspheres in the buffer or in detergent micelle
   solutions, as a function of the microsphere size and compare that to
   calculated dissolution times using the Epstein-Plesset (EP) model.
   Single, pure Ibp microparticles precipitated as liquid phase
   microdroplets that then gradually dissolved into the surrounding PBS
   medium. Analyzing the dissolution profiles of Ibp over time, a diffusion
   coefficient of 5.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) cm(2)/s was obtained by using the EP
   model, which was in excellent agreement with the literature. Finally,
   solubilization of Ibp into sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles was
   directly visualized microscopically for the first time by the
   micropipette technique, showing that such micellization could increase
   the solubility of Ibp from 4 to 80 mM at 100 mM SDS. We also introduce a
   particular microfluidic device that has recently been used to make PLGA
   microspheres, showing the importance of optimizing the flow parameters.
   Using this device, perfectly smooth and size-homogeneous microparticles
   were formed for flow rates of 0.167 mL/h for the dispersed phase (Q(d))
   and 1.67 mL/h for the water phase (Q(c)), i.e., a flow rate ratio
   Q(d)/Q(c) of 10, based on parameters such as interfacial tension,
   dissolution rates and final concentrations. Thus, using the micropipette
   technique to observe the formation, and quantify solvent dissolution,
   solidification or precipitation of an active pharmaceutical ingredient
   (API) or excipient for single and individual microparticles, represents
   a very useful tool for understanding microsphere-processes and hence can
   help to establish process conditions without resorting to expensive and
   material-consuming bulk particle runs.}},

Abstract = {{Patient motion artifacts are often visible in densely sampled or large
   wide field-of-view (FOV) retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   volumes. A popular strategy for reducing motion artifacts is to capture
   two orthogonally oriented volumetric scans. However, due to larger
   volume sizes, longer acquisition times, and corresponding larger motion
   artifacts, the registration of wide FOV scans remains a challenging
   problem. In particular, gaps in data acquisition due to eye motion, such
   as saccades, can be significant and their modeling becomes critical for
   successful registration. In this article, we develop a complete
   computational pipeline for the automatic motion correction and accurate
   registration of wide FOV orthogonally scanned OCT images of the human
   retina. The proposed framework utilizes the retinal boundary
   segmentation as a guide for registration and requires only a minimal
   transformation of the acquired data to produce a successful
   registration. It includes saccade detection and correction, a custom
   version of the optical flow algorithm for dense lateral registration and
   a linear optimization approach for axial registration. Utilizing a wide
   FOV swept source OCT system, we acquired retinal volumes of 12 subjects
   and we provide qualitative and quantitative experimental results to
   validate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of the proposed technique.

   in a General Circulation Model of the Tropical Pacific}},

Abstract = {{The authors present a polynomial chaos (PC)-based Bayesian inference
   method for quantifying the uncertainties of the K-profile
   parameterization (KPP) within the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm)
   of the tropical Pacific. The inference of the uncertain parameters is
   based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme that utilizes a newly
   formulated test statistic taking into account the different components
   representing the structures of turbulent mixing on both daily and
   seasonal time scales in addition to the data quality, and filters for
   the effects of parameter perturbations over those as a result of changes
   in the wind. To avoid the prohibitive computational cost of integrating
   the MITgcm model at each MCMC iteration, a surrogate model for the test
   statistic using the PC method is built. Because of the noise in the
   model predictions, a basis-pursuit-denoising (BPDN) compressed sensing
   approach is employed to determine the PC coefficients of a
   representative surrogate model. The PC surrogate is then used to
   evaluate the test statistic in the MCMC step for sampling the posterior
   of the uncertain parameters. Results of the posteriors indicate good
   agreement with the default values for two parameters of the KPP model,
   namely the critical bulk and gradient Richardson numbers; while the
   posteriors of the remaining parameters were barely informative.}},

Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs) are commonly used to treat
   domestic wastewater in the Dickinson Bayou watershed, located between
   Houston and Galveston. The Dickinson Bayou is classified as
   ``impaired{''} by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality due to
   high levels of indicator bacterium, Escherichia coli. Failing OWTSs in
   the watershed are possible sources for the impairment of the bayou.
   Nearly all of the watershed is at risk to failing OWTSs due to high
   water table and clay content in the soil. The HYDRUS modeling software
   for water and solute flow through variably saturated media was used to
   simulate the performance of (1) conventional OWTSs, (2) aerobic
   treatment units (ATUs) with spray distribution, and (3) mounded OWTSs
   under conditions indicative of the Dickinson Bayou watershed. The
   purpose of the study was to simulate system performance under existing
   conditions. Simulation results indicated that both the conventional and
   ATU systems fail due to effluent ponding and E. coli transport to the
   land surface due to high water tables and clay soils in the watershed.
   Simulations indicated that conventional and ATU systems failed when
   rainfall intensity was greater than 0.25 cm/h. However, themodel
   simulations indicatemound systems did not fail under existing conditions
   as they did not allow E. coli to reach the surface or ponding to occur.
   Consequently, mound systems can be considered as better systems in this
   watershed to minimize bacterial loadings.}},

Abstract = {{Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a major mechanism responsible for the
   spread of antibiotic resistance. Conversely, it is often assumed that
   antibiotics promote HGT. Careful dissection of the literature, however,
   suggests a lack of conclusive evidence supporting this notion in
   general. This is largely due to the lack of well-defined quantitative
   experiments to address this question in an unambiguous manner. In this
   review, we discuss the extent to which HGT is responsible for the spread
   of antibiotic resistance and examine what is known about the effect of
   antibiotics on the HGT dynamics. We focus on conjugation, which is the
   dominant mode of HGT responsible for spreading antibiotic resistance on
   the global scale. Our analysis reveals a need to design experiments to
   quantify HGT in such a way to facilitate rigorous data interpretation.
   Such measurements are critical for developing novel strategies to combat
   resistance spread through HGT.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient and exact spectral integral method (SIM) for the general
   problems of scattering by a circular cylinder is presented, both for
   acoustic and electromagnetic cases. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and
   convolution theorem help us to execute the algorithm efficiently with
   O(Nlog(N)) computational complexity. The Fourier coefficients of the
   integral kernels are computed in a semianalytical way to accomplish a
   fast convergence rate with spectral accuracy. Compared with the method
   not using the semianalytical forms, without the increase of the
   computing and memory abundance, it saves more than 90\% sampling points
   to achieve about the same accuracy, and with the same number of sampling
   points, several to more than ten orders of magnitude more accuracy can
   be achieved. For example, for the tested large wavenumber case with 2 x
   10(6) wavelengths on the boundary, only two sampling points per
   wavelength are required to achieve a relative error of less than
   0.001\%. More than 90\% computational time is saved compared with the
   normal summation formula of harmonic cylinder expansions. (c) 2016

Title = {{Comparison of low-contrast detectability between two CT reconstruction
   algorithms using voxel-based 3D printed textured phantoms}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{6497-6506}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To use novel voxel-based 3D printed textured phantoms in order
   to compare low-contrast detectability between two reconstruction
   algorithms, FBP (filtered-backprojection) and SAFIRE (sinogram affirmed
   iterative reconstruction) and determine what impact background texture
   (i.e., anatomical noise) has on estimating the dose reduction potential
   of SAFIRE.
   Methods: Liver volumes were segmented from 23 abdominal CT cases. The
   volumes were characterized in terms of texture features from gray-level
   co-occurrence and run-length matrices. Using a 3D clustered lumpy
   background (CLB) model, a fitting technique based on a genetic
   optimization algorithm was used to find CLB textures that were
   reflective of the liver textures, accounting for CT system factors of
   spatial blurring and noise. With the modeled background texture as a
   guide, four cylindrical phantoms (Textures A-C and uniform, 165 mm in
   diameter, and 30 mm height) were designed, each containing 20
   low-contrast spherical signals (6 mm diameter at nominal contrast levels
   of similar to 3.2, 5.2, 7.2, 10, and 14 HU with four repeats per
   signal). The phantoms were voxelized and input into a commercial
   multimaterial 3D printer (Object Connex 350), with custom software for
   voxel-based printing (using principles of digital dithering). Images of
   the textured phantoms and a corresponding uniform phantom were acquired
   at six radiation dose levels (SOMATOM Flash, Siemens Healthcare) and
   observer model detection performance (detectability index of a
   multislice channelized Hotelling observer) was estimated for each
   condition (5 contrasts x 6 doses x 2 reconstructions x 4 backgrounds =
   240 total conditions). A multivariate generalized regression analysis
   was performed (linear terms, no interactions, random error term, log
   link function) to assess whether dose, reconstruction algorithm, signal
   contrast, and background type have statistically significant effects on
   detectability. Also, fitted curves of detectability (averaged across
   contrast levels) as a function of dose were constructed for each
   reconstruction algorithm and background texture. FBP and SAFIRE were
   compared for each background type to determine the improvement in
   detectability at a given dose, and the reduced dose at which SAFIRE had
   equivalent performance compared to FBP at 100\% dose.
   Results: Detectability increased with increasing radiation dose (P =
   2.7x10(-59)) and contrast level (P = 2.2x10(-86)) and was higher in the
   uniform phantom compared to the textured phantoms (P = 6.9x10(-51)).
   Overall, SAFIRE had higher d' compared to FBP (P = 0.02). The estimated
   dose reduction potential of SAFIRE was found to be 8\%, 10\%, 27\%, and
   8\% for Texture-A, Texture-B, Texture-C and uniform phantoms.
   Conclusions: In all background types, detectability was higher with
   SAFIRE compared to FBP. However, the relative improvement observed from
   SAFIRE was highly dependent on the complexity of the background texture.
   Iterative algorithms such as SAFIRE should be assessed in the most
   realistic context possible. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{The prediction of mosquito abundance is of central interest in
   addressing mosquito population dynamics and in forecasting the
   associated emerging and re-emerging diseases. However, little work has
   focused on the systematic evaluation of how well adult mosquito
   abundance can be predicted as a function of observational resolutions,
   aggregation scales, and prediction lead time. We use a state space
   reconstruction (SSR) approach to compare the predictability of mosquito
   population dynamics at weekly, biweekly, and monthly scales. We focus on
   the analysis of Aedes vexans and Culiseta melanura populations monitored
   in Brunswick County (North Carolina, USA) and find that prediction over
   a 7-d lead time is improved when daily observations are used, compared
   to the commonly used once-per-week sample. Our results demonstrate that
   daily observations of mosquito abundance contribute to improving
   mosquito predictability in two ways: (1) daily observations better
   capture fluctuations over short timescales, which are missed when
   sampling at coarser resolutions, and (2) the aggregation of daily
   abundance observations reduces the impact of noise, thereby increasing
   the predictability of mosquito population dynamics as the aggregation
   scale is increased. We show that the evaluation of population dynamical
   models based on observed and predicted abundance can lead to a
   spuriously high apparent performance, due to the high autocorrelation in
   the observations used to update the model state at each successive time
   step. We show that the comparison of predicted and observed population
   change, expressed through per capita growth rates, leads to a more
   informative performance measure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel distributed method to stabilize a set
   of agents moving in a two dimensional environment to a desired rigid
   formation. In our approach, each agent computes its control input using
   the relative positions of a set of formation neighbors but, contrary to
   most existing works, this information is expressed in the agent's own
   independent local coordinate frame, without requiring any common
   reference. The controller is based on the minimization of a Lyapunov
   function that includes locally computed rotation matrices, which are
   required due to the absence of a common orientation. Our contribution is
   that the proposed distributed coordinate-free method achieves global
   stabilization to a rigid formation with the agents using only partial
   information of the team, does not require any leader units, and is
   applicable to both single-integrator or unicycle agents. To guarantee
   global stability, we require that the network induced by the agent
   interactions belongs to a certain class of undirected rigid graphs in
   two dimensions, which we explicitly characterize. The performance of the
   proposed method is illustrated with numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider scenarios where mobility can be exploited to
   enable reliable communications in wireless networks with scarce
   resources that are unable to concurrently service their nodes.
   Specifically, we consider cases where a team of robots operate as mobile
   access points (APs) that provide service, namely sufficient end-to-end
   communication routes, to a multihop network of static source nodes which
   generate data. We introduce the connectivity scheduling problem, a novel
   framework that combines motion planning of the APs with service
   scheduling of the source nodes and network routing control so that
   integrity of communications is guaranteed over time. We formulate the
   connectivity scheduling problem as a multistage mixed integer
   programming (MIP) problem, where path planning, service scheduling, and
   routing decisions are all jointly optimized over a discrete-time
   horizon. Since MIP problems can grow intractable quickly, we further
   consider a continuous convex reformulation of the problem and employ
   sparse optimization techniques, specifically the reweighted l(1)
   regularization scheme, to recover the desired integrality structure of
   the solution. We propose a decentralized method to solve the above
   relaxation that is based on the recently developed accelerated
   distributed augmented Lagrangians (ADAL) algorithm. Specifically, we
   modify ADAL by incorporating in the algorithm the reweighted l(1)
   scheme, which enables us to recover the desired sparsity structure of
   the original MIP at the final solution. Numerical results are presented
   that validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an equivalence between feasible kinodynamic planning
   and optimal kinodynamic planning, in that any optimal planning problem
   can be transformed into a series of feasible planning problems in a
   state-cost space, whose solutions approach the optimum. This
   transformation yields a meta-algorithm that produces an asymptotically
   optimal planner, given any feasible kinodynamic planner as a subroutine.
   The meta-algorithm is proven to be asymptotically optimal and a formula
   is derived relating expected running time and solution suboptimality. It
   is directly applicable to a wide range of optimal planning problems
   because it does not resort to the use of steering functions or numerical
   boundary-value problem solvers. On a set of benchmark problems, it is
   demonstrated to perform, using the expansive space tree (EST) and
   rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithms as subroutines, at a
   level that is superior or comparable to related planners.}},

Abstract = {{Saccadic eye movements rapidly displace the image of the world that is
   projected onto the retinas. In anticipation of each saccade, many
   neurons in the visual system shift their receptive fields. This
   presaccadic change in visual sensitivity, known as remapping, was first
   documented in the parietal cortex and has been studied in many other
   brain regions. Remapping requires information about upcoming saccades
   via corollary discharge. Analyses of neurons in a corollary discharge
   pathway that targets the frontal eye field (FEF) suggest that remapping
   may be assembled in the FEF's local microcircuitry. Complementary data
   from reversible inactivation, neural recording, and modeling studies
   provide evidence that remapping contributes to transsaccadic continuity
   of action and perception. Multiple forms of remapping have been reported
   in the FEF and other brain areas, however, and questions remain about
   the reasons for these differences. In this review of recent progress, we
   identify three hypotheses that may help to guide further investigations
   into the structure and function of circuits for remapping.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Structural and compositional heterogeneity within drusen
   comprising lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins have been previously
   described. We sought to detect and define phenotypic patterns of drusen
   heterogeneity in the form of optical coherence tomography-reflective
   drusen substructures (ODS) and examine their associations with
   age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-related features and AMD
   progression.
   Design: Retrospective analysis in a prospective study.
   Participants: Patients with intermediate AMD (n = 349) enrolled in the
   multicenter Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) ancillary
   spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) study.
   Methods: Baseline SD OCT scans of 1 eye per patient were analyzed for
   the presence of ODS. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of
   ODS presence with AMD-related features visible on SD OCT and color
   photographs, including drusen volume, geographic atrophy (GA), and
   preatrophic features, were evaluated for the entire macular region.
   Similar associations were also made locally within a 0.5-mm-diameter
   region around individual ODS and corresponding control region without
   ODS in the same eye.
   Main Outcome Measures: Preatrophy SD OCT changes and GA, central GA, and
   choroidal neovascularization (CNV) from color photographs.
   Results: Four phenotypic subtypes of ODS were defined: low reflective
   cores, high reflective cores, conical debris, and split drusen. Among
   the 349 participants, there were 307 eligible eyes and 74 (24\%) had at
   least 1 ODS. The ODS at baseline were associated with (1) greater
   macular drusen volume at baseline (P < 0.001), (2) development of
   preatrophic changes at year 2 (P = 0.001-0.01), and (3) development of
   macular GA (P = 0.005) and preatrophic changes at year 3 (P =
   0.002-0.008), but not development of CNV. The ODS at baseline in a local
   region were associated with (1) presence of preatrophy changes at
   baseline (P = 0.02-0.03) and (2) development of preatrophy changes at
   years 2 and 3 within the region (P = 0.008-0.05).
   Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography-reflective drusen
   substructures are optical coherence tomography-based biomarkers of
   progression to GA, but not to CNV, in eyes with intermediate AMD.
   Optical coherence tomography-reflective drusen substructures may be a
   clinical entity helpful in monitoring AMD progression and informing
   mechanisms in GA pathogenesis. (C) 2016 by the American Academy of

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Roadside trash burning is largely unexamined as a factor that influences
   air quality, radiative forcing, and human health even though it is
   ubiquitously practiced across many global regions, including throughout
   India. The objective of this research is to examine characteristics and
   redox activity of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with
   roadside trash burning in Bangalore, India. Emissions from smoldering
   and flaming roadside trash piles (n = 24) were analyzed for organic and
   elemental carbon (OC/EC), brown carbon (BrC), and toxicity (i.e. redox
   activity, measured via the dithiothreitol ``DTI{''} assay). A subset of
   samples (n = 8) were further assessed for toxicity by a cellular assay
   (macrophage assay) and also analyzed for trace organic compounds.
   Results show high variability of chemical composition and toxicity
   between trash-burning emissions, and characteristic differences from
   ambient samples. OC/EC ratios for trash-burning emissions range from 0.8
   to 1500, while ambient OC/EC ratios were observed at 5.4 +/- 1.8. Trace
   organic compound analyses indicate that emissions from trash-burning
   piles were frequently composed of aromatic di-acids (likely from burning
   plastics) and levoglucosan (an indicator of biomass burning), while the
   ambient sample showed high response from alkanes indicating notable
   representation from vehicular exhaust. Volume-normalized DTT results
   (i.e., redox activity normalized by the volume of air pulled through the
   filter during sampling) were, unsurprisingly, extremely elevated in all
   trash-burning samples. Interestingly, DIT results suggest that on a
   per-mass basis, fresh trash-burning emissions are an order of magnitude
   less redox-active than ambient air (13.4 +/- 14.8 pmol/min/mu gOC for
   trash burning; 107 +/- 25 pmol/min/mu gOC for ambient). However, overall
   results indicate that near trash burning sources, exposure to
   redox-active PM can be extremely high. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how extracellular matrix (ECM) binding impacts valve
   interstitial cells (VICs) is critical not only to better understanding
   the etiology of valvular diseases but also to constructing living valve
   substitutes that can grow and remodel. Use of ECM-mimicking adhesive
   peptides with specific affinity to different receptors provides insights
   into adhesion-mediated cell signaling and downstream outcomes.
   Expression of adhesion receptors by VICs was assessed by flow cytometry
   and used to guide the choice of peptides studied. The peptide RGDS with
   affinity to multiple integrin receptors, and specific receptor-targeting
   peptides DGEA (integrin alpha (2) beta (1)), YIGSR (67 kDa
   laminin/elastin receptor; 67LR), and VAPG (67LR) were incorporated into
   hydrogels to investigate their effects on VICs. DGEA, YIGSR, and VAPG
   alone were insufficient to induce stable VIC adhesion. As a result,
   these peptides were studied in combination with 1 mM RGDS. For VICs
   cultured on two-dimensional hydrogel surfaces, YIGSR and VAPG
   down-regulated the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin
   (myofibroblast activation marker); DGEA promoted VIC adhesion and
   VIC-mediated ECM deposition and inhibited the activity of alkaline
   phosphatase (osteogenic differentiation marker). Further, YIGSR and DGEA
   in combination promoted ECM deposition while inhibiting both
   myofibroblastic and osteogenic differentiation. However, VICs behaved
   differently to adhesive ligands when cultured within three-dimensional

Abstract = {{Electrotransfection has been widely used as a versatile, non-viral
   method for gene delivery. However, electrotransfection efficiency (eTE)
   is still low and unstable, compared to viral methods. To understand
   potential mechanisms of the problems, we investigated effects of
   electrode materials on eTE and viability of mammalian cells. Data from
   the study showed that commonly used metal electrodes generated a
   significant amount of particles during application of pulsed electric
   field, which could cause precipitation of plasmid DNA from solutions,
   thereby reducing eTE. For aluminum electrodes, the particles were
   composed of aluminum hydroxide and/or aluminum oxide, and their median
   sizes were 300-400 nm after the buffer was pulsed 4-8 times at 400 V
   cm(-1), 5 ms duration and 1 Hz frequency. The precipitation could be
   prevented by using carbon (graphite) electrodes in electrotransfection
   experiments. The use of carbon electrodes also increased cell viability.
   Taken together, the study suggested that electrodes made of
   electrochemically inert materials were desirable for electrotransfection
   of cells in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the challenges of scaling quantum computer hardware lie at the
   interface between the qubits and the classical control signals used to
   manipulate them. Modular ion trap quantum computer architectures address
   scalability by constructing individual quantum processors interconnected
   via a network of quantum communication channels. Successful operation of
   such quantum hardware requires a fully programmable classical control
   system capable of frequency stabilizing the continuous wave lasers
   necessary for loading, cooling, initialization, and detection of the ion
   qubits, stabilizing the optical frequency combs used to drive logic gate
   operations on the ion qubits, providing a large number of analog voltage
   sources to drive the trap electrodes, and a scheme for maintaining phase
   coherence among all the controllers that manipulate the qubits. In this
   work, we describe scalable solutions to these hardware development
   challenges.}},

Title = {{Using Hyperpolarized Xe-129 MRI to Quantify the Pulmonary Ventilation
   Distribution}},
Journal = {{ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1521-1531}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Ventilation heterogeneity is impossible to
   detect with spirometry. Alternatively, pulmonary ventilation can be
   imaged three-dimensionally using inhaled Xe-129 magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). To date, such images have been quantified primarily based
   on ventilation defects. Here, we introduce a robust means to transform
   Xe-129 MRI scans such that the underlying ventilation distribution and
   its heterogeneity can be quantified.
   Materials and Methods: Quantitative Xe-129 ventilation MRI was conducted
   in 12 younger (24.7 +/- 5.2 years) and 10 older (62.2 +/- 7.2 years)
   healthy individuals, as well as in 9 younger (25.9 +/- 6.4 yrs) and 10
   older (63.2 +/- 6.1 years) asthmatics. The younger healthy population
   was used to establish a reference ventilation distribution and
   thresholds for six intensity bins. These bins were used to display and
   quantify the ventilation defect region (VDR), the low ventilation region
   (LVR), and the high ventilation region (HVR).
   Results: The ventilation distribution in young subjects was roughly
   Gaussian with a mean and standard deviation of 0.52 0.18, resulting in
   VDR = 2.1 +/- 1.3\%, LVR = 15.6 +/- 5.4\%, and HVR = 17.4 +/- 3.1\%.
   Older healthy volunteers exhibited a significantly right skewed
   distribution (0.46 +/- 0.20, P = 0.034), resulting in significantly
   increased VDR (7.0 +/- 4.8\%, P = 0.008) and LVR (24.5 +/- 11.5\%, P =
   0.025). In the asthmatics, VDR and LVR increased in the older
   population, and HVR was significantly reduced (13.5 +/- 4.6\% vs 18.9
   +/- 4.5\%, P = 0.009). Quantitative Xe-129 MRI also revealed altered
   ventilation heterogeneity in response to albuterol in two asthmatics
   with normal spirometry.
   Conclusions: Quantitative Xe-129 MRI provides a robust and objective
   means to display and quantify the pulmonary ventilation distribution,
   even in subjects who have airway function impairment not appreciated by
   spirometry.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered cardiac tissues hold promise for cell therapy and drug
   development, but exhibit inadequate function and maturity. In this
   study, we sought to significantly improve the function and maturation of
   rat and human engineered cardiac tissues. We developed dynamic,
   free-floating culture conditions for engineering ``cardiobundles{''},
   3-dimensional cylindrical tissues made from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
   or human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs)
   embedded in fibrin-based hydrogel. Compared to static culture, 2-week
   dynamic culture of neonatal rat cardiobundles significantly increased
   expression of sarcomeric proteins, cardiomyocyte size (similar to
   2.1-fold), contractile force (similar to 3.5-fold), and conduction
   velocity of action potentials (similar to 1.4-fold). The average
   contractile force per cross-sectional area (59.7 mN/mm(2)) and
   conduction velocity (52.5 cm/s) matched or approached those of adult rat
   myocardium, respectively. The inferior function of statically cultured
   cardiobundles was rescued by transfer to dynamic conditions, which was
   accompanied by an increase in mTORC1 activity and decline in AMPK
   phosphorylation and was blocked by rapamycin. Furthermore, dynamic
   culture effects did not stimulate ERK1/2 pathway and were insensitive to
   blockers of mechanosensitive channels, suggesting increased nutrient
   availability rather than mechanical stimulation as the upstream
   activator of mTORC1. Direct comparison with phenylephrine treatment
   confirmed that dynamic culture promoted physiological cardiomyocyte
   growth rather than pathological hypertrophy. Optimized dynamic culture
   conditions also augmented function of human cardiobundles made
   reproducibly from cardiomyocytes derived from multiple hPSC lines,
   resulting in significantly increased contraction force (similar to
   2.5-fold) and conduction velocity (similar to 1.4-fold). The average
   specific force of 23.2 mN/mm(2) and conduction velocity of 25.8 cm/s
   approached the functional metrics of adult human myocardium. In
   conclusion, we have developed a versatile methodology for engineering
   cardiac tissues with a near-adult functional output without the need for
   exogenous electrical or mechanical stimulation, and have identified mTOR
   signaling as an important mechanism for advancing tissue maturation and
   function in vitro. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the crystallization kinetics of Cu50Zr50 metallic
   glass thin films using nanocalorimetry. The crystallization process is
   growth-controlled during heating and nucleation-controlled during
   cooling, resulting in different critical heating and cooling rates to
   suppress crystallization. Measurements over a wide range of scanning
   rates (13 K/s to 21,000 K/s) reveal that crystallization does not follow
   Arrhenius kinetics upon heating. Instead, the behavior on heating is
   well described by a fragility based model of growth-controlled kinetics
   that takes into account breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relationship.
   Upon cooling, the quench rate required to suppress crystallization of
   the melt is much higher than for bulk samples. This reduced asymmetry in
   critical heating and cooling rates compared to bulk materials suggests
   that crystallization of the thin-film metallic glass is controlled by
   heterogeneous nucleation. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{Microscale surface roughness has been shown to enhance osseointegration
   of titanium implants through increased osteoblast differentiation while
   osteoblast proliferation remains greater on smooth titanium. Taking
   advantage of these phenomena, we developed a shape memory (meth)acrylate
   copolymer with thermomechanical properties that created a time-dependent
   dynamic surface change from smooth to rough under in vitro cell culture
   conditions and evaluated the effect of the shape recovery on osteoblast
   response. Rough topographies were created using soft lithography
   techniques to mimic those found on clinically-used Ti surfaces (machined
   smooth; acid-etched; grit-blasted). The surface roughness was then
   reduced to smooth via compression and shown to fully recover within 24 h
   in culture conditions. When grown under static conditions, osteoblast
   number, alkaline phosphatase specific activity (ALP), and
   osteoprotegerin (OPG) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   production were unaffected by polymer surface roughness, but osteocalcin
   (OCN) was increased on the grit-blasted polymer mimic. Under dynamic
   conditions, DNA was reduced but OCN and OPG were increased on the
   compressed grit blasted polymer at 3 days compared to static surfaces.
   The present study indicates that responses to polymer surface are
   sensitive to time-dependent changes in topography. The use of a shape
   memory polymer with dynamic surface roughness may improve
   osseointegration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to calculate thermal properties in automatic fashion, the
   Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA) has been combined with the Automatic
   Phonon Library (APL) and implemented within the AFLOW framework for
   high-throughput computational materials science. As a benchmark test to
   address the accuracy of the method and implementation, the specific heat
   capacities, thermal expansion coefficients, Gruneisen parameters and
   bulk moduli have been calculated for 130 compounds. It is found that
   QHA-APL can reliably predict such values for several different classes
   of solids with root mean square relative deviation smaller than 28\%
   with respect to experimental values. The automation, robustness,
   accuracy and precision of QHA-APL enable the computation of large
   material data sets, the implementation of repositories containing
   thermal properties, and finally can serve the community for data mining
   and machine learning studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The present study reports CO2 capture and conversion to bicarbonate

   while the CO2 in the aqueous phase was subsequently converted to
   bicarbonate ions by the CA. CO2 gas removal in air was investigated at
   various conditions such as gas velocity, cell density and CO2 inlet
   concentration. Regimes for kinetic and mass transfer limitations were
   defined. Very high removal rates of CO2 were observed:
   9570gCO(2)m(bioreactor)(-3)h(-1) and a CO2 removal efficiency of 93\% at
   4\% inlet CO2 when the gas retention time was 24s, and cell
   concentration was 4g(dw)L(-1). These performances are superior to
   earlier reports of experimental bioreactors using CA for CO2 capture.
   Overall, this bioreactor system has significant potential as an

Abstract = {{In this paper, the formulation of Stolt migration is modified for
   impulse borehole radar imaging in large nonuniform subsurface scenarios.
   By applying the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the
   acquisition of the frequency-wavenumber spectrum (FWS), the efficiency
   of Stolt migration for nonuniform surveys is improved. First, each
   nonuniform exponent basis in Fourier transform is approximated with a
   weighted summation of several uniform exponent bases. Then, the
   nonuniform samples with the same uniform exponent basis are accumulated
   to generate a larger virtual uniform sample set. The FWS of nonuniform
   samples is approximated with the virtual sample set by FFT. Finally,
   angular frequency interpolation and inverse FFT are performed over a
   sample FWS to reconstruct the reflectivity map of the imaging area. The
   selection of approximation parameters is discussed to make a tradeoff
   between approximation error and computational cost. The improved Stolt
   migration technique is compared with the conventional backprojection
   method and the Kirchhoff migration method on synthetic data and
   validated by a single borehole radar experiment in a subsurface
   scenario. The results show that the developed Stolt migration is
   superior to the conventional methods in terms of computational cost,
   cross-range resolution, and the ability to reconstruct the targets.}},

Title = {{Using the detectability index to predict P300 speller performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The P300 speller is a popular brain-computer interface (BCI)
   system that has been investigated as a potential communication
   alternative for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. To
   achieve acceptable accuracy levels for communication, the system
   requires repeated data measurements in a given signal condition to
   enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of elicited brain responses. These
   elicited brain responses, which are used as control signals, are
   embedded in noisy electroencephalography (EEG) data. The
   discriminability between target and non-target EEG responses defines a
   user's performance with the system. A previous P300 speller model has
   been proposed to estimate system accuracy given a certain amount of data
   collection. However, the approach was limited to a static stopping
   algorithm, i.e. averaging over a fixed number of measurements, and the
   row-column paradigm. A generalized method that is also applicable to
   dynamic stopping (DS) algorithms and other stimulus paradigms is
   desirable. Approach. We developed a new probabilistic model-based
   approach to predicting BCI performance, where performance functions can
   be derived analytically or via Monte Carlo methods. Within this
   framework, we introduce a new model for the P300 speller with the
   Bayesian DS algorithm, by simplifying a multi-hypothesis to a binary
   hypothesis problem using the likelihood ratio test. Under a normality
   assumption, the performance functions for the Bayesian algorithm can be
   parameterized with the detectability index, a measure which quantifies
   the discriminability between target and non-target EEG responses. Main
   results. Simulations with synthetic and empirical data provided initial
   verification of the proposed method of estimating performance with
   Bayesian DS using the detectability index. Analysis of results from
   previous online studies validated the proposed method. Significance. The
   proposed method could serve as a useful tool to initially assess BCI
   performance without extensive online testing, in order to estimate the
   amount of data required to achieve a desired accuracy level.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes in detail the effects of sodium and potassium on
   Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) absorbers and solar cells. We report on the
   influence of these species on the surface and bulk composition as well
   as bulk defect structure of CIGS films as revealed by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), secondary ion mass spectroscopy
   (SIMS), and photoluminescence (PL). From the XPS studies it is found
   that Na and K promote oxygen absorption onto the CIGS films.
   Furthermore, potassium accelerates the formation of indium and gallium
   oxides on the film surface, making the surface Cu-deficient. Low
   temperature PL studies suggest that (i) Na and K help passivate
   non-radiative recombination centers, presumably at the grain boundaries,
   and (ii) Na further impacts the bulk defect structure inside of CIGS
   grains, which is not observed with K. This change in bulk defect
   structure is attributed to the greater diffusivity of Na in CIGS
   relative to K due to the smaller atomic size. This in-depth study
   (integration of XPS, SIMS, PL, and device characteristics) reveals that
   the surface chemistry and the grain boundary passivation have stronger
   influences on the device performance than the bulk defect structure. (C)

Abstract = {{We perform microwave imaging using a dynamically reconfigurable aperture
   based on a tunable disordered cavity. The electrically large cavity is
   cubic with a spherical deformation and supports a multitude of distinct
   electromagnetic modes that vary as a function of excitation frequency.
   With a set of irises introduced into one wall of the cavity, the cavity
   modes couple to spatially distinct radiative modes that vary as a
   function of the driving frequency. To increase the diversity of the
   radiated fields, we replace one of the cavity walls with a variable
   impedance surface consisting of a set of varactor-populated mushroom
   structures grouped into pixels. The reflection phase of each pixel is
   independently changed with application of a voltage bias, effectively
   altering the surface impedance. We demonstrate high-fidelity imaging and
   examine the role of the impedance-tunable boundary condition, revealing
   superior performance in comparison with just frequency-diverse
   measurements. We also demonstrate single-frequency imaging, which can
   significantly reduce the demands on the required microwave source. The
   dynamic cavity imager may find relevance in security screening,
   through-wall imaging, biomedical diagnostics, and radar applications.}},

   Carbon Aerosols from an Urban Indian City-Kanpur}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric aerosols influence Earth's radiative balance, having both
   warming and cooling effects. Though many aerosols reflect radiation,
   carbonaceous aerosols such as black carbon and certain organic carbon
   species known as brown carbon have the potential to warm the atmosphere
   by absorbing light. Black carbon absorbs light over the entire solar
   spectrum whereas brown carbon absorbs near-UV wavelengths and, to a
   lesser extent, visible light. In developing countries, such as India,
   where combustion sources are prolific, the influence of brown carbon on
   absorption may be significant. In order to better characterize brown
   carbon, we present experimental and modeled absorption properties of
   submicron aerosols measured in an urban Indian city (Kanpur). Brown
   carbon here is found to be fivefold more absorbing at 365 nm wavelength
   compared to previous studies. Results suggest similar to 30\% of total
   absorption in Kanpur is attributed to brown carbon, with primary organic
   aerosols contributing more than secondary organics. We report the
   spectral brown carbon refractive indices along with an experimentally
   constrained estimate of the influence of aerosol mixing state on
   absorption. We conclude that brown carbon in Kanpur is highly absorbing
   in nature and that the mixing state plays an important role in light
   absorption from volatile species.}},

Abstract = {{Amines and amides are important atmospheric organic-nitrogen compounds
   but high time resolution, highly sensitive, and simultaneous ambient
   measurements of these species are rather sparse. Here, we present the
   development of a high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass
   spectrometer (HR-ToF-CIMS) method, utilizing protonated ethanol as
   reagent ions to simultaneously detect atmospheric gaseous amines (C-1 to
   C-6) and amides (C-1 to C-6). This method possesses sensitivities of
   5.6-19.4 Hz pptv 1 for amines and 3.8-38.0 Hz pptv(-1) for amides under
   total reagent ion signals of similar to 0.32 MHz. Meanwhile, the
   detection limits were 0.10-0.50 pptv for amines and 0.29-1.95 pptv for
   amides at 3 sigma of the background signal for a 1 min integration time.
   Controlled characterization in the laboratory indicates that relative
   humidity has significant influences on the detection of amines and
   amides, whereas the presence of organics has no obvious effects. Ambient
   measurements of amines and amides utilizing this method were conducted
   from 25 July to 25 August 2015 in urban Shanghai, China. While the
   concentrations of amines ranged from a few parts per trillion by volume
   to hundreds of parts per trillion by volume, concentrations of amides
   varied from tens of parts per trillion by volume to a few parts per
   billion by volume. Among the C-1- to C-6-amines, the C-2-amines were the
   dominant species with concentrations up to 130 pptv. For amides, the
   C-3-amides (up to 8.7 ppb) were the most abundant species. The diurnal
   and backward trajectory analysis profiles of amides suggest that in
   addition to the secondary formation of amides in the atmosphere,
   industrial emissions could be important sources of amides in urban
   Shanghai. During the campaign, photooxidation of amines and amides might
   be a main loss pathway for them in daytime, and wet deposition was also
   an important sink.}},

Title = {{Quantifying Risk for Anxiety Disorders in Preschool Children: A Machine
   Learning Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Early childhood anxiety disorders are common, impairing, and predictive
   of anxiety and mood disorders later in childhood. Epidemiological
   studies over the last decade find that the prevalence of impairing
   anxiety disorders in preschool children ranges from 0.3\% to 6.5\%. Yet,
   less than 15\% of young children with an impairing anxiety disorder
   receive a mental health evaluation or treatment. One possible reason for
   the low rate of care for anxious preschoolers is the lack of affordable,
   timely, reliable and valid tools for identifying young children with
   clinically significant anxiety. Diagnostic interviews assessing
   psychopathology in young children require intensive training, take hours
   to administer and code, and are not available for use outside of
   research settings. The Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) is a
   reliable and valid structured diagnostic parent-report interview for
   assessing psychopathology, including anxiety disorders, in 2 to 5 year
   old children. In this paper, we apply machine-learning tools to already
   collected PAPA data from two large community studies to identify
   sub-sets of PAPA items that could be developed into an efficient,
   reliable, and valid screening tool to assess a young child's risk for an
   anxiety disorder. Using machine learning, we were able to decrease by an
   order of magnitude the number of items needed to identify a child who is
   at risk for an anxiety disorder with an accuracy of over 96\% for both
   generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and separation anxiety disorder
   (SAD). Additionally, rather than considering GAD or SAD as
   discrete/binary entities, we present a continuous risk score
   representing the child's risk of meeting criteria for GAD or SAD.
   Identification of a short question- set that assesses risk for an
   anxiety disorder could be a first step toward development and validation
   of a relatively short screening tool feasible for use in pediatric
   clinics and daycare/preschool settings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an overview of current progress in the technological
   advances and the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat
   neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, as presented by
   participants of the Fourth Annual DBS Think Tank, which was convened in
   March 2016 in conjunction with the Center for Movement Disorders and
   Neurorestoration at the University of Florida, Gainesveille FL, USA. The
   Think Tank discussions first focused on policy and advocacy in DBS
   research and clinical practice, formation of registries, and issues
   involving the use of DBS in the treatment of Tourette Syndrome. Next,
   advances in the use of neuroimaging and electrochemical markers to
   enhance DBS specificity were addressed. Updates on ongoing use and
   developments of DBS for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, essential
   tremor, Alzheimer's disease, depression, post traumatic stress disorder,
   obesity, addiction were presented, and progress toward innovation(s) in
   closed-loop applications were discussed. Each section of these
   proceedings provides updates and highlights of new information as
   presented at this year's international Think Tank, with a view toward
   current and near future advancement of the field.}},

Title = {{Subwavelength diffractive acoustics and wavefront manipulation with a
   reflective acoustic metasurface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Acoustic metasurfaces provide useful wavefront shaping capabilities,
   such as beam steering, acoustic focusing, and asymmetric transmission,
   in a compact structure. Most acoustic metasurfaces described in the
   literature are transmissive devices and focus their performance on
   steering sound beam of the fundamental diffractive order. In addition,
   the range of incident angles studied is usually below the critical
   incidence predicted by generalized Snell's law of reflection. In this
   work, we comprehensively analyze the wave interaction with a generic
   periodic phase-modulating structure in order to predict the behavior of
   all diffractive orders, especially for cases beyond critical incidence.
   Under the guidance of the presented analysis, a broadband reflective
   metasurface is designed based on an expanded library of labyrinthine
   acoustic metamaterials. Various local and nonlocal wavefront shaping
   properties are experimentally demonstrated, and enhanced absorption of
   higher order diffractive waves is experimentally shown for the first
   time. The proposed methodology provides an accurate approach for
   predicting practical diffracted wave behaviors and opens a new
   perspective for the study of acoustic periodic structures. The designed
   metasurface extends the functionalities of acoustic metasurfaces and
   paves the way for the design of thin planar reflective structures for
   broadband acoustic wave manipulation and extraordinary absorption.

Abstract = {{Cu2BaSnS4-xSex films consisting of earth-abundant metals have been
   examined for photocathode application. Films with different Se contents
   (i.e., Cu2BaSnS4-xSex with x <= 2.4) were synthesized using a cosputter
   system with post-deposition sulfurization/selenization annealing
   treatments. Each film adopts a trigonal P31 crystal structure, with
   progressively larger lattice constants and with band gaps shifting from
   2.0 to 1.6 eV, as more Se substitutes for S in the parent compound
   Cu2BaSnS4. Given the suitable bandgap and earth-abundant elements, the
   Cu2BaSnS4-xSex films were studied as prospective photocathodes for water
   splitting. Greater than 6 mA/cm(2) was obtained under illumination at
   -0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for Pt/Cu2BaSnS4-xSex films
   with similar to 60\% Se content (i.e., x = 2.4), whereas a bare
   Cu2BaSnS4-xSex (x = 2.4) film yielded similar to 3 mA/cm(2) at -0.4

Title = {{Spectral element method for band-structure calculations of 3D phononic
   crystals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{45}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{The spectral element method (SEM) is a special kind of high-order finite
   element method (FEM) which combines the flexibility of a finite element
   method with the accuracy of a spectral method. In contrast to the
   traditional FEM, the SEM exhibits advantages in the high-order accuracy
   as the error decreases exponentially with the increase of interpolation
   degree by employing the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) polynomials as
   basis functions. In this study, the spectral element method is developed
   for the first time for the determination of band structures of 3D
   isotropic/anisotropic phononic crystals (PCs). Based on the Bloch
   theorem, we present a novel, intuitive discretization formulation for
   Navier equation in the SEM scheme for periodic media. By virtue of using
   the orthogonal Legendre polynomials, the generalized eigenvalue problem
   is converted to a regular one in our SEM implementation to improve the
   efficiency. Besides, according to the specific geometry structure,
   8-node and 27-node hexahedral elements as well as an analytic mesh have
   been used to accurately capture curved PC models in our SEM scheme. To
   verify its accuracy and efficiency, this study analyses the
   phononic-crystal plates with square and triangular lattice arrangements,
   and the 3D cubic phononic crystals consisting of simple cubic (SC), bulk
   central cubic (BCC) and faced central cubic (FCC) lattices with
   isotropic or anisotropic scatters. All the numerical results considered
   demonstrate that SEM is superior to the conventional FEM and can be an
   efficient alternative method for accurate determination of band
   structures of 3D phononic crystals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the classification of high-dimensional Gaussian
   signals from low-dimensional noisy, linear measurements. In particular,
   it provides upper bounds (sufficient conditions) on the number of
   measurements required to drive the probability of misclassification to
   zero in the low-noise regime, both for random measurements and designed
   ones. Such bounds reveal two important operational regimes that are a
   function of the characteristics of the source: 1) when the number of
   classes is less than or equal to the dimension of the space spanned by
   signals in each class, reliable classification is possible in the
   low-noise regime by using a one-vs-all measurement design; 2) when the
   dimension of the spaces spanned by signals in each class is lower than
   the number of classes, reliable classification is guaranteed in the
   low-noise regime by using a simple random measurement design. Simulation
   results both with synthetic and real data show that our analysis is
   sharp, in the sense that it is able to gauge the number of measurements
   required to drive the misclassification probability to zero in the
   low-noise regime.}},

Title = {{Dual-wavelength pump-probe microscopy analysis of melanin composition}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Pump-probe microscopy is an emerging technique that provides detailed
   chemical information of absorbers with sub-micrometer spatial
   resolution. Recent work has shown that the pump-probe signals from
   melanin in human skin cancers correlate well with clinical concern, but
   it has been difficult to infer the molecular origins of these
   differences. Here we develop a mathematical framework to describe the
   pump-probe dynamics of melanin in human pigmented tissue samples, which
   treats the ensemble of individual chromophores that make up melanin as
   Gaussian absorbers with bandwidth related via Frenkel excitons. Thus,
   observed signals result from an interplay between the spectral
   bandwidths of the individual underlying chromophores and spectral
   proximity of the pump and probe wavelengths. The model is tested using a
   dual-wavelength pump-probe approach and a novel signal processing method
   based on gnomonic projections. Results show signals can be described by
   a single linear transition path with different rates of progress for
   different individual pump-probe wavelength pairs. Moreover, the combined
   dual-wavelength data shows a nonlinear transition that supports our
   mathematical framework and the excitonic model to describe the optical
   properties of melanin. The novel gnomonic projection analysis can also
   be an attractive generic tool for analyzing mixing paths in biomolecular
   and analytical chemistry.}},

Title = {{Co-designing a scalable quantum computer with trapped atomic ions}},
Journal = {{NPJ QUANTUM INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The first generation of quantum computers are on the horizon, fabricated
   from quantum hardware platforms that may soon be able to tackle certain
   tasks that cannot be performed or modelled with conventional computers.
   These quantum devices will not likely be universal or fully
   programmable, but special-purpose processors whose hardware will be
   tightly co-designed with particular target applications. Trapped atomic
   ions are a leading platform for first-generation quantum computers, but
   they are also fundamentally scalable to more powerful general purpose
   devices in future generations. This is because trapped ion qubits are
   atomic clock standards that can be made identical to a part in 1015, and
   their quantum circuit connectivity can be reconfigured through the use
   of external fields, without modifying the arrangement or architecture of
   the qubits themselves. In this forwardlooking overview, we show how a
   modular quantum computer with thousands or more qubits can be engineered
   from ion crystals, and how the linkage between ion trap qubits might be
   tailored to a variety of applications and quantum-computing protocols.}},

Title = {{Trends for isolated amino acids and dipeptides: Conformation, divalent
   ion binding, and remarkable similarity of binding to calcium and lead}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{We derive structural and binding energy trends for twenty amino acids,
   their dipeptides, and their interactions with the divalent cations Ca2+,
   Ba2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+. The underlying data set consists of
   more than 45,000 first-principles predicted conformers with relative
   energies up to similar to 4eV (similar to 400 kJ/mol). We show that only
   very few distinct backbone structures of isolated amino acids and their
   dipeptides emerge as lowest-energy conformers. The isolated amino acids
   predominantly adopt structures that involve an acidic proton shared
   between the carboxy and amino function. Dipeptides adopt one of two
   intramolecular-hydrogen bonded conformations C-5 or C-7(eq). Upon
   complexation with a divalent cation, the accessible conformational space
   shrinks and intramolecular hydrogen bonding is prevented due to strong
   electrostatic interaction of backbone and side chain functional groups
   with cations. Clear correlations emerge from the binding energies of the
   six divalent ions with amino acids and dipeptides. Cd2+ and Hg2+ show
   the largest binding energies-a potential correlation with their known
   high acute toxicities. Ca2+ and Pb2+ reveal almost identical binding
   energies across the entire series of amino acids and dipeptides. This
   observation validates past indications that ion-mimicry of calcium and
   lead should play an important role in a toxicological context.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
   is complex. Vitamin D (VitD) has been implicated in NAFLD pathogenesis
   because it has roles in immune modulation, cell differentiation and
   proliferation, and regulation of inflammation. We evaluated the
   association of VitD levels, hepatic gene expression for VitD
   metabolizing genes, and NAFLD histological severity.
   METHODS: Two adult cohorts, controls (n=39) and NAFLD (n=244), who
   underwent liver biopsy were compared. Two-sided t-tests or Wilcoxon's
   rank-sum tests for continuous predictors and chi-squared tests or
   Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables were used to analyze the
   association of VitD and NAFLD. Generalized linear models were used to
   analyze the association of VitD levels and VitD metabolizing genes with
   histological severity of NAFLD while adjusting for potential confounders
   and correcting for multiple comparisons.
   RESULTS: NAFLD patients were more likely than controls to have higher
   HbA1c ( 6.5 +/- 1.2 vs 5.9 +/- 1.0; P=0.009), a risk factor for VitD
   deficiency. However, no difference in VitD levels was observed between
   groups. VitD levels did not correlate with the severity of hepatic
   steatosis, lobular or portal inflammation, or ballooned hepatocytes
   after adjusting for confounding factors. Furthermore, no association was
   noted between VitD deficiency or differential expression of genes
   involved in VitD metabolism and severity of hepatic fibrosis or any
   other histologic feature of NAFLD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neither VitD deficiency, nor hepatic expression of
   VitD-related genes, associate with the presence or histologic severity
   of NAFLD in patients. Hence, despite preclinical evidence implicating
   VitD in NAFLD pathogenesis, VitD deficiency does not appear to be
   associated with NAFLD severity in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Nitinol-based vascular devices, for example, peripheral and intracranial
   stents, are limited by thrombosis and restenosis. To ameliorate these
   complications, we developed a technology to promote vessel healing by
   rapidly seeding (QuickSeeding) autologous blood-derived endothelial
   cells (ECs) onto modified self-expanding nitinol stent delivery systems
   immediately before implantation. Several thousand micropores were
   laser-drilled into a delivery system sheath surrounding a commercial
   nitinol stent to allow for exit of an infused cell suspension. As
   suspension medium flowed outward through the micropores, ECs flowed
   through the delivery system attaching to the stent surface. The
   QuickSeeded ECs adhered to and spread on the stent surface following
   24-h in vitro culture under static or flow conditions. Further,
   QuickSeeded ECs on stents that were deployed into porcine carotid
   arteries spread to endothelialize stent struts within 48 h (n=4). The
   QuickSeeded stent struts produced significantly more nitric oxide in ex
   vivo flow circuits after 24 h, as compared to static conditions (n=5).
   In conclusion, ECs QuickSeeded onto commercial nitinol stents within
   minutes of implantation spread to form a functional layer in vitro and
   in vivo, providing proof of concept that the novel QuickSeeding method
   with modified delivery systems can be used to seed functional autologous
   endothelium at the point of care. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The story starts in Basel at CLINAM in 2013, when I asked Pieter about
   making nanoparticles and he advised me to try this solvent-exchange
   method we have developed for making limit sized particles. We are
   particularly interested in what are limit size materials because we want
   to test the feasibility of an idea: could we design, make, develop, and
   test the concept for treating metastatic cancer by, Putting the Drug in
   the Cancer's Food? Limit size is the size of the cancers food, ? the
   common Low Density Lipoprotein, (LDL) similar to 20 nm diameter. In this
   contribution to Pieter's LTAA we focus on the bottom (nucleation) and
   the up (growth) of bottom-up design as it applies to homogeneous
   nucleation of especially, hydrophobic drugs and the 8 physico-chemical
   stages and associated parameters that determine the initial size, and
   any subsequent coarsening, of a nanoparticle suspension. We show that,
   when made by the rapid solvent-exchange method, the same sized particles
   can be obtained without phospholipid. Furthermore, the obtained size
   follows the predictions of classic nucleation theory when the
   appropriate values for the parameters (surface tension and
   supersaturation) at nucleation are included. Calculations on dissolution
   time for nanoparticles reveal that a typical fewmicromolar-solubility,
   hydrophobic, anti-cancer drug (like Lapatinib, Niclosamide, Abiraterone,
   and Fulvestrant) of 500nm diameter would take between 3?7 s to dissolve
   in an infinite sink like the blood stream; and a 50nm particle would
   dissolve in less than a second! And so the nanoparticle design requires
   a highly water-insoluble drug, and a tight, encapsulating, impermeable
   lipid:cholesterol monolayer. While the Y junction can be used to mix an
   ethanolic solution with anti-solvent, we find that a no-junction can
   give equally good results. A series of nanoparticles (DiI-fluorescently
   labeled Triolein-cored and drug-cored nanoparticles of Orlistat) were
   then tested in well-characterized cell lines for uptake and efficacy as
   well as a PET-imageable nanoparticle in initial PET-imaging studies in
   animals for EPR uptake and tumor detection. We show that, while
   free-drug cannot be optimally administered in vivo, a nanoparticle
   formulation of orlistat could in principle represent a stable parenteral
   delivery system. The article ends with a brief discussion of what we see
   as the way forward in Individualized Medicine from the
   Diagnostic-Therapeutic (Diapeutic) side, requiring (18)FDG detection of
   metastatic lesions, functional imaging of a protein target (e.g. Fatty
   Acid Synthase) using C-11 acetate, then a PET (or other)-imageable
   nanoparticle to demonstrate EPR accumulation, and then the
   administration of the pure-drug nanoparticle taken in by the most
   aggressive cancer cells in the perivascular space, as they would their
   food.}},

Title = {{Loss of stiffness in collagen-rich uterine fibroids after digestion with
   purified collagenase Clostridium histolyticum}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are a significant health problem. These
   common benign tumors occur in 70-80\% of women before age 50 years and
   often cause bleeding and pain and can interfere considerably with daily
   life. Current treatment options are limited. Fibroids contain
   substantial amounts of altered and disordered collagens, which
   contribute to their bulk. Targeting these collagens directly presents a
   novel treatment approach.
   OBJECTIVES: We sought to test the hypothesis that a highly purified
   collagenase Clostridium histolyticum will digest interstitial collagen
   in uterine fibroids and reduce their stiffness and thereby evaluate the
   feasibility that this collagenase C histolyticum can be developed into
   an alternative treatment for fibroids. A secondary objective was to
   describe the collagen content of the fibroid tissue.
   STUDY DESIGN: Fibroid tissue cubes (1 cm(3); n = 154) were cut from 17
   uterine fibroids that were obtained from 7 consented subjects undergoing
   scheduled hysterectomies. Tissue cubes were injected with diluent,
   placebo, or highly purified collagenase C histolyticum(0.05, 0.1, or 0.2
   mg/cube) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours. At
   each time point, 6 noninjected control cubes were also evaluated. Tissue
   cubes were photographed before and after incubation. Myometrial samples
   (n = 21) were also evaluated. Stiffness was quantified through rheometry
   by measuring complex shear moduli of the tissues. Percent fibrosis was
   determined by computerized analysis of Masson-trichromeestained slides.
   Digestion of collagen fibrils was confirmed by transmission electron
   microscopy.
   RESULTS: Fibrosis in untreated fibroids ranged from 37\% to 77\%,
   reflecting the collagen-rich nature of these tumors. After treatment
   with collagenase for 96 hours, fibrosis ranged from 5.3\% to 2.4\%.
   Transmission electron microscopy confirmed complete digestion of
   collagen fibrils. Tissue stiffness was reduced with all 3 doses of
   collagenase treatment and at all 4 time points. Longer incubation times
   with collagenase caused greater reduction in stiffness, and treated
   cubes lost their cuboidal shape and had gelatinous/liquefied centers. At
   96 hours the stiffness in tissues treated with the lowest dose was
   reduced to 966 +/- 106 Pascal compared with the diluent-treated control
   at the same time (5323 +/- 903 Pascal; P < .0001; by analysis of
   variance with Tukey-Kramer).
   CONCLUSION: Uterine fibroids have a high content of collagen that can be
   effectively digested by highly purified collagenase C histolyticum,
   resulting in reduced tissue stiffness. Loss of stiffness may decrease
   bulk symptoms in vivo and possibly lead to shrinkage of fibroids through
   changed mechanotransduction, leading ultimately to reduced fibroid
   symptoms of pain and bleeding. Clinical trials are necessary to evaluate
   the safety and efficacy of collagenase C histolyticum including the rate
   of regrowth of fibroids. The data of this study provide a strong
   rationale for using this purified collagenase in clinical trials as a
   local treatment for women with fibroids.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in water treatment technology have made water recycling a
   viable engineering solution to water supply limitations. In spite of
   this, such water recycling schemes have often been halted by lack of
   public acceptance. Previous studies have captured the public's attitudes
   regarding planned reuse schemes, but here we focus on unplanned reuse
   (i.e. de facto reuse), present in many cities across the U.S. We
   performed a survey in three metropolitan areas, Atlanta, GA (N = 421),
   Philadelphia, PA (N = 490), and Phoenix, AZ (N = 418), to assess basic
   perceptions of treated wastewater occurrence and its acceptance in the
   public water supply. These perceptions were then coupled by estimates of
   the actual extent of occurrence in the corresponding cities. The key
   results are that (1) de facto reuse occurs at rates across the three
   cities higher than what is perceived; (2) roughly 25\% of respondents
   perceive de facto reuse to occur in their home tap water; and (3)
   respondents who perceived de facto reuse to occur at their tap were ten
   times more likely to have a high level of acceptance for de facto reuse
   in their home tap. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of stone size on the process and comminution efficiency of
   shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) were investigated in experiments, numerical
   simulations and scale analysis. Cylindrical BegoStone phantoms with
   approximately equal height and diameter of either 4, 7 or 10 mm, in a
   total aggregated mass of about 1.5 g, were treated in an electromagnetic
   shock wave lithotripter field. The resultant stone comminution was found
   to correlate closely with the average peak pressure, P+(avg), incident
   on the stones. The P+(avg) threshold necessary to initiate stone
   fragmentation in water increased from 7.9 to 8.8 to 12.7 MPa,
   respectively, as stone size decreased from 10 to 7 to 4 mm. Similar
   changes in the P+(avg) threshold were observed for the 7- and 10-mm
   stones treated in 1,3-butanediol, in which cavitation is suppressed,
   suggesting that the observed size dependency is due to changes in stress
   distribution within stones of different size. Moreover, the slope of the
   correlation curve between stone comminution and ln((P) over bar
   (+(avg))) in water increased with decreasing stone size, whereas the
   opposite trend was observed in 1,3-butanediol. The progression of stone
   comminution in SWL exhibited size-dependence: the 7- and 10-mm stones
   fragmented into progressively smaller pieces, whereas a significant
   portion (>30\%) of the 4-mm stones reached a stalemate within the size
   range of 2.8 similar to 4 mm, even after 1000 shocks. Analytical scaling
   considerations suggest size-dependent fragmentation behavior, a
   hypothesis further supported by numerical model calculations that reveal
   changing patterns of constructive and destructive wave interference and,
   thus, variations in the maximum tensile stress or stress integral
   produced in cylindrical and spherical stone of different sizes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, the mixed-order stabilized biconjugate gradient fast
   Fourier transform (mixed-order BCGS-FFT) method is presented to solve
   the scattering problem of magnetodielectric materials with general
   anisotropy in layered media. While the volumetric roof-top functions are
   used as the testing functions for the coupled field volume integral
   equation and the basis functions for flux densities, the second-order
   curl conforming basis functions are applied to expand the vector
   potentials with the aim of both preserving the continuity of their
   tangential components and avoiding the zero terms that might otherwise
   be caused by the divergence operator. The layered medium Green's
   function (LMGF) is efficiently evaluated through the recursive matrix
   method along with an interpolation technique. Several numerical
   experiments are presented to demonstrate the high accuracy and
   efficiency of the method. Different from the previously published works
   that aim to solve the similar problem, the new contribution of this work
   is to extend the mixed-order BCGS-FFT method to accommodate the layered
   background medium. Therefore, the 3-D FFT acceleration for integral
   kernels associated with the LMGF as well as the interpolation technique
   has been implemented and combined with the mixed-order BCGS-FFT method.}},

Title = {{Validation of Macular Choroidal Thickness Measurements from Automated
   SD-OCT Image Segmentation}},
Journal = {{OPTOMETRY AND VISION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1387-1398}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging
   permits in vivo visualization of the choroid with micron-level
   resolution over wide areas and is of interest for studies of ocular
   growth and myopia control. We evaluated the speed, repeatability, and
   accuracy of a new image segmentation method to quantify choroid
   thickness compared to manual segmentation.
   Methods. Two macular volumetric scans (25 x 30 degrees) were taken from
   30 eyes of 30 young adult subjects in two sessions, 1 hour apart. A
   single rater manually delineated choroid thickness as the distance
   between Bruch's membrane and sclera across three B-scans (foveal,
   inferior, and superior-most scan locations). Manual segmentation was
   compared to an automated method based on graph theory, dynamic
   programming, and wavelet-based texture analysis. Segmentation
   performance comparisons included processing speed, choroid thickness
   measurements across the foveal horizontal midline, and measurement
   repeatability (95\% limits of agreement (LoA)).
   Results. Subjects were healthy young adults (n = 30; 24 +/- 2 years;
   mean +/- SD; 63\% female) with spherical equivalent refractive error of
   -3.46 +/- 2.69D (range: +2.62 to -8.50D). Manual segmentation took 200
   times longer than automated segmentation (780 vs. 4 seconds). Mean
   choroid thickness at the foveal center was 263 +/- 24 mu m (manual) and
   259 +/- 23 mu m (automated), and this difference was not significant (p
   = 0.10). Regional segmentation errors across the foveal horizontal
   midline (+/- 15 degrees) were <= 9 mu m (median) except for nasal-most
   regions closest to the nasal peripapillary margin-15 degrees (19 mu m)
   and 12 degrees (16 mu m) from the foveal center. Repeatability of
   choroidal thickness measurements had similar repeatability between
   segmentation methods (manual LoA: +/- 15 mu m; automated LoA: +/- 14 mu
   m).
   Conclusions. Automated segmentation of SD-OCT data by graph theory and
   dynamic programming is a fast, accurate, and reliable method to
   delineate the choroid. This approach will facilitate longitudinal
   studies evaluating changes in choroid thickness in response to novel
   optical corrections and in ocular disease.}},

Abstract = {{Structural damage inspection after an earthquake is essential for safety
   assessment of the affected wood-frame buildings and for making
   knowledgeable decision regarding their repair, renovation, or
   replacement. We present a polarimetric radar system for sensing the
   concealed wood-frames damaged by earthquakes. This system employs an
   antenna array consisting of four linearly polarized Vivaldi antennas
   recording full-polarimetric radar echoes in an ultra-wideband ranging
   from 1 to 20 GHz. The detailed design of the system and the signal
   processing algorithms for high-resolution 3D imaging are introduced. We
   conducted a number of surveys on damaged wooden wall specimens in
   laboratory. The experiment results indicate that the high-frequency
   radar waves can penetrate the wooden walls. Deformations of wooden
   structures (about 2 cm displacement) inside the wall, as well as the
   concealed small metal nails (about 3 mm in diameter and less than 2 cm
   in length) and bolts can be clearly imaged. The shape and orientation of
   the wooden members have shown a great sensitivity to the radar
   polarization. It is concluded that radar polarimetry can provide much
   richer information on the condition of concealed building structures
   than the conventional single-polarization subsurface penetrating radar.}},

Abstract = {{Bioprocessing technology offers a potentially promising and more
   sustainable alternative to many traditional chemical process
   technologies; however to date this potential has largely not been
   realized. For large-scale bioprocessing to have larger penetration into
   larger volume chemical markets, new technologies need to both exploit
   the key advantages of biocatalysts over chemical catalysts, while
   addressing the key limitations of bioprocessing as compared to more
   traditional chemical process technology. The use of dynamic metabolic
   control strategies to engineer productive and robust stationary phase
   biocatalysts in combination with advanced two-stage fermentation has the
   potential to both increase process level metrics, including specific
   productivity, volumetric rates, titers and yields, while leveraging the
   unique ability of whole cell biocatalysts to perform multiple complex
   chemical conversions in a single unit operation.}},

Abstract = {{Dying cells release nucleic acids (NA) and NA-containing complexes that
   activate inflammatory pathways of immune cells. Sustained activation of
   these pathways contributes to chronic inflammation frequently
   encountered in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In this study,
   grafting of cationic polymers onto a nanofibrous mesh enabled local
   scavenging of negatively charged pro-inflammatory molecules in the
   extracellular space. Nucleic acid scavenging nanofibers (NASFs) formed
   from poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) conjugated with 1.8 kDa bPEI
   resulted in nanofibers of diameters 486 +/- 9 nm. NASFs inhibited the
   NF-kappa B response stimulated by the negatively charged agonists, CpG
   and poly(I:C), in Ramos-blue cells but not Pam3CSK4, a nonanionic
   agonist. Moreover, NASFs significantly impeded NF-kappa B activation in
   cells stimulated with damage associated molecular pattern molecules
   (DAMPs) released from doxorubicin killed cancer cells. In vivo
   application of NASFs to open wounds demonstrated nucleic acid scavenging
   in wounds of diabetic mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
   suggesting the in vivo efficacy of NASFs. This simple technique of
   generating NASF results in effective localized anti-inflammation in
   vitro and local nucleic acid scavenging in vivo.}},

Title = {{Climate, not conflict, explains extreme Middle East dust storm}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The recent dust storm in the Middle East (Sepember 2015) was publicized
   in the media as a sign of an impending `Dust Bowl.' Its severity,
   demonstrated by extreme aerosol optical depth in the atmosphere in the
   99th percentile compared to historical data, was attributed to the
   ongoing regional conflict. However, surface meteorological and remote
   sensing data, as well as regional climate model simulations, support an
   alternative hypothesis: the historically unprecedented aridity played a
   more prominent role, as evidenced by unusual climatic and meteorological
   conditions prior to and during the storm. Remotely sensed normalized
   difference vegetation index demonstrates that vegetation cover was high
   in 2015 relative to the prior drought and conflict periods, suggesting
   that agricultural activity was not diminished during that year, thus
   negating the media narrative. Instead, meteorological simulations using
   the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model show that the storm was
   associated with a cyclone and `Shamal' winds, typical for dust storm
   generation in this region, that were immediately followed by an unusual
   wind reversal at low levels that spread dust west to the Mediterranean
   Coast. These unusual meteorological conditions were aided by a
   significant reduction in the critical shear stress due to extreme dry
   and hot conditions, thereby enhancing dust availability for erosion
   during this storm. Concluding, unusual aridity, combined with unique
   synoptic weather patterns, enhanced dust emission and westward
   long-range transport across the region, thus generating the extreme
   storm.}},

Abstract = {{Power Doppler (PD) imaging is a widely used technique for flow
   detection. Despite the wide use of Doppler ultrasound, limitations exist
   in the ability of Doppler ultrasound to assess slow flow in the
   small-diameter vasculature, such as the maternal spiral arteries and
   fetal villous arteries of the placenta and focal liver lesions. The
   sensitivity of PD in small vessel detection is limited by the low signal
   produced by slow flow and the noise associated with small vessels. The
   noise sources include electronic noise, stationary or slowly moving
   tissue clutter, reverberation clutter, and off-axis scattering from
   tissue, among others. In order to provide more sensitive detection of
   slow flow in small diameter vessels, a coherent flow imaging technique,
   termed coherent flow PD (CFPD), is characterized and evaluated with
   simulation, flow phantom experiment studies, and an in vivo animal small
   vessel detection study. CFPD imaging was introduced as a technique to
   detect slow blood flow. It has been demonstrated to detect slow flow
   below the detection threshold of conventional PD imaging using identical
   pulse sequences and filter parameters. In this paper, we compare CFPD
   with PD in the detection of blood flow in small-diameter vessels. The
   results from the study suggest that CFPD is able to provide a
   7.5-12.5-dB increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over PD images
   for the same physiological conditions and is less susceptible to
   reverberation clutter and thermal noise. Due to the increase in SNR,
   CFPD is able to detect small vessels in high channel noise cases, for
   which PD was unable to generate enough contrast to observe the vessel.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The Nanopulse Lithotripter (NPL; Lithotech Medical,
   Israel) is a novel intracorporeal device that uses a nanosecond duration
   electrical discharge through a reusable flexible coaxial probe to
   endoscopically fragment urinary stones. This device was compared with a
   holmium laser lithotripsy (HoL) with regard to stone fragmentation
   efficiency (SFE) and its impact on flexible ureteroscope (URS)
   deflection and flow of irrigation.
   Methods: Using a custom bench model, a 6mm BegoStone cylindrical phantom
   (mixture 5: 2) was confined under 0.9\% saline atop sequential mesh
   sieves. The SFE of two NPL probe sizes (2.0F, 3.6F) and two HoL fibers
   (200, 365 mu m) was evaluated using concordant settings of 1 J and 5 Hz.
   URS deflection and irrigation flow with NPL probes in the working
   channel were tested in five new fourth generation flexible URS and
   compared with other adjunct endourologic instruments.
   Results: The 2.0F NPL showed improved SFE compared with the 200 lm laser
   (86 mg/min vs 52 mg/min, p = 0.014) as did the 3.6F NPL vs the 365 lm
   laser (173 mg/min vs 80 mg/min, p = 0.05). The NPL created more 1 to 2mm
   fragments; the laser created more dust. URS deflection reduced by 3.75
   degrees with the 2.0 NPL probe. URS irrigation flow reduced from 36.5 to
   6.3 mL/min with the 2.0F NPL probe.
   Conclusion: NPL shows improved SFE compared with HoL. Flow with the 2.0F
   probe is akin to a stone basket. NPL offers an effective alternative to
   HoL.}},

   class of all isotropic hyperelastic models. In this sense the presented
   development can be considered an important extension and complement to
   the stabilization approach proposed by the authors in previous work,
   which was instead focused on explicit time integration and simple
   neo-Hookean models for nearly-incompressible elasticity. With the goal
   of computational efficiency, we also present a two-step block
   Gauss-Seidel strategy for the time update of displacements, velocities
   and pressures. Specifically, a mixed system of equations for the
   velocity and pressure is updated implicitly in a first stage, and the
   displacements are updated explicitly in a second stage. The proposed
   mixed formulation is then embedded in Newton-type strategies for the
   nonlinear solution of the equations of motion. Various implicit time
   integration strategies are considered, and, particularly, we focus on
   high-frequency dissipation time integrators, which are preferable in
   transient mechanics applications. An extensive set of numerical
   computations with linear tetrahedral elements is presented to
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Anaerobic Digestion Pasteurization Latrine (ADPL) is a
   self-contained and energy neutral on-site sanitation system using
   anaerobic digestion of fecal sludge to generate biogas and then uses the
   biogas to pasteurize the digester effluent at 65-75 degrees C to produce
   a safe effluent that can be reused locally as a fertilizer. Two ADPL
   systems were installed on residential plots with 17 and 35 residents in
   a peri-urban area outside of Eldoret, Kenya. Each system comprised three
   toilets built above a floating dome digester and one heat pasteurization
   system to sanitize the digested effluent. ADPLs are simple systems, with
   no moving parts and relying on gravity-induced flows. Adoption at the
   two sites was successful, and residents reported that the systems had
   little to no odor or flies. ADPLs were monitored for biogas production
   and temperatures in the pasteurization system. ADPLs serving 17 and 35
   residents produced on average 16 and 11 L-biogas/person/day (maximum of
   20 and 15 L-biogas/p/d), respectively. The temperature in the
   sterilization system was greater than 65 degrees C on 58\% and 87\% of
   sampling days during the most stable period of operation. Treated
   effluent was analyzed periodically for chemical oxygen demand (COD),
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), pH, and
   fecal coliform (FC). On average, the effluent at the two locations
   contained 4,540 and 6,450mg COD/L (an 85\% or 89\% reduction of the
   estimated input), 2,050 and 3,970 mg BOD/L, and 2,420 and 4,760mg NH3-N,
   respectively, and greater than 5 log reductions of FC (nondetectable) in
   the sterilization tank. Results from this field study show that
   anaerobic digestion of minimally diluted fecal sludge can provide enough
   energy to pasteurize digester effluent and that the ADPL may be a
   suitable option for on-site fecal sludge treatment.}},

Abstract = {{A novel uniplanar CPW-fed tri-band stub-loaded slot antenna is proposed
   for wireless local area network (WLAN) and worldwide interoperability
   for microwave access (WiMAX) applications. Dual resonant modes were
   effectively excited in the upper band by using two identical pairs of
   slot stubs and parasitic slots symmetrically along the arms of a
   traditional CPW-fed slot dipole, achieving a much wider bandwidth. The
   middle band was realized by the fundamental mode of the slot dipole. To
   obtain the lower band, two identical inverted-L-shaped open-ended slots
   were symmetrically etched in the ground plane. A prototype was
   fabricated and measured, showing that tri-band operation with 10-dB
   return loss bandwidths of 150 MHz from 2.375 to 2.525 GHz, 725 MHz from
   3.075 to 3.8 GHz, and 1.9 GHz from 5.0 to 6.9 GHz has been achieved.
   Details of the antenna design as well as the measured and simulated

   Keratoplasty: An Ex Vivo Microscope-Integrated OCT Study}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:To examine big-bubble (BB) formation success rates in deep
   anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) at various corneal depths using
   real-time guidance from swept-source, microscope-integrated optical
   coherence tomography (SS-MIOCT).Methods:The DALK procedure was performed
   ex vivo with 34 human donor corneoscleral buttons on pressurized
   artificial anterior chambers using the BB technique employed by Anwar
   and Teichmann. We inserted a needle under controlled ex vivo conditions
   to corneal depths ranging from 40\% to 90\% using real-time guidance
   from SS-MIOCT and injected air. BB success was then determined for each
   injection.Results:The average needle depth for successful full BB
   formation was 79.9\% 3.0\% compared with 66.9\% +/- 2.6\% for partial BB
   formation and 49.9\% +/- 3.4\% for no BB formation (P < 0.0001).
   Expressed as stroma below the needle tip, this corresponded to 123.9 +/-
   20.0 m for successful full BB formation compared with 233.7 +/- 23.8 m
   for partial BB formation and 316.7 +/- 17.3 m for no BB formation (P <
   0.0001). All other variables tested (sex, race, age, endothelial cell
   density, air injected, needle angle, and central corneal thickness) did
   not significantly affect BB formation success rates.Conclusions:BB
   formation in DALK is more successful if needle insertion and air
   injection occur at deeper corneal depth. However, 90\% corneal depth was
   not necessary in this ex vivo model of DALK. SS-MIOCT can be used to
   accurately guide the needle in real time.}},

Volume = {{285}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve (PN) is a
   potential therapy for bladder dysfunction, but voiding efficiency (VE)
   produced by PN stimulation appears limited to 60-70\%. We conducted
   experiments in rats and cats to investigate the hypothesis that
   introduction of artificial phasic bursting activity of the external
   urethral sphincter (EUS) would enhance VE under conditions where such
   activity was absent.
   Materials and methods: Cystometry experiments were conducted in 17
   urethane anesthetized female Sprague-Dawley rats and 4 alpha-chloralose
   anesthetized male cats. The effects of phasic stimulation of the
   pudendal motor branch on VE were quantified in intact conditions,
   following bilateral transection of the motor branch of the PN, and
   following subsequent bilateral transection of the sensory branch of the
   PN.
   Results: Artificial phasic bursting activity in the EUS generated by
   electrical stimulation of the motor branch of the PN increased VE in
   both rats and cats. Subsequent transection of the sensory branch of the
   PN abolished the increased VE elicited by phasic stimulation in both
   rats and cats.
   Conclusions: Artificial phasic EUS bursting restored efficient voiding
   in rats. Introduction of artificial phasic bursting in cats, which
   normally exhibit EUS relaxation while voiding, was also effective in
   promoting efficient voiding. In both species phasic EUS activity
   increased voiding efficiency via activation of pudendal sensory
   pathways. These results provide further insight into the function of
   phasic EUS activity in efficient voiding and highlight a novel approach
   to increase VE generated by pudendal afferent nerve stimulation. (C)

Abstract = {{This study provides an analytical solution for time-dependent potentials

   formulas for potentials in a fiber stimulated by a transverse electric
   field. The comparison of the 3D analytical solution with the 1D cable
   model shows that the cable model approximates transmembrane potential
   with the error below 5 \% when the distance between the electrode and
   the fiber is 0.2-4 mm and when the stimulus is longer than 3.3 ms. For
   stimuli between 0.43 and 3.3 ms, the range of fiber-electrode distances

Abstract = {{Chemical cleaning of membranes may be limited by the tolerance of some
   polymeric membranes to chlorine. In this work we show that modification
   of a polyvinyl pyrrolidone-polysulfone (PVP-PSF) membrane with
   carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) leads to greater chlorine tolerance
   of the membrane along with smoothing the surface roughness and improving
   some membrane properties including permeability, hydrophilicity and
   antifouling ability. In comparison with PVP-PSF membrane, incorporating
   carboxylated CNTs reduced the release of organic matter from the
   membrane and caused less decrease in hydrophilicity, permeability and
   BSA rejection. After chlorine treatment of a conventional PVP-PSF
   membrane, an infrared absorbance peak around 1670 cm(-1), representing
   the vibration of the amide bond in the PVP, decreased significantly and
   two smaller peaks at around 1725 and 1775 cm(-1) were observed. The
   percentage of C-Cl (2p) in the PVP-PSF membrane was about 2.8 times
   greater than that of the carboxylated CNT-composite PVP-PSF
   (CNT-PVP-PSF) membrane after chlorine exposure, suggesting greater
   chlorine tolerance of CNT-PVP-PSF membrane. In comparison with PVP-PSF
   membrane, the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts during
   chlorination of organic matter released from CNT-PVP-PSF membrane was
   much lower. The improvement of tolerance to chlorine is attributed to
   stabilization of the polymer through hydrogen bonding between polymer
   and carboxylated CNTs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A sparse and uniform multiple-input-multiple-output array is generally
   utilized in through-wall radar to implement real-time imaging of moving
   targets. However, the array sparsity with the interelement spacing much
   bigger than half a wavelength gives rise to grating lobe interference
   smearing the images. In order to enhance the signal-to-interference
   ratio, this letter introduces the sign coherence factor (SCF) to weigh
   through-wall images to suppress the grating lobes. The SCF is first
   proposed in medical ultrasound imaging and directly reflects the
   coherence of sign bits of all the transmit-receive channels in each
   pixel. Since the SCF calculated only by the sign bits, it has the
   smallest amount of computations compared with two other weighing
   factors, namely, the coherence factor (CF) and the phase coherence
   factor (PCF), which have been applied to through-wall imaging already.
   Moreover, the SCF has comparable performance in suppressing grating
   lobes with the PCF, much better than the CF. These two advantages make
   the SCF the most suitable for real-time imaging of moving targets. The
   experimental results with a two-transmitting eight-receiving
   stepped-frequency continuous-wave through-wall radar verifies the
   excellent performance of the SCF.}},

Title = {{Classification and Reconstruction of High-Dimensional Signals From

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper offers a characterization of fundamental limits on the
   classification and reconstruction of high-dimensional signals from
   low-dimensional features, in the presence of side information. We
   consider a scenario where a decoder has access both to linear features
   of the signal of interest and to linear features of the side information
   signal; while the side information may be in a compressed form, the
   objective is recovery or classification of the primary signal, not the
   side information. The signal of interest and the side information are
   each assumed to have (distinct) latent discrete labels; conditioned on
   these two labels, the signal of interest and side information are drawn
   from a multivariate Gaussian distribution that correlates the two. With
   joint probabilities on the latent labels, the overall signal-(side
   information) representation is defined by a Gaussian mixture model. By
   considering bounds to the misclassification probability associated with
   the recovery of the underlying signal label, and bounds to the
   reconstruction error associated with the recovery of the signal of
   interest itself, we then provide sharp sufficient and/or necessary
   conditions for these quantities to approach zero when the covariance
   matrices of the Gaussians are nearly low rank. These conditions, which
   are reminiscent of the well-known Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv conditions,
   are the function of the number of linear features extracted from signal
   of interest, the number of linear features extracted from the side
   information signal, and the geometry of these signals and their
   interplay. Moreover, on assuming that the signal of interest and the
   side information obey such an approximately low-rank model, we derive
   the expansions of the reconstruction error as a function of the
   deviation from an exactly low-rank model; such expansions also allow the
   identification of operational regimes, where the impact of side
   information on signal reconstruction is most relevant. Our framework,
   which offers a principled mechanism to integrate side information in
   high-dimensional data problems, is also tested in the context of imaging
   applications. In particular, we report state-of-the-art results in
   compressive hyperspectral imaging applications, where the accompanying
   side information is a conventional digital photograph.}},

Title = {{Temporal pattern of stimulation modulates reflex bladder activation by

Abstract = {{AimsReflex bladder activation and inhibition by electrical stimulation
   of pudendal nerve (PN) afferents is a promising approach to restore
   control of bladder function in persons with lower urinary tract
   dysfunction caused by disease or injury. The objective of this work was
   to determine whether bladder activation evoked by pudendal afferent
   stimulation was dependent on the temporal pattern of stimulation, and
   whether specific temporal patterns of stimulation produced larger
   bladder contractions than constant frequency stimulation.
   MethodsThe mean and maximum contraction pressures evoked by different
   temporal patterns of stimulation of the dorsal genital branch of the
   pudendal nerve were measured under isovolumetric conditions in
   -chloralose anesthetized cats. A computational model of the spinal
   neural network mediating the pudendo-vesical reflex was used to
   understand the mechanisms of different bladder responses to patterned
   stimulation.
   ResultsThe pattern of stimulation significantly affected the magnitude
   of evoked bladder contractions; several temporal patterns were as
   effective as regular stimulation, but no pattern evoked larger bladder
   contractions. Random patterns and patterns with pauses, burst-like
   activity, or high frequency components evoked significantly smaller
   bladder contractions, supporting the use of regular frequency
   stimulation in the development of neural prosthetic approaches for
   bladder control.
   ConclusionsThese results reveal that the bladder response to pudendal
   afferent stimulation is dependent on the pattern, as well as the
   frequency, of stimulation. The computational model revealed that the
   effects of patterned pudendal afferent stimulation were determined by
   the dynamic properties of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the
   lumbosacral spinal cord. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35:882-887, 2016. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{The thermodynamic properties of the Ta-Ti binary system below 900
   degrees C are not well known. In particular, the location and shape of
   the solvus between the phase separation region at low temperatures and
   the solid solution at high temperatures are not well defined. In this
   study, we present a thermodynamic description for this system based on
   ab-initio calculations. The formation enthalpies of bcc and hcp solid
   solutions are estimated using the special quasi-random structures
   methodology and their vibrational free energy calculated by the
   quasi-harmonic Debye model. The excess energies of the solid solutions
   are fitted to a sub-subregular model and used to define the phase
   diagram of the binary system. It is shown that the current empirical
   assessment of the energies of the pure elements leads to a phase diagram
   that strongly departs from the known experimental features at low
   temperatures. An ab-initio guided correction of these energies is
   necessary to obtain correctly the low temperature phase separation and
   the high temperature solid solution. The predicted solvus of the phase
   diagram is qualitatively different from those previously reported for
   the Ta-Ti system. It exhibits a miscibility gap between two distinct bcc
   phases, similar to those that exist in the closely related binary
   systems Ta-Zr, Ta-Hf, Cr-Ti, Mo-Ti, V-Ti, and Ti-W. (C) 2016 Acta

   fasteners and spinal intervertebral implants, polyetheretherketone
   (PEEK) often suffers from poor osseointegration. Introducing porosity
   can overcome this limitation by encouraging bone ingrowth; however, the
   corresponding decrease in implant strength can potentially reduce the
   implant's ability to bear physiologic loads. We have previously shown,
   using a single pore size, that limiting porosity to the surface of PEEK
   implants preserves strength while supporting in vivo osseointegration.
   However, additional work is needed to investigate the effect of pore
   size on both the mechanical properties and cellular response to PEEK.
   (1) Can surface porous PEEK (PEEK-SP) microstructure be reliably
   controlled? (2) What is the effect of pore size on the mechanical
   properties of PEEK-SP? (3) Do surface porosity and pore size influence
   the cellular response to PEEK?
   PEEK-SP was created by extruding PEEK through NaCl crystals of three
   controlled ranges: 200 to 312, 312 to 425, and 425 to 508 A mu m.
   Micro-CT was used to characterize the microstructure of PEEK-SP.
   Tensile, fatigue, and interfacial shear tests were performed to compare
   the mechanical properties of PEEK-SP with injection-molded PEEK
   (PEEK-IM). The cellular response to PEEK-SP, assessed by proliferation,
   alkaline phosphatase activity, vascular endothelial growth factor
   production, and calcium content of osteoblast, mesenchymal stem cell,
   and preosteoblast (MC3T3-E1) cultures, was compared with that of
   machined smooth PEEK and Ti6Al4V.
   Micro-CT analysis showed that PEEK-SP layers possessed pores that were
   284 +/- A 35 A mu m, 341 +/- A 49 A mu m, and 416 +/- A 54 A mu m for
   each pore size group. Porosity and pore layer depth ranged from 61\% to
   69\% and 303 to 391 A mu m, respectively. Mechanical testing revealed
   tensile strengths > 67 MPa and interfacial shear strengths > 20 MPa for
   all three pore size groups. All PEEK-SP groups exhibited > 50\% decrease
   in ductility compared with PEEK-IM and demonstrated fatigue strength >
   38 MPa at one million cycles. All PEEK-SP groups also supported greater
   proliferation and cell-mediated mineralization compared with smooth PEEK
   and Ti6Al4V.
   The PEEK-SP formulations evaluated in this study maintained favorable
   mechanical properties that merit further investigation into their use in
   load-bearing orthopaedic applications and supported greater in vitro
   osteogenic differentiation compared with smooth PEEK and Ti6Al4V. These
   results are independent of pore sizes ranging 200 A mu m to 508 A mu m.
   PEEK-SP may provide enhanced osseointegration compared with current
   implants while maintaining the structural integrity to be considered for
   several load-bearing orthopaedic applications such as spinal fusion or
   soft tissue repair.}},

Abstract = {{We present a set of stable and efficient formulas to compute the
   electromagnetic radiation of arbitrary magnetic dipoles in a
   cylindrically layered anisotropic medium. This set of formulas is
   derived on the basis of the generalized reflection and transmission
   coefficients. By expressing our new formulas by the ratios of Bessel or
   Hankel functions, rather than directly by these special functions, the
   notorious overflow problem for numerical computation is successfully
   obviated. Our formulas can be easily implemented for any number of
   layers, as well as for arbitrary locations and orientations of the
   transmitter and the receiver. Numerical experiments have demonstrated
   their correctness and stability. They are then utilized to investigate
   the influence of the eccentricity distance, the eccentricity angle, and
   the formation anisotropy on the response of a multicomponent induction
   logging tool.}},

Abstract = {{Finding an informative subset of a large collection of data points or
   models is at the center of many problems in computer vision, recommender
   systems, bio/health informatics as well as image and natural language
   processing. Given pairwise dissimilarities between the elements of a
   `source set' and a `target set,' we consider the problem of finding a
   subset of the source set, called representatives or exemplars, that can
   efficiently describe the target set. We formulate the problem as a
   row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem. Since the proposed
   formulation is, in general, NP-hard, we consider a convex relaxation.
   The solution of our optimization finds representatives and the
   assignment of each element of the target set to each representative,
   hence, obtaining a clustering. We analyze the solution of our proposed
   optimization as a function of the regularization parameter. We show that
   when the two sets jointly partition into multiple groups, our algorithm
   finds representatives from all groups and reveals clustering of the
   sets. In addition, we show that the proposed framework can effectively
   deal with outliers. Our algorithm works with arbitrary dissimilarities,
   which can be asymmetric or violate the triangle inequality. To
   efficiently implement our algorithm, we consider an Alternating
   Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which results in
   quadratic complexity in the problem size. We show that the ADMM
   implementation allows to parallelize the algorithm, hence further
   reducing the computational time. Finally, by experiments on real-world
   datasets, we show that our proposed algorithm improves the state of the
   art on the two problems of scene categorization using representative
   images and time-series modeling and segmentation using representative
   models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a quantitative approach based on identifying
   hand trajectory dissimilarities through the use of a multidimensional
   scaling (MDS) analysis. A high-rate motion capture system is used to
   gather three-dimensional (3D) trajectory data of healthy and
   stroke-impacted hemiparetic subjects. The mutual dissimilarity between
   any two trajectories is measured by the area between them. This area is
   used as a dissimilarity variable to create an MDS map. The map reveals a
   structure for measuring the difference and variability of individual
   trajectories and their groups. The results suggest that the recovery of
   hemiparetic subjects can be quantified by comparing the difference and
   variability of their individual MDS map points to the points from the
   cluster of healthy subject trajectories. Within the MDS map, we can
   identify fully recovered patients, those who are only functionally
   recovered, and those who are either in an early phase of, or are
   nonresponsive to the therapy.}},

Abstract = {{As the only striated muscle tissues in the body, skeletal and cardiac
   muscle share numerous structural and functional characteristics, while
   exhibiting vastly different size and regenerative potential. Healthy
   skeletal muscle harbors a robust regenerative response that becomes
   inadequate after large muscle loss or in degenerative pathologies and
   aging. In contrast, the mammalian heart loses its regenerative capacity
   shortly after birth, leaving it susceptible to permanent damage by acute
   injury or chronic disease. In this review, we compare and contrast the
   physiology and regenerative potential of native skeletal and cardiac
   muscles, mechanisms underlying striated muscle dysfunction, and
   bioengineering strategies to treat muscle disorders. We focus on
   different sources for cellular therapy, biomaterials to augment the
   endogenous regenerative response, and progress in engineering and
   application of mature striated muscle tissues in vitro and in vivo.
   Finally, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in translating
   muscle bioengineering strategies to clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Magn,li phase Ti5O9 ceramics with 200-nm grain-size were fabricated by
   hot-pressing nanopowders of titanium and anatase TiO2 at 1223 K. The

   we propose a modified Heikes-Chaikin-Beni model, based on a canonical
   ensemble of closely spaced titanium t (2g) levels, to account for the
   temperature dependency of the Seebeck coefficient. Modeling of the
   thermal conductivity data reveals that the phonon contribution remains

Abstract = {{The performance of multiimage alignment, bringing different images into
   one coordinate system, is critical in many applications with varied
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. A great amount of effort is
   being invested into developing methods to solve this problem. Several
   important questions thus arise, including: Which are the fundamental
   limits in multiimage alignment performance? Does having access to more
   images improve the alignment? Theoretical bounds provide a fundamental
   benchmark to compare methods and can help establish whether improvements
   can be made. In this work, we tackle the problem of finding the
   performance limits in image registration when multiple shifted and noisy
   observations are available. We derive and analyze the Cramer-Rao and
   Ziv-Zakai lower bounds under different statistical models for the
   underlying image. We show the existence of different behavior zones
   depending on the difficulty level of the problem, given by the SNR
   conditions of the input images. The analysis we present here brings
   further insight into the fundamental limitations of the multiimage
   alignment problem.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been increasingly commercialized and
   their release into the environment is imminent. Toxicity of AgNP has
   been studied with a wide spectrum of organisms, yet the mechanism of
   toxicity remains largely unknown. This study systematically compared
   toxicity of 10 AgNPs of different particle diameters and coatings to
   Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) larvae to understand how
   characteristics of AgNP relate to toxicity. Dissolution of AgNPs was
   largely dependent on particle size, but their aggregation behavior and
   toxicity were more dependent on coating materials. 96h lethal
   concentration 50\% (LC50) values correlated with AgNP aggregate size
   rather than size of individual nanoparticles. Of the AgNPs studied, the
   dissolved Ag concentration in the test suspensions did not account for
   all of the observed toxicity, indicating the role of NP-specific
   characteristics in resultant toxicity. Exposure to AgNP led to decrease
   of sodium concentration in the tissue and increased expression of
   Na+/K(+)ATPase. Gene expression patterns also suggested that toxicity
   was related to disruption of sodium regulation and not to oxidative
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{We proposed and demonstrated a new metamaterial architecture capable of
   high speed modulation of free-space space thermal infrared radiation
   using graphene. Our design completely eliminates channel resistance,
   thereby maximizing the electrostatic modulation speed, while at the same
   time effectively modulating infrared radiation. Experiment results
   verify that our device with area of 100 x 120 mu m(2) can achieve a
   modulation speed as high as 2.6 GHz. We further highlight the utility of
   our graphene metamaterial modulator by reconstructing a fast infrared
   signal using an equivalent time sampling technique. The graphene
   metamaterial modulator demonstrated here is not only limited to the
   thermal infrared, but may be scaled to longer infrared and terahertz
   wavelengths. Our work provides a path forward for realization of
   frequency selective and all-electronic high speed devices for infrared
   applications. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{240}},
Pages = {{151-164}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes is a rapidly growing disease that poses a significant
   burden to the United States healthcare system. Despite the many
   available treatments for the disease, close to half of diagnosed type 2
   diabetes cases are not properly managed, largely due to inadequate
   patient adherence to prescribed treatment regimens. Methods for
   improving delivery - and thereby easing administration - of type 2 drugs
   have the potential to greatly improve patient health. This review
   focuses on two peptide drugs - insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1
   (GLP-1) - for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Peptide drugs offer the
   benefits of high potency and specificity but pose a significant delivery
   challenge due to their inherent instability and short half-life. The
   development of insulin and GLP-1 analogs highlights the broad spectrum
   of drug delivery strategies that have been used to solve these problems.
   Numerous structural modifications and formulations have been introduced
   to optimize absorption, residence time, stability, route of delivery and
   frequency of administration. Continual improvements in delivery methods
   for insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonists are paving the way towards
   better patient compliance and improved disease management, and thereby
   enhanced patient quality of life. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Accurate ab initio tight-binding Hamiltonians: Effective tools for
   electronic transport and optical spectroscopy from first principles}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{The calculations of electronic transport coefficients and optical
   properties require a very dense interpolation of the electronic band
   structure in reciprocal space that is computationally expensive and may
   have issues with band crossing and degeneracies. Capitalizing on a
   recently developed pseudoatomic orbital projection technique, we exploit
   the exact tight-binding representation of the first-principles
   electronic structure for the purposes of (i) providing an efficient
   strategy to explore the full band structure E-n (k), (ii) computing the
   momentum operator differentiating directly the Hamiltonian, and (iii)
   calculating the imaginary part of the dielectric function. This enables
   us to determine the Boltzmann transport coefficients and the optical
   properties within the independent particle approximation. In addition,
   the local nature of the tight-binding representation facilitates the
   calculation of the ballistic transport within the Landauer theory for
   systems with hundreds of atoms. In order to validate our approach we
   study the multivalley band structure of CoSb3 and a large core-shell
   nanowire using the ACBN0 functional. In CoSb3 we point the many band
   minima contributing to the electronic transport that enhance the
   thermoelectric properties; for the core-shell nanowire we identify
   possible mechanisms for photo-current generation and justify the
   presence of protected transport channels in the wire.}},

Title = {{Mechanism of Fibronectin Binding to Human Trabecular Meshwork Exosomes
   and Its Modulation by Dexamethasone}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Exosomes are emerging as important mediators of cell-matrix interactions
   by means of specific adhesion proteins. Changes in the tissue-specific
   exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby
   extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular
   hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular
   meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the
   trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix
   interactions at cellular structures called ``invadosomes{''}. Trabecular
   meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and
   maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we
   observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with
   dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of
   fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that
   exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent
   with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in
   the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way,
   dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant
   reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not
   detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant
   dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on
   exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our
   findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced
   alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for
   the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients.}},

Abstract = {{Intriguing lattice dynamics have been predicted for aperiodic crystals
   that contain incommensurate substructures. Here we report inelastic
   neutron scattering measurements of phonon and magnon dispersions in
   Sr14Cu24O41, which contains incommensurate one-dimensional (1D) chain
   and two-dimensional (2D) ladder substructures. Two distinct
   pseudoacoustic phonon modes, corresponding to the sliding motion of one
   sublattice against the other, are observed for atomic motions polarized
   along the incommensurate axis. In the long wavelength limit, it is found
   that the sliding mode shows a remarkably small energy gap of 1.7-1.9
   meV, indicating very weak interactions between the two incommensurate
   sublattices. The measurements also reveal a gapped and steep linear
   magnon dispersion of the ladder sublattice. The high group velocity of
   this magnon branch and weak coupling with acoustic and pseudoacoustic
   phonons can explain the large magnon thermal conductivity in Sr14Cu24O41
   crystals. In addition, the magnon specific heat is determined from the
   measured total specific heat and phonon density of states and exhibits a
   Schottky anomaly due to gapped magnon modes of the spin chains. These
   findings offer new insights into the phonon and magnon dynamics and
   thermal transport properties of incommensurate magnetic crystals that
   contain low-dimensional substructures.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is a microscopic interfacial characterization of a
   series of lung surfactant materials performed with the micropipette
   technique. The advantages of this technique include the measurement of
   equilibrium and dynamic surface tensions while acquiring structural and
   dynamic information at microscopic air-water interfaces in real time and
   upon compression. Here, we characterized a series of animal-derived and
   synthetic lung surfactant formulations, including native surfactant
   obtained from porcine lungs (NS); the commercial Curosurf, Infasurf, and
   Survanta; and a synthetic Super Mini-B (SMB)-containing formulation. It
   was observed that the presence of the natural hydrophobic proteins and,
   more strikingly, the peptide SMB, promoted vesicle condensation as thick
   membrane stacks beneath the interface. Only in the presence of SMB,
   these stacks underwent spontaneous structural transformations,
   consisting of the nucleation and growth of microtubes and in some cases
   their subsequent coiling into helices. The dimensions of these tubes
   (2-15 mu m diameter) and their linear (2-3 mu m/s) and volumetric growth
   rates (20-30 mu m(3)/s) were quantified, and no specific effects were
   found on them for increasing SMB concentrations from 0.1 to 4\%.
   Nevertheless, a direct correlation between the number of tubes and SMB
   contents was found, suggesting that SMB molecules are the promoters of
   tube nucleation in these membranes. A detailed analysis of the tube
   formation process was performed following previous models for the growth
   of myelin figures, proposing a combined mechanism between
   dehydration-rehydration of the lipid bilayers and induction of
   mechanical defects by SMB that would act as nucleation sites for the
   tubes. The formation of tubes was also observed in Infasurf, and in NS
   only after subsequent expansion and compression but neither in the other
   clinical surfactants nor in protein-free preparations. Finally, the
   connection between this data and the observations from the lung
   surfactant literature concerning the widely reported near-zero surface
   tension for lung surfactant films and intact alveolar surfaces is also
   discussed.}},

Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{The ability to directly enhance electrical excitability of human cells
   is hampered by the lack of methods to efficiently overexpress large
   mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). Here we describe the use
   of small prokaryotic sodium channels (BacNa(v)) to create de novo
   excitable human tissues and augment impaired action potential conduction
   in vitro. Lentiviral co-expression of specific BacNa(v) orthologues, an
   inward-rectifying potassium channel, and connexin-43 in primary human
   fibroblasts from the heart, skin or brain yields actively conducting
   cells with customizable electrophysiological phenotypes. Engineered
   fibroblasts ('E-Fibs') retain stable functional properties following
   extensive subculture or differentiation into myofibroblasts and rescue
   conduction slowing in an in vitro model of cardiac interstitial
   fibrosis. Co-expression of engineered BacNa(v) with endogenous mammalian
   VGSCs enhances action potential conduction and prevents conduction
   failure during depolarization by elevated extracellular K+, decoupling

Title = {{Ultrathin, transferred layers of thermally grown silicon dioxide as

Abstract = {{Materials that can serve as long-lived barriers to biofluids are
   essential to the development of any type of chronic electronic implant.
   Devices such as cardiac pacemakers and cochlear implants use bulk metal
   or ceramic packages as hermetic enclosures for the electronics. Emerging
   classes of flexible, biointegrated electronic systems demand similar
   levels of isolation from biofluids but with thin, compliant films that
   can simultaneously serve as biointerfaces for sensing and/or actuation
   while in contact with the soft, curved, and moving surfaces of target
   organs. This paper introduces a solution to this materials challenge
   that combines (i) ultrathin, pristine layers of silicon dioxide (SiO2)
   thermally grown on device-grade siliconwafers, and (ii) processing
   schemes that allow integration of these materials onto flexible
   electronic platforms. Accelerated lifetime tests suggest robust barrier
   characteristics on timescales that approach 70 y, in layers that are
   sufficiently thin (less than 1 mu m) to avoid significant compromises in
   mechanical flexibility or in electrical interface fidelity. Detailed
   studies of temperature-and thickness-dependent electrical and physical
   properties reveal the key characteristics. Molecular simulations
   highlight essential aspects of the chemistry that governs interactions
   between the SiO2 and surrounding water. Examples of use with passive and
   active components in high-performance flexible electronic devices
   suggest broad utility in advanced chronic implants.}},

Title = {{Implementing an accurate and rapid sparse sampling approach for low-dose
   atomic resolution STEM imaging}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{While aberration correction for scanning transmission electron
   microscopes (STEMs) dramatically increased the spatial resolution
   obtainable in the images of materials that are stable under the electron
   beam, the practical resolution of many STEM images is now limited by the
   sample stability rather than the microscope. To extract physical
   information from the images of beam sensitive materials, it is becoming
   clear that there is a critical dose/dose-rate below which the images can
   be interpreted as representative of the pristine material, while above
   it the observation is dominated by beam effects. Here, we describe an
   experimental approach for sparse sampling in the STEM and in-painting
   image reconstruction in order to reduce the electron dose/dose-rate to
   the sample during imaging. By characterizing the induction limited
   rise-time and hysteresis in the scan coils, we show that a sparse
   line-hopping approach to scan randomization can be implemented that
   optimizes both the speed of the scan and the amount of the sample that
   needs to be illuminated by the beam. The dose and acquisition time for
   the sparse sampling is shown to be effectively decreased by at least a
   factor of 5 x relative to conventional acquisition, permitting imaging
   of beam sensitive materials to be obtained without changing the
   microscope operating parameters. The use of sparse line-hopping scan to
   acquire STEM images is demonstrated with atomic resolution aberration
   corrected the Z-contrast images of CaCO3, a material that is
   traditionally difficult to image by TEM/STEM because of dosage issues.

Abstract = {{Up to 80\% of injuries sustained by U.S. soldiers in Operation Enduring
   Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom were the result of blast exposure
   from improvised explosive devices. Some soldiers experience multiple
   blasts while on duty, and it has been suggested that symptoms of
   repetitive blast are similar to those that follow multiple non-blast
   concussions, such as sport-related concussion. Despite the interest in
   the effects of repetitive blast exposure, it remains unknown whether an
   initial blast renders the brain more vulnerable to subsequent exposure,
   resulting in a synergistic injury response. To investigate the effect of
   multiple primary blasts on the brain, organotypic hippocampal slice
   cultures were exposed to single or repetitive (two or three total)
   primary blasts of varying intensities. Long-term potentiation was
   significantly reduced following two Level 2 (92.7kPa, 1.4msec,
   38.5kPa<bold>msec</bold>) blasts delivered 24h apart without altering
   basal evoked response. This deficit persisted when the interval between
   injuries was increased to 72h but not when the interval was extended to
   144h. The repeated blast exposure with a 24h interval increased
   microglia staining and activation significantly but did not
   significantly increase cell death or damage axons, dendrites, or
   principal cell layers. Lack of overt structural damage and change in
   basal stimulated neuron response suggest that injury from repetitive
   primary blast exposure may specifically affect long-term potentiation.
   Our studies suggest repetitive primary blasts can exacerbate injury
   dependent on the injury severity and interval between exposures.}},

Title = {{Analytical modeling of printed metasurface cavities for computational
   imaging}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{We derive simple analytical expressions to model the electromagnetic
   response of an electrically large printed cavity. The analytical model
   is then used to develop printed cavities for microwave imaging purposes.
   The proposed cavity is excited by a cylindrical source and has
   boundaries formed by subwavelength metallic cylinders (vias) placed at
   subwavelength distances apart. Given their small size, the electric
   currents induced on the vias are assumed to have no angular dependence.
   Applying this approximation simplifies the electromagnetic problem to a
   matrix equation which can be solved to directly compute the electric
   current induced on each via. Once the induced currents are known, the
   electromagnetic field inside the cavity can be computed for every
   location. We verify the analytical model by comparing its prediction to
   full-wave simulations. To utilize this cavity in imaging settings, we
   perforate one side of the printed cavity with radiative slots such that
   they act as the physical layer of a computational imaging system. An
   analytical approximation for the slots is also developed, enabling us to
   obtain estimates of the cavity performance in imaging scenarios. This
   ability allows us to make informed decisions on the design of the
   printed metasurface cavity. The utility of the proposed model is further
   highlighted by demonstrating high-quality experimental imaging;
   performance metrics, which are consistent between theory and experiment,
   are also estimated. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Acoustic Holographic Rendering with Two-dimensional Metamaterial-based

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Acoustic holographic rendering in complete analogy with optical
   holography are useful for various applications, ranging from multi-focal
   lensing, multiplexed sensing and synthesizing three-dimensional complex
   sound fields. Conventional approaches rely on a large number of active
   transducers and phase shifting circuits. In this paper we show that by
   using passive metamaterials as subwavelength pixels, holographic
   rendering can be achieved without cumbersome circuitry and with only a
   single transducer, thus significantly reducing system complexity. Such
   metamaterial-based holograms can serve as versatile platforms for
   various advanced acoustic wave manipulation and signal modulation,
   leading to new possibilities in acoustic sensing, energy deposition and
   medical diagnostic imaging.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{3903-3907}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Synthesis of cubic-phase AgBi2I7 iodobismuthate thin films and
   fabrication of air-stable Pb-free solar cells using the AgBi2I7 absorber
   have recently been reported. On the basis of X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   analysis and nominal composition, it was suggested that the synthesized
   films have a cubic ThZr2H7 crystal structure with AgBi2I7 stoichiometry.
   Through careful examination of the proposed structure and computational
   evaluation of the phase stability and bandgap, we find that the reported
   ``AgBi2I7{''} films cannot be forming with the ThZr2H7-type structure,
   but rather more likely adopt an Ag-deficient AgBiI4 type. Both the
   experimental X-ray diffraction pattern and bandgap can be better
   explained by the AgBiI4 structure. Additionally, the proposed AgBiI4
   structure, with octahedral bismuth coordination, removes unphysically
   short Bi-I bonding within the {[}BiI8] hexahedra of the ThZr2I7 model.
   Our results provide critical insights for assessing the photovoltaic
   properties of AgBi2I7 iodobismuthate materials.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{12-20}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Gels are a drug delivery platform that is being evaluated for
   application of active pharmaceutical ingredients, termed microbicides,
   that act topically against vaginal and rectal mucosal infection by
   sexually transmitted HIV. Despite success in one Phase IIb trial of a
   vaginal gel delivering tenofovir, problems of user adherence to designed
   gel application scheduling have compromised results in two other trials.
   The microbicides field is responding to this dilemma by expanding
   behavioral analysis of the determinants of adherence while
   simultaneously improving the pharmacological, biochemical, and
   biophysical analyses of the determinants of microbicide drug delivery.
   The intent is to combine results of these two complementary perspectives
   on microbicide performance and epidemiological success to create an
   improved product design paradigm. Central to both user sensory
   perceptions and preferences, key factors that underlie adherence, and to
   vaginal gel mucosal drug delivery, that underlies anti-HIV efficacy, are
   gel properties (e.g. rheology) and volume. The specific engineering
   problem to be solved here is to develop a model for how gel rheology and
   volume, interacting with loaded drug concentration, govern the transport
   of the microbicide drug tenofovir into the vaginal mucosa to its stromal
   layer. These are factors that can be controlled in microbicide gel
   design. The analysis here builds upon our current understanding of
   vaginal gel deployment and drug delivery, incorporating key features of
   the gel's environment, the vaginal canal, fluid production and
   subsequent gel dilution, and vaginal wall elasticity. These have not
   previously been included in the modeling of drug delivery. We consider
   the microbicide drug tenofovir, which is the drug most completely
   studied for gels: in vitro, in animal studies in vivo, and in human
   clinical trials with both vaginal or rectal gel application. Our goal is
   to contribute to improved biophysical and pharmacological understanding
   of gel functionality, providing a computational tool that can be used in
   future vaginal microbicide gel design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of low boiling point components occurs at
   low-temperature and usually at high pressure. A proper method for
   computing the fugacity coefficient is to use a cubic equation of state
   with mixing rules. However, empirical mixing rules include one
   adjustable parameter and cannot predict VLE of some mixtures accurately.
   An alternative that could be used for non-ideal mixtures is the
   Wong-Sandler mixing rule, which is derived based on the excess Gibbs
   energy (GE). In this research, VLE of light gaseous mixtures was
   calculated at low temperatures and medium to high pressures using the
   Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS), the Wong-Sandler mixing rule,
   and the NRTL equation as a GE model. This introduces an additional
   adjustable parameter. Assuming the adjustable parameters as a function
   of temperature, the results show that this thermodynamic model is an
   appropriate method to predict VLE of low boiling point materials at wide
   range of temperatures. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To compare cross-sectional choroidal morphology in rhesus
   macaque and human eyes using enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence
   tomography (EDI-OCT) and histologic analysis.
   METHODS. Enhanced-depth imaging-OCT images from 25 rhesus macaque and 30
   human eyes were evaluated for choriocapillaris and choroidal-scleral
   junction (CSJ) visibility in the central macula based on OCT
   reflectivity profiles, and compared with age-matched histologic
   sections. Semiautomated segmentation of the choriocapillaris and CSJ was
   used to measure choriocapillary and choroidal thickness, respectively.
   Multivariate regression was performed to determine the association of
   age, refractive error, and race with choriocapillaris and CSJ
   visibility.
   RESULTS. Rhesus macaques exhibit a distinct hyporeflective
   choriocapillaris layer on EDI-OCT, while the CSJ cannot be visualized.
   In contrast, humans show variable reflectivities of the
   choriocapillaris, with a distinct CSJ seen in many subjects. Histologic
   sections demonstrate large, darkly pigmented melanocytes that are
   densely distributed in the macaque choroid, while melanocytes in humans
   are smaller, less pigmented, and variably distributed. Optical coherence
   tomography reflectivity patterns of the choroid appear to correspond to
   the density, size, and pigmentation of choroidal melanocytes. Mean
   choriocapillary thickness was similar between the two species (19.3 +/-
   3.4 vs. 19.8 +/- 3.4 mu m, P = 0.615), but choroidal thickness may be
   lower in macaques than in humans (191.2 +/- 43.0 vs. 266.8 +/- 78.0 mu
   m, P < 0.001). Racial differences in uveal pigmentation also appear to
   affect the visibility of the choriocapillaris and CSJ on EDI-OCT.
   CONCLUSIONS. Pigmented uveal melanocytes affect choroidal morphology on
   EDI-OCT in rhesus macaque and human eyes. Racial differences in
   pigmentation may affect choriocapillaris and CSJ visibility, and may
   influence the accuracy of choroidal thickness measurements.}},

Abstract = {{spectral element method (SEM) is implemented for the numerical
   simulation of high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) through a
   self-consistent solution of the Schrodinger-Poisson equations. The
   electron conduction band structure and electron density distribution are
   calculated and plotted, and results compared to those based on methods
   utilizing a finite-difference approach. Simulation accuracy and
   efficiency are analyzed and compared with traditional finite difference
   method (FDM). DC current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for the HEMT
   structure are simulated, based on a quasi-2D current model. The SEM
   approach offers advantages in speed and efficiency over FDM, while
   yielding results which conform well to reported experimental results.
   These advantages are particularly important for compound heterojunction
   devices with complex material profiles, for which FDM methods may be
   inefficient and computationally slow.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Biomaterials created from supramolecular peptides, proteins, and their
   derivatives have been receiving increasing interest for both
   immunological applications, such as vaccines and immunotherapies, as
   well as ostensibly nonimmunological applications, such as therapeutic
   delivery or tissue engineering. However, simple rules for either
   maximizing immunogenicity or abolishing it have yet to be elucidated,
   even though immunogenicity is a prime consideration for the design of
   any supramolecular biomaterial intended for use in vivo. Here, we
   investigated a range of physicochemical properties of fibrillized
   peptide biomaterials, identifying negative surface charge as a means for
   completely abolishing antibody and T cell responses against them in
   mice, even when they display a competent epitope. The work was
   facilitated by the modularity of the materials, which enabled the
   generation of a set of co-assembled fibrillar peptide materials with
   broad ranges of surface properties. It was found that negative surface
   charge, provided via negatively charged amino acid residues, prevented T
   cell and antibody responses to antigen-carrying assemblies because it
   prevented uptake of the materials by antigen-presenting cells (APCs),
   which in turn prevented presentation of the epitope peptide in the APCs'
   major histocompatibility class II molecules. Conversely, positive
   surface charge augmented the uptake of fibrillized peptides by APCs.
   These findings suggest that some surface characteristics, such as
   extensive negative charge, should be avoided in vaccine design using
   supramolecular peptide assemblies. More importantly, it provides a
   strategy to switch off potentially problematic immunogenicity for using
   these materials in nonimmunological applications.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared (IR) light sources with high modulation rates are critical
   components for on-chip optical communications. Lead-based colloidal
   quantum dots are promising nonepitaxial materials for use in IR
   light-emitting diodes, but their slow photoluminescence lifetime is a
   serious limitation. Here we demonstrate coupling of PbS quantum dots to
   colloidal plasmonic nanoantennas based on film-coupled metal nanocubes,
   resulting in a dramatic 1300-fold reduction in the emission lifetime
   from the microsecond to the nanosecond regime. This lifetime reduction
   is primarily due to a 1100-fold increase in the radiative decay rate
   owing to the high quantum yield (65\%) of the antenna. The short
   emission lifetime is accompanied by high antenna quantum efficiency and
   directionality. This nonepitaxial platform points toward GHz frequency,
   electrically modulated, telecommunication wavelength light-emitting
   diodes and single-photon sources.}},

Abstract = {{The complex process of supercontinuum generation (SG) is known to be
   exploitable for designing spatially coherent white light sources
   emitting light simultaneously in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared
   ranges. Herein the first natural material able to generate in laboratory
   conditions a supercontinuum similar to those known from man-made
   photonic crystal fibers is described. The ability resides in siliceous
   20-50 cm long spicules of the glass sponge Sericolophus hawaiicus. By
   shedding into the spicules optical peak intensities ranging from 1 to
   100 TW cm(-2) the generation of a SG is revealed. The SG involves
   wavelengths between 650 and 900 nm and shows a maximum spectral spread
   for excitation at a wavelength of 750 nm. It is hypothesized that the SG
   is favored by spicules being a biocomposite that incorporates together
   isotopically pure biogenic silica (delta(30) Si = -3.28) and 15.2 +/-
   1.3 mu g N -acetyl-glucosamine (chitin) per mg of silica. The internal
   organization of these spicules is distinguished by a solid silica core
   with a 1 mu m wide axial channel as well as a highly ordered
   silica-chitin composite. Such a composition and organization pattern may
   be of potential interest for the design of low temperature synthesis of
   future materials for light guidance.}},

Abstract = {{The development of pericoital (on demand) vaginal HIV prevention
   technologies remains a global health priority. Clinical trials to date
   have been challenged by nonadherence, leading to an inability to
   demonstrate product efficacy. The work here provides new methodology and
   results to begin to address this limitation. We created validated scales
   that allow users to characterize sensory perceptions and experiences
   when using vaginal gel formulations. In this study, we sought to
   understand the user sensory perceptions and experiences (USPEs) that
   characterize the preferred product experience for each participant. Two
   hundred four women evaluated four semisolid vaginal formulations using
   the USPE scales at four randomly ordered formulation evaluation visits.
   Women were asked to select their preferred formulation experience for
   HIV prevention among the four formulations evaluated. The scale scores
   on the Sex-associated USPE scales (e.g., Initial Penetration and
   Leakage) for each participant's selected formulation were used in a
   latent class model analysis. Four classes of preferred formulation
   experiences were identified. Sociodemographic and sexual history
   variables did not predict class membership; however, four specific
   scales were significantly related to class: Initial Penetration,
   Perceived Wetness, Messiness, and Leakage. The range of preferred user
   experiences represented by the scale scores creates a potential target
   range for product development, such that products that elicit scale
   scores that fall within the preferred range may be more acceptable, or
   tolerable, to the population under study. It is recommended that similar
   analyses should be conducted with other semisolid vaginal formulations,
   and in other cultures, to determine product property and development
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{Neural control of continence and micturition is distributed over a
   network of interconnected reflexes. These reflexes integrate sensory
   information from the bladder and urethra and are modulated by descending
   influences to produce different physiological outcomes based on the
   information arriving from peripheral afferents. Therefore, the mode of
   activation of primary afferents is essential in understanding the action
   of spinal reflex pathways in the lower urinary tract. We present an
   overview of sensory mechanisms in the bladder and urethra focusing on
   their spinal integration, identify the cardinal spinal reflexes
   responsible for continence and micturition, and describe how their

Abstract = {{Brachytherapy is a targeted type of radiotherapy utilized in the
   treatment of cancers. Elastin-like polypeptides are a unique class of
   genetically engineered peptide polymers that have several attractive
   properties for brachytherapy.
   To explore the feasibility and application of brachytherapy for VX2
   liver tumor using elastin-like polypeptides with I-131 so as to provide
   reliable experimental evidence for a new promising treatment of liver
   cancer.
   Elastin-like polypeptide as carrier was labeled with I-131 using the
   iodogen method. Ten eligible rabbits with VX2 liver tumor were randomly
   divided into the treatment group (n = 5) and control group (n = 5). The
   treatment group received brachytherapy using elastin-like polypeptide
   with I-131, and in the control group, elastin-like polypeptide was
   injected into the VX2 liver tumor as a control. Periodic biochemical and
   imaging surveillances were required to assess treatment efficacy.
   The stability of elastin-like polypeptide with I-131 in vitro was
   maintained at over 96.8 \% for 96 h. Biochemistry and imaging indicated
   brachytherapy using elastin-like polypeptide with I-131 for liver tumor
   can improve liver function and inhibit tumor growth (P < 0.05).
   Elastin-like polypeptide can be an ideal carrier of I-131 and have high
   labeling efficiency, radiochemical purity and stability. Brachytherapy
   using elastin-like polypeptide with I-131 for liver tumor is a useful
   therapy that possesses high antitumor efficacy advantages.}},

Title = {{Municipal solid waste and dung cake burning: discoloring the Taj Mahal
   and human health impacts in Agra}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The Taj Mahal-an iconic World Heritage monument built of white
   marble-has become discolored with time, due, in part, to high levels of
   particulate matter (PM) soiling its surface (Bergin et al 2015 Environ.
   Sci. Technol. 49 808-812). Such discoloration has required extensive and
   costly treatment (2015 Two Hundred Sixty Second Report on Effects of
   Pollution on Taj Parliament of India Rajya Sabha, New Delhi) and despite
   previous interventions to reduce pollution in its vicinity, the haze and
   darkening persists (Bergin et al 2015 Environ. Sci. Technol. 49 808-812;
   2015 Two Hundred Sixty Second Report on Effects of Pollution on Taj
   Parliament of India Rajya Sabha, New Delhi). PM responsible for the
   soiling has been attributed to a variety of sources including industrial
   emissions, vehicular exhaust and biomass burning, but the contribution
   of the emissions from the burning of open municipal solid waste (MSW)
   may also play an important role. A recent source apportionment study of
   fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at the Taj Mahal showed biomass burning
   emissions, which would include MSW emissions, accounted for nearly 40\%
   of organic matter (OM)-a component of PM-deposition to its surface
   (Bergin et al 2015 Environ. Sci. Technol. 49 808-812); dung cake
   burning, used extensively for cooking in the region, was the suggested
   culprit and banned within the city limits (2015 Two Hundred Sixty Second
   Report on Effects of Pollution on Taj Parliament of India Rajya Sabha,
   New Delhi), although the burning of MSW, a ubiquitous practice in the
   area (Nagpure et al 2015 Environ. Sci. Technol. 49 12904-12), may play a
   more important role in local air quality. Using spatially detailed
   emission estimates and air quality modeling, we find that open MSW
   burning leads to about 150 (+/- 130) mgm(-2) yr(-1) of PM2.5 being
   deposited to the surface of the Taj Mahal compared to about 12 (+/- 3.2)
   mgm(-2) yr(-1) from dung cake burning. Those two sources, combined, also
   lead to an estimated 713 (377-1050) premature mortalities in Agra each
   year, dominated by waste burning in socioeconomically lower status
   neighborhoods. An effectiveMSWmanagement strategy would reduce soiling
   of the Taj Mahal, improve human health, and have additional aesthetic
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{In order to directly utilize the dyadic Green's functions in surface
   integral equations (SIEs), a novel double-arctan transformation for
   nearly hypersingular integrals is proposed in this communication. This
   new transformation is flexible and applicable to nearly hypersingular
   integrals in the forms of (R) over cap(R) over cap /R-3, (R) over cap
   /R-3, and 1/R-3 over the curved surfaces by a fully numerical method.
   With the help of the sigmoidal transformation to improve the stability
   of this new singularly handling method, there results an efficient
   solution for the third-order near-singularity problems in SIEs.
   Moreover, the proposed method is also effective for the lower orders of
   the nearly singular integral kernels. With typical testing cases, the
   performance of this method is fairly evaluated, and its validity and
   stability is well demonstrated.}},

Title = {{Operational hydrological forecasting during the IPHEx-IOP campaign -
   Meet the challenge}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{434-456}},

Abstract = {{An operational streamflow forecasting testbed was implemented during the
   Intense Observing Period (IOP) of the Integrated Precipitation and
   Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx-IOP) in May-June 2014 to characterize flood
   predictability in complex terrain. Specifically, hydrological forecasts
   were issued daily for 12 headwater catchments in the Southern
   Appalachians using the Duke Coupled surface-groundwater Hydrology Model
   (DCHM) forced by hourly atmospheric fields and QPFs (Quantitative
   Precipitation Forecasts) produced by the NASA-Unified Weather Research
   and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model. Previous day hindcasts forced by
   radar-based QPEs (Quantitative Precipitation Estimates) were used to
   provide initial conditions for present day forecasts. This manuscript
   first describes the operational testbed framework and workflow during
   the IPHEx-IOP including a synthesis of results. Second, various data
   assimilation approaches are explored a posteriori (post-IOP) to improve
   operational (flash) flood forecasting. Although all flood events during
   the MP were predicted by the IPHEx operational testbed with lead times
   of up to 6 h, significant errors of over-and, or under-prediction were
   identified that could be traced back to the QPFs and subgrid-scale
   variability of radar QPEs. To improve operational flood prediction,
   three data-merging strategies were pursued post-IOP: (1) the spatial
   patterns of QPFs were improved through assimilation of satellite-based
   microwave radiances into NU-WRF; (2) QPEs were improved by merging
   raingauge observations with ground-based radar observations using bias
   correction methods to produce streamflow hindcasts and associated
   uncertainty envelope capturing the streamflow observations, and (3)
   river discharge observations were assimilated into the DCHM to improve
   streamflow forecasts using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), the
   fixed-lag Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EnKS), and the Asynchronous EnKF
   (i.e. AEnKF) methods. Both flood hindcasts and forecasts were
   significantly improved by assimilating discharge observations into the
   DCHM. Specifically, Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) values as high as
   0.98, 0.71 and 0.99 at 15-min time-scales were attained for three
   headwater catchments in the inner mountain region demonstrating that the
   assimilation of discharge observations at the basin's outlet can reduce
   the errors and uncertainties in soil moisture at very small scales.
   Success in operational flood forecasting at lead times of 6, 9, 12 and
   15 h was also achieved through discharge assimilation with NSEs of 0.87,
   0.78, 0.72 and 0.51, respectively. Analysis of experiments using various
   data assimilation system configurations indicates that the optimal
   assimilation time window depends both on basin properties and
   storm-specific space-time-structure of rainfall, and therefore adaptive,
   context-aware configurations of the data assimilation system are
   recommended to address the challenges of flood prediction in headwater
   basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rainwater harvesting (RWH) has the potential to reduce water-related
   costs by providing an alternate source of water, in addition to
   relieving pressure on public water sources and reducing stormwater
   runoff. Existing methods for determining the optimal size of the cistern
   component of a RWH system have various drawbacks, such as specificity to
   a particular region, dependence on numerical optimization, and/or
   failure to consider the costs of the system. In this paper a formulation
   is developed for the optimal cistern volume which incorporates the fixed
   and distributed costs of a RWH system while also taking into account the
   random nature of the depth and timing of rainfall, with a focus on RWH
   to supply domestic, nonpotable uses. With rainfall inputs modeled as a
   marked Poisson process, and by comparing the costs associated with
   building a cistern with the costs of externally supplied water, an
   expression for the optimal cistern volume is found which minimizes the
   water-related costs. The volume is a function of the roof area, water
   use rate, climate parameters, and costs of the cistern and of the
   external water source. This analytically tractable expression makes
   clear the dependence of the optimal volume on the input parameters. An
   analysis of the rainfall partitioning also characterizes the efficiency
   of a particular RWH system configuration and its potential for runoff
   reduction. The results are compared to the RWH system at the Duke Smart
   Home in Durham, NC, USA to show how the method could be used in
   practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Studying cetacean behaviour: new technological approaches and

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{235-244}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Animal behaviour can provide valuable information for wildlife
   management and conservation. Studying the detailed behaviour of marine
   mammals involves challenges not faced by most animal behaviour
   researchers due to the size, mobility and lack of continuous visibility
   of these animals. We describe several methods developed by marine mammal
   scientists to study behaviour, primarily of cetaceans, focusing on
   technological advances: unmanned aerial systems (UAS), satellite-linked
   telemetry, passive acoustics and multisensor high-resolution acoustic
   recording tags. We then go on to explain how the data collected by these
   methods have contributed to and informed conservation actions. We focus
   on examples including: satellite data informing the interactions between
   cetaceans and offshore oil and gas development; passive acoustics used
   to track distributions of several species of cetaceans, including their
   movements near shipping lanes; and high-resolution acoustic recording
   tags used to document responses of cetaceans to anthropogenic
   activities. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to link animal behaviour
   to individual fitness and, particularly for behavioural disturbances, to
   population-level consequences, which can be helpful for informing
   conservation efforts. The infusion of technological advancements into
   studies of cetacean behaviour combined with emerging analytical
   techniques brings us to the next 20+ years of studying these animals.
   These developments will improve our capabilities in areas such as
   testing whether their behaviour adheres to traditional behavioural
   theory, and will certainly assist the guiding of conservation efforts.

Abstract = {{We have developed frequency domain multispectral multiple scattering low
   coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI) for deep imaging of absorption and
   scattering contrast. Using tissue-mimicking phantoms that match the full
   scattering phase function of human dermal tissue, we demonstrate that
   ms2/LCI can provide a signal/noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 15.4 dB
   over conventional OCT at an imaging depth of 1 mm. The enhanced SNR and
   penetration depth provided by ms2/LCI could be leveraged for a variety
   of clinical applications including the assessment of burn injuries where
   current clinical classification of severity only provides limited
   accuracy. The utility of the approach was demonstrated by imaging a
   tissue phantom simulating a partial-thickness burn revealing good
   spectroscopic contrast between healthy and injured tissue regions deep
   below the sample surface. Finally, healthy rat skin was imaged in vivo
   with both a commercial OCT instrument and our custom ms2/LCI system. The
   results demonstrate that ms2/LCI is capable of obtaining spectroscopic
   information far beyond the penetration depth provided by conventional
   OCT. (C)2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In vivo imaging permits longitudinal study of ocular disease processes
   in the same animal over time. Two different in vivo optical imaging
   modalities optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence provide
   important structural and cellular data respectively about disease
   processes. In this Methods in Eye Research article, we describe and
   demonstrate the combination of these two modalities producing a truly
   simultaneous OCT and fluorescence imaging system for imaging of
   fluorescently labeled animal models. This system uses only a single
   light source to illuminate both modalities, and both share the same
   field of view. This allows simultaneous acquisition of OCT and
   fluorescence images, and the benefits of both techniques are realized
   without incurring increased costs in variability, light exposure, time,
   and post-processing effort as would occur when the modalities are used
   separately. We then utilized this system to demonstrate multi-modal
   imaging in a progression of samples exhibiting both fluorescence and OCT
   scattering beginning with resolution targets, ex vivo thy1-YFP labeled
   neurons in mouse eyes, and finally an in vivo longitudinal time course
   of GFP labeled myeloid cells in a mouse model of ocular allergy. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose: To test whether oxygenation kinetics correlate with the
   likelihood for local tumor control after fractionated radiation therapy.
   Methods and Materials: We used diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to
   noninvasively measure tumor vascular oxygenation and total hemoglobin
   concentration associated with radiation therapy of 5 daily fractions
   (7.5, 9, or 13.5 Gy/d) in FaDu xenografts. Spectroscopy measurements
   were obtained immediately before each daily radiation fraction and
   during the week after radiation therapy. Oxygen saturation and total
   hemoglobin concentration were computed using an inverse Monte Carlo
   model.
   Results: First, oxygenation kinetics during and after radiation therapy,
   but before tumor volumes changed, were associated with local tumor
   control. Locally controlled tumors exhibited significantly faster
   increases in oxygenation after radiation therapy (days 12-15) compared
   with tumors that recurred locally. Second, within the group of tumors
   that recurred, faster increases in oxygenation during radiation therapy
   (day 3-5 interval) were correlated with earlier recurrence times. An
   area of 0.74 under the receiver operating characteristic curve was
   achieved when classifying the local control tumors from all irradiated
   tumors using the oxygen kinetics with a logistic regression model.
   Third, the rate of increase in oxygenation was radiation dose dependent.
   Radiation doses <= 9.5 Gy/d did not initiate an increase in oxygenation,
   whereas 13.5 Gy/d triggered significant increases in oxygenation during
   and after radiation therapy.
   Conclusions: Additional confirmation is required in other tumor models,
   but these results suggest that monitoring tumor oxygenation kinetics
   could aid in the prediction of local tumor control after radiation
   therapy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Assessing task performance in FFDM, DBT, and synthetic mammography using
   uniform and anthropomorphic physical phantoms}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study is to quantify the differences in
   detectability between full field digital mammography (FFDM), digital
   breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and synthetic mammography (SM) for
   challenging, low contrast signals, in the context of both a uniform and
   an anthropomorphic, textured phantom.
   Methods: Images of the phantoms were acquired using a Hologic Selenia
   Dimensions system. Images were taken at 50\%, 100\%, and 200\% of the
   dose delivered under automatic exposure control (AEC). Low-contrast
   disks, created using an inkjet printer with iodine-doped ink, were
   inserted into the phantom. The disks varied in diameter from 210 to 630
   mu m, and in local contrast from 1.1\% to 2.8\% in regular increments.
   Human observers located the disks in a 4 alternative forced choice
   experiment. Proportion correct (PC) was computed as the number of
   correct localizations out of the total number of tries.
   Results: Overall, scores from FFDM and DBT were consistently greater
   than scores from SM. At an exposure corresponding to the AEC setting,
   mean PC scores for the largest disks with the uniform phantom were 0.80
   for FFDM, 0.83 for DBT, and 0.66 for SM, with the same rank ordering at
   other doses. Scores were similar but lower for the nonuniform
   background. At an exposure twice the AEC setting, however, the
   difference between uniform and nonuniform scores was most pronounced for
   DBT alone. Differences between scores for FFDM and SM were statistically
   significant, while those between FFDM and DBT were not. Scores were used
   to compute the minimum contrast level needed to reach 62.5\% detection
   rate. The minimum contrast for SM was 36\%-81\% higher compared to FFDM
   or DBT, in either background.
   Conclusions: This study shows that an anthropomorphic phantom and
   lesions inserts may be used to conduct a reader study. Detectability was
   significantly lower for synthetic mammography than for FFDM or DBT, for
   all conditions. Additionally, observer performance was consistently
   lower for the anthropomorphic phantom, indicating the greater challenge
   due to anatomical background. Because of this, it may be important to
   use realistic phantoms in observer studies in order to draw conclusions
   that are more clinically relevant. (C) 2016 American Association of

Title = {{Patient-specific quantification of image quality: An automated method
   for measuring spatial resolution in clinical CT images}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and validate an automated technique for evaluating
   the spatial resolution characteristics of clinical computed tomography
   (CT) images.
   Methods: Twenty one chest and abdominopelvic clinical CT datasets were
   examined in this study. An algorithm was developed to extract a CT
   resolution index (RI) analogous to the modulation transfer function from
   clinical CT images by measuring the edge-spread function (ESF) across
   the patient's skin. A polygon mesh of the air-skin boundary was created.
   The faces of the mesh were then used to measure the ESF across the
   air-skin interface. The ESF was differentiated to obtain the line-spread
   function (LSF), and the LSF was Fourier transformed to obtain the RI.
   The algorithm's ability to detect the radial dependence of the RI was
   investigated. RIs measured with the proposed method were compared with a
   conventional phantom-based method across two reconstruction algorithms
   (FBP and iterative) using the spatial frequency at 50\% RI, f(50), as
   the metric for comparison. Three reconstruction kernels were
   investigated for each reconstruction algorithm. Finally, an observer
   study was conducted to determine if observers could visually perceive
   the differences in the measured blurriness of images reconstructed with
   a given reconstruction method.
   Results: RI measurements performed with the proposed technique exhibited
   the expected dependencies on the image reconstruction. The measured
   f(50) values increased with harder kernels for both FBP and iterative
   reconstruction. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was able to detect
   the radial dependence of the RI. Patient-specific measurements of the RI
   were comparable to the phantom-based technique, but the patient data
   exhibited a large spread in the measured f(50), indicating that some
   datasets were blurrier than others even when the projection data were
   reconstructed with the same reconstruction algorithm and kernel. Results
   from the observer study substantiated this finding.
   Conclusions: Clinically informed, patient-specific spatial resolution
   can be measured from clinical datasets. The method is sufficiently
   sensitive to reflect changes in spatial resolution due to different
   reconstruction parameters. The method can be applied to automatically
   assess the spatial resolution of patient images and quantify
   dependencies that may not be captured in phantom data. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{Due to the nonlinear property of large uniaxial anisotropic scatterers,
   many iterative optimization methods have a high risk of being trapped in
   local minima. In this paper, a frequency-hopping subspace-based
   optimization method (SOM) is proposed to reconstruct the relative
   permittivity distribution of 2-D large uniaxial anisotropic scatterers
   with transverse electrical (TE) illumination. This hybrid method
   utilizes the results obtained at lower frequency to provide good initial
   guesses for higher frequency reconstruction, which reduces the
   occurrence of local minima for the inversion at the higher frequency.
   For lower frequency, it can only obtain coarse resolution image although
   it is unable to show the details of the scatterers. However, this coarse
   image provides a priori information for the reconstruction at higher
   frequencies to get finer resolution. Numerical examples demonstrate that
   the proposed hybrid method can effectively rebuild large uniaxial
   anisotropic scatterers (six wavelengths) with higher stability compared
   with conventional SOM that uses only single-frequency data.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider networks of mobile robots responsible for
   servicing a collection of tasks in complex environments, while ensuring
   end-to-end connectivity with a fixed infrastructure of access points.
   Tasks are associated with specific locations in the environment, are
   announced sequentially, and are not assigned a priori to any robots.
   Information generated at the tasks is propagated to the access points
   via a multihop communication network. We propose a distributed, hybrid
   control scheme that dynamically grows tree networks, rooted at the
   access points, with branches that connect robots that service individual
   tasks to the main network structure. To achieve this goal, the robots
   switch between different roles related to their functionality in the
   network. The switching process is tightly integrated with distributed
   optimization of the communication variables and motion planning in
   complex environments, giving rise to the proposed distributed hybrid
   system. Our proposed scheme results in an efficient use of the available
   robots and also allows for global planning by construction, a task that
   is particularly challenging in complex environments.}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation is generally viewed as a cost-effective and sustainable
   technology because it relies on microbes to transform pollutants into
   benign compounds. Advances in molecular biological analyses allow
   unprecedented microbial detection and are increasingly incorporated into
   bioremediation. Throughout history, state-of-the-art techniques have
   informed bioremediation strategies. However, the insights those
   techniques provided were not as in depth as those provided by recently
   developed omics tools. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have
   now placed metagenomics and metatranscriptomics within reach of
   environmental engineers. As NGS costs decrease, metagenomics and
   metatranscriptomics have become increasingly feasible options to rapidly
   scan sites for specific degradative functions and identify
   microorganisms important in pollutant degradation. These omic techniques
   are capable of revolutionizing biological treatment in environmental
   engineering by allowing highly sensitive characterization of previously
   uncultured microorganisms. Omics enables the discovery of novel
   microorganisms for use in bioaugmentation and supports systematic
   optimization of biostimulation strategies. This review describes the
   omics journey from its roots in biology and medicine to its current
   status in environmental engineering, including potential future
   directions in commercial application. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Background/aims To assess peripheral retinal lesions and the posterior
   pole in single widefield optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes.
   Methods A wide field of view (FOV) swept-source OCT (WFOV SSOCT) system
   was developed using a commercial swept-source laser and a custom sample
   arm consisting of two indirect ophthalmic lenses. Twenty-seven subjects
   with peripheral lesions (choroidal melanomas, choroidal naevi,
   sclerochoroidal calcification, retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic
   retinopathy, retinoschisis and uveitis) were imaged with the WFOV SSOCT.
   Volumes were taken in primary gaze. Using the optic nerve to fovea
   distance as a reference measurement, comparisons were made between the
   lateral FOV of the WFOV SSOCT, current generation spectral-domain OCT
   (SDOCT) and widefield scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) of the same
   eyes.
   Results Peripheral pathologies were captured with WFOV SSOCT in 26 of
   the 27 subjects. The one not captured was in the far nasal periphery and
   was not seen in the primary gaze volume. Posterior pole associated
   pathologies were captured in all subjects. Current generation SDOCT had
   a mean lateral FOV of 2.080.21 optic nerve to fovea distance units, WFOV
   SSOCT had an FOV of 4.62 +/- 0.62 units and SLO had an FOV of 9.35 +/-
   1.02 units.
   Conclusions WFOV OCT can be used to examine both peripheral retinal
   pathology and the posterior pole within a single volume acquisition. SLO
   had the greatest FOV, but does not provide depth information. Future
   studies using widefield OCT systems will help further delineate the role
   of WFOV OCT to quantitatively assess and monitor peripheral retinal
   disease in three dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnification of the surgical field using the operating microscope
   facilitated profound innovations in retinal surgery in the 1970s, such
   as pars plana vitrectomy. Although surgical instrumentation and
   illumination techniques are continually developing, the operating
   microscope for vitreoretinal procedures has remained essentially
   unchanged and currently limits the surgeon's depth perception and
   assessment of subtle microanatomy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   has revolutionized clinical management of retinal pathology, and its
   introduction into the operating suite may have a similar impact on
   surgical visualization and treatment. In this article, we review the
   evolution of OCT for retinal surgery, from perioperative analysis to
   live volumetric (four-dimensional, 4D) image-guided surgery. We begin by
   briefly addressing the benefits and limitations of the operating
   microscope, the progression of OCT technology, and OCT applications in
   clinical/perioperative retinal imaging. Next, we review intraoperative
   OCT (iOCT) applications using handheld probes during surgical pauses,
   two-dimensional (2D) microscope-integrated OCT (MIOCT) of live surgery,
   and volumetric MIOCT of live surgery. The iOCT discussion focuses on
   technological advancements, applications during human retinal surgery,
   translational difficulties and limitations, and future directions.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Posterior eye shape assessment by magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) is used to study myopia. We tested the hypothesis that optical
   coherence tomography (OCT), as an alternative, could measure posterior
   eye shape similarly to MRI.
   METHODS. Macular spectral-domain OCT and brain MRI images previously
   acquired as part of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study
   were analyzed. The right eye in the MRI and OCT images was automatically
   segmented. Optical coherence tomography segmentations were corrected for
   optical and display distortions requiring biometry data. The
   segmentations were fitted to spheres and ellipsoids to obtain the
   posterior eye radius of curvature (R-c) and asphericity (Q(xz)). The
   differences in R-c and Q(xz) measured by MRI and OCT were tested using
   paired t-tests. Categorical assignments of prolateness or oblateness
   using Q(xz) were compared.
   RESULTS. Fifty-two subjects (67.8 +/- 5.6 years old) with spherical
   equivalent refraction from vertical bar 0.50 to -5.38 were included. The
   mean paired difference between MRI and original OCT posterior eye R-c
   was 24.03 +/- 46.49 mm (P = 0.0005). For corrected OCT images, the
   difference in R-c decreased to -0.23 +/- 2.47 mm (P = 0.51). The
   difference between MRI and OCT asphericity, Q(xz), was -0.052 +/- 0.343
   (P = 0.28). However, categorical agreement was only moderate (kappa =
   0.50).
   CONCLUSIONS. Distortion-corrected OCT measurements of R-c and Q(xz) were
   not statistically significantly different from MRI, although the
   moderate categorical agreement suggests that individual differences
   remained. This study provides evidence that with distortion correction,
   noninvasive office-based OCT could potentially be used instead of MRI
   for the study of posterior eye shape.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The integration of swept-source optical coherence tomography
   (SS-OCT) into the operating microscope enables real-time, tissue-level
   three-dimensional (3D) imaging to aid in ophthalmic microsurgery. In
   this prospective randomized controlled study, we evaluated the impact of
   SS microscope-integrated OCT (MI-OCT) on ophthalmology residents'
   performance of ophthalmic microsurgical maneuvers.
   METHODS. Fourteen ophthalmology residents from a single institution were
   stratified by year of training and randomized to perform four anterior
   segment surgical maneuvers on porcine eyes with (MI-OCT+) or without
   (MI-OCT-) direct intraoperative OCT guidance. Subsequently, both groups
   repeated the same maneuvers without MI-OCT feedback to test whether
   initial MI-OCT experience affected subsequent surgical performance.
   Finally, the MI-OCT- group was crossed over and allowed to repeat the
   same maneuvers with direct MI-OCT guidance. Each resident completed a
   survey at the completion of the study.
   RESULTS. With direct MI-OCT feedback, residents demonstrated enhanced
   performance in depth-based anterior segment maneuvers ( corneal suture
   passes at 50\% and 90\% depth and corneal laceration repair) compared
   with the residents operating without MI-OCT. Microscope-integrated OCT+
   residents continued to outperform the controls when both groups
   subsequently operated without MI-OCT. For clear corneal wound geometry,
   there was no statistically significant effect of MI-OCT as applied in
   this study. Overall, the resident surgeons rated their subjective
   experience of using MI-OCT very favorably.
   CONCLUSIONS. Microscope-integrated OCT feedback enhances performance of
   ophthalmology residents in select anterior segment surgical maneuvers.
   Microscope-integrated OCT represents a valuable tool in the surgical
   education of ophthalmology residents.}},

Abstract = {{A computational and experimental study of a uniform cantilever beam with
   a tip mass under base excitation was performed. The beam was excited at
   various levels of base displacement to provoke tip displacements greater
   than 15\% of the beam length. Damping and yield stress of the beam were
   both considered. It was found that a large tip displacement causes
   nonlinear inertial (NLI) and structural (NLS) effects to arise. Each of
   the structural and inertial nonlinearities has an opposite effect on the
   resulting resonance frequency, which are nearly mutually canceling. The
   result was that resonant frequency calculated using the full nonlinear
   (FNL) model was essentially equal to the value calculated by linear
   (LIN) theory, and the tip displacement amplitude varied only modestly
   from the LIN value. It was also observed that the damping in this system
   is likely nonlinear, and depends on tip displacement amplitude. A
   theoretical model for fluid damping is suggested. Initial investigation
   shows encouraging agreement between the theoretical fluid damping and
   the measured values.}},

Abstract = {{Managing and optimizing radiation dose has become a core problem for the
   CT community. As a fundamental step for dose optimization, accurate and
   computationally efficient dose estimates are crucial. The purpose of
   this study was to devise a computationally efficient projection-based
   dose metric. The absorbed energy and object mass were individually
   modeled using the projection data. The absorbed energy was estimated
   using the difference between intensity of the primary photon and the
   exit photon. The mass was estimated using the volume under the
   attenuation profile. The feasibility of the approach was evaluated
   across phantoms with a broad size range, various kVp settings, and two
   bowtie filters, using a simulation tool, the Computer Assisted
   Tomography SIMulator (CATSIM) software. The accuracy of projection-based
   dose estimation was validated against Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The
   relationship between projection-based dose metric and MC dose estimate
   was evaluated using regression models. The projection-based dose metric
   showed a strong correlation with Monte Carlo dose estimates (R (2) >
   0.94). The prediction errors for the projection-based dose metric were
   all below 15 \%. This study demonstrated the feasibility of
   computationally efficient dose estimation requiring only the projection
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Although variations in nasal index (NI) have been reported to represent

   anatomy. Airflow simulations were conducted under constant inspiratory
   pressure. Nasal resistance (NR) against NI showed weak association from
   nostrils to anterior inferior turbinate (R-2 = 0.26) and nostril to
   choanae (R-2 = 0.12). NI accounted for 38\% and 41\% of the respective
   variation in wall shear stress (WSS) and heat flux (HF) at the nasal
   vestibule, and 52\% and 49\% of variability in WSS and HF across the
   entire nose. HF and WSS had strong correlation with NI < 80, and weakly
   correlated with NI > 80; these differences in HF and WSS for NI < 80 and
   NI > 80 were not statistically significant. Results suggest strong
   relationship between NI and both WSS and HF but not NR, particularly in

Abstract = {{Graphene is an emerging candidate for biomedical applications, including
   biosensor, drug delivery and scaffold biomaterials. Cellular functions
   and behaviors on different graphene-coated substrates, however, still
   remain elusive to a great extent. This paper explored the functional
   responses of cells such as adhesion and proliferation, to different
   kinds of substrates including coverslips, silicone, polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS) with different curing ratios, PDMS treated with oxygen plasma,
   and their counterparts coated with single layer graphene (SLG).
   Specifically, adherent cell number, spreading area and cytoskeleton
   configuration were exploited to characterize cell-substrate adhesion
   ability, while MTT assay was employed to test the proliferation
   capability of fibroblasts. Experimental outcome demonstrated graphene
   coating had excellent cytocompatibility, which could lead to an increase
   in early adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and remodeling of
   cytoskeletons of fibroblast cells. Notably, it was found that the
   underlying substrate effect, e.g., stiffness of substrate materials,
   could essentially regulate the adhesion and proliferation of cells
   cultured on graphene. The stiffer the substrates were, the stronger the
   abilities of adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts were. This study
   not only deepens our understanding of substrate-modulated interfacial
   interactions between live cells and graphene, but also provides a
   valuable guidance for the design and application of graphene-based
   biomaterials in biomedical engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study aims at analyzing the combined impact of uncertainties in
   initial conditions and wind forcing fields in ocean general circulation
   models (OGCM) using polynomial chaos (PC) expansions. Empirical
   orthogonal functions (EOF) are used to formulate both spatial
   perturbations to initial conditions and space-time wind forcing
   perturbations, namely in the form of a superposition of modal components
   with uniformly distributed random amplitudes. The forward deterministic
   HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is used to propagate input
   uncertainties in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) in spring 2010, during the
   Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and to generate the ensemble of model
   realizations based on which PC surrogate models are constructed for both
   localized and field quantities of interest (QoIs), focusing specifically
   on sea surface height (SSH) and mixed layer depth (MLD). These PC
   surrogate models are constructed using basis pursuit denoising
   methodology, and their performance is assessed through various
   statistical measures. A global sensitivity analysis is then performed to
   quantify the impact of individual modes as well as their interactions.
   It shows that the local SSH at the edge of the GoM main current-the Loop
   Current-is mostly sensitive to perturbations of the initial conditions
   affecting the current front, whereas the local MLD in the area of the
   Deepwater Horizon oil spill is more sensitive to wind forcing
   perturbations. At the basin scale, the SSH in the deep GoM is mostly
   sensitive to initial condition perturbations, while over the shelf it is
   sensitive to wind forcing perturbations. On the other hand, the basin
   MLD is almost exclusively sensitive to wind perturbations. For both
   quantities, the two sources of uncertainty have limited interactions.
   Finally, the computations indicate that whereas local quantities can
   exhibit complex behavior that necessitates a large number of
   realizations, the modal analysis of field sensitivities can be suitably
   achieved with a moderate size ensemble.}},

Abstract = {{It is well-known that the power allocation can enhance the power
   utilization of the distributed radar systems. We first analyze two
   interesting non-increasing properties of Cramer-Rao low bound (CRLB) for
   target location via distributed multiple radar systems. On the basis of
   the classical power allocation methods {[}15], this paper proposes a
   fast efficient power allocation algorithm applied to cognitive
   distributed multiple radar systems, which depends greatly on an
   alternating global search algorithm(AGSA). In this paper, our aim is
   directly to minimize the non-convex CRLB {[}15] of target location
   estimation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is theoretically
   analyzed by LaSalle invariance principle. We analyze the computational
   complexity of the two closely-related algorithms. The famous Pareto
   optimal set associated with power allocation is obtained by the proposed
   algorithm, and it can indirectly derive the solution to problem for
   minimizing total power budget. Experimental results demonstrate that our
   algorithm has quick convergence and good performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Separation of cells and microorganisms from complex biological mixtures
   is a critical first step in many analytical applications ranging from
   clinical diagnostics to environmental monitoring for food and waterborne
   contaminants. Yet, existing techniques for cell separation are plagued
   by high reagent and/or instrumentation costs that limit their use in
   many remote or resource-poor settings, such as field clinics or
   developing countries. We developed an innovative approach to isolate
   infectious pathogens from biological fluids using buoyant hollow silica
   microspheres that function as ``molecular buoys{''} for affinity-based
   target capture and separation by floatation. In this process, antibody
   functionalized glass microspheres are mixed with a complex biological
   sample, such as stool. When mixing is stopped, the target-bound,
   low-density microspheres float to the air/liquid surface, which
   simultaneously isolates and concentrates the target analytes from the
   sample matrix. The microspheres are highly tunable in terms of size,
   density, and surface functionality for targeting diverse analytes with
   separation times of <= 2 min in viscous solutions. We have applied the
   molecular buoy technique for isolation of a protozoan parasite that
   causes diarrheal illness, Cryptosporidium, directly from stool with
   separation efficiencies over 90\% and low nonspecific binding. This
   low-cost method for phenotypic cell/pathogen separation from complex
   mixtures is expected to have widespread use in clinical diagnostics as
   well as basic research. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A buckled beam with immovable pinned ends is considered. Attached to the
   beam are either one concentrated mass, two concentrated masses, a
   spring-mass system (that could model a human, robot, or passive
   vibration absorber), or a horizontal rigid bar with two vertical end
   springs (a ``bounce-pitch{''} system that could model an animal or a
   vehicle). In the theoretical analysis, the beam is modeled as an
   inextensible elastica. Equilibrium configurations are determined first.
   Then small free vibrations about equilibrium are examined, and the
   lowest frequencies and corresponding modes are computed. The effects of
   various parameters are investigated, such as the ratio of the span to
   the total arc length of the beam, the locations and weights of the
   attached masses and systems, and the stiffnesses of the springs. For the
   case of a single attached mass, experiments are conducted and the
   results are compared to the theoretical ones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Predicting material properties of off-stoichiometry systems remains a
   long-standing and formidable challenge in rational materials design. A
   proper analysis of such systems by means of a supercell approach
   requires the exhaustive consideration of all possible superstructures,
   which can be a time-consuming process. On the contrary, the use of
   quasirandom approximants, although very computationally effective,
   implicitly bias the analysis toward disordered states with the lowest
   site correlations. Here, we propose a novel framework designed
   specifically to investigate stoichiometrically driven trends of
   disordered systems (i.e., having partial occupation and/or disorder in
   the atomic sites). At the heart of the approach is the identification
   and analysis of unique supercells of a virtually equivalent
   stoichiometry to the disordered material. We employ Boltzmann statistics
   to resolve system-wide properties at a high-throughput (HT) level. To
   maximize efficiency and accessibility, we integrated the method within
   the automatic HT computational framework Aflow. As proof of concept, we
   apply our approach to three systems of interest, a zinc chalcogenide
   (ZnS1-xSex), a wide-gap oxide semiconductor (MgxZn1-xO), and an iron
   alloy (Fe1-xCux), at various stoichiometries. These systems exhibit
   properties that are highly tunable as a function of composition,
   characterized by optical bowing and linear ferromagnetic behavior. Not
   only are these qualities successfully predicted, but additional insight
   into underlying physical mechanisms is revealed.}},

Abstract = {{Nanosecond electric pulses (nsEP's) are a well-studied phenomena in
   biophysics that cause substantial alterations to cellular membrane
   dynamics, internal biochemistry, and cytoskeletal structure, and induce
   apoptotic and necrotic cell death. While several studies have attempted
   to measure the effects of multiple nanosecond pulses, the effect of
   pulse repetition rate (PRR) has received little attention, especially at
   frequencies greater than 100 Hz. In this study, uptake of Propidium
   Iodide, FM 1-43, and YO-PRO-1 fluorescent dyes in CHO-K1 cells was
   monitored across a wide range of PRRs (5 Hze500 KHz) using a
   laser-scanning confocal microscope in order to better understand how
   high frequency repetition rates impact induced biophysical changes. We
   show that frequency trends depend on the identity of the dye under
   study, which could implicate transmembrane protein channels in the
   uptake response due to their chemical selectivity. Finally, YO-PRO-1
   fluorescence was monitored in the presence of Gadolinium (Gd3(+)),
   Ruthenium Red, and in calcium-free solution to elucidate a mechanism for
   its unique frequency trend. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Transfection with in vitro transcribed mRNAs is a safe and effective
   tool to convert somatic cells to any cell type of interest. One caveat
   of mRNA transfection is that mRNAs are recognized by multiple RNAsensing
   toll like receptors (TLRs). These TLRs can both promote and inhibit
   cellular reprogramming. We demonstrated that mRNA transfection
   stimulated TLR3 and TLR7 and induced cytotoxicity and IFN-beta
   expression in human and mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore, mRNA
   transfection induced paracrine inhibition of repeated mRNA transfection
   through type I IFNs. Modified mRNAs (mmRNAs) containing pseudouridine
   and 5-methycytosine reduced TLR stimulation, cytotoxicity and IFN-beta
   expression in fibroblasts. Repeated liposomal transfection with MyoD
   mmRNAs significantly enhanced myogenic conversion of human and mouse
   fibroblasts compared with repeated transfection with MyoD mRNAs.
   Interestingly, electroporation of mRNAs and mmRNAs completely abrogated
   cytotoxicity and IFN-beta expression and also abolished myogenic
   conversion of fibroblasts. At a low concentration, TLR7/8 agonist R848
   enhanced MyoD mmRNA-driven conversion of human fibroblasts into skeletal
   muscle cells, whereas high concentrations of R848 inhibited myogenic
   conversion of fibroblasts. Our study suggests that deliberate control of
   TLR signaling is a key factor in the success of mRNA-driven cellular
   reprogramming. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have demonstrated great promise as a novel class of
   biomarkers for early detection of various cancers, including breast
   cancer. However, due to technical, difficulties in detecting these small
   molecules, miRNAs have not been adopted. into routine clinical practice
   for early diagnostics. Thus,, it is important to develop alternative
   detection strategies that could offer more advantages over conventional,
   methods. Here, we demonstrate the application of a ``turn-on{''} SERS
   sensing technology, referred to as ``inverse Molecular Sentinel
   (iMS){''} nanoprobes, as a homogeneous assay for multiplexed detection
   of naiRNAs. This SERS nanoprobe involves the use of plasmonic-active
   nanostars as the sensing platform. The ``OFF-to-ON{''} signal switch is
   based on a nonenzymatic stand-displacement process and the
   conformational change of stem-loop (hairpin) oligonucleotide probes upon
   target binding. This technique was previously used to detect a synthetic
   DNA sequence of interest. In this study; we modified the design of the
   nanoprobe to be used for the detection of short (22-nt) miRNA sequences.
   The demonstration of using iMS nanoprobes to detect miRNAs in real
   biological samples was performed with total small RNA extracted from

Abstract = {{Manganese (Mn) contamination of well water is recognized as an
   environmental health concern. In the southeastern Piedmont region of the
   United States, well water Mn concentrations can be >2 orders of
   magnitude above health limits, but the specific sources and causes of
   elevated Mn in groundwater are generally unknown. Here, using field,
   laboratory, spectroscopic, and geospatial analyses, we propose that
   natural pedogenetic and hydrogeochemical processes couple to export Mn
   from the near-surface to fractured bedrock aquifers within the Piedmont.
   Dissolved Mn concentrations are greatest just below the water table and
   decrease with depth. Solid phase concentration, chemical extraction, and
   X-ray absorption spectroscopy data show that secondary Mn oxides
   accumulate near the water table within the chemically weathering
   saprolite, whereas less-reactive, primary Mn-bearing minerals dominate
   Mn speciation within the physically weathered transition zone and
   bedrock. Mass-balance calculations indicate soil weathering has depleted
   over 40\% of the original solid-phase Mn from the near-surface, and
   hydrologic gradients provide a driving force for downward delivery of
   Mn. Overall, we estimate that >1 million people in the southeastern
   Piedmont consume well water containing Mn at concentrations exceeding
   recommended standards, and collectively, these results suggest that
   integrated soil-bedrock-system analyses are needed to predict and manage
   Mn in drinking-water wells.}},

Abstract = {{We performed dynamic force spectroscopy of single dextran and titin 127
   molecules using small-amplitude and low-frequency (40-240 Hz) dithering
   of an atomic force microscope tip excited by a sine wave voltage fed
   onto the tip-carrying piezo. We show that for such low-frequency
   dithering experiments, recorded phase information can be unambiguously
   interpreted within the framework of a transparent theoretical model that
   starts from a well-known partial differential equation to describe the
   dithering of an atomic force microscope cantilever and a single molecule
   attached to its end system, uses an appropriate set of initial and
   boundary conditions, and does not exploit any implicit suggestions. We
   conclude that the observed phase (dissipation) signal is due completely
   to the dissipation related to the dithering of the cantilever itself
   (i.e., to the change of boundary conditions in the course of
   stretching). For both cases, only the upper bound of the dissipation of
   a single molecule has been established as not exceeding 3.10(-7) kg/s.
   We compare our results with previously reported measurements of the
   viscoelastic properties of single molecules, and we emphasize that
   extreme caution must be taken in distinguishing between the dissipation
   related to the stretched molecule and the dissipation that originates
   from the viscous damping of the dithered cantilever. We also present the
   results of an amplitude channel data analysis, which reveal that the
   typical values of the spring constant of a 127 molecule at the moment of
   module unfolding are equal to 4 +/- 1.5 mN/m, and the typical values of
   the spring constant of dextran at the moment of chair-boat transition
   are equal to 30 - 50 mN/m.}},

Title = {{Assimilation of virtual legs and perception of floor texture by complete
   paraplegic patients receiving artificial tactile feedback}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Spinal cord injuries disrupt bidirectional communication between the
   patient's brain and body. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for
   reproducing lower limb somatosensory feedback in paraplegics by
   remapping missing leg/foot tactile sensations onto the skin of patients'
   forearms. A portable haptic display was tested in eight patients in a
   setup where the lower limbs were simulated using immersive virtual
   reality (VR). For six out of eight patients, the haptic display induced
   the realistic illusion of walking on three different types of floor
   surfaces: beach sand, a paved street or grass. Additionally, patients
   experienced the movements of the virtual legs during the swing phase or
   the sensation of the foot rolling on the floor while walking. Relying
   solely on this tactile feedback, patients reported the position of the
   avatar leg during virtual walking. Crossmodal interference between
   vision of the virtual legs and tactile feedback revealed that patients
   assimilated the virtual lower limbs as if they were their own legs. We
   propose that the addition of tactile feedback to neuroprosthetic devices
   is essential to restore a full lower limb perceptual experience in
   spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, and will ultimately, lead to a higher
   rate of prosthetic acceptance/use and a better level of motor
   proficiency.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Malaria detection through microscopic examination of stained blood
   smears is a diagnostic challenge that heavily relies on the expertise of
   trained microscopists. This paper presents an automated analysis method
   for detection and staging of red blood cells infected by the malaria
   parasite Plasmodium falciparum at trophozoite or schizont stage. Unlike
   previous efforts in this area, this study uses quantitative phase images
   of unstained cells. Erythrocytes are automatically segmented using
   thresholds of optical phase and refocused to enable quantitative
   comparison of phase images. Refocused images are analyzed to extract 23
   morphological descriptors based on the phase information. While all
   individual descriptors are highly statistically different between
   infected and uninfected cells, each descriptor does not enable
   separation of populations at a level satisfactory for clinical utility.
   To improve the diagnostic capacity, we applied various machine learning
   techniques, including linear discriminant classification (LDC), logistic
   regression (LR), and k-nearest neighbor classification (NNC), to
   formulate algorithms that combine all of the calculated physical
   parameters to distinguish cells more effectively. Results show that LDC
   provides the highest accuracy of up to 99.7\% in detecting schizont
   stage infected cells compared to uninfected RBCs. NNC showed slightly
   better accuracy (99.5\%) than either LDC (99.0\%) or LR (99.1\%) for
   discriminating late trophozoites from uninfected RBCs. However, for
   early trophozoites, LDC produced the best accuracy of 98\%.
   Discrimination of infection stage was less accurate, producing high
   specificity (99.8\%) but only 45.0\%-66.8\% sensitivity with early
   trophozoites most often mistaken for late trophozoite or schizont stage
   and late trophozoite and schizont stage most often confused for each
   other. Overall, this methodology points to a significant clinical
   potential of using quantitative phase imaging to detect and stage
   malaria infection without staining or expert analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Visual impairment due to glaucoma currently impacts 70 million people
   worldwide. While disease progression can be slowed or stopped with
   effective lowering of intraocular pressure, current medical treatments
   are often inadequate. Fortunately, three new classes of therapeutics
   that target the diseased conventional outflow tissue responsible for
   ocular hypertension are in the final stages of human testing. The rho
   kinase inhibitors have proven particularly efficacious and additive to
   current therapies. Unfortunately, non-contact technology that monitors
   the health of outflow tissue and its response to conventional outflow
   therapy is not available clinically. Using optical coherence tomographic
   (OCT) imaging and novel segmentation software, we present the first
   demonstration of drug effects on conventional outflow tissues in living
   eyes. Topical netarsudil (formerly AR-13324), a rho kinase/nor
   epinephrine transporter inhibitor, affected both proximal (trabecular
   meshwork and Schlemm's Canal) and distal portions (intrascleral vessels)
   of the mouse conventional outflow tract. Hence, increased perfusion of
   outflow tissues was reliably resolved by OCT as widening of the
   trabecular meshwork and significant increases in cross-sectional area of
   Schlemm's canal following netarsudil treatment. These changes occurred
   in conjunction with increased outflow facility, increased speckle
   variance intensity of outflow vessels, increased tracer deposition in
   conventional outflow tissues and decreased intraocular pressure. This is
   the first report using live imaging to show real-time drug effects on
   conventional outflow tissues and specifically the mechanism of action of
   netarsudil in mouse eyes. Advancements here pave the way for development
   of a clinic-friendly OCT platform for monitoring glaucoma therapy. (C)

Title = {{Minimal subspace rotation on the Stiefel manifold for stabilization and

Abstract = {{For a projection-based reduced order model (ROM) of a fluid flow to be
   stable and accurate, the dynamics of the truncated subspace must be
   taken into account. This paper proposes an approach for stabilizing and
   enhancing projection-based fluid ROMs in which truncated modes are
   accounted for a priori via a minimal rotation of the projection
   subspace. Attention is focused on the full non-linear compressible
   Navier-Stokes equations in specific volume form as a step toward a more
   general formulation for problems with generic non-linearities. Unlike
   traditional approaches, no empirical turbulence modeling terms are
   required, and consistency between the ROM and the Navier-Stokes equation
   from which the ROM is derived is maintained. Mathematically, the
   approach is formulated as a trace minimization problem on the Stiefel
   manifold. The reproductive as well as predictive capabilities of the
   method are evaluated on several compressible flow problems, including a
   problem involving laminar flow over an airfoil with a high angle of
   attack, and a channel-driven cavity flow problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The increasing use of strategies incorporating nanoscale zero valent
   iron (nZVI) for soil and groundwater in situ remediation is raising some
   concerns regarding the potential adverse effects nZVI could have on
   indigenous microbial communities and ecosystem functioning. This review
   provides an overview of the current literature pertaining to the impacts
   of nZVI applications on microbial communities. Toxicity studies suggest
   that cell membrane disruption and oxidative stress through the
   generation of Fe2+ and reactive oxygen species by nZVI are the main
   mechanisms contributing to nZVI cytotoxicity. In addition, nZVI has been
   shown to substantially alter the taxonomic and functional composition of
   indigenous microbial communities. However, because the physicochemical
   conditions encountered in situ highly modulate nZVI toxicity, a better
   understanding of the environmental factors affecting nZVI toxicity and
   transport in the environment is of primary importance in evaluating the
   ecological consequences that could result from a more extensive use of
   nZVI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Development of myopia is associated with large-scale changes in ocular
   tissue gene expression. Although differential expression of coding genes
   underlying development of myopia has been a subject of intense
   investigation, the role of non-coding genes such as microRNAs in the
   development of myopia is largely unknown. In this study, we explored
   myopia-associated miRNA expression profiles in the retina and sclera of
   C57Bl/6J mice with experimentally induced myopia using microarray
   technology. We found a total of 53 differentially expressed miRNAs in
   the retina and no differences in miRNA expression in the sclera of
   C57BL/6J mice after 10 days of visual form deprivation, which induced
   -6.93 +/- 2.44 D (p < 0.000001, n = 12) of myopia. We also identified
   their putative mRNA targets among mRNAs found to be differentially
   expressed in myopic retina and potential signaling pathways involved in
   the development of form-deprivation myopia using miRNA-mRNA interaction
   network analysis. Analysis of myopia-associated signaling pathways
   revealed that myopic response to visual form deprivation in the retina
   is regulated by a small number of highly integrated signaling pathways.
   Our findings highlighted that changes in microRNA expression are
   involved in the regulation of refractive eye development and predicted
   how they may be involved in the development of myopia by regulating
   retinal gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Tunable mechanical response under dynamic and static loading is
   desirable for many technological applications. Traditionally, mechanical
   performance of polymeric materials is controlled by modulating
   structural (i.e., molecular weight, chain packing, or cross-link
   density) or temporal parameters (such as kinetics of the exchange of
   dynamic cross-linkers). Metal ligand interactions are uniquely suited to
   control both structural and temporal parameters as the thermodynamics
   and kinetics of mechanically active cross-linkers can be varied by
   careful selection of metal without significant synthetic modification of
   the polymer backbone. Here, we have demonstrated that it is possible to
   engineer desired mechanical properties in a metallopolymer with a high
   degree of tunability by simply changing the type and amount of added
   metal. Specifically, we cross-linked an imidazole,containing brush
   copolymer system with the divalent cations of zinc, copper, and cobalt.
   Using rheology and tensile experiments, we have correlated the emergent
   mechanical properties to the stoichiometric ratio of ligand to metal as
   well as the coordination number and ligand exchange mechanism of the
   imidazole metal. cross-links. In contrary to the general view that
   unbound free ligands are normally regarded as mechanically inactive
   dangling chains in metallopolymer networks, this study clearly shows
   that they can play a critical role in stress distribution and chain
   relaxation. Importantly, this work shows for the first time that it is
   possible to simultaneously control-both the structure of networks and
   the temporal response of bulk materials using dynamic association of
   weak, and monodentate ligands with transition metals.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Although electrical neurostimulation has been proposed as an alternative
   treatment for drug-resistant cases of epilepsy, current procedures such
   as deep brain stimulation, vagus, and trigeminal nerve stimulation are
   effective only in a fraction of the patients. Here we demonstrate a
   closed loop brain-machine interface that delivers electrical stimulation
   to the dorsal column (DCS) of the spinal cord to suppress epileptic
   seizures. Rats were implanted with cortical recording microelectrodes
   and spinal cord stimulating electrodes, and then injected with
   pentylenetetrazole to induce seizures. Seizures were detected in real
   time from cortical local field potentials, after which DCS was applied.
   This method decreased seizure episode frequency by 44\% and seizure
   duration by 38\%. We argue that the therapeutic effect of DCS is related
   to modulation of cortical theta waves, and propose that this closed-loop
   interface has the potential to become an effective and semi-invasive
   treatment for refractory epilepsy and other neurological disorders.}},

Title = {{Charge compensation and electrostatic transferability in three
   entropy-stabilized oxides: Results from density functional theory
   calculations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory calculations were carried out for three
   entropic rocksalt oxides, (Mg0.1Co0.1Ni0.1Cu0.1Zn0.1)O-0.5, termed J14,
   and J14 + Li and J14 + Sc, to understand the role of charge neutrality
   and electronic states on their properties, and to probe whether simple
   expressions may exist that predict stability. The calculations predict
   that the average lattice constants of the ternary structures provide
   good approximations to that of the random structures. For J14, Bader
   charges are transferable between the binary, ternary, and random
   structures. For J14 + Sc and J14 + Li, average Bader charges in the
   entropic structures can be estimated from the ternary compositions.
   Addition of Sc to J14 reduces the majority of Cu, which show large
   displacements from ideal lattice sites, along with reduction of a few Co
   and Ni cations. Addition of Li to J14 reduces the lattice constant,
   consistent with experiment, and oxidizes some of Co as well as some of
   Ni and Cu. The Bader charges and spin-resolved density of states (DOS)
   for Co+3 in J14 + Li are very different from Co+2, while for Cu and Ni
   the Bader charges form continuous distributions and the two DOS are
   similar for the two oxidation states. Experimental detection of
   different oxidation states may therefore be challenging for Cu and Ni
   compared to Co. Based on these results, empirical stability parameters
   for these entropic oxides may be more complicated than those for
   non-oxide entropic solids. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content,

Abstract = {{Altered cartilage loading is believed to be associated with
   osteoarthritis development. However, there are limited data regarding
   the influence of normal gait, an essential daily loading activity, on
   cartilage strains. In this study, 8 healthy subjects with no history of
   knee surgery or injury underwent magnetic resonance imaging of a single
   knee prior to and following a 20-min walking activity at approximately
   1.1 m/s. Bone and cartilage surfaces were segmented from these images
   and compiled into 3-dimensional models of the tibia, femur, and
   associated cartilage. Thickness changes were measured across a grid of
   evenly spaced points spanning the models of the articular surfaces.
   Averaged compartmental strains and local strains were then calculated.
   Overall compartmental strains after the walking activity were found to
   be significantly different from zero in all four tibiofemoral
   compartments, with tibial cartilage strain being significantly larger
   than femoral cartilage strain. These results provide baseline data
   regarding the normal tibiofemoral cartilage strain response to gait.
   Additionally, the technique employed in this study has potential to be
   used as a ``stress test{''} to understand how factors including age,
   weight, and injury influence tibiofemoral cartilage strain response,
   essential information in the development of potential treatment
   strategies for the prevention of osteoarthritis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Wearable inertial sensors measure human head impact kinematics important
   to the on-going development and validation of head injury criteria.
   However, sensor specifications have not been scientifically justified in
   the context of the anticipated field impact dynamics. The objective of
   our study is to determine the minimum bandwidth and sample rate required
   to capture the impact frequency response relevant to injury. We used
   high-bandwidth head impact data as ground-truth measurements, and
   investigated the attenuation of various injury criteria at lower
   bandwidths. Given a 10\% attenuation threshold, we determined the
   minimum bandwidths required to study injury criteria based on skull
   kinematics and brain deformation in three different model systems:
   helmeted cadaver (no neck), unhelmeted cadaver (no neck), and helmeted
   dummy impacts (with neck). We found that higher bandwidths are required
   for unhelmeted impacts in general and for studying strain rate injury
   criteria. Minimum gyroscope bandwidths of 300 Hz in helmeted sports and
   500 Hz in unhelmeted sports are necessary to study strain rate based
   injury criteria. A minimum accelerometer bandwidth of 500 Hz in
   unhelmeted sports is necessary to study most injury criteria. Current
   devices typically sample at 1000 Hz, with gyroscope bandwidths below 200
   Hz, which are not always sufficient according to these requirements.
   With hard contact test conditions, the identified requirements may be
   higher than most soft contacts on the field, but should be satisfied to
   capture the worst contact, and often higher risk, scenarios relative to
   the specific sport or activity. Our findings will help establish
   standard guidelines for sensor choice and design in traumatic brain
   injury research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A 3D Poly(ethylene glycol)-based Tumor Angiogenesis Model to Study the
   Influence of Vascular Cells on Lung Tumor Cell Behavior}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Tumor angiogenesis is critical to tumor growth and metastasis, yet much
   is unknown about the role vascular cells play in the tumor
   microenvironment. In vitro models that mimic in vivo tumor
   neovascularization facilitate exploration of this role. Here we
   investigated lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells (344SQ) and endothelial
   and pericyte vascular cells encapsulated in cell-adhesive,
   proteolytically-degradable poly(ethylene) glycol-based hydrogels. 344SQ
   in hydrogels formed spheroids and secreted proangiogenic growth factors
   that significantly increased with exposure to transforming growth factor
   beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a potent tumor progression-promoting factor.
   Vascular cells in hydrogels formed tubule networks with localized
   activated TGF-beta 1. To study cancer cell-vascular cell interactions,
   we engineered a 2-layer hydrogel with 344SQ and vascular cell layers.
   Large, invasive 344SQ clusters (area > 5,000 mu m(2), circularity <
   0.25) developed at the interface between the layers, and were not
   evident further from the interface or in control hydrogels without
   vascular cells. A modified model with spatially restricted 344SQ and
   vascular cell layers confirmed that observed cluster morphological
   changes required close proximity to vascular cells. Additionally,
   TGF-beta 1 inhibition blocked endothelial cell-driven 344SQ migration.
   Our findings suggest vascular cells contribute to tumor progression and
   establish this culture system as a platform for studying tumor
   vascularization.}},

Abstract = {{Overexpression of exogenous fate-specifying transcription factors can
   directly reprogram differentiated somatic cells to target cell types.
   Here, we show that similar reprogramming can also be achieved through
   the direct activation of endogenous genes using engineered
   CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators. We use this approach to
   induce activation of the endogenous Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l genes (BAM
   factors) to convert mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal
   cells. This direct activation of endogenous genes rapidly remodeled the
   epigenetic state of the target loci and induced sustained endogenous
   gene expression during reprogramming. Thus, transcriptional activation
   and epigenetic remodeling of endogenous master transcription factors are
   sufficient for conversion between cell types. The rapid and sustained
   activation of endogenous genes in their native chromatin context by this
   approach may facilitate reprogramming with transientmethods that avoid
   genomic integration and provides a new strategy for overcoming
   epigenetic barriers to cell fate specification.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{From the timing of amoeba development to the maintenance of stem cell
   pluripotency, many biological signaling pathways exhibit the ability to
   differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in the regulation
   of downstream gene expression. While the networks underlying this signal
   decoding are diverse, many are built around a common motif, the
   incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL), where an input simultaneously
   activates an output and an inhibitor of the output. With appropriate
   parameters, this motif can exhibit temporal adaptation, where the system
   is desensitized to a sustained input. This property serves as the
   foundation for distinguishing input signals with varying temporal
   profiles. Here, we use quantitative modeling to examine another property
   of IFFLs-the ability to process oscillatory signals. Our results
   indicate that the system's ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is
   limited by two constraints. The kinetics of the IFFL components dictate
   the input range for which the network is able to decode pulsatile
   dynamics. In addition, a match between the network parameters and input
   signal characteristics is required for optimal ``counting{''}. We
   elucidate one potential mechanism by which information processing occurs
   in natural networks, and our work has implications in the design of
   synthetic gene circuits for this purpose.}},

Title = {{Framework for event-based semidistributed modeling that unifies the
   SCS-CN method, VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologists and engineers may choose from a range of semidistributed
   rainfall-runoff models such as VIC, PDM, and TOPMODEL, all of which
   predict runoff from a distribution of watershed properties. However,
   these models are not easily compared to event-based data and are missing
   ready-to-use analytical expressions that are analogous to the SCS-CN
   method. The SCS-CN method is an event-based model that describes the
   runoff response with a rainfall-runoff curve that is a function of the
   cumulative storm rainfall and antecedent wetness condition. Here we
   develop an event-based probabilistic storage framework and distill
   semidistributed models into analytical, event-based expressions for
   describing the rainfall-runoff response. The event-based versions called
   VICx, PDMx, and TOPMODELx also are extended with a spatial description
   of the runoff concept of prethreshold and threshold-excess runoff, which
   occur, respectively, before and after infiltration exceeds a storage
   capacity threshold. For total storm rainfall and antecedent wetness
   conditions, the resulting ready-to-use analytical expressions define the
   source areas (fraction of the watershed) that produce runoff by each
   mechanism. They also define the probability density function (PDF)
   representing the spatial variability of runoff depths that are

   runoff, which describes the so-called runoff curve. These new
   event-based semidistributed models and the traditional SCS-CN method are
   unified by the same general expression for the runoff curve. Since the
   general runoff curve may incorporate different model distributions, it
   may ease the way for relating such distributions to land use, climate,
   topography, ecology, geology, and other characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To assess the reliability of manual choroidal thickness
   measurements by comparing different posterior boundary definitions of
   the choroidal-scleral junction on enhanced depth imaging optical
   coherence tomography (EDI-OCT).
   DESIGN: Reliability analysis.
   METHODS: Two graders marked the choroidal-scleral junction with
   segmentation software using different posterior boundaries: (1) the
   outer border of the choroidal vessel lumen, (2) the outer border of the
   choroid stroma, and (3) the inner border of the sclera, to measure the
   vascular choroidal thickness (VCT), stromal choroidal thickness (SCT),
   and total choroidal thickness (TCT), respectively. Measurements were
   taken at 0.5-mm intervals from 1.5 mm nasal to 1.5 mm temporal to the
   fovea, and averaged continuously across the central 3 mm of the macula.
   Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of reliability
   (CR) were compared to assess inter grader and intragrader reliability.
   RESULTS: Choroidal thickness measurements varied significantly with
   different posterior boundaries (P < .001 for all). Intergrader ICCs were
   greater for SCT (0.959-0.980) than for TCT (0.928-0.963) and VCT
   (0.750-0.869), even in eyes where choroidal-scleral junction visibility
   was < 75\%. Intergrader CRs were lower for SCT (41.40-62.31) than for
   TCT (61.13-74.24) or VCT (72.44-115.11). ICCs and CRs showed greater
   reliability for averaged VCT, SCT, or TCT measurements than at
   individual locations. Intragrader ICCs and CRs were comparable to
   intergrader values.
   CONCLUSIONS: Choroidal thickness measurements are more reproducible when
   measured to the border of the choroid stroma (SCT) than the vascular
   lumen (VCT) or sclera (TCT). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we propose a low-cost cross-polarized dark field
   microscopy system for in vivo vascular imaging to detect head and neck
   cancer. A simple-to-use Gabor-filter-based image processing technique
   was developed to objectively and automatically quantify several
   important vascular features, including tortuosity, length, diameter and
   area fraction, from vascular images. Simulations were performed to
   evaluate the accuracies of vessel segmentation and feature extraction
   for our algorithm. Sensitivity and specificity for vessel segmentation
   of the Gabor masks both remained above 80\% at all contrast levels when
   compared to gold-standard masks. Errors for vascular feature extraction
   were under 5\%. Moreover, vascular contrast and vessel diameter were
   identified to be the two primary factors which affected the segmentation
   accuracies. After our algorithm was validated, we monitored the blood
   vessels in an inducible hamster cheek pouch carcinogen model over 17
   weeks and quantified vascular features during carcinogenesis. A
   significant increase in vascular tortuosity and a significant decrease
   in vessel length were observed during carcinogenesis. (C)2016 Optical

Abstract = {{We briefly review recent progress in techniques for modeling and
   analyzing hyperspectral images and movies, in particular for detecting
   plumes of both known and unknown chemicals. For detecting chemicals of
   known spectrum, we extend the technique of using a single subspace for
   modeling the background to a ``mixture of subspaces{''} model to tackle
   more complicated background. Furthermore, we use partial least squares
   regression on a resampled training set to boost performance. For the
   detection of unknown chemicals, we view the problem as an anomaly
   detection problem and use novel estimators with low-sampled complexity
   for intrinsically low-dimensional data in high dimensions that enable us
   to model the ``normal{''} spectra and detect anomalies. We apply these
   algorithms to benchmark datasets made available by the Automated Target
   Detection program cofunded by NSF, DTRA, and NGA, and compare, when
   applicable, to current state-of-the-art algorithms, with favorable
   results.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Expressions for the logarithmic variations of the normalized turbulent
   longitudinal velocity ((u(2p)) over bar (+))(1/p) with normalized
   distance z/delta from a boundary for high-order (p) moments in the
   intermediate region of wall bounded flows characterized by thickness
   delta are derived. The ansatz that ((u(2p)) over bar (+))(1/p) variation
   in ln(z/delta) originates from a compound effect of random sweeping and
   -1 power-law scaling in the longitudinal velocity spectrum E-u(k) is
   discussed, where k is the wavenumber. Using velocity time series sampled
   above a uniform ice sheet, an E-u(k) similar to k(-1) scaling is
   confirmed for k z < 1 and k delta > 1. The data were then used to
   analyze assumptions required for the utility of the random sweeping
   decorrelation (RSD) hypothesis connecting the k-1 power-law with
   log-scaling in ((u(2p)) over bar (+))(1/p). It has been found out that
   while the RSD hypothesis is operationally applicable to scales
   associated with attached eddies bounded by k z < 1 and kd > 1,
   significant interactions among high-order turbulent velocity and
   velocity increments lead to the conclusion that the RSD hypothesis
   cannot be exactly valid. Its operational utility stems from the
   observations that some of the interaction terms among the high-order
   velocity and velocity increments act in opposite directions thereby
   canceling their additive effects in RSD. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method for elastic
   waves suffers from the staircasing error when applied to model a curved
   free surface because of its structured grid. In this work, an improved,
   stable and accurate 3-D FDTD method for elastic wave modelling on a
   curved free surface is developed based on the finite volume method and
   enlarged cell technique (ECT). To achieve a sufficiently accurate
   implementation, a finite volume scheme is applied to the curved free
   surface to remove the staircasing error; in the mean time, to achieve
   the same stability as the FDTD method without reducing the time step
   increment, the ECT is introduced to preserve the solution stability by
   enlarging small irregular cells into adjacent cells under the condition
   of conservation of force. This method is verified by several 3-D
   numerical examples. Results show that the method is stable at the
   Courant stability limit for a regular FDTD grid, and has much higher
   accuracy than the conventional FDTD method.}},

Abstract = {{The movement from discrete transistors to integrated silicon circuits
   led to the rapid evolution of microscale electronics, but there has been
   no equivalent transition for the vacuum tube transistor. Difficulty
   integrating devices at microscales has hindered the use of vacuum
   electronic circuits, despite the unique advantages they offer in
   selected applications. The development of the field emission
   microfabricated cathode offers the potential to take advantage of the
   benefits of the vacuum technology in an integrated platform. This paper
   utilizes an MEMS carbon nanotube field emission vacuum microelectronic
   device as an active circuit element. Using a combination of particle
   trajectory simulation and experimental characterization, we investigated
   device performance in an integrated platform. Specifically, we present
   solutions for the operation of multiple devices in close proximity and
   for enhancing transmission (i.e., reducing grid loss) in vacuum field
   emission devices. The isolation structures reduced the crosstalk between
   neighboring devices from 14\% on average, to nearly zero. Innovative
   geometries and a new operational mode reduced the grid loss by nearly
   three times, improving transmission of the current from the cathode to
   the anode from 25\% from the previous designs to 70\% on average. These
   performance enhancements are the important enablers for larger scale
   integration and for the realization of complex vacuum microelectronic
   circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Duchenne muscular dystrophy is one of the most common inherited genetic
   diseases and is caused by mutations to the DMD gene that encodes the
   dystrophin protein. Recent advances in genome editing and gene therapy
   offer hope for the development of potential therapeutics. Truncated
   versions of the DMD gene can be delivered to the affected tissues with
   viral vectors and show promising results in a variety of animal models.
   Genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been used to
   restore dystrophin expression by deleting one or more exons of the DMD
   gene in patient cells and in a mouse model that led to functional
   improvement of muscle strength. Exon skipping with oligonucleotides has
   been successful in several animal models and evaluated in multiple
   clinical trials. Next-generation oligonucleotide formulations offer
   significant promise to build on these results. All these approaches to
   restoring dystrophin expression are encouraging, but many hurdles
   remain. This review summarizes the current state of these technologies
   and summarizes considerations for their future development.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D stacked network-on-chip (NOC) promises the integration of a large
   number of cores in a many-core system-on-chip (SOC). The NOC can be used
   to test the embedded cores in such SOCs, whereby the added cost of
   dedicated test-access hardware can be avoided. However, a potential
   problem associated with 3D NOC-based test access is the emergence of
   hotspots due to stacking and the high toggle rates associated with
   structural test patterns used for manufacturing test. High temperatures
   and hotspots can lead to the failure of good parts, resulting in yield
   loss. We describe a unicast-based multicast approach and a
   thermal-driven test scheduling method to avoid hotspots, whereby the
   full NOC bandwidth is used to deliver test packets. Test delivery is
   carried out using a new unicast-based multicast scheme. Experimental
   results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing

Abstract = {{Cervical softness is a critical parameter in pregnancy. Clinically,
   preterm birth is associated with premature cervical softening and
   postdates birth is associated with delayed cervical softening. In
   practice, the assessment of softness is subjective, based on digital
   examination. Fortunately, objective, quantitative techniques to assess
   softness, and other parameters associated with microstructural cervical
   change are emerging. One of these is shear wave speed (SWS) estimation.
   In principle, this allows objective characterization of stiffness
   because waves travel more slowly in softer tissue. We are studying SWS
   in humans and rhesus macaques, the latter in order to accelerate
   translation from bench to bedside. For the current study, we estimated
   SWS in ex vivo cervices of rhesus macaques, n = 24 nulliparous (never
   given birth) and n = 9 multiparous (delivered at least one baby).
   Misoprostol (a prostaglandin used to soften human cervices prior to
   gynecological procedures) was administered to 13 macaques prior to
   necropsy (nulliparous: 7; multiparous: 6). SWS measurements were made at
   predetermined locations from the distal to proximal end of the cervix on
   both the anterior and posterior cervix, with five repeat measures at
   each location. The intent was to explore macaque cervical
   microstructure, including biological and spatial variability, to
   elucidate the similarities and differences between the macaque and the
   human cervix in order to facilitate future in vivo studies. We found
   that SWS is dependent on location in the normal nonpregnant macaque
   cervix, as in the human cervix. Unlike the human cervix, we detected no
   difference between ripened and unripened rhesus macaque cervix samples,
   nor nulliparous versus multiparous samples, although we observed a trend
   toward stiffer tissue in nulliparous samples. We found rhesus macaque
   cervix to be much stiffer than human, which is important for technique
   refinement. These findings are useful for guiding study of cervical
   microstructure in both humans and macaques.}},

Abstract = {{Viscoelastic response (VisR) ultrasound is an acoustic radiation force
   (ARF)-based imaging method that fits induced displacements to a
   one-dimensional (1-D) mass-spring-damper (MSD) model to estimate the
   ratio of viscous to elastic moduli, tau, in viscoelastic materials.
   Error in VisR tau estimation arises from inertia and acoustic
   displacement underestimation. These error sources are herein evaluated
   using finite-element method (FEM) simulations, error correction methods
   are developed, and corrected VisR tau estimates are compared with true
   simulated tau values to assess VisR's relevance to quantifying
   viscoelasticity. With regard to inertia, adding a mass term in series
   with the Voigt model, to achieve the MSD model, accounts for inertia due
   to tissue mass when ideal point force excitations are used. However,
   when volumetric ARF excitations are applied, the induced complex system
   inertia is not described by the single-degree-of-freedom MSD model,
   causing VisR to overestimate tau. Regarding acoustic displacement
   underestimation, associated deformation of ARF-induced displacement
   profiles further distorts VisR tau estimates. However, median error in
   VisR tau is reduced to approximately -10\% using empirically derived
   error correction functions applied to simulated viscoelastic materials
   with viscous and elastic properties representative of tissue. The
   feasibility of corrected VisR imaging is then demonstrated in vivo in
   the rectus femoris muscle of an adult with no known neuromuscular
   disorders. These results suggest VisR's potential relevance to
   quantifying viscoelastic properties clinically.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, there has been an increased interest in
   characterizing cardiac tissue mechanics utilizing newly developed
   ultrasound-based elastography techniques. These methods excite the
   tissue mechanically and track the response. Two frequently used methods,
   acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and shear-wave elasticity
   imaging (SWEI), have been considered qualitative and quantitative
   techniques providing relative and absolute measures of tissue stiffness,
   respectively. Depending on imaging conditions, it is desirable to
   identify indices of cardiac function that could be measured by ARFI and
   SWEI and to characterize the relationship between the measures. In this
   study, we have compared two indices (i.e., relaxation time constant used
   for diastolic dysfunction assessment and systolic/diastolic stiffness
   ratio) measured nearly simultaneously by M-mode ARFI and SWEI
   techniques. We additionally correlated ARFI-measured inverse
   displacements with SWEI-measured values of the shear modulus of
   stiffness. For the eight animals studied, the average relaxation time
   constant (tau) measured by ARFI and SWEI were (69 +/- 18 ms, R-2 = 0.96)
   and (65 +/- 19 ms, R-2 = 0.99), respectively (ARFI-SWEI inter-rater
   agreement = 0.90). Average systolic/diastolic stiffness ratios for ARFI
   and SWEI measurements were 6.01 +/- 1.37 and 7.12 +/- 3.24, respectively
   (agreement = 0.70). Shear modulus of stiffness (SWEI) was linearly
   related to inverse displacement values (ARFI) with a 95\% CI for the
   slope of 0.010-0.011 (1/mu m)/(kPa) (R-2 = 0.73). In conclusion, the
   relaxation time constant and the systolic/diastolic stiffness ratio were
   calculated with good agreement between the ARFI- and SWEI-derived
   measurements. ARFI relative and SWEI absolute stiffness measurements
   were linearly related with varying slopes based on imaging conditions
   and subject tissue properties.}},

Abstract = {{Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) and its long term
   consequences are a major health concern among veterans. Despite recent
   work enhancing our knowledge about bTBI, very little is known about the
   contribution of the blast wave alone to the observed sequelae. Herein,
   we isolated its contribution in a mouse model by constraining the
   animals' heads during exposure to a shockwave (primary blast). Our
   results show that exposure to primary blast alone results in changes in
   hippocampus-dependent behaviors that correspond with
   electro-physiological changes in area CA1 and are accompanied by
   reactive gliosis. Specifically, five days after exposure, behavior in an
   open field and performance in a spatial object recognition (SOR) task
   were significantly different from sham. Network electrophysiology, also
   performed five days after injury, demonstrated a significant decrease in
   excitability and increase in inhibitory tone. Immunohistochemistry for
   GFAP and Iba1 performed ten days after injury showed a significant
   increase in staining. Interestingly, a threefold increase in the impulse
   of the primary blast wave did not exacerbate these measures. However, we
   observed a significant reduction in the contribution of the NMDA
   receptors to the field EPSP at the highest blast exposure level. Our
   results emphasize the need to account for the effects of primary blast
   loading when studying the sequelae of bTBI. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Charge transport at the contacts is a dominant factor in determining the
   performance of devices using 2D MoS2. Using a low-energy beam of Ar
   ions, the interface between Ni and MoS2 was modified to improve the
   performance in 2D field-effect transistors (FETs). This broad-beam ion
   source is integrated into an ultrahigh vacuum, physical vapor deposition
   system that allowed for in situ modification of the MoS2 immediately
   prior to Ni contact deposition. The contact resistance decreased leading
   to a corresponding and highly reproducible boost in the on-current by up
   to four times. Spectroscopic analysis of the ion beam-modified MoS2
   suggests that there are generated defects, which supply dangling bonds
   that improve carrier injection between the Ni metal contact and MoS2.
   This approach for modifying the Ni-MoS2 interface opens a promising new
   path for reducing the impact of contacts on MoS2 FET performance.}},

Abstract = {{The fast scattering and inverse scattering algorithms for acoustic wave
   propagation and scattering in a layered medium with buried objects are
   an important research topic, especially for large-scale geophysical
   applications and for target detection. There have been increasing
   efforts in the development of practical, accurate, and efficient means
   of imaging subsurface target anomalies. In this work, the acoustic
   scattering problem in layered media is formulated as a volume integral
   equation and is solved by the stabilized bi-conjugate gradient fast
   Fourier transform (BCGS-FFT) method. By splitting the layered medium
   Green's function interacting with the induced source into a convolution
   and a correlation, the acoustic fields can be calculated efficiently by
   the FFT algorithm. This allows both the forward solution and inverse
   solution to be computed with only O(N logN) computation time per
   iteration, where N is the number of degrees of freedom. The inverse
   scattering is solved using a simultaneous multiple frequency contrast
   source inversion (CSI). The stable convergence of this inversion process
   makes the multiple frequency simultaneous CSI reconstruction practical
   for large acoustic problems. Some representative examples are shown to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the forward and inverse solvers for
   acoustic applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a composite scaffold consisting of an electrospun
   polyurethane and poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel was investigated for
   aortic valve tissue engineering. This multilayered approach permitted
   the fabrication of a scaffold that met the desired mechanical
   requirements while enabling the 3D culture of cells. The scaffold was
   tuned to mimic the tensile strength, anisotropy, and extensibility of
   the natural aortic valve through design of the electrospun polyurethane
   mesh layer. Valve interstitial cells were encapsulated inside the
   hydrogel portion of the scaffold around the electrospun mesh, creating a
   composite scaffold approximately 200 mu m thick. The stiffness of the
   electrospun fibers caused the encapsulated cells to exhibit an activated
   phenotype that resulted in fibrotic remodeling of the scaffold in a
   heterogeneous manner. Remodeling was further explored by culturing the
   scaffolds in both a mechanically constrained state and in a bent state.
   The constrained scaffolds demonstrated strong fibrotic remodeling with
   cells aligning in the direction of the mechanical constraint. Bent
   scaffolds demonstrated that applied mechanical forces could influence
   cell behavior. Cells seeded on the outside curve of the bend exhibited
   an activated, fibrotic response, while cells seeded on the inside curve
   of the bend were a quiescent phenotype, demonstrating potential control
   over the fibrotic behavior of cells. Overall, these results indicate
   that this polyurethane/hydrogel scaffold mimics the structural and
   functional heterogeneity of native valves and warrants further
   investigation to be used as a model for understanding fibrotic valve
   disease.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE \& PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are being explored in many different applications due to
   the unique properties offered by quantum effects. To broaden the scope
   of these applications, the deposition of nanoparticles onto substrates
   in a simple and controlled way is highly desired. In this study, we use
   resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE)
   for the deposition of metallic, silver nanoparticles for plasmonic
   applications. We find that RIR-MAPLE, a simple and versatile approach,
   is able to deposit silver nanoparticles as large as 80 nm onto different
   substrates with good adhesion, regardless of substrate properties. In
   addition, the nanoparticle surface coverage of the substrates, which
   result from the random distribution of nanoparticles across the
   substrate per laser pulse, can be simply and precisely controlled by
   RIR-MAPLE. Polymer films of poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) are
   also deposited by RIR-MAPLE on top of the deposited silver nanoparticles
   in order to demonstrate enhanced absorption due to the localized surface
   plasmon resonance effect. The reported features of RIR-MAPLE
   nanoparticle deposition indicate that this tool can enable efficient
   processing of nanoparticle thin films for applications that require
   specific substrates or configurations that are not easily achieved using
   solution-based approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Since soil erosion is driven by overland flow, it is fair to expect
   heterogeneity in erosion and deposition in both space and time. In this
   study, we develop and evaluate an open-source, spatially-explicit,
   sediment erosion, deposition and transport module for the distributed
   hydrological model, GEOtop. The model was applied in Dripsey catchment
   in Ireland, where it captured the total discharge volume and suspended
   sediment yield (SSY) with a relative bias of -1.2\% and -22.4\%,
   respectively. Simulation results suggest that daily SSY per unit
   rainfall amount was larger when the top soil was near saturation.
   Simulated erosion and deposition areas, which varied markedly between
   events, were also found to be directly influenced by spatial patterns of
   soil saturation. The distinct influence of soil saturation on erosion,
   deposition and SSY underscores the role of coupled surface-subsurface
   hydrologic interactions and a need to represent them in models for
   capturing fine resolution sediment dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   MIMO array composed of a compact receiving subarray and M spatially
   dispersed transmitters, there are M ghosts at the same side of the wall
   as the array. The mth ghost is supposed to occur near the intersection
   of the line, connecting the target and the center of the receiving
   subarray, and the ellipse whose foci are the positions of the target and
   the mth transmitter. Under the assumption of phase uniform distribution
   clutter, the PCF can suppress the ghosts up to -20lg (1-root(M-2 -

Abstract = {{We present a novel distributed algorithm for convex constrained
   optimization problems that are subject to noise corruption and
   uncertainties. The proposed scheme can be classified as a distributed
   stochastic approximation method, where a unique feature here is that we
   allow for multiple noise terms to appear in both the computation and
   communication stages of the distributed iterative process. Specifically,
   we consider problems that involve multiple agents optimizing a separable
   convex objective function subject to convex local constraints and linear
   coupling constraints. This is a richer class of problems compared to
   those that can be handled by existing distributed stochastic
   approximation methods which consider only consensus constraints and
   fewer sources of noise. The proposed algorithm utilizes the augmented
   Lagrangian (AL) framework, which has been widely used recently to solve
   deterministic optimization problems in a distributed way. We show that
   the proposed method generates sequences of primal and dual variables
   that converge to their respective optimal sets almost surely.}},

Abstract = {{The ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a popular and successful remote
   sensing modality that has been investigated for landmine detection. GPR
   offers excellent detection performance, but it is limited by a low rate
   of advance (ROA) due to its short sensing standoff distance. Standoff
   distance refers to the distance between the sensing platform and the
   location in front of the platform where the GPR senses the ground. Large
   standoff (high ROA) sensing modalities have been investigated as
   alternatives to the GPR, but they do not yet achieve comparable
   detection performance. This paper proposes a new sensor management
   approach, called multistate management (MSM), which combines large and
   short standoff sensors on the same platform in a way that leverages
   their respective advantages, yielding a system with better ROA and
   detection performance. MSMis more difficult to analyze than traditional
   systems because it allows sensor activity and system velocity to change
   over time. Therefore, a new probabilistic model based on queuing theory,
   called Q-MSM, is also proposed for analyzing and designing detection
   systems operating with MSM. Simulations were conducted using real
   field-collected data for a system with a large standoff forward-looking
   infrared camera and a GPR. The system is operated with MSM, and the
   results show that this leads to better ROA and detection performance
   than can be attained otherwise. Furthermore, the results show that Q-MSM
   can accurately predict the behavior of theMSMsystem, validating its
   utility for analyzing and designing such systems.}},

Abstract = {{We study the capacity region of two-user erasure interference channels
   with local delayed channel state information at the transmitters. In our
   model, transmitters have local mismatched outdated knowledge of the
   channel gains. We propose a transmission strategy that only relies on
   the delayed knowledge of the outgoing links at each transmitter and
   achieves the outer bound for the scenario in which transmitters learn
   the entire channel state with delay. Our result reveals the subset of
   the channel state information that affects the capacity region the most.
   We also identify cases in which local delayed knowledge of the channel
   state does not provide any gain over the zero knowledge assumption. To
   do so, we revisit a long-known intuition about interference channels
   that as long as the marginal distributions at the receivers are
   conserved, the capacity remains the same. We take this intuition and
   impose a certain spatial correlation among channel gains such that the
   marginal distributions remain unchanged. Then, we provide an outer bound
   on the capacity region of the channel with correlation that matches the
   capacity region when transmitters do not have access to channel state
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Gallium (Ga), a group Ill metal, is of fundamental interest due to its
   polymorphism and unusual phase transition behaviours. New solid phases
   have been observed when Ga is confined at the nanoscale. Herein, we
   demonstrate the stable coexistence, from 180 K to 800 K, of the
   unexpected solid gamma-phase core and a liquid shell in
   substrate-supported Ga nanoparticles. We show that the support plays a
   fundamental role in determining Ga nanoparticle phases, with the driving
   forces for the nucleation of the gamma-phase being the Laplace pressure
   in the nanoparticles and the epitaxial relationship of this phase to the
   substrate. We exploit the change in the amplitude of the evolving
   surface plasmon resonance of Ga nanoparticle ensembles during synthesis
   to reveal in real time the solid core formation in the liquid Ga
   nanoparticle. Finally, we provide a general framework for understanding
   how nanoscale confinement, interfacial and surface energies, and
   crystalline relationships to the substrate enable and stabilize the
   coexistence of unexpected phases.}},

Abstract = {{Enabled by adaptive optics, retinal photoreceptor cell imaging is
   changing our understanding of retinal structure(1,'2) and function(3,4),
   as well as the pathogenesis of numerous ocular disease(5). To date, use
   of this technology has been limited to cooperative adult subjects due to
   the size, weight and inconvenience of the equipment, thus excluding
   study of retinal maturation during human development. Here, we report
   the design and operation of a handheld probe that can perform both
   scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography of the
   parafoveal photoreceptor structure in infants and children without the
   need for adaptive optics. The probe, featuring a compact optical design
   weighing only 94 g, was able to quantify packing densities of parafoveal
   cone photoreceptors and visualize cross-sectional photoreceptor
   substructure in children with ages ranging from 14 months to 12 years.
   The probe will benefit paediatric research by improving the
   understanding of retinal development, maldevelopment and early onset of
   disease during human growth.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{The diverse biological effects of xenoestrogens may be explained by
   their ability to differentially recruit co-regulatory proteins to the
   estrogen receptor (ER). We employed high-throughput receptor affinity
   binding and co-regulatory protein recruitment screening assays based on
   fluorescence polarization and time resolved florescence resonance energy
   transfer (TR-FRET), respectively, to assess xenoestrogen-specific
   binding and co-regulatory protein recruitment to the ER. Then we used a
   functional proteomic assay based on co-immunoprecipitation of ER-bound
   proteins to isolate and identify intact co-regulatory proteins recruited
   to a ligand-activated ER. Through these approaches, we revealed
   differential binding affinity of bisphenol-A (BPA) and genistein (GEN)
   to the human ER alpha (ESR1) and ligand-dependent recruitment of SRC-1
   and SRC-3 peptides. Recruitment profiles were variable for each ligand
   and in some cases were distinct compared to 17 beta-estradiol (E2). For
   example, E2 and GEN recruited both SRC-1 and -3 peptides whereas BPA
   recruited only SRC-1 peptides. Results of the functional proteomic assay
   showed differential recruitment between ligands where E2 recruited the
   greatest number of proteins followed by BPA then GEN. A number of
   proteins share previously identified relationships with ESR1 as
   determined by STRING analysis. Although there was limited overlap in
   proteins identified between treatments, all ligands recruited proteins
   involved in cell growth as determined by subnetwork enrichment analysis
   (p < 0.05). A comparative, in silico analysis revealed that fewer
   interactions exist between zebrafish (Danio rerio) esr1 and zebrafish
   orthologs of proteins identified in our functional proteomic analysis.
   Taken together these results identify recruitment of known and
   previously unknown co-regulatory proteins to ESR1 and highlight new
   methods to assay recruitment of low abundant and intact, endogenous
   co-regulatory proteins to ESR1 or other nuclear receptors, in both human
   and aquatic species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   range. Moreover, electromagnetic simulations are performed and
   demonstrate good agreement with experimental results and further reveal
   the evolution of optical properties from the optically thick film to the

Abstract = {{Intensive monitoring was carried out to evaluate the performance of a
   full-scale innovative swine waste-to-energy system at a commercial swine
   farm with 8640 heads of swine. Detailed mass balances over each unit of
   the system showed that the system, which includes a 7600 m(3) anaerobic
   digester, a 65-kW microturbine, and a 4200 m(3) aeration basin, was able
   to remove up to 92\% of the chemical oxygen demand ( COD), 99\% of the
   biological oxygen demand ( BOD), 77\% of the total nitrogen ( TN), and
   82\% of the total phosphorous ( TP) discharged into the system as fresh
   pig waste. The overall biogas yield based on the COD input was 64\% of
   the maximum theoretical, a value that indicates that even greater
   environmental benefits could be obtained with process optimization.
   Overall, the characterization of the materials fluxes in the system

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a technology that facilitates
   communication between vehicles by creating a `mobile Internet'. The
   system aims at ensuring road safety and achieving secured commutation.
   For this reason, reliability and survivability of the network become
   matters of prime concern. Reliability and survivability of the network
   is immensely dependent upon the hardware and channel availability. This
   paper, primarily focuses on the reliability and survivability of VANET
   as a function of reliable hardware and channel availability. The
   reliability of the vehicles and the road side equipment is investigated
   using reliability block diagrams. The survivability of the network, with
   respect to reliable hardware and channel availability is explored using
   Markov chains and Markov reward model. Considering that the
   communication between the vehicles may take place directly (i.e.,
   vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)) or through the road side equipment (i.e.,
   vehicle-to-roadside (V2R)), the evaluation is ascertained for both V2V
   and V2R communications methodology, in terms of network reliability,
   connectivity and message lost due to unreliable hardware or channel
   availability. The technique of hierarchical modeling is adopted for the
   same. The results are also verified against simulation. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Both chemical and mechanical stimuli can dramatically influence cell
   behavior. By optimizing the signals cell's experience, it may be
   possible to control the behavior of therapeutic cell populations. In
   this work, biomimetic geometries of adhesive ligands, which recapitulate
   the morphology of mature cells, are used to direct human mesenchymal
   stem cell (HMSC) differentiation toward a desired lineage. Specifically,
   adipocytes cultured in 2D are imaged and used to develop biomimetic
   virtual masks used in laser scanning lithography to form patterned
   fibronectin surfaces: The impact of adipocyte-derived pattern geometry
   on HMSC differentiation is compared to the behavior of HMSCs cultured on
   square and circle geometries, as well as adipocyte-derived patterns
   modified to include high stress regions. HMSCs on adipocyte mimetic
   geometries demonstrate greater adipogenesis than HMSCs on the other
   :patterns. Greater than 45\% of all HMSCs cultured on adipocyte mimetic
   patterns underwent adipogenesis as compared to approximately 19\% of
   cells on modified adipocyte patterns with higher stress regions. These
   results are attributed to variations in cytoskeletal tension experienced
   by cells on the different protein micropatterns. The effects of geometry
   on adipogenesis are mitigated by the incorporation of a cytoskeletal
   protein inhibitor; exposure to this inhibitor leads to increased
   adipogenesis on all patterns examined.}},

Abstract = {{Volumetric acquisition with anterior segment optical coherence
   tomography (ASOCT) is necessary to obtain accurate representations of
   the tissue structure and to account for asymmetries of the anterior eye
   anatomy. Additionally, recent interest in imaging of anterior segment
   vasculature and aqueous humor flow resulted in application of OCT
   angiography techniques to generate en face and 3D micro-vasculature maps
   of the anterior segment. Unfortunately, ASOCT structural and vasculature
   imaging systems do not capture volumes instantaneously and are subject
   to motion artifacts due to involuntary eye motion that may hinder their
   accuracy and repeatability. Several groups have demonstrated real-time
   tracking for motion-compensated in vivo OCT retinal imaging, but these
   techniques are not applicable in the anterior segment. In this work, we
   demonstrate a simple and low-cost pupil tracking system integrated into
   a custom swept-source OCT system for real-time motion-compensated
   anterior segment volumetric imaging. Pupil oculography hardware coaxial
   with the swept-source OCT system enabled fast detection and tracking of
   the pupil centroid. The pupil tracking ASOCT system with a field of view
   of 15 x 15 mm achieved diffraction-limited imaging over a lateral
   tracking range of +/-2.5 mm and was able to correct eye motion at up to
   22 Hz. Pupil tracking ASOCT offers a novel real-time motion compensation
   approach that may facilitate accurate and reproducible anterior segment
   imaging.}},

Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{An impedance matched surface is able, in principle, to totally absorb
   the incident sound and yield no reflection, and this is desired in many
   acoustic applications. Here we demonstrate a design of impedance matched
   sound absorbing surface with a simple construction. By coupling
   different resonators and generating a hybrid resonance mode, we designed
   and fabricated a metasurface that is impedance-matched to airborne sound
   at tunable frequencies with subwavelength scale unit cells. With careful
   design of the coupled resonators, over 99\% energy absorption at central
   frequency of 511 Hz with a 50\% absorption bandwidth of 140 Hz is
   achieved experimentally. The proposed design can be easily fabricated,
   and is mechanically stable. The proposed metasurface can be used in many
   sound absorption applications such as loudspeaker design and
   architectural acoustics. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Sub-60 mV/decade switching in 2D negative capacitance field-effect
   transistors with integrated ferroelectric polymer}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{There is a rising interest in employing the negative capacitance (NC)
   effect to achieve sub-60 mV/decade (below the thermal limit) switching
   in field-effect transistors (FETs). The NC effect, which is an effectual
   amplification of the applied gate potential, is realized by
   incorporating a ferroelectric material in series with a dielectric in
   the gate stack of a FET. One of the leading challenges to such NC-FETs
   is the variable substrate capacitance exhibited in 3D semiconductor
   channels (bulk, Fin, or nanowire) that minimizes the extent of sub-60
   mV/decade switching. In this work, we demonstrate 2D NC-FETs that
   combine the NC effect with 2D MoS2 channels to extend the steep
   switching behavior. Using the ferroelectric polymer, poly(vinylidene
   difluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)), these 2D NC-FETs are
   fabricated by modification of top-gated 2D FETs through the integrated
   addition of P(VDF-TrFE) into the gate stack. The impact of including an
   interfacial metal between the ferroelectric and dielectric is studied
   and shown to be critical. These 2D NC-FETs exhibit a decrease in
   subthreshold swing from 113 mV/decade down to 11.7 mV/decade at room
   temperature with sub-60 mV/decade switching occurring over more than 4
   decades of current. The P(VDF-TrFE) proves to be an unstable option for
   a device technology, yet the superb switching behavior observed herein
   opens the way for further exploration of nanomaterials for extremely
   low-voltage NC-FETs. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) are brief bursts of energetic
   gammy-ray photons generated during thunderstorms, which have been
   detected almost exclusively by satellite-based instruments. Here we
   present three lines of evidence which includes the three out of three
   simultaneously observed pairs, the same occurrence contexts, and the
   consistent estimated occurrence rate, which indicate a direct
   relationship between a subset of TGFs and a class of energetic radio
   signal easily detectable by ground-based sensors. This connection
   indicates that these gamma ray and radio emissions are two views of the
   same phenomenon and further enable detection of these TGFs from ground
   distant radio signals alone. Besides dramatically increasing the
   detection rate of TGFs, this ground detection approach can identify TGFs
   in continental and coastal areas that are at latitudes too high for
   present TGF-detecting satellites and will provide more insights into the
   mechanism of TGF production.}},

Abstract = {{Although multidomain proteins predominate the proteome of all organisms
   and are expected to display complex folding behaviors and significantly
   greater structural dynamics as compared with single-domain proteins,
   their conformational heterogeneity and its impact on their interaction
   with ligands are poorly understood due to a lack of experimental
   techniques. The multidomain calcium-binding -crystallin proteins are
   particularly important because their deterioration and
   misfolding/aggregation are associated with melanoma tumors and
   cataracts. Here we investigate the mechanical stability and
   conformational dynamics of a model calcium-binding -crystallin protein,
   Protein S, and elaborate on its interactions with calcium. We ask
   whether domain interactions and calcium binding affect Protein S folding
   and potential structural heterogeneity. Our results from single-molecule
   force spectroscopy show that the N-terminal (but not the C-terminal)
   domain is in equilibrium with an alternative conformation in the absence
   of Ca2+, which is mechanically stable in contrast to other proteins that
   were observed to sample a molten globule under similar conditions.
   Mutagenesis experiments and computer simulations reveal that the
   alternative conformation of the N-terminal domain is caused by
   structural instability produced by the high charge density of a calcium
   binding site. We find that this alternative conformation in the
   N-terminal domain is diminished in the presence of calcium and can also
   be partially eliminated with a hitherto unrecognized compensatory
   mechanism that uses the interaction of the C-terminal domain to
   neutralize the electronegative site. We find that up to 1\% of all
   identified multidomain calcium-binding proteins contain a similarly
   highly charged site and therefore may exploit a similar compensatory
   mechanism to prevent structural instability in the absence of ligand.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), a close homologue of the
   eukaryote monoamine transporters (MATs) currently Serves as a powerful
   template for computer simulations of MATs, Transport of the amino acid
   leucine through the membrane is made possible by the sodium
   electrochemical potential. Recent reports indicate that the substrate
   transport mechanism is, based on structural changes such as hinge
   movements of key transmembrane domains. In order to further investigate
   the role of sodium ions in the uptake leucine, here we present a Markov
   state model analysis of atomistic simulations of lipid embedded LeuT in
   different environments, generated by varying the presence of binding
   pocket, sodium ions and substrate. Six metastable conformations are
   found, and structural differences between them along with transition
   probabilities are determined. We complete the analysis with the
   implementation of perturbation response Scanning on our system,
   determining the most sensitive and influential regions of LeuT, in each
   environment. Our results show that the Occupation of sites Na1 and Na2,
   along with the presence of the substrate, selectively influences, the
   geometry of LeuT. In particular, the occupation of each site Na1/Na2 has
   strong effects (in terms of changes in influence and/or sensitivity, as
   compared to the case without ions) in specific regions, of LeuT, and the
   effects are different for simultaneous occupation., Our results
   strengthen the rationale and provide a conformational mechanism for a
   putative transport mechanism in which Na2 is necessary, but may not be
   sufficient, to initiate and stabilize extracellular substrate access to
   the binding pocket.}},

Abstract = {{Holographic optics are an essential tool for the control of light,
   generating highly complex and tailored light field distributions that
   can represent physical objects or abstract information. Conceptually, a
   hologram is a region of space in which an arbitrary phase shift and
   amplitude variation are added to an incident reference wave at every
   spatial location, such that the reference wave will produce a desired
   field distribution as it scatters from the medium. Practical holograms
   are composed of materials, however, which have limited properties that
   constrain the possible field distributions. Here, we show it is possible
   to produce a hologram with continuous phase distribution and a
   non-uniform amplitude variation at every point by leveraging resonant
   metamaterial elements and constraining the hologram's pixels to match
   the elements' resonant behavior. We demonstrate the viability of the
   resonant metamaterial approach with a single layer, co-polarized
   holographic metasurface that produces an image at millimeter wavelengths
   (92.5 GHz) despite the elements' limited phase range and coupled
   amplitude dependency. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A versatile method is described to engineer precisely defined
   protein/peptide-polymer therapeutics by a modular approach that consists
   of three steps: 1) fusion of a protein/peptide of interest with an
   elastin-like polypeptide that enables facile purification and high
   yields; 2) installation of a clickable group at the C terminus of the
   recombinant protein/peptide with almost complete conversion by
   enzyme-mediated ligation; and 3) attachment of a polymer by a click
   reaction with near-quantitative conversion. We demonstrate that this
   modular approach is applicable to various protein/peptide drugs and used
   it to conjugate them to structurally diverse water-soluble polymers that
   prolong the plasma circulation duration of these proteins. The
   protein/peptide-polymer conjugates exhibited significantly improved
   pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effects over the native protein/peptide
   upon administration to mice. The studies reported here provide a facile
   method for the synthesis of protein/peptide-polymer conjugates for

Abstract = {{Minimally-invasive microsurgery has resulted in improved outcomes for
   patients. However, operating through a microscope limits depth
   perception and fixes the visual perspective, which result in a steep
   learning curve to achieve microsurgical proficiency. We introduce a
   surgical imaging system employing four-dimensional (live volumetric
   imaging through time) microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography
   (4D MIOCT) capable of imaging at up to 10 volumes per second to
   visualize human microsurgery. A custom stereoscopic heads-up display
   provides real-time interactive volumetric feedback to the surgeon. We
   report that 4D MIOCT enhanced suturing accuracy and control of
   instrument positioning in mock surgical trials involving 17 ophthalmic
   surgeons. Additionally, 4D MIOCT imaging was performed in 48 human eye
   surgeries and was demonstrated to successfully visualize the pathology
   of interest in concordance with preoperative diagnosis in 93\% of
   retinal surgeries and the surgical site of interest in 100\% of anterior
   segment surgeries. In vivo 4D MIOCT imaging revealed sub-surface
   pathologic structures and instrument-induced lesions that were invisible
   through the operating microscope during standard surgical maneuvers. In
   select cases, 4D MIOCT guidance was necessary to resolve such lesions
   and prevent post-operative complications. Our novel surgical
   visualization platform achieves surgeon-interactive 4D visualization of
   live surgery which could expand the surgeon's capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis and estimation of extreme event occurrences is a central
   problem in many fields of geoscience. Advancements in the study of
   extreme events have recently been limited, arguably in connection with
   asymptotic assumptions in the traditional extreme value theory (EVT) and
   with its focusing on a small fraction of the available observations
   representing the tail properties of the underlying event generation
   process. Here we develop a Metastatistical Extreme Value framework (MEV)
   which relaxes limiting assumptions at the basis of the traditional EVT
   and accounts for the full distribution of the underlying ordinary
   events. We apply this general approach to the relevant case of daily
   rainfall and find that the MEV approach reduces the uncertainty in the
   estimation of high-quantile extremes by up to 50\% with respect to the
   classical EVT. The improved predictive power of the MEV framework is
   connected with its recognizing that extremes emerge from repeated
   sampling of ordinary events, thereby being able to use all available
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Potosi, Bolivia, is the site of centuries of historic and
   present-daymining of the Cerro Rico, a mountain known for its rich
   polymetallic deposits, and was the site of large-scale Colonial era
   silver refining operations. In this study, the concentrations of several
   metal and metalloid elements were quantified in adobe brick, dirt floor,
   and surface dust samples from 49 houses in Potosi. Median concentrations
   of total mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As) were significantly
   greater than concentrations measured in Sucre, Bolivia, a non-mining
   town, and exceeded US-based soil screening levels. Adobe brick samples
   were further analyzed for bioaccessible concentrations of trace elements
   using a simulated gastric fluid (GF) extraction. Median GF extractable
   concentrations of Hg, As, and Pb were 0.085, 13.9, and 32.2\% of the
   total element concentration, respectively. Total and GF extractable
   concentrations of Hg, As, and Pb were used to estimate exposure and
   potential health risks to children following incidental ingestion of
   adobe brick particles. Risks were assessed using a range of potential
   ingestion rates (50-1000 mg/day). Overall, the results of the risk
   assessment show that the majority of households sampled contained
   concentrations of bioaccessible Pb and As, but not Hg, that represent a
   potential health risk. Even at the lowest ingestion rate considered, the
   majority of households exceeded the risk threshold for Pb, indicating
   that the concentrations of this metal are of particular concern. To our
   knowledge, this is the first study to quantify key trace elements in
   building materials in adobe brick houses and the results indicate that
   these houses are a potential source of exposure to metals and metalloids
   in South American mining communities. Additional studies are needed to
   fully characterize personal exposure and to understand potential adverse
   health outcomes within the community. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Density-functional theory simulations of CZTS, CZTSe, and

   investigate the stability of the CZTS(0.25)Se(0.75) alloy vs.
   decomposition into CZTS, CZTSe, and other secondary compounds. The Gibbs
   energy for vibrational contributions was estimated by calculating phonon
   spectra and thermodynamic properties at finite temperatures. It was
   demonstrated that the CZTS(0.25)Se(0.75) alloy is stabilized not by
   enthalpy of formation but primarily by the mixing contributions to the
   Gibbs energy. The Gibbs energy gains/losses for several decomposition
   reactions were calculated as a function of temperature with/without
   intermixing and vibration contributions to the Gibbs energy. A set of
   phase diagrams was built in the multidimensional space of chemical
   potentials at 300 K and 900 K temperatures to demonstrate alloy
   stability and boundary compounds at various chemical conditions. It
   demonstrated for CZTS(0.25)Se(0.75) that the chemical potentials for
   stability differ between typical processing temperature (similar to 900
   K) and operating temperature (300 K). This implies that as cooling
   progresses, the flux/concentration of S should be increased in MBE
   growth to maintain the CZTS(0.25)Se(0.75) in a thermodynamically stable
   state to minimize phase decomposition. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Long-Term Training with a Brain-Machine Interface-Based Gait Protocol
   Induces Partial Neurological Recovery in Paraplegic Patients}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a new assistive strategy aimed
   at restoring mobility in severely paralyzed patients. Yet, no study in
   animals or in human subjects has indicated that long-term BMI training
   could induce any type of clinical recovery. Eight chronic (3-13 years)
   spinal cord injury (SCI) paraplegics were subjected to long-term
   training (12 months) with a multi-stage BMI-based gait
   neurorehabilitation paradigm aimed at restoring locomotion. This
   paradigm combined intense immersive virtual reality training, enriched
   visual-tactile feedback, and walking with two EEG-controlled robotic
   actuators, including a custom-designed lower limb exoskeleton capable of
   delivering tactile feedback to subjects. Following 12 months of training
   with this paradigm, all eight patients experienced neurological
   improvements in somatic sensation (pain localization, fine/crude touch,
   and proprioceptive sensing) in multiple dermatomes. Patients also
   regained voluntary motor control in key muscles below the SCI level, as
   measured by EMGs, resulting in marked improvement in their walking
   index. As a result, 50\% of these patients were upgraded to an
   incomplete paraplegia classification. Neurological recovery was
   paralleled by the reemergence of lower limb motor imagery at cortical
   level. We hypothesize that this unprecedented neurological recovery
   results from both cortical and spinal cord plasticity triggered by
   long-term BMI usage.}},

Title = {{Phonon anharmonicity and negative thermal expansion in SnSe}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{The anharmonic phonon properties of SnSe in the Pnma phase were
   investigated with a combination of experiments and first-principles
   simulations. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and nuclear
   resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (NRIXS), we have measured the phonon
   dispersions and density of states (DOS) and their temperature
   dependence, which revealed a strong, inhomogeneous shift and broadening
   of the spectrum on warming. First-principles simulations were performed
   to rationalize these measurements, and to explain the previously
   reported anisotropic thermal expansion, in particular the negative
   thermal expansion within the Sn-Se bilayers. Including the anisotropic
   strain dependence of the phonon free energy, in addition to the
   electronic ground state energy, is essential to reproduce the negative
   thermal expansion. From the phonon DOS obtained with INS and additional
   calorimetry measurements, we quantify the harmonic, dilational, and
   anharmonic components of the phonon entropy, heat capacity, and free
   energy. The origin of the anharmonic phonon thermodynamics is linked to
   the electronic structure.}},

   (MAPbI(3)) absorber and CdS as the electron transport layer. X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy reveals a small presence of Cd at the surface
   of most perovskite films fabricated on CdS. Perovskite films were
   deliberately doped with Cd to understand the possible impacts of Cd
   diffusion into the perovskite absorber layer. Doping substantially
   increases the grain size of the perovskite films but also reduces device
   performance through the formation of an electrical barrier, as inferred
   by the S-shape of their JV curves. Time-resolved photoluminescence
   measurements of the doped films do not indicate substantial nonradiative
   recombination due to bulk defects, but a secondary phase is evident in
   these films, which experiments have revealed to be the organicinorganic
   hybrid material methylammonium cadmium iodide, (CH3NH3)(2)CdI4. It is
   further demonstrated that this compound can form via the reaction of CdS
   with methylammonium iodide and may form as a competing phase during
   deposition of the perovskite. Buildup of this insulating compound may
   act as an electrical barrier at perovskite interfaces, accounting for
   the drop in device performance.}},

Abstract = {{Emulsion-based, resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed laser
   evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) has been demonstrated as an alternative
   technique to deposit conjugated polymer films for photovoltaic
   applications; yet, a fundamental understanding of how the emulsion
   target characteristics translate into film properties and solar cell
   performance is unclear. Such understanding is crucial to enable the
   rational improvement of organic solar cell (OSC) efficiency and to
   realize the expected advantages of emulsion based RIR-MAPLE for OSC
   fabrication. In this paper, the effect of the primary solvent used in
   the emulsion target is studied, both experimentally and theoretically,
   and it is found to determine the conjugated polymer cluster size in the
   emulsion as well as surface roughness and internal morphology of
   resulting polymer films. By using a primary solvent with low
   solubility-in-water and low vapor pressure, the surface roughness of
   deposited P3HT and PCPDTBT polymer films was reduced to 10 nm, and the
   efficiency of P3HT:PC61BM OSCs was increased to 3.2\% (similar to 100
   times higher compared to the first MAPLE OSC demonstration {[}Caricato,
   A. P.; et al. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2012, 100, 073306]). This work unveils
   the mechanism of polymer film formation using emulsion-based RIR-MAPLE
   and provides insight and direction to determine the best ways to take
   advantage of the emulsion target approach to control film properties for
   different applications.}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) generates large volumes of
   wastewater, the detailed composition of which must be known for adequate
   risk assessment and treatment. In particular, transformation products of
   geogenic compounds and disclosed additives have not been described. This
   study investigated six Fayetteville Shale wastewater samples for organic
   composition using a suite of one- and two-dimensional gas
   chromatographic techniques to capture a broad distribution of chemical
   structures. Following the application of strict
   compound-identification-confidence criteria, we classified compounds
   according to their putative origin. Samples displayed distinct chemical
   distributions composed of typical geogenic substances (hydrocarbons and
   hopane biomarkers), disclosed UNGD additives (e.g., hydrocarbons,
   phthalates such as diisobutyl phthalate, and radical initiators such as
   azobis(isobutyronitrile)), and undisclosed compounds (e.g., halogenated
   hydrocarbons, such as 2-bromohexane or 4bromoheptane). Undisclosed
   chloromethyl alkanoates (chloromethyl propanoate, pentanoate, and
   octanoate) were identified as potential delayed acids (i.e., those that
   release acidic moieties only after hydrolytic cleavage, the rate of
   which could be potentially controlled), suggesting they were
   deliberately introduced to react in the subsurface. In contrast, the
   identification of halogenated methanes and acetones suggested that those
   compounds were formed as unintended byproducts. Our study highlights the
   possibility that UNGD operations generate transformation products and
   underscores the value of disclosing additives injected into the
   subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{Biological resurfacing of entire articular surfaces represents an
   important but challenging strategy for treatment of cartilage
   degeneration that occurs in osteoarthritis. Not only does this approach
   require anatomically sized and functional engineered cartilage, but the
   inflammatory environment within an arthritic joint may also inhibit
   chondrogenesis and induce degradation of native and engineered
   cartilage. The goal of this study was to use adult stem cells to
   engineer anatomically shaped, functional cartilage constructs capable of
   tunable and inducible expression of anti-inflammatory molecules,
   specifically IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). Large (22-mm-diameter)
   hemispherical scaffolds were fabricated from 3D woven
   poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) fibers into two different configurations and
   seeded with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). Doxycycline
   (dox)-inducible lentiviral vectors containing eGFP or IL-1Ra transgenes
   were immobilized to the PCL to transduce ASCs upon seeding, and
   constructs were cultured in chondrogenic conditions for 28 d. Constructs
   showed biomimetic cartilage properties and uniform tissue growth while
   maintaining their anatomic shape throughout culture. IL-1Ra-expressing
   constructs produced nearly 1 mu g/mL of IL-1Ra upon controlled induction
   with dox. Treatment with IL-1 significantly increased matrix
   metalloprotease activity in the conditioned media of eGFP-expressing
   constructs but not in IL-1Ra-expressing constructs. Our findings show
   that advanced textile manufacturing combined with scaffold-mediated gene
   delivery can be used to tissue engineer large anatomically shaped
   cartilage constructs that possess controlled delivery of anticytokine
   therapy. Importantly, these cartilage constructs have the potential to
   provide mechanical functionality immediately upon implantation, as they
   will need to replace a majority, if not the entire joint surface to
   restore function.}},

Abstract = {{Previous study claimed that disc degeneration may be preceded by
   structure and matrix changes in the intervertebral disc (IVD) which
   coincide with the loss of distinct notochordally derived nucleus
   pulposus (NP) cells. However, the fate of notochordal cells and their
   molecular phenotype change during aging and degeneration in human are
   still unknown. In this study, a set of novel molecular phenotype markers
   of notochordal NP cells during aging and degeneration in human IVD
   tissue were revealed with immunostaining and flow cytometry.
   Furthermore, the potential of phenotype juvenilization and matrix
   regeneration of IVD cells in a laminin-rich pseudo-3D culture system
   were evaluated at day 28 by immunostaining, Safranin O, and type II
   collagen staining. Immunostaining and flow cytometry demonstrated that
   transcriptional factor Brachyury T, neuronal-related proteins (brain
   abundant membrane attached signal protein 1, Basp1; Neurochondrin, Ncdn;
   Neuropilin, Nrp-1), CD24, and CD221 were expressed only in juvenile
   human NP tissue, which suggested that these proteins may be served as
   the notochordal NP cell markers. However, the increased expression of
   CD54 and CD166 with aging indicated that they might be referenced as the
   potential biomarker for disc degeneration. In addition, 3D culture
   maintained most of markers in juvenile NP, and rescued the expression of
   Basp1, Ncdn, and Nrp 1 that disappeared in adult NP native tissue. These
   findings provided new insight into molecular profile that may be used to
   characterize the existence of a unique notochordal NP cells during aging
   and degeneration in human IVD cells, which will facilitate cell-based
   therapy for IVD regeneration. (C) 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Abstract = {{The postvoid residual volume (PVR) is a common urodynamic parameter used
   to quantify the severity of lower urinary tract dysfunction. However,
   the serial cystometrograms that are typically used to assess bladder
   function in animal models make measuring PVR very difficult. Current
   approaches are to either remove PVR after each void to measure it, which
   is disruptive to the bladder, or to neglect the unknown contribution to
   PVR from ureter flow, which results in inaccurate estimates. We propose
   a procedure to estimate PVR during a serial cystometrogram that requires
   only a single measurement, rather than measuring after each void.
   Moreover, this measurement can occur at the end of the experiment such
   that it does not affect the bladder during data collection. We
   mathematically express PVR for all voids during a serial cystometrogram
   using a linear recurrence equation and use this equation to build an
   estimation procedure for PVR. Using in vivo measurements in urethane
   anesthetized rats and computer simulations we show that the estimation
   procedure is at least as accurate in determining PVR as the traditional
   method of measuring PVR after each void. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
   adverse effects of repeated PVR measurements in a common animal model of
   cystitis. Using the proposed procedure can increase the efficiency and
   accuracy of determining PVR for a serial cystometrogram and is less
   disruptive to the system under study. This, in turn, allows the
   calculation of other urodynamic parameters that are critical for
   research studies, including voiding efficiency and bladder capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Here we illustrate the free search for the optimal geometry of flow
   channel cross-sections that meet two objectives simultaneously: reduced
   resistances to heat transfer and fluid flow. The element cross section
   and the wall material are fixed, while the shape of the fluid flow
   opening, or the wetted perimeter is free to vary. Two element cross
   sections are considered, square and equilateral triangular. We find that
   the two objectives are best met when the solid wall thickness is
   uniform, i.e., when the wetted perimeters are square and triangular,
   respectively. We also consider arrays of square elements and triangular
   elements, on the basis of equal mass flow rate per unit of array cross
   sectional area. The conclusion is that the array of triangular elements
   meets the two objectives better than the array of square elements. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper documents a numerical study of time-dependent melting
   dominated by natural convection in a cylinder filled with a phase change
   material. In accord with constructal design, the search is for effective
   heat-flow architectures. The volume-constrained improvement of the
   designs for heat flow begins with assuming the simplest structure, where
   a single line serves as heat source. Next, the heat source is endowed
   with freedom to change its shape as it grows. The objective of the
   numerical simulations is to discover the geometric features that lead to
   the fastest melting process. The results show that the heat transfer
   rate density increases as the complexity and number of degrees of
   freedom of the structure are increased. Furthermore, the angles between
   heat invasion lines have a minor effect on the global performance
   compared to other degrees of freedom: number of branching levels, stem
   length, and branch lengths. The effect of natural convection in the melt
   zone is documented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and efficient prediction of electromagnetic scattering from
   inhomogeneous objects in layered medium is one of the most challenging
   issues in engineering applications. This paper presents the first 3-D
   higher order hybrid finite-element method (FEM) and method of moments
   (MoM) for the accurate modeling of inhomogeneous dielectric objects in
   multilayered medium. The main challenges of this paper include: 1) the
   integration of these algorithms for layered medium and 2) the higher
   order computational approach involved in layered medium for high
   efficiency. In the proposed method, the MoM with the layered medium
   dyadic Green's function is used as the exact radiation boundary
   condition in an inhomogeneous background, and the FEM is applied to
   model the inhomogeneous objects. Furthermore, the higher order maximally
   orthogonal basis functions with curl-conforming and
   divergence-conforming properties are used in the FEM and MoM,
   respectively to improve the modeling capability of this algorithm. For
   3-D inhomogeneous objects scattering in multilayered medium, this new
   method requires a much more tightly truncated simulation domain than the
   traditional FEM, and provides much higher flexibility than the pure
   surface integral equation method. Finally, some numerical results are
   provided to validate the accuracy, efficiency, and flexibility of this
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Live monitoring data and simple dynamic reduced-order models of the
   Christchurch Women's Hospital (CWH) help explain the performance of the
   base-isolation (BI) system of the hospital during the series of
   Canterbury earthquakes in 2011-2012. A Park-Wen-Ang hysteresis model is
   employed to simulate the performance of the BI system and results are
   compared to measured data recorded above the isolation layer and on the
   sixth story. Simplified single, two, and three degree-of-freedom models
   (SDOF, 2DOF, and 3DOF) show that the CWH structure did not behave as an
   isolated but as a fixed-base structure. Comparisons of accelerations and
   deflections between simulated and monitored data show a good match for
   isolation stiffness values of approximately two times of the value
   documented in the design specification and test protocol. Furthermore,
   an analysis of purely measured data revealed very little to no relative
   motion across the isolators for large events of moment magnitude scale
   (Mw) 5.8 and 6.0 that occurred within 3h of each other on December 23,
   2011. One of the major findings is that the BI system during the seismic
   events on December 23, 2011, did not yield and that the superstructure
   performed as a fixed-base building, indicating a need to reevaluate the
   analysis, design, and implementation of these structures. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The authors present a multistatic imaging system at microwave
   frequencies based on arrays of planar cavity sub-apertures, or panels.
   The cavity imager consists of sets of transmit and receive panels,
   loaded with radiating irises distributed over the sub-apertures in an
   aperiodic pattern. This frequency-diverse aperture produces distinct
   radiation patterns as a function of frequency that encode scene
   information onto a set of measurements; images are subsequently
   reconstructed using computational imaging approaches. Similar to
   previously reported computational imaging systems, the cavity-based
   imager presents a simple system architecture, minimising the number and
   expense of components required in traditional microwave imaging systems.
   The cavity imager builds on previous frequency-diverse approaches, such
   as the recently reported metamaterial and air-filled cavity systems, by
   utilising frequency-diverse panels for both the transmit and receive
   sub-apertures of the imaging system. Though the panel-to-panel
   architecture has greater sensitivity to calibration error, this
   implementation nevertheless increases mode diversity and, in the context
   of a computational imaging system, results in improved image
   reconstructions.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental approaches verifying the fluidic operation
   of a partially shielded digital microfluidics device are presented in
   this paper. This paper is motivated by recent demand from the synthetic
   biology community for electrowetting on dielectric (EWD) enabled
   in-droplet electroporation, but is generalizable to a range of EWD
   applications that require shielding structures to be patterned on the
   EWD. An electrode patterned in an additional metal layer on the
   insulator that supports EWD actuation reduces the effective strength of
   the EW force due to dielectric shielding at the droplet contact line. A
   numerical model was developed to predict the impact of the partially
   shielding electrode on threshold voltage, EW force, fluid velocity, and
   droplet transport time. Compared with a batch of devices lacking the
   extra electrode, the presence of the added metal layer resulted in a
   29\% increase in threshold voltage, an 82\% increase in transport time,
   and a 44\% decrease in average transport velocity. Each trend agrees
   with the simulation results obtained from the fluid transport model.
   These results support the development of design rules for microfluidic
   devices that require partially shielding metal layers to integrate with
   EWD device architectures. {[}2016-0034]}},

   electroconvulsive therapy and magnetic seizure therapy in a realistic
   human head model}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{55-64}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study examines the strength and spatial distribution of
   the electric field induced in the brain by electroconvulsive therapy
   (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST).
   Methods: The electric field induced by standard (bilateral, right
   unilateral, and bifrontal) and experimental (focal electrically
   administered seizure therapy and frontomedial) ECT electrode
   configurations as well as a circular MST coil configuration was
   simulated in an anatomically realistic finite element model of the human
   head. Maps of the electric field strength relative to an estimated
   neural activation threshold were used to evaluate the stimulation
   strength and focality in specific brain regions of interest for these
   ECT and MST paradigms and various stimulus current amplitudes.
   Results: The standard ECT configurations and current amplitude of
   800-900 mA produced the strongest overall stimulation with median of
   1.8-2.9 times neural activation threshold and more than 94\% of the
   brain volume stimulated at suprathreshold level. All standard ECT
   electrode placements exposed the hippocampi to suprathreshold electric
   field, although there were differences across modalities with bilateral
   and right unilateral producing respectively the strongest and weakest
   hippocampal stimulation. MST stimulation is up to 9 times weaker
   compared to conventional ECT, resulting in direct activation of only
   21\% of the brain. Reducing the stimulus current amplitude can make ECT
   as focal as MST.
   Conclusions: The relative differences in electric field strength may be
   a contributing factor for the cognitive sparing observed with right
   unilateral compared to bilateral ECT, and MST compared to right
   unilateral ECT. These simulations could help understand the mechanisms
   of seizure therapies and develop interventions with superior
   risk/benefit ratio. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic glasses attract considerable interest due to their unique
   combination of superb properties and processability. Predicting their
   formation from known alloy parameters remains the major hindrance to the
   discovery of new systems. Here, we propose a descriptor based on the
   heuristics that structural and energetic `confusion' obstructs
   crystalline growth, and demonstrate its validity by experiments on two
   well-known glass-forming alloy systems. We then develop a robust model
   for predicting glass formation ability based on the geometrical and
   energetic features of crystalline phases calculated ab initio in the
   AFLOW framework. Our findings indicate that the formation of metallic
   glass phases could be much more common than currently thought, with more
   than 17\% of binary alloy systems potential glass formers. Our approach
   pinpoints favourable compositions and demonstrates that smart
   descriptors, based solely on alloy properties available in online
   repositories, offer the sought-after key for accelerated discovery of
   metallic glasses.}},

Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Salt-gradient solar ponds (SGSPs) are water bodies that capture and
   accumulate large amounts of solar energy. The design of an SGSP field
   has never been analyzed in terms of studying the optimal number of solar
   ponds that must be built to maximize the useful energy that can be
   collected in the field, or the most convenient way to connect the ponds.
   In this paper, we use constructal design to find the optimal
   configuration of an SGSP field. A steady-state thermal model was
   constructed to estimate the energy collected by each SGSP, and then a
   complementary model was developed to determine the final temperature of
   a defined mass flow rate of a fluid that will be heated by heat
   exchangers connected to the solar ponds. By applying constructal design,
   four configurations for the SGSP field, with different surface area
   distribution, were evaluated: series, parallel, mixed series-parallel
   and tree-shaped configurations. For the study site of this
   investigation, it was found that the optimal SGSP field consists of 30
   solar ponds of increasing surface area connected in series. This SGSP
   field increases the final temperature of the fluid to be heated in
   22.9\%, compared to that obtained in a single SGSP. The results of this
   study show that is possible to use constructal theory to further
   optimize the heat transfer of an SGSP field. Experimental results of
   these configurations would be useful in future works to validate the
   methodology proposed in this study. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Biomaterials used in the context of tissue engineering or wound repair
   are commonly designed to be nonimmunogenic. However, previously it has
   been observed that self-assembled peptide nanofiber materials are
   noninflammatory despite their immunogenicity, suggesting that they may
   be appropriate for use in wound-healing contexts. To test this
   hypothesis, mice were immunized with epitope-containing peptide
   self-assemblies until they maintained high antibody titers against the
   material, then gels of the same peptide assemblies were applied within
   full-thickness dermal wounds. In three different murine dermal-wounding
   models with different baseline healing rates, even significantly
   immunogenic peptide assemblies did not delay healing. Conversely,
   adjuvanted peptide assemblies, while raising similar antibody titers to
   unadjuvanted assemblies, did delay wound healing. Analysis of the
   healing wounds indicated that compared to adjuvanted peptide assemblies,
   the unadjuvanted assemblies exhibited a progression of the dominant
   T-cell subset from CD4(+) to CD8(+) cells in the wound, and CD4(+) cell
   populations displayed a more Th2-slanted response. These findings
   illustrate an example of a significant antibiomaterial adaptive immune
   response that does not adversely affect wound healing despite ongoing
   antibody production. This material would thus be considered
   immunologically compatible in this specific context rather than
   nonimmunogenic, a designation that is expected to apply to a range of
   other protein- and peptide-based biomaterials in wound-healing and
   tissue-engineering applications. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Cell volume growth occurs in all living tissues. The growth exerts
   mechanical stresses on surrounding tissues that may alter tissue
   microenvironment, and have significant implications in health and
   diseases. However, the level of growth stress generated by single cells
   in three-dimensional (3D) environment remains to be determined. To this
   end, we developed a growth force microscopy technique to determine 3D
   distribution of the stress. The technique was based on encapsulation of
   cells in elastic hydrogels, and involved 3D particle tracking and
   mechanical analysis of gel deformation. Data from the study demonstrated
   that the growth stress was dynamic, and the stress distribution at the
   gel-cell interface was correlated inversely to the mean surface
   curvature or the distance to the geometric center of the cell. The
   stress averaged over the cell surface increased with increasing gel
   stiffness, suggesting that cells could alter growth stress in response
   to stiffness change in microenvironment These findings suggested that
   the elastic hydrogel-based microscopy technique had a potential to
   provide new insights into mechanisms of mechanical interactions between
   cell and its microenvironment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Silver toxicity across salinity gradients: the role of dissolved silver

Abstract = {{The influence of salinity on Ag toxicity was investigated in Atlantic
   killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) early life-stages. Embryo mortality
   was significantly reduced as salinity increased and Ag+ was converted to
   AgCl(solid). However, as salinity continued to rise (> 5 aEuro degrees),
   toxicity increased to a level at least as high as observed for Ag+ in
   deionized water. Rather than correlating with Ag+, Fundulus embryo
   toxicity was better explained (R-2 = 0.96) by total dissolved Ag (Ag+,
   AgCl2 (-), AgCl3 (2-), AgCl4 (3-)). Complementary experiments were
   conducted with medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos to determine if this
   pattern was consistent among evolutionarily divergent euryhaline
   species. Contrary to Fundulus data, medaka toxicity data were best
   explained by Ag+ concentrations (R-2 = 0.94), suggesting that differing
   ionoregulatory physiology may drive observed differences. Fundulus
   larvae were also tested, and toxicity did increase at higher salinities,
   but did not track predicted silver speciation. Alternatively, toxicity
   began to increase only at salinities above the isosmotic point,
   suggesting that shifts in osmoregulatory strategy at higher salinities
   might be an important factor. Na+ dysregulation was confirmed as the
   mechanism of toxicity in Ag-exposed Fundulus larvae at both low and high
   salinities. While Ag uptake was highest at low salinities for both
   Fundulus embryos and larvae, uptake was not predictive of toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate two methods to build a polynomial approximation of a
   model output depending on some parameters. The two approaches are based
   on pseudo-spectral projection (PSP) methods on adaptively constructed
   sparse grids, and aim at providing a finer control of the resolution
   along two distinct subsets of model parameters. The control of the error
   along different subsets of parameters may be needed for instance in the
   case of a model depending on uncertain parameters and deterministic
   design variables. We first consider a nested approach where an
   independent adaptive sparse grid PSP is performed along the first set of
   directions only, and at each point a sparse grid is constructed
   adaptively in the second set of directions. We then consider the
   application of aPSP in the space of all parameters, and introduce
   directional refinement criteria to provide a tighter control of the
   projection error along individual dimensions. Specifically, we use a
   Sobol decomposition of the projection surpluses to tune the sparse grid
   adaptation. The behavior and performance of the two approaches are
   compared for a simple two-dimensional test problem and for a shock-tube
   ignition model involving 22 uncertain parameters and 3 design
   parameters. The numerical experiments indicate that whereas both methods
   provide effective means for tuning the quality of the representation
   along distinct subsets of parameters, PSP in the global parameter space
   generally requires fewer model evaluations than the nested approach to
   achieve similar projection error. In addition, the global approach is
   better suited for generalization to more than two subsets of directions.}},

Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{94-100}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Self-assembled metamaterials constitute a promising platform to
   achieving bulk and homogenous optical materials that exhibit unusual
   effective medium properties. For many years now, the research community
   has contemplated lithographically fabricated metasurfaces, with
   extraordinary optical features. However, achieving large volumes at low
   cost is still a challenge by top-down fabrication. Bottom-up
   fabrication, that relies both on nanochemistry and self-assembly, is
   capable of building such materials while greatly reducing the energy
   footprint in the formulation of the metamaterial. Self-assembled
   metamaterials have shown that they are capable of reaching unprecedented
   values of bulkiness and homogeneity figures of merit. This feat is
   achieved by synthesizing plasmonic nanoresonators (meta-atoms in the
   sense of artificial polarizable units) and assembling them into a fully
   three-dimensional matrix through a variety of methods. Furthermore it
   has been shown that a wide range of material parameters can be tailored
   by controlling the geometry and composition of the meta-atoms as well as
   the volume fraction of the nano-objects in the metamaterial. Here we
   conduct a non-comprehensive review of some of the recent trends in
   self-assembled optical metamaterials and illustrate these trends with
   our recent work. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Communities Exposed to Tetrabromobisphenol A}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{The increasing occurrence of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in the
   environment is raising questions about its potential ecological and
   human health impacts. TBBPA is microbially transformed under anaerobic
   conditions to bisphenol A (BPA). However, little is known about which
   taxa degrade TBBPA and the adaptation of microbial communities exposed
   to TBBPA. The objectives of this study were to characterize the effect
   of TBBPA on microbial community structure during the start-up phase of a
   bench-scale anaerobic sludge reactor, and identify taxa that may be
   associated with TBBPA degradation. TBBPA degradation was monitored using
   LC/MS-MS, and the microbial community was characterized using Ion
   Torrent sequencing and qPCR. TBBPA was nearly completely transformed to
   BPA via reductive debromination in 55 days. Anaerobic reactor
   performance was not negatively affected by the presence of TBBPA and the
   bulk of the microbial community did not experience significant shifts.
   Several taxa showed a positive response to TBBPA, suggesting they may be
   associated with TBBPA degradation. Some of these taxa had been
   previously identified as dehalogenating bacteria including
   Dehalococcoides, Desulfovibrio, Propionibacterium, and Methylosinus
   species, but most had not previously been identified as having
   dehalogenating capacities. This study is the first to provide in-depth
   information on the microbial dynamics of anaerobic microbial communities
   exposed to TBBPA.}},

Abstract = {{The present study demonstrates the possibility of generating hydrogen by
   methanol steam reforming at temperatures of 235-260 degrees C inside a
   non-concentrating solar collector, ideally for stationary fuel cell
   systems. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, the solar
   collector provides all heat required for heating and evaporation of the
   reactants, endothermic reaction, and compensation of heat losses,
   without any external heat supply (such as from combustion of fuel or
   electric heating) and without the need for concentration of sunlight (as
   in conventional parabolic trough systems). Without the need for solar
   concentration, the system is simpler and more compact than conventional
   systems, and it can utilize all direct and indirect incident sunlight.
   The solar collector-reactor achieves hydrogen generation up to 6.62
   L-STP min(-1) per m(2) collector area (equivalent to 1088 W m(-2) LHV)
   under 1 sun, with solar-to-hydrogen efficiencies up to 78\% and total
   energetic efficiencies (considering solar and fuel input) up to 43\%.

Abstract = {{Computational imaging modalities support a simplification of the active
   architectures required in an imaging system and these approaches have
   been validated across the electromagnetic spectrum. Recent
   implementations have utilized pseudo-orthogonal radiation patterns to
   illuminate an object of interest-notably, frequency-diverse metasurfaces
   have been exploited as fast and low-cost alternative to conventional
   coherent imaging systems. However, accurately measuring the
   complex-valued signals in the frequency domain can be burdensome,
   particularly for sub-centimeter wavelengths. Here, computational imaging
   is studied under the relaxed constraint of intensity-only measurements.
   A novel 3D imaging system is conceived based on `phaseless' and
   compressed measurements, with benefits from recent advances in the field
   of phase retrieval. In this paper, the methodology associated with this
   novel principle is described, studied, and experimentally demonstrated
   in the microwave range. A comparison of the estimated images from both
   complex valued and phaseless measurements are presented, verifying the
   fidelity of phaseless computational imaging. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{On the basis of thin film hybrid integrated circuit technology, a
   miniaturised X-band balanced microwave limiter with low insertion loss
   (IL), low spike and flat leakage power and short recovery time has been
   presented. The balanced circuit configuration improves the power
   capacity of the PIN diodes, provides the absorptive load for the
   reflected power and also effectively tackles the problem of suffering
   high incident power. The measured results show that the balanced
   microwave limiter could suffer a pulse with 150 W peak power and 3\%
   duty ratio while the leakage power is <10 mW, and the small signal IL of
   the circuit is <1.4 dB in the frequency range from 8.8 to 9.8 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Amplification of optical signals is useful for a wide variety of
   applications, ranging from data signal transmission to chemical sensing
   and biomedical diagnostics. One such application in chemical sensing is
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), an important technique for
   increasing the Raman signal using the plasmonic effect of enhanced
   electromagnetic fields associated with metallic nanostructures. One of
   the most important limitations of SERS-based amplification is the
   difficulty to reproducibly control the SERS signal. Here, we describe
   the design and implementation of a unique hybrid system capable of
   producing reversible gating of plasmonic coupling for Raman signal
   amplification. The hybrid system is composed of two subsystems: (1)
   colloidal magneto-plasmonic nanoparticles for SERS enhancement and (2) a
   micromagnet substrate with an externally applied magnetic field to
   modulate the colloidal nanoparticles. For this proof of concept
   demonstration, the nanoparticles were labeled with a Raman-active dye,
   and it was shown that the detected SERS signal could be reproducibly
   modulated by controlling the externally applied magnetic field. The
   developed system provides a simple, robust, inexpensive, and reusable
   device for SERS signal modulation. These properties will open up new
   possibilities for optical signal amplification and gating as well for
   high-throughput, reproducible SERS detection.}},

Abstract = {{Circuits distributed across cortico-limbic brain regions compose the
   networks that mediate emotional behavior. The prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   regulates ultra-slow (<1 Hz) dynamics across these networks, and PFC
   dysfunction is implicated in stress-related illnesses including major
   depressive disorder (MDD). To uncover the mechanism whereby
   stress-induced changes in PFC circuitry alter emotional networks to
   yield pathology, we used a multi-disciplinary approach including in vivo
   recordings in mice and chronic social defeat stress. Our network model,
   inferred using machine learning, linked stress-induced behavioral
   pathology to the capacity of PFC to synchronize amygdala and VTA
   activity. Direct stimulation of PFC-amygdala circuitry with DREADDs
   normalized PFC-dependent limbic synchrony in stress-susceptible animals
   and restored normal behavior. In addition to providing insights into MDD
   mechanisms, our findings demonstrate an interdisciplinary approach that
   can be used to identify the large-scale network changes that underlie
   complex emotional pathologies and the specific network nodes that can be
   used to develop targeted interventions.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed analysis of Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic
   Imager (RHESSI) terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) is performed in
   association with World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) sources
   and very low frequency (VLF) sferics recorded at Duke University. RHESSI
   clock offset is evaluated and found to experience changes on the 5
   August 2005 and 21 October 2013, based on the analysis of TGF-WWLLN
   matches. The clock offsets were found for all three periods of
   observations with standard deviations less than 100s. This result opens
   the possibility for the precise comparative analyses of RHESSI TGFs with
   the other types of data (WWLLN, radio measurements, etc.) In case of
   multiple-peak TGFs, WWLLN detections are observed to be simultaneous
   with the last TGF peak for all 16 cases of multipeak RHESSI TGFs
   simultaneous with WWLLN sources. VLF magnetic field sferics were
   recorded for two of these 16 events at Duke University. These radio
   measurements also attribute VLF sferics to the second peak of the double
   TGFs, exhibiting no detectable radio emission during the first TGF peak.
   Possible scenarios explaining these observations are proposed. Double
   (multipeak) TGFs could help to distinguish between the VLF radio
   emission radiated by the recoil currents in the +IC leader channel and
   the VLF emission from the TGF producing electrons.}},

   nanorattles and magnetic beads for malaria diagnostics}},

Abstract = {{One of the major obstacles to implement nucleic acid-based molecular
   diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC) and in resource-limited settings
   is the lack of sensitive and practical DNA detection methods that can be
   seamlessly integrated into portable platforms. Herein we present a
   sensitive yet simple DNA detection method using a surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) nanoplatform: the ultrabright SERS nanorattle. The
   method, referred to as the nanorattle-based method, involves sandwich
   hybridization of magnetic beads that are loaded with capture probes,
   target sequences, and ultrabright SERS nanorattles that are loaded with
   reporter probes. Upon hybridization, a magnet was applied to concentrate
   the hybridization sandwiches at a detection spot for SERS measurements.
   The ultrabright SERS nanorattles, composed of a core and a shell with
   resonance Raman reporters loaded in the gap space between the core and
   the shell, serve as SERS tags for signal detection. Using this method, a
   specific DNA sequence of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
   could be detected with a detection limit of approximately 100 attomoles.
   Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discrimination of wild type malaria
   DNA and mutant malaria DNA, which confers resistance to artemisinin
   drugs, was also demonstrated. These test models demonstrate the
   molecular diagnostic potential of the nanorattle-based method to both
   detect and genotype infectious pathogens. Furthermore, the method's
   simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for integration into portable
   platforms for POC and in resource-limited settings applications. (C)

Abstract = {{We report on a simple plasma electrochemistry method for synthesizing
   cuprous oxide (Cu2O) nanoparticles in the presence of glucose. In this
   system, Ar plasma in contact with a NaCl solution was used as one
   electrode, and a Cu plate was immersed in the solution as the counter
   electrode. The plasma-solution interaction produced many reducing and
   oxidizing species which can react with the Cu ions released from the Cu
   electrode. Cu2O nanoparticles, with an average diameter of 22 +/- 6 nm,
   were formed under the competition of reducing and oxidizing reactions in
   the solution. The results show that the glucose added in the electrolyte
   strongly influences the properties of the products. Corresponding to
   high, medium, and low concentrations of glucose, the products were
   nanoparticles from amorphous Cu2O, polycrystalline Cu2O, and a mixture
   of polycrystalline Cu2O and Cu2Cl(OH)(3), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Chalcogenides such as CdTe, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)(2) (CIGSSe), and
   Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) (CZTSSe) have enabled remarkable advances in thin-film
   photovoltaic performance, but concerns remain regarding (i) the toxicity
   (CdTe) and (ii) scarcity (CIGSSe/CdTe) of the constituent elements and
   (iii) the unavoidable antisite disordering that limits further
   efficiency improvement (CZTSSe). In this work, we show that a different
   materials class, the BaCu2SnSexS4-x (BCTSSe) system, offers a
   prospective path to circumvent difficulties (i-iii) and to target new
   environmentally friendly and earth-abundant absorbers. Antisite
   disordering and associated band tailing are discouraged in BCTSSe due to
   the distinct coordination environment of the large Ba2+ cation. Indeed,
   an abrupt absorption edge and sharp associated photoluminescence
   emission demonstrate a reduced impact of band tailing in BCTSSe relative
   to CZTSSe. Our combined experimental and computational studies of BCTSSe
   reveal that the compositions 0 = x = 4 exhibit a tunable nearly direct
   or direct bandgap in the 1.6-2 eV range, spanning relevant values for
   single- or multiple-junction photovoltaic applications. For the first
   time, a prototype BaCu2SnS4-based thin-film solar cell has been
   successfully demonstrated, yielding a power conversion efficiency of
   1.6\% (0.42 cm2 total area). The systematic experimental and theoretical
   investigations, combined with proof-of-principle device results, suggest
   promise for BaCu2SnSexS4-x as a thin-film solar cell absorber.}},

Title = {{Nerve excitation using an amplitude-modulated signal with
   kilohertz-frequency carrier and non-zero offset}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Incorporating kilohertz-frequency signals in transcutaneous
   electrical stimulation has been proposed as a means to overcome the
   impedance of the skin, thereby reaching deeper nerves. In particular, a
   transdermal amplitude modulated signal (TAMS), composed of a 210 kHz
   non-zero offset carrier modulated by rectangular pulses, was introduced
   recently for the treatment of overactive bladder. However, the
   contribution of the components of TAMS to nerve fiber activation has not
   been quantified.
   Methods: We conducted in vivo experiments and applied direct stimulation
   to the sciatic nerve of cats and rats. We measured electromyogram and
   compound action potential activity evoked by pulses, TAMS and modified
   versions of TAMS in which we varied the size of the carrier.
   Results: Nerve fiber activation using TAMS showed no difference with
   respect to activation with conventional pulse for carrier frequencies of
   20 kHz and higher, regardless the relative amplitude of the carrier. For
   frequencies lower than 20 kHz, the offset needed to generate half of the
   maximal evoked response decreased significantly with respect to the
   pulse. Results of simulations in a computational model of nerve fiber
   stimulation using the same stimulation waveforms closely matched our
   experimental measurements.
   Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that a TAMS with
   carrier frequencies >20 kHz does not offer any advantage over
   conventional pulses, even with larger amplitudes of the carrier, and
   this has implications for design of waveforms for efficient and
   effective transcutaneous stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, resonance energy transfer (RET) networks between
   chromophores are used to implement fluorescent taggants with temporally
   coded signatures. Because the temporal signature of such a fluorescent
   taggant is a phase-type distribution defined by the geometry of its RET
   network, the taggant design is not constrained by resolvable dyes and
   has a significantly larger coding capacity than spectrally or lifetime
   coded fluorescent taggants. Meanwhile, the detection process becomes
   highly efficient when the signatures are coded in the time domain. The
   taggant identification method is based on the multinomial distribution
   of detected photons and Maximum Likelihood Estimation, which guarantees
   high accuracy even with only a few hundred photons and also applies to a
   mixture of taggants in multiplex detection. Therefore, these temporally
   coded fluorescent taggants have great potential for both in situ and
   Lidar applications. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

   Electrofusion under a Pulsed Electric Field}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{The effects of electric field on lipid membrane and cells have been
   extensively studied in the last decades. The phenomena of
   electroporation and electrofusion are of particular interest due to
   their wide use in cell biology and biotechnology. However, numerical
   studies on the electrofusion of cells (or vesicles) with different
   deformed shapes are still rare. Vesicle, being of cell size, can be
   treated as a simple model of cell to investigate the behaviors of cell
   in electric field. Based on the finite element method, we investigate
   the effect of vesicle shape on electrofusion of contact vesicles in
   various medium conditions. The transmembrane voltage (TMV) and pore
   density induced by a pulsed field are examined to analyze the
   possibility of vesicle fusion. In two different medium conditions, the
   prolate shape is observed to have selective electroporation at the
   contact area of vesicles when the exterior conductivity is smaller than
   the interior one; selective electroporation is more inclined to be found
   at the poles of the oblate vesicles when the exterior conductivity is
   larger than the interior one. Furthermore, we find that when the
   exterior conductivity is lower than the internal conductivity, the pulse
   can induce a selective electroporation at the contact area between two
   vesicles regardless of the vesicle shape. Both of these two findings
   have important practical applications in guiding electrofusion
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we show that during their half-century history, helicopters have
   been evolving into geometrically similar architectures with surprisingly
   sharp correlations between dimensions, performance, and body size. For
   example, proportionalities emerge between body size, engine size, and
   the fuel load. Furthermore, the engine efficiency increases with the
   engine size, and the propeller radius is roughly the same as the length
   scale of the whole body. These trends are in accord with the constructal
   law, which accounts for the engine efficiency trend and the
   proportionality between ``motor{''} size and body size in animals and
   vehicles. These body-size effects are qualitatively the same as those
   uncovered earlier for the evolution of aircraft. The present study adds
   to this theoretical body of research the evolutionary design of all

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex neurodegenerative
   disorder that may have anterior visual pathway involvement. In this
   study, we compare the macular structure of patients with ALS to healthy
   controls, and examine correlations between macular sub-layer thickness
   measurements and pulmonary function tests and disease duration. ALS
   patients underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to obtain
   macular cube scans of the right eye. Macular cube OCT data from
   age-matched healthy subjects were provided by the OCT reading center.
   Semi-automated retinal segmentation software was used to quantify
   macular sub-layers. Pulmonary function tests and time since symptom
   onset were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical records
   of ALS patients. Macular retinal nerve fiber layer was significantly
   thinner in ALS patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). Total
   macular and other sub-layer thicknesses were not reduced in the ALS
   cohort. Macular retinal nerve fiber layer thickness positively
   correlated with forced vital capacity \% predicted and forced expiratory
   volume in 1 second \% predicted (P < 0.05). In conclusion, analysis of
   OCT measurements supports the involvement of the anterior visual pathway
   in ALS. Subtle structural thinning in the macular retinal nerve fiber
   layer correlates with pulmonary function tests.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoscale materials, whether natural, engineered, or incidental, are
   increasingly acknowledged as important components in large,
   environmental systems with potential implications for environmental
   impact and human health. Mathematical models are a useful tool for
   handling the rapidly increasing complexity and diversity of these
   materials and their exposure routes. Presented here is a mathematical
   model of trophic transfer driven by nanomaterial surface affinity for
   environmental and biological surfaces, developed in tandem with an
   experimental functional assay for determining these surface affinities.
   We found that nanoparticle surface affinity is a strong predictor of
   uptake through predation in a simple food web consisting of the algae
   Chlorella vulgaris and daphnid Daphnia magna. The mass of nanoparticles
   internalized by D. magna through consuming nanomaterial-contaminated
   algae varied linearly with surface-attachment efficiency. Internalized
   quantities of gold nanoparticles in D. magna ranged from 8.3 to 23.6
   ng/mg for nanoparticle preparations with surface-attachment efficiencies
   ranging from 0.07 to 1. This model, coupled with the functional-assay
   approach, may provide a useful screening tool for existing materials as
   well as a predictive model for their development.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of a
   real-time voltage-tunable terahertz metamaterial based on
   microelectromechanical systems and broadside-coupled split-ring
   resonators. In our metamaterial, the magnetic and electric interactions
   between the coupled resonators are modulated by a comb-drive actuator,
   which provides continuous lateral shifting between the coupled
   resonators by up to 20 mu m. For these strongly coupled split-ring
   resonators, both a symmetric mode and an anti-symmetric mode are
   observed. With increasing lateral shift, the electromagnetic
   interactions between the split-ring resonators weaken, resulting in
   frequency shifting of the resonant modes. Over the entire lateral shift
   range, the symmetric mode blueshifts by similar to 60 GHz, and the
   anti-symmetric mode redshifts by similar to 50 GHz. The amplitude of the
   transmission at 1.03 THz is modulated by 74\%; moreover, a 180 degrees
   phase shift is achieved at 1.08 THz. Our tunable metamaterial device has
   myriad potential applications, including terahertz spatial light
   modulation, phase modulation, and chemical sensing. Furthermore, the
   scheme that we have implemented can be scaled to operate at other
   frequencies, thereby enabling a wide range of distinct applications.}},

Abstract = {{Surface energy released upon drop coalescence is known to power the
   self-propelled jumping of liquid droplets on superhydrophobic solid
   surfaces, and the jumping droplets can additionally carry colloidal
   payloads toward self-cleaning. Here, we show that drop coalescence on a
   spherical particle leads to self-propelled launching of the particle
   from virtually any solid surface. The main prerequisite is an
   intermediate wettability of the particle, such that the momentum from
   the capillary-inertial drop coalescence process can be transferred to
   the particle. By momentum conservation, the launching velocity of the
   particle-drop complex is proportional to the capillary-inertial velocity
   based on the drop radius and to the fraction of the liquid mass in the
   total mass. The capillary-inertial catapult is not only an alternative
   mechanism for removing colloidal contaminants, but also a useful model

Abstract = {{The enhancement of light from semiconductors due to surface plasmons
   coupled resonantly to its emission is limited because of dissipation in
   the metal and is also restricted by the dielectric characteristics and
   homogeneity of the metal-semiconductor interface. We report a new
   mechanism based on electrostatic interactions of carriers and their
   image charges in metals to generate more photons from optical sources at
   frequencies that are off-resonant to the localized plasmon frequency.
   Coulomb catalysis of carrier accumulation resulting from the
   inhomogeneity of metal nanodroplets on a semiconductor's surface can
   result in an enhancement of light that is nondissipative and does not
   require resonant coupling of plasmons to the emission wavelength. The
   enhancement occurs because of an increase in the ratio of radiative to
   nonradiative recombination in the vicinity of metal nanoparticles. It is
   equally effective with any type of metal and enhances radiation at any
   frequency, a property that is of principal importance for the
   realization of widely tunable semiconductor emitters. This fundamental
   mechanism provides a new perspective for improving the efficiency of
   light emitters and controlling carrier concentration on the nanoscale.
   The structural characteristics of the hybrid metal-semiconductor
   emitters are studied using electron microscopy and atomic force
   microscopy. We demonstrate the electrostatic mechanism by studying
   steady-state and transient photoluminescence from two-dimensional
   semiconductors, such as GaAs/AlGAs quantum wells, and bulk
   semiconductors, such as ZnO thin films, emitting in the near-IR and UV
   wavelength regimes, respectively.}},

Title = {{Impact of breast structure on lesion detection in breast tomosynthesis,
   a simulation study}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to characterize the effect of background tissue density
   and heterogeneity on the detection of irregular masses in breast
   tomosynthesis, while demonstrating the capability of the sophisticated
   tools that can be used in the design, implementation, and performance
   analysis of virtual clinical trials (VCTs). Twenty breast phantoms from
   the extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) family, generated based on dedicated
   breast computed tomography of human subjects, were used to extract a
   total of 2173 volumes of interest (VOIs) from simulated tomosynthesis
   images. Five different lesions, modeled after human subject
   tomosynthesis images, were embedded in the breasts and combined with the
   lesion absent condition yielded a total of 6 x 2173 VOIs. Effects of
   background tissue density and heterogeneity on the detection of the
   lesions were studied by implementing a composite hypothesis signal
   detection paradigm with location known exactly, lesion known exactly or
   statistically, and background known statistically. Using the area under
   the receiver operating characteristic curve, detection performance
   deteriorated as density was increased, yielding findings consistent with
   clinical studies. A human observer study was performed on a subset of
   the simulated tomosynthesis images, confirming the detection performance
   trends with respect to density and serving as a validation of the
   implemented detector. Performance of the implemented detector varied
   substantially across the 20 breasts. Furthermore, background tissue
   density and heterogeneity affected the log-likelihood ratio test
   statistic differently under lesion absent and lesion present conditions.
   Therefore, considering background tissue variability in tissue models
   can change the outcomes of a VCT and is hence of crucial importance. The
   XCAT breast phantoms have the potential to address this concern by
   offering realistic modeling of background tissue variability based on a
   wide range of human subjects, comprising various breast shapes, sizes,
   and densities. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare computed tomography (CT)
   low-contrast detectability from human readers with observer model-based
   surrogates of image quality. A phantom with a range of low-contrast
   signals (five contrasts, three sizes) was imaged on a state-of-the-art
   CT scanner (Siemens' force). Images were reconstructed using filtered
   back projection and advanced modeled iterative reconstruction and were
   assessed by 11 readers using a two alternative forced choice method.
   Concurrently, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), area-weighted CNR (CNRA),
   and observer model-based metrics were estimated, including
   nonprewhitening (NPW) matched filter, NPW with eye filter (NPWE), NPW
   with internal noise, NPW with an eye filter and internal noise (NPWEi),
   channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), and CHO with internal noise

Abstract = {{The most promising alternatives to heart transplantation are left
   ventricular assist devices and artificial hearts; however, their use has
   been limited by thrombotic complications. To reduce these, sintered
   titanium (Ti) surfaces were developed, but thrombosis still occurs in
   approximately 7.5\% of patients. We have invented a rapid-seeding
   technology to minimize the risk of thrombosis by rapid
   endothelialization of sintered Ti with human cord blood-derived
   endothelial cells (hCB-ECs). Human cord blood-derived endothelial cells
   were seeded within minutes onto sintered Ti and exposed to
   thrombosis-prone low fluid flow shear stresses. The hCB-ECs adhered and
   formed a confluent endothelial monolayer on sintered Ti. The exposure of
   sintered Ti to 4.4 dynes/cm(2) for 20 hr immediately after rapid seeding
   resulted in approximately 70\% cell adherence. The cell adherence was
   not significantly increased by additional ex vivo static culture of
   rapid-seeded sintered Ti before flow exposure. In addition, adherent
   hCB-ECs remained functional on sintered Ti, as indicated by flow-induced
   increase in nitric oxide secretion and reduction in platelet adhesion.
   After 15 day ex vivo static culture, the adherent hCB-ECs remained
   metabolically active, expressed endothelial cell functional marker
   thrombomodulin, and reduced platelet adhesion. In conclusion, our
   results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid-seeding sintered Ti with
   blood-derived hCB-ECs to generate a living antithrombotic surface.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of multiple-input single-output broadcast
   channels with Rayleigh fading where the transmitter has access to
   delayed knowledge of the channel state information. We first
   characterize the capacity region of this channel with two users to
   within constant number of bits for all values of the transmit power. The
   proposed signaling strategy utilizes the delayed knowledge of the
   channel state information and the previously transmitted signals, in
   order to create a signal of common interest for both receivers. This
   signal would be the quantized version of the summation of the previously
   transmitted signals. A challenge that arises in deriving the result for
   finite signal-to-noise ratio regimes is the correlation that exists
   between the quantization noise and the signal. To guarantee the
   independence of quantization noise and signal, we extend the framework
   of lattice quantizers with dither together with an interleaving step.
   For converse, we use the fact that the capacity region of this problem
   is upper bounded by the capacity region of a physically degraded
   broadcast channel with no channel state information where one receiver
   has two antennas. Then, we derive an outer bound on the capacity region
   of this degraded broadcast channel. Finally, we show how to extend our
   results to obtain the approximate capacity of the K-user multiple-input
   single-output broadcast channel with delayed knowledge of the channel
   state information at the transmitter to within 2 log(2)(K + 2)
   bits/s/Hz.}},

Abstract = {{Cascading chains of events are a salient feature of many real-world
   social, biological, and financial networks. In social networks, social
   reciprocity accounts for retaliations in gang interactions, proxy wars
   in nation-state conflicts, or the Internet memes shared via social
   media. Neuron spikes stimulate or inhibit spike activity in other
   neurons. Stock market shocks can trigger a contagion of volatility
   throughout a financial network. In these and other examples, only
   individual events associated with network nodes are observed, usually
   without the knowledge of the underlying dynamic relationships between
   nodes. This paper addresses the challenge of tracking how events within
   such networks stimulate or influence future events. The proposed
   approach is an online learning framework well-suited to streaming data,
   using a multivariate Hawkes point process model to encapsulate
   autoregressive features of observed events within the social network.
   Recent work on online learning in dynamic environments is leveraged not
   only to exploit the dynamics within the underlying network, but also to
   track the network structure as it evolves. Regret bounds and
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs
   nearly as well as an oracle or batch algorithm.}},

   technology. This balance can be evaluated by quantitatively modeling the
   execution of quantum logic operations on a realistic quantum hardware
   containing limited computational resources. In this work, we report a
   complete performance simulation software tool capable of (1) searching
   the hardware design space by varying resource architecture and
   technology parameters, (2) synthesizing and scheduling a fault-tolerant
   quantum algorithm within the hardware constraints, (3) quantifying the
   performance metrics such as the execution time and the failure
   probability of the algorithm, and (4) analyzing the breakdown of these
   metrics to highlight the performance bottlenecks and visualizing
   resource utilization to evaluate the adequacy of the chosen design.
   Using this tool, we investigate a vast design space for implementing key
   building blocks of Shor's algorithm to factor a 1,024-bit number with a
   baseline budget of 1.5 million qubits. We show that a trapped-ion
   quantum computer designed with twice as many qubits and one-tenth of the
   baseline infidelity of the communication channel can factor a 2,048-bit
   integer in less than 5 months.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to improve reproducibility and translatability
   of preclinical data to fully exploit opportunities for molecular
   therapeutics involving radiation and radiochemotherapy. For in vitro
   research, the clonogenic assay remains the current state-of-the-art of
   preclinical assays, whereas newer moderate and high-throughput assays
   offer the potential for rapid initial screening. Studies of radiation
   response modification by molecularly targeted agents can be improved
   using more physiologic 3D culture models. Elucidating effects on the
   cancer stem cells (CSC, and CSC-like) and developing biomarkers for
   defining targets and measuring responses are also important. In vivo
   studies are necessary to confirm in vitro findings, further define
   mechanism of action, and address immunomodulation and treatment-induced
   modification of the microenvironment. Newer in vivo models include
   genetically engineered and patient-derived xenograft mouse models and
   spontaneously occurring cancers in domesticated animals. Selection of
   appropriate endpoints is important for in vivo studies; for example,
   regrowth delay measures bulk tumor killing, whereas local tumor control
   assesses effects on CSCs. The reliability of individual assays requires
   standardization of procedures and cross-laboratory validation. Radiation
   modifiers must be tested as part of clinical standard of care, which
   includes radiochemotherapy for most tumors. Radiation models are
   compatible with but also differ from those used for drug screening.
   Furthermore, the mechanism of a drug as a chemotherapeutic agent may be
   different from its interaction with radiation and/or radiochemotherapy.
   This provides an opportunity to expand the use of molecular-targeted
   agents. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To determine whether longitudinal changes in mesopic visual
   function on microperimetry occurred independent of its associations with
   microstructural parameters on spectral-domain optical coherence
   tomography (SD-OCT) in the early stages of AMD.
   METHODS. Forty-one AMD eyes underwent microperimetry testing and SD-OCT
   scans over a 12-month period at 6-month intervals. Microstructural
   parameters analyzed include the retinal pigment epithelium-drusen
   complex (RPEDC) layer thickness, number of hyperreflective foci (HF) and
   their inner retinal migration (represented by a weighted axial
   distribution score; AxD), and the number of atrophic areas.
   RESULTS. Microperimetric sensitivity was 0.29 dB (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] = -0.38 to -0.20 dB, P < 0.001) and 0.13 dB (95\% CI =
   -0.22 to -0.03 dB, P = 0.008) lower in each sector for every 10-mu m
   higher RPEDC layer thickness and 1-HF present, but was not associated
   with the AxD score or the number of atrophic areas present (P <= 0.464).
   However, each 10-mu m greater RPEDC layer thickness and 1-HF present was
   not independently associated with a further decline in sensitivity
   (-0.08 dB/year, 95\% CI = -0.24 to 0.07 dB/year, P = 0.288 and 0.09
   dB/year, 95\% CI = -0.06 to 0.24 dB/year, P = 0.242, respectively) over
   time when accounting for the association between RPEDC layer thickness
   and number of HF with microperimetric sensitivity.
   CONCLUSIONS. Longitudinal changes in mesopic visual function measured on
   microperimetry paralleled changes in the microstructural changes over a
   12-month time frame, without any changes occurring independent of the
   associations between structure and function alone.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound image quality is often inherently limited by the physical
   dimensions of the imaging transducer. We hypothesize that, by collecting
   synthetic aperture data sets over a range of aperture positions while
   precisely tracking the position and orientation of the transducer, we
   can synthesize large effective apertures to produce images with improved
   resolution and target detectability. We analyze the two largest limiting
   factors for coherent signal summation: aberration and mechanical
   uncertainty. Using an excised canine abdominal wall as a model phase
   screen, we experimentally observed an effective arrival time error
   ranging from 18.3 ns to 58 ns (root-mean-square error) across the swept
   positions. Through this clutter-generating tissue, we observed a 72.9\%
   improvement in resolution with only a 3.75 dB increase in side lobe
   amplitude compared to the control case. We present a simulation model to
   study the effect of calibration and mechanical jitter errors on the
   synthesized point spread function. The relative effects of these errors
   in each imaging dimension are explored, showing the importance of
   orientation relative to the point spread function. We present a
   prototype device for performing swept synthetic aperture imaging using a
   conventional 1-D array transducer and ultrasound research scanner. Point
   target reconstruction error for a 44.2 degree sweep shows a
   reconstruction precision of 82.8 mu m and 17.8 mu m in the lateral and
   axial dimensions respectively, within the acceptable performance bounds
   of the simulation model. Improvements in resolution, contrast and
   contrast-to-noise ratio are demonstrated in vivo and in a fetal phantom.}},

   force microscopy which is exquisitely sensitive to stiffness changes
   that arise from even a single atomic layer of a van der Waals-adhered
   material is a powerful experimental tool to address this challenge. A
   combined density functional theory and continuum modeling approach is
   introduced that yields sub-surface-sensitive, nanomechanical
   fingerprints associated with specific, well-defined structure models of
   individual surface domains. Where such models are known, this
   information can be correlated with experimentally obtained
   contact-resonance frequency maps to reveal the (sub)surface structure of

Title = {{Toward Standardized Acoustic Radiation Force (ARF)-Based Ultrasound
   Elasticity Measurements With Robotic Force Control}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Acoustic radiation force (ARF)-based approaches to measure
   tissue elasticity require transmission of a focused high-energy acoustic
   pulse from a stationary ultrasound probe and ultrasound-based tracking
   of the resulting tissue displacements to obtain stiffness images or
   shear wave speed estimates. The method has established benefits in
   biomedical applications such as tumor detection and tissue fibrosis
   staging. One limitation, however, is the dependence on applied probe
   pressure, which is difficult to control manually and prohibits
   standardization of quantitative measurements. To overcome this
   limitation, we built a robot prototype that controls probe contact
   forces for shear wave speed quantification. Methods: The robot was
   evaluated with controlled force increments applied to a tissue-mimicking
   phantom and in vivo abdominal tissue from three human volunteers.
   Results: The root-mean-square error between the desired and measured
   forces was 0.07 N in the phantom and higher for the fatty layer of in
   vivo abdominal tissue. The mean shear wave speeds increased from3.7 to
   4.5 m/s in the phantom and 1.0 to 3.0 m/s in the in vivo fat for
   compressive forces ranging from 2.5 to 30 N. The standard deviation of
   shear wave speeds obtained with the robotic approach were low inmost
   cases (<0.2 m/s) and comparable to that obtained with a semiquantitative
   landmark-based method. Conclusion: Results are promising for the

Abstract = {{The interactions between electrons and lattice vibrations are
   fundamental to materials behaviour. In the case of group IV-VI, V and
   related materials, these interactions are strong, and the materials
   exist near electronic and structural phase transitions. The prototypical
   example is PbTe whose incipient ferroelectric behaviour has been
   recently associated with large phonon anharmonicity and
   thermoelectricity. Here we show that it is primarily electron-phonon
   coupling involving electron states near the band edges that leads to the
   ferroelectric instability in PbTe. Using a combination of nonequilibrium
   lattice dynamics measurements and first principles calculations, we find
   that photoexcitation reduces the Peierls-like electronic instability and
   reinforces the paraelectric state. This weakens the long-range forces
   along the cubic direction tied to resonant bonding and low lattice
   thermal conductivity. Our results demonstrate how
   free-electron-laser-based ultrafast X-ray scattering can be utilized to
   shed light on the microscopic mechanisms that determine materials
   properties.}},

Title = {{Rational design of carbon nitride photocatalysts by identification of
   cyanamide defects as catalytically relevant sites}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The heptazine-based polymer melon (also known as graphitic carbon
   nitride, g-C3N4) is a promising photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.
   Nonetheless, attempts to improve its inherently low activity are rarely
   based on rational approaches because of a lack of fundamental
   understanding of its mechanistic operation. Here we employ molecular
   heptazine-based model catalysts to identify the cyanamide moiety as a
   photocatalytically relevant `defect'. We exploit this knowledge for the
   rational design of a carbon nitride polymer populated with cyanamide
   groups, yielding a material with 12 and 16 times the hydrogen evolution
   rate and apparent quantum efficiency (400 nm), respectively, compared
   with the unmodified melon. Computational modelling and material
   characterization suggest that this moiety improves coordination (and, in
   turn, charge transfer kinetics) to the platinum co-catalyst and enhances
   the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. The demonstrated
   knowledge transfer for rational catalyst design presented here provides
   the conceptual framework for engineering high-performance
   heptazine-based photocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in flow-based microfluidics now allow an efficient
   implementation of biochemistry on-a-chip for DNA sequencing, drug
   discovery, and point-of-care disease diagnosis. However, the adoption of
   flow-based biochips is hampered by defects that frequently occur in
   chips fabricated using soft lithography techniques. Recently published
   work has shown how we can automate the testing of flow-based biochips;
   diagnosis methods are now needed to identify the flaws in the
   fabrication process and to facilitate the use of partially defective
   chips. Since disposable biochips are being targeted for a highly
   competitive and low-cost market segment, such diagnosis methods need to
   be inexpensive, quick, and effective. In this paper, we present the
   first approach for the automated diagnosis of leakage and blockage
   defects in flow-based microfluidic biochips. The proposed method targets
   the identification of fault types and their locations based on test
   outcomes. It reduces the number of possible fault sites significantly
   while identifying their exact locations. We use a graph representation
   of flow paths and a formulation based on hitting sets for the analysis
   of observed error syndromes. The diagnosis technique is evaluated on
   three fabricated biochips, and the localization of faults and their
   classification are achieved correctly in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{Static random access memories (SRAMs) built on carbon nanotube field
   effect transistors (CNFETs) are promising alternatives to conventional
   CMOS-based SRAMs, due to their advantages in terms of power consumption
   and noise immunity. However, the nonideal carbon nanotube (CNT)
   fabrication process generates metallic-CNTs (m-CNTs) along with
   semiconductor-CNTs, leading to correlated faulty cells along the growth
   direction of the m-CNTs. In this paper, we propose a novel low-cost test
   solution to detect such faults. Instead of using conventional March test
   to test each and every SRAM cell, we selectively test certain SRAM cells
   and judiciously skip testing other SRAM cells between the selected
   cells. To ensure high fault coverage, we propose three jump test
   algorithms for different CNFET-SRAM layouts. Moreover, we model
   m-CNT-induced SRAM faults and characterize their distribution in the
   SRAM array. Experimental results show that the proposed solutions are
   able to achieve high fault coverage with low test cost.}},

Abstract = {{For circular trace scanning synthetic aperture radar (CTSSAR), the
   conventional approximated quadratic range equation assumption does not
   hold due to the impact of the curved flight path. Thus, existing SAR
   methods cannot focus the target accurately and efficiently in CTSSAR. To
   address this problem, the stationary phase can be regarded as an
   implicit function of the Doppler frequency. Therefore, the 2-D spectrum
   can be consequently achieved by employing the principle of stationary
   phase. In this letter, an imaging algorithm based on the derived
   spectrum is developed for CTSSAR. Promising results from simulation
   demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Wall penetration of the electromagnetic wave causes target image
   defocused and displaced from its true position in through-wall radar
   imaging. To solve this problem, this letter proposes an approximate wall
   compensation algorithm, named the refraction angle approximation
   algorithm, which assumes that the actual refraction angle is
   approximately equal to the one whose incidence angle is the azimuth
   angle of the target. The assumption is reasonable since the refraction
   angle is less sensitive to the incidence angle and limited in a small
   range based on the Snell's law, and the cosine function has a small
   derivative at a small angle. Theoretical derivation indicates that the
   time delay estimation error can be ignored if the target is not so close
   to the wall surface around the radar. Numerical simulation verifies the
   efficacy of the algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental techniques and DFT calculations have been combined to study
   and compare the effect of the metal-substrate interaction in
   Cu/TiO2(110) and Cu/CeOx/TiO2(110) catalysts for the water-gas shift
   (WGS) reaction. Experiments and theory show that CeOx nanoparticles
   affect the dispersion of copper on titania, and on the formed
   copper-ceria interface, there are synergistic effects which favor water
   dissociation and the WGS reaction. The minimum energy path for the WGS
   reaction on the new highly active catalytic system Cu/CeOx/TiO2(110) has
   been predicted by theoretical calculations. Main steps such as
   adsorption-dissociation of water and {*}OCOH carboxyl intermediate
   formation-deprotonation have been characterized. In this very particular
   system, water splitting is no longer the rate-limiting step because it
   can dissociate overcoming an energy barrier of only 0.92 kcal/mol. One
   important insight of the present work is to show that easy full
   hydration of the ceria particles strongly lowers the reaction barrier
   for the deprotonation of the {*}OCOH intermediate and facilitates the
   evolution of the WGS reaction. For the first time, a system has been
   found on which the WGS reaction is able to work with all the involved
   energy barriers below 12 kcal/mol. This remarkable behavior makes the
   metal/CeOx/TiO2 family a potential candidate for industrial application
   as catalysts in the WGS reaction. The change in the metal-support
   interactions when going from Cu/TiO2 to Cu/CeOx/TiO2 illustrates the
   importance of optimizing the oxide phase when improving the performance
   of metal/oxide catalysts for the WGS.}},

Abstract = {{From its early beginnings in characterizing aerosol particles to its
   recent applications for investigating natural waters and waste streams,
   single particle inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (spICP-MS)
   has proven to be a powerful technique for the detection and
   characterization of aqueous dispersions of metal-containing
   nanomaterials. Combining the high-throughput of an ensemble technique
   with the specificity of a single particle counting technique and the
   elemental specificity of ICP-MS, spICP-MS is capable of rapidly
   providing researchers with information pertaining to size, size
   distribution, particle number concentration, and major elemental
   composition with minimal sample perturbation. Recently, advances in data
   acquisition, signal processing, and the implementation of alternative
   mass analyzers (e.g., time-of-flight) has resulted in a wider breadth of
   particle analyses and made significant progress toward overcoming many
   of the challenges in the quantitative analysis of nanoparticles. This
   review provides an overview of spICP-MS development from a niche
   technique to application for routine analysis, a discussion of the key
   issues for quantitative analysis, and examples of its further
   advancement for analysis of increasingly complex environmental and
   biological samples.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we report the proof of concept of the possibility
   to identify natural dyes on textiles using surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) detection by means of a simple ``dry-state{''} SERS
   approach, i.e., exploiting the interactions between a solid nanometallic
   substrate and dye molecules present on textiles, thus avoiding any
   extraction or necessity to remove samples. The challenges associated
   with instrumental constraints related to SERS analysis of bulk materials
   and possible contamination of artworks with metallic nanoparticles were
   approached. Different silver nanosubstrates, i.e., nanoislands and films
   obtained starting from two different metal colloids, were tested for
   this aim. The study also investigates different parameters associated
   with the synthesis of nanosubstrates influencing the enhancement of the
   ``dry-state{''} SERS signals obtained. SERS spectra of anthraquinone red
   dyes were successfully recorded from reference wool threads using this
   simple approach. The results illustrate the usefulness of the practical
   and rapid ``dry-state{''} SERS approach that could open new
   opportunities toward the non-destructive analysis of dyes in artefacts.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors discuss measurement methods and instrumentation
   useful for the characterization of the gray tracking performance of
   medical color monitors for diagnostic applications. The authors define
   gray tracking as the variability in the chromaticity of the gray levels
   in a color monitor.
   Methods: The authors present data regarding the capability of color
   measurement instruments with respect to their abilities to measure a
   target white point corresponding to the CIE Standard Illuminant D65 at
   different luminance values within the grayscale palette of a medical
   display. The authors then discuss evidence of significant differences in
   performance among color measurement instruments currently available for
   medical physicists to perform calibrations and image quality checks for
   the consistent representation of color in medical displays. In addition,
   the authors introduce two metrics for quantifying grayscale chromaticity
   consistency of gray tracking.
   Results: The authors' findings show that there is an order of magnitude
   difference in the accuracy of field and reference instruments. The gray
   tracking metrics quantify how close the grayscale chromaticity is to the
   chromaticity of the full white point (equal amounts of red, green, and
   blue at maximum level) or to consecutive levels (equal values for red,
   green, and blue), with a lower value representing an improved grayscale
   tracking performance. An illustrative example of how to calculate and
   report the gray tracking performance according to the Task Group
   definitions is provided.
   Conclusions: The authors' proposed methodology for characterizing the
   grayscale degradation in chromaticity for color monitors that can be
   used to establish standards and procedures aiding in the quality control
   testing of color displays and color measurement instrumentation. (C)

Abstract = {{The modelling of diffusive terms in particle methods is a delicate
   matter and several models were proposed in the literature to take such
   terms into account. The diffusion velocity method (DVM), originally
   designed for the diffusion of passive scalars, turns diffusive terms
   into convective ones by expressing them as a divergence involving a
   so-called diffusion velocity. In this paper, DVM is extended to the
   diffusion of vectorial quantities in the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes
   equations, in their incompressible, velocity-vorticity formulation. The
   integration of a large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model is
   investigated and a DVM general formulation is proposed. Either with or
   without LES, a novel expression of the diffusion velocity is derived,
   which makes it easier to approximate and which highlights the analogy
   with the original formulation for scalar transport. From this statement,
   DVM is then analysed in one dimension, both analytically and numerically
   on test cases to point out its good behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies have reported blood brain barrier (BBB)
   dysfunction after blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI). Despite
   this evidence, there is limited quantitative understanding of the extent
   of BBB opening and the time course of damage after blast injury. In
   addition, many studies do not report kinematic parameters of head
   motion, making it difficult to separate contributions of primary and
   tertiary blast-loading. Detailed characterization of blast-induced BBB
   damage may hold important implications for serum constituents that may
   potentially cross the compromised barrier and contribute to
   neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and persistent neurologic deficits.
   Using an in vivo bTBI model, systemic administration of sodium
   fluorescein (NaFl; 376 Da), Evans blue (EB; 69 kDa when bound to serum
   albumin), and dextrans (3-500 kDa) was used to estimate the pore size of
   BBB opening and the time required for recovery. Exposure to blast with
   272 +/- 6 kPa peak overpressure, 0.69 +/- 0.01 ms duration, and 65 +/- 1
   kPa{*}ms impulse resulted in significant acute extravasation of NaFl, 3
   kDa dextran, and EB. However, there was no significant acute
   extravasation of 70 kDa or 500 kDa dextrans, and minimal to no
   extravasation of NaFl, dextrans, or EB 1 day after exposure. This study
   presents a detailed analysis of the time course and pore size of BBB
   opening after bTBI, supported by a characterization of kinematic
   parameters associated with blast-induced head motion.}},

Abstract = {{How do interacting physical and biological processes control the form
   and evolution of salt-marsh landscapes? Salt marshes are shaped by the
   erosion, transport and deposition of sediment, all of which are mediated
   by vegetation. In addition, vegetation plays a key role in deposition of
   organic material within marsh sediments. The influence of biota on
   salt-marsh landscapes is indeed well established. However, a fascinating
   and relevant question is whether one can identify the signatures of the
   underlying and intertwined physical and biological processes in marsh
   landscapes, and indeed infer from them the dynamic behavior of these
   coupled physical and biological systems. Can one detect landscape
   features that would not have emerged in the absence of interactions and
   feedbacks between physical and biological processes?
   Here we use field evidence and a two-dimensional biomorphodynamic model
   to show that the interplay between physical and biological processes
   generates striking biological and morphological patterns. One such
   pattern, vegetation zonation, consists of a mosaic of vegetation
   patches, of approximately uniform composition, displaying sharp
   transitions in the presence of extremely small topographic gradients.
   The model describes the mutual interaction and adjustment between tidal
   flows, sediment transport, morphology, and vegetation distribution, thus
   allowing us to study the biomorphodynamic evolution of salt-marsh
   platforms. A number of different scenarios were modelled to analyze the
   changes induced in bio-geomorphic patterns by varying environmental
   forcings, such as the rate of relative sea level rise (RSLR) andsediment
   supply (SS), and by plant species with different characteristics. Model
   results show how marsh responses to changes in forcings are highly
   spatially dependent: while changes in SS most directly affect marsh
   areas closest to the channels, changes in the rate of RSLR affect the
   marsh platform as a whole. Organic sediment accretion is very important
   for allowing marshes to compete with increasing rates of RSLR near
   watershed divides, whereas inorganic sedimentation is more important
   closer to the channels. Increasing sediment supply to coastal marshes,
   therefore, might not compensate for rising sea levels, particularly in
   the inner marsh portions. Model results also emphasize that biodiversity
   is strongly controlled by environmental forcings and that zonation
   patterns are a signature of bio-geomorphic feedbacks with vegetation
   acting as a landscape constructor which feeds back on, directly alters,
   and contributes to shape tidal environments. Finally, the model
   generates realistic frequency distributions of vegetation occurrence,
   which nicely meet observed ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Salt marshes are ubiquitous features of the tidal landscape governed by
   mutual feedbacks among processes of physical and biological nature.
   Improving our understanding of these feedbacks and of their effects on
   tidal geomorphological and ecological dynamics is a critical step to
   address issues related to salt-marsh conservation and response to
   changes in the environmental forcing. In particular, the spatial
   variation of organic and inorganic soil production processes at the
   marsh scale, a key piece of information to understand marsh responses to
   a changing climate, remains virtually unexplored. In order to
   characterize the relative importance of organic vs. inorganic deposition
   as a function of space, we collected 33 shallow soil sediment samples
   along three transects in the San Felice and Riga salt marshes located in
   the Venice lagoon, Italy. The amount of organic matter in each sample
   was evaluated using Loss On Ignition (LOI), a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
   treatment, and a sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) treatment following the
   H2O2 treatment. The grain size distribution of the inorganic fraction
   was determined using laser diffraction techniques. Our study marshes
   exhibit a weakly concave-up profile, with maximum elevations and coarser
   inorganic grains along their edges. The amount of organic and inorganic
   matter content in the samples varies with the distance from the marsh
   edge and is very sensitive to the specific analysis method adopted. The
   use of a H2O2+NaClO treatment yields an organic matter density value
   which is more than double the value obtained from LOI. Overall,
   inorganic contributions to soil formation are greatest near the marsh
   edges, whereas organic soil production is the main contributor to soil
   accretion in the inner marsh. We interpret this pattern by considering
   that while plant biomass productivity is generally lower in the inner
   part of the marsh, organic soil decomposition rates are highest in the
   better aerated edge soils. Hence the higher inorganic soil content near
   the edge is due to the preferential deposition of inorganic sediment
   from the adjacent creek, and to the rapid decomposition of the
   relatively large biomass production. The higher organic matter content
   in the inner part of the marsh results from the small amounts of
   suspended sediment that makes it to the inner marsh, and to the low
   decomposition rate which more than compensates for the lower biomass
   productivity in the low-lying inner zones. Finally, the average soil
   organic carbon density from the LOI measurements is estimated to be
   0.044 g C cm(-3). The corresponding average carbon accumulation rate for
   the San Felice and Riga salt marshes, 132 g C m(-2) yr(-1), highlights
   the considerable carbon stock and sequestration rate associated with
   coastal salt marshes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the coupled biotic and abiotic dynamics in intertidal

   We explore the effects of two widely different types of vegetation:
   salt-marsh vegetation and mangroves. These two types of vegetation,
   which colonize distinct geographical areas, are characterized by
   different biomass productivities and stabilization mechanisms. We show
   that changing vegetation and biofilm properties result in differing
   stable states, both in their type and number. The presence of the
   biofilm exerts a dominant control on the tidal flat (lower intertidal)
   equilibrium elevation and stability. Vegetation controls the elevation
   of the marsh platform (i.e., the upper intertidal equilibrium). The two
   types of vegetation considered lead to similar effects on the stability
   of the system despite their distinct biophysical interactions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Histopathology is the clinical standard for tissue diagnosis; however,
   it requires tissue processing, laboratory personnel and infrastructure,
   and a highly trained pathologist to diagnose the tissue. Optical
   microscopy can provide real-time diagnosis, which could be used to
   inform the management of breast cancer. The goal of this work is to
   obtain images of tissue morphology through fluorescence microscopy and
   vital fluorescent stains and to develop a strategy to segment and
   quantify breast tissue features in order to enable automated tissue
   diagnosis.
   We combined acriflavine staining, fluorescence microscopy, and a
   technique called sparse component analysis to segment nuclei and
   nucleoli, which are collectively referred to as acriflavine positive
   features (APFs). A series of variables, which included the density, area
   fraction, diameter, and spacing of APFs, were quantified from images
   taken from clinical core needle breast biopsies and used to create a
   multivariate classification model. The model was developed using a
   training data set and validated using an independent testing data set.
   The top performing classification model included the density and area
   fraction of smaller APFs (those less than 7 A mu m in diameter, which
   likely correspond to stained nucleoli).When applied to the independent
   testing set composed of 25 biopsy panels, the model achieved a
   sensitivity of 82 \%, a specificity of 79 \%, and an overall accuracy of
   80 \%.
   These results indicate that our quantitative microscopy toolbox is a
   potentially viable approach for detecting the presence of malignancy in
   clinical core needle breast biopsies.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the demand for high-speed wireless communications, carrier
   frequencies have increased in the search for both available and wider
   bands. The millimeter-wave and terahertz bands (0.1-3 THz) are commonly
   believed to be impractical for all but short-range links due to severe
   attenuation by atmospheric water vapor. However, the field of
   submillimeter radio astronomy has demonstrated that this can be
   effectively mitigated by the construction of large aperture telescopes
   in very dry high-altitude locations, such as the Atacama Large
   Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Chilean Andes. Modeling has
   shown that Earth-satellite links in excess of 1 Tb per second can be
   achieved with a system patterned off observatories, since the loss of a
   satellite link from a dry location equals a sea-level path of only
   several kilometers. Despite advantages over optical satellite links, THz
   links have not been an area of active study. We review the technology
   and science necessary to develop a terabit-per-second THz satellite link
   and argue that a satellite link offers a good first step toward the
   development of ubiquitous THz communications.}},

Abstract = {{Three important properties of a classification machinery are i) the
   system preserves the core information of the input data; ii) the
   training examples convey information about unseen data; and iii) the
   system is able to treat differently points from different classes. In
   this paper, we show that these fundamental properties are satisfied by
   the architecture of deep neural networks. We formally prove that these
   networks with random Gaussian weights perform a distance-preserving
   embedding of the data, with a special treatment for in-class and
   out-of-class data. Similar points at the input of the network are likely
   to have a similar output. The theoretical analysis of deep networks here
   presented exploits tools used in the compressed sensing and dictionary
   learning literature, thereby making a formal connection between these
   important topics. The derived results allow drawing conclusions on the
   metric learning properties of the network and their relation to its
   structure, as well as providing bounds on the required size of the
   training set such that the training examples would represent faithfully
   the unseen data. The results are validated with state-of-the-art trained
   networks.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{95-104}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of wavelength dependent aerosol light absorption
   coefficients were carried out as part of the Southern Oxidant and
   Aerosol Study (SOAS) during the summer of 2013 to determine the
   contribution of light absorbing organic carbon (BrC) to total aerosol
   light absorption in a rural location (Centreville, AL) and an urban area
   (Atlanta, GA). The light absorption coefficients in the near UV and
   visible wavelengths were measured for both ambient air, as well as
   ambient air heated in a thermal denuder to 200 degrees C to remove the
   semi-volatile organic compounds. Atlanta measurements show dominance of
   semi-volatile brown carbon with an average absorption angstrom exponent
   (AAE) of 1.4 before heating and about 1.0 after heating. In urban
   Atlanta, a decrease of about similar to 35\% in the light absorption
   coefficient at 370 nm after heating indicates that light absorbing
   organic compounds are a substantial fraction of the light absorption
   budget. Furthermore, a considerable increase in the fraction of light
   absorption by the semi-volatile aerosol occurs during the daytime,
   likely linked with photochemistry. Measurements at rural Centerville, on
   the other hand, do not show any major change in AAE with values before
   and after heating of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. Overall the results
   suggest that photochemical aged urban emissions result in the presence
   of light absorbing BrC, while at rural locations which are dominated by
   aged aerosol and local biogenic emissions (based, on measurements of
   Angstrom exponents) BrC does not significantly contribute to light
   absorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil formation results from opposite processes of bedrock weathering and
   erosion, whose balance may be altered by natural events and human
   activities, resulting in reduced soil depth and function. The impacts of
   vegetation on soil production and erosion and the feedbacks between soil
   formation and vegetation growth are only beginning to be explored
   quantitatively. Since plants require suitable soil environments,
   disturbed soil states may support less vegetation, leading to a downward
   spiral of increased erosion and decline in ecosystem function. We
   explore these feedbacks with a minimal model of the soil-plant system
   described by two coupled nonlinear differential equations, which include
   key feedbacks, such as plant-driven soil production and erosion
   inhibition. We show that sufficiently strong positive plant-soil
   feedback can lead to a `humped' soil production function, a necessary
   condition for soil depth bistability when erosion is assumed to vary
   monotonically with vegetation biomass. In bistable plant-soil systems,
   the sustainable soil condition engineered by plants is only accessible
   above a threshold vegetation biomass and occurs in environments where
   the high potential rate of erosion exerts a strong control on soil
   production and erosion. Vegetation removal for agriculture reduces the
   stabilizing effect of vegetation and lowers the system resilience,
   thereby increasing the likelihood of transition to a degraded soil
   state. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{A metasurface that absorbs waves from all directions of incidence can be
   achieved if the surface impedance is made to vary as a function of
   incidence angle in a specific manner. Here we show that a periodic array
   of planar nanoparticles coupled to a metal film can act as an absorbing
   metasurface with an angle-dependent impedance. Through a semi-analytical
   calculation based on coupled-mode theory, we find the perfect absorbing
   condition is equivalent to balancing the Ohmic and radiative losses of
   the nanoparticles at normal incidence. Absorption over a wide range of
   incidence angles can then be obtained by tailoring the scattered
   far-field pattern of the individual planar nanoparticles such that their
   radiative losses remain constant. The theory provides a means of
   understanding the behavior of perfect absorbing structures that have
   been observed experimentally or numerically, reconciling previously
   published theories and enabling the optimization of absorbing surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are increasingly entering the
   environment with uncertain consequences including potential ecological
   effects. Various research communities view differently whether
   ecotoxicological testing of ENMs should be conducted using
   environmentally relevant concentrations where observing outcomes is
   difficult versus higher ENM doses, where responses are observable. What
   exposure conditions are typically used in assessing ENM hazards to
   populations? What conditions are used to test ecosystem-scale hazards?
   What is known regarding actual ENMs in the environment, via measurements
   or modeling simulations? How should exposure conditions, ENM
   transformation, dose, and body burden be used in interpreting biological
   and computational findings for assessing risks? These questions were
   addressed in the context of this critical review. As a result, three
   main recommendations emerged. First, researchers should improve
   ecotoxicology of ENMs by choosing test end points, duration, and study
   conditions-including ENM test concentrations that align with realistic
   exposure scenarios. Second, testing should proceed via tiers with
   iterative feedback that informs experiments at other levels of
   biological organization. Finally, environmental realism in ENM hazard
   assessments should involve greater coordination among ENM quantitative
   analysts, exposure modelers, and ecotoxicologists, across government,
   industry, and academia.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a terrestrial gamma ray flash (TGF) that occurred on 15
   August 2014 coincident with an altitude-triggered lightning at the
   International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT) in North
   Central Florida. The TGF was observed by a ground-level network of gamma
   ray, close electric field, distant magnetic field, Lightning Mapping
   Array (LMA), optical, and radar measurements. Simultaneous gamma ray and
   LMA data indicate that the upward positive leader of the triggered
   lightning flash induced relativistic runaway electron avalanches when
   the leader tip was at about 3.5 km altitude, resulting in the observed
   TGF. Channel luminosity and electric field data show that there was an
   initial continuous current (ICC) pulse in the lightning channel to
   ground during the time of the TGF. Modeling of the observed ICC pulse
   electric fields measured at close range (100-200 m) indicates that the
   ICC pulse current had both a slow and fast component (full widths at
   half maximum of 235 mu s and 59 mu s) and that the fast component was
   more or less coincident with the TGF, suggesting a physical association
   between the relativistic runaway electron avalanches and the ICC pulse
   observed at ground. Our ICC pulse model reproduces moderately well the
   measured close electric fields at the ICLRT as well as three independent
   magnetic field measurements made about 250 km away. Radar and LMA data
   suggest that there was negative charge near the region in which the TGF
   was initiated.}},

   Conditions for Reliable Classification}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3035-3050}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers the classification of linear subspaces with
   mismatched classifiers. In particular, we assume a model where one
   observes signals in the presence of isotropic Gaussian noise and the
   distribution of the signals conditioned on a given class is Gaussian
   with a zero mean and a low-rank covariance matrix. We also assume that
   the classifier knows only a mismatched version of the parameters of
   input distribution in lieu of the true parameters. By constructing an
   asymptotic low-noise expansion of an upper bound to the error
   probability of such a mismatched classifier, we provide sufficient
   conditions for reliable classification in the low-noise regime that are
   able to sharply predict the absence of a classification error floor.
   Such conditions are a function of the geometry of the true signal
   distribution, the geometry of the mismatched signal distributions as
   well as the interplay between such geometries, namely, the principal
   angles and the overlap between the true and the mismatched signal
   subspaces. Numerical results demonstrate that our conditions for
   reliable classification can sharply predict the behavior of a mismatched
   classifier both with synthetic data and in a motion segmentation and a
   hand-written digit classification applications.}},

Abstract = {{Non-thermal plasma (NTP) is an emerging technology for the treatment of
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in polluted point source air streams.
   Here, a dielectric barrier discharge NTP was used to evaluate the
   treatment efficiency of several common VOCs at constant experimental
   conditions (gas residence time of 0.016 s in the plasma zone, 95-100
   ppm(v) average inlet VOC concentration in air). When treated as single
   pollutant with a specific input energy (SIE) of 350 J L-1, the removal
   efficiency of the VOC followed the following sequence: methyl ethyl
   ketone (50\%), benzene (58\%), toluene (74\%), 3-pentanone (76\%),
   methyl tert-butyl ether (80\%), ethylbenzene (81\%), and n-hexane
   (90\%). The effects of pollutant structure on VOC removal efficiency
   were investigated. The highest removal efficiencies were observed for
   compounds with the highest percentage of hydrogen in their molecular
   structures. During treatment of toluene and ethylbenzene vapors, a dark
   brown, tar-like deposit formed inside the plasma reactor. The deposit
   formation rate depended on both treated VOCs as well as on experimental
   conditions such as VOC concentration, and SIE. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Preparation of regenerable granular carbon nanotubes by a simple

   pharmaceuticals}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{294}},

Abstract = {{A simple and convenient method was used to prepare novel granular carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) for enhanced adsorption of pharmaceuticals. By heating
   CNTs powder at 450 degrees C in air, followed by filtration, the
   obtained granular adsorbent exhibited high surface area and pore volume
   since the heating process produced some oxygen-containing functional
   groups on CNT surface, making CNTs more dispersible in the formation of
   granular cake. The porous granular CNTs not only had more available
   surfaces for adsorption but also were more easily separated from
   solution than pristine CNTs (p-CNTs) powder. This adsorbent exhibited
   relatively fast adsorption for carbamazepine (CBZ), tetracycline (TC)
   and diclofenac sodium (DS), and the maximum adsorption capacity on the
   granular CNTs was 369.5 mu mol/g for CBZ, 284.2 mu mol/g for TC and
   203.1 mu mol/g for DS according to the Langmuir fitting, increasing by
   42.4\%, 37.8\% and 38.0\% in comparison with the pristine CNTs powder.
   Moreover, the spent granular CNTs were successfully regenerated at 400
   degrees C in air without decreasing the adsorption capacity in five
   regeneration cycles. The adsorbed CBZ and DS were completely degraded,
   while the adsorbed TC was partially oxidized and the residual was
   favorable for the subsequent adsorption. This research develops an easy
   method to prepare and regenerate granular CNT adsorbent for the enhanced
   removal of organic pollutants from water or wastewater. (C) 2016

Title = {{A variational multiscale finite element method for monolithic ALE
   computations of shock hydrodynamics using nodal elements}},

Abstract = {{We present a monolithic arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite
   element method for computing highly transient flows with strong shocks.
   We use a variational multiscale (VMS) approach to stabilize a
   piecewise-linear Galerkin formulation of the equations of compressible
   flows, and an entropy artificial viscosity to capture strong solution
   discontinuities. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of VMS methods
   for highly transient shock flows, an area of research for which the VMS
   literature is extremely scarce. In addition, the proposed monolithic ALE
   method is an alternative to the more commonly used Lagrangian+remap
   methods, in which, at each time step, a Lagrangian computation is
   followed by mesh smoothing and remap (conservative solution
   interpolation). Lagrangian+remap methods are the methods of choice in
   shock hydrodynamics computations because they provide nearly optimal
   mesh resolution in proximity of shock fronts. However, Lagrangian+remap
   methods are not well suited for imposing inflow and outflow boundary
   conditions. These issues offer an additional motivation for the proposed
   approach, in which we first perform the mesh motion, and then the flow
   computations using the monolithic ALE framework.
   The proposed method is second-order accurate and stable, as demonstrated
   by extensive numerical examples in two and three space dimensions. (C)

Abstract = {{Magnetophoretic conductor tracks are used to transport single magnetized
   beads and magnetically labeled single cells in a 3D time-varying
   magnetic field. The vertical field bias, in addition to the in-plane
   rotating field, has the advantage of reducing the attraction between
   particles, which inhibits the formation of particle clusters. However,
   the inclusion of a vertical field requires the re-design of magnetic
   track geometries, which can transport magnetized objects across the
   substrate. Following insights from magnetic bubble technology, it is
   found that successful magnetic conductor geometries defined in soft
   magnetic materials must be composed of alternating sections of positive
   (convex) and negative (concave) curvature. In addition to the previously
   studied magnetic tracks from the magnetic bubble literature, a
   drop-shape pattern is found to be even more adept at transporting small
   magnetic beads and single cells. Symmetric patterns are shown to achieve
   bi-directional conduction, whereas asymmetric patterns achieve
   unidirectional conduction. These designs represent the electrical
   circuit corollaries of the conductor and diode, respectively. Finally,
   biological applications are demonstrated in the transport of single
   cells and in the size-based separation of magnetic particles.}},

Title = {{Effect of the mandible on mouthguard measurements of head kinematics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1845-1853}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Wearable sensors are becoming increasingly popular for measuring head
   motions and detecting head impacts. Many sensors are worn on the skin or
   in headgear and can suffer from motion artifacts introduced by the
   compliance of soft tissue or decoupling of headgear from the skull. The
   instrumented mouthguard is designed to couple directly to the upper
   dentition, which is made of hard enamel and anchored in a bony socket by
   stiff ligaments. This gives the mouthguard superior coupling to the
   skull compared with other systems. However, multiple validation studies
   have yielded conflicting results with respect to the mouthguard's head
   kinematics measurement accuracy. Here, we demonstrate that imposing
   different constraints on the mandible (lower jaw) can alter mouthguard
   kinematic accuracy in dummy headform testing. In addition, post mortem
   human surrogate tests utilizing the worst-case unconstrained mandible
   condition yield 40\% and 80\% normalized root mean square error in
   angular velocity and angular acceleration respectively. These errors can
   be modeled using a simple spring-mass system in which the soft
   mouthguard material near the sensors acts as a spring and the mandible
   as a mass. However, the mouthguard can be designed to mitigate these
   disturbances by isolating sensors from mandible loads, improving
   accuracy to below 15\% normalized root mean square error in all
   kinematic measures. Thus, while current mouthguards would suffer from
   measurement errors in the worst case unconstrained mandible condition,
   future mouthguards should be designed to account for these disturbances
   and future validation testing should include unconstrained mandibles to
   ensure proper accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{N-cadherin is Key to Expression of the Nucleus Pulposus Cell Phenotype
   under Selective Substrate Culture Conditions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells of the intervertebral disc are essential for
   synthesizing extracellular matrix that contributes to disc health and
   mechanical function. NP cells have a unique morphology and molecular
   expression pattern derived from their notochordal origin, and reside in
   N-cadherin (CDH2) positive cell clusters in vivo. With disc
   degeneration, NP cells undergo morphologic and phenotypic changes
   including loss of CDH2 expression and ability to form cell clusters.
   Here, we investigate the role of CDH2 positive cell clusters in
   preserving healthy, biosynthetically active NP cells. Using a
   laminin-functionalized hydrogel system designed to mimic features of the
   native NP microenvironment, we demonstrate NP cell phenotype and
   morphology is preserved only when NP cells form CDH2 positive cell
   clusters. Knockdown (CRISPRi) or blocking CDH2 expression in vitro and
   in vivo results in loss of a healthy NP cell. Findings also reveal that
   degenerate human NP cells that are CDH2 negative can be promoted to
   re-express CDH2 and healthy, juvenile NP matrix synthesis patterns by
   promoting cell clustering for controlled microenvironment conditions.
   This work also identifies CDH2 interactions with beta-catenin-regulated
   signaling as one mechanism by which CDH2-mediated cell interactions can
   control NP cell phenotype and biosynthesis towards maintenance of
   healthy intervertebral disc tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass harvest generates an imbalance in forest carbon (C) and nitrogen
   (N) cycles and the nonlinear bio-geochemical responses may have
   long-term consequences for soil fertility and sustainable management We
   analyze these dynamics and characterize the impact of biomass harvest
   and N fertilization on soil biogeochemistry and ecosystem yield with an
   ecosystem model of intermediate complexity that couples plant and soil C
   and N cycles. Two harvest schemes are modeled: continuous harvest at low
   intensity and periodic clear-cut harvest. Continuously-harvested systems
   sustain N harvest at steady-state under net mineralization conditions,
   which depends on the C:N ratio and respiration rate of decomposers.
   Further, linear stability analysis reveals steady-state harvest regimes
   are associated with stable foci, indicating oscillations in C and N
   pools that decay with time after harvest. Modeled ecosystems under
   periodic clear-cut harvest operate in a limit-cycle with net
   mineralization on average. However, when N limitation is strong, soil
   C-N cycling switches between net immobilization and net mineralization
   through time. The model predicts an optimal rotation length associated
   with a maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and minimum external N losses.
   Through non-linear plant-soil feedbacks triggered by harvest, strong N
   limitation promotes short periods of immobilization and mineral N
   retention, which alter the relation between MSY and N losses. Rotational
   systems use N more efficiently than continuous systems with equivalent
   biomass yield as immobilization protects mineral N from leaching losses.
   These results highlight dynamic soil C-N cycle responses to harvest
   strategy that influence a range of functional characteristics, including
   N retention, leaching, and biomass yield. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach for the stabilization of linear tetrahedral
   finite elements in the case of nearly incompressible transient solid
   dynamics computations. Our method is based on a mixed formulation, in
   which the momentum equation is complemented by a rate equation for the
   evolution of the pressure field, approximated with piecewise linear,
   continuous finite element functions. The pressure equation is stabilized
   to prevent spurious pressure oscillations in computations. Incidentally,
   it is also shown that many stabilized methods previously developed for
   the static case do not generalize easily to transient dynamics.
   Extensive tests in the context of linear and nonlinear elasticity are
   used to corroborate the claim that the proposed method is robust,
   stable, and accurate. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical and strategic materials in the
   defense, energy, electronics, and automotive industries. The reclamation
   of REEs from coal combustion fly ash has been proposed as a way to
   supplement REE mining. However, the typical REE contents in coal fly
   ash, particularly in the United States, have not been comprehensively
   documented or compared among the major types of coal feedstocks that
   determine fly ash composition. The objective of this study was to
   characterize a broad selection of U.S. fly ashes of varied geological
   origin in order to rank their potential for REE recovery. The total and
   nitric acid-extractable REE content for more than 100 ash samples were
   correlated with characteristics such as the major element content and
   coal basin to elucidate trends in REE enrichment. Average total REE
   content (defined as the sum of the lanthanides, yttrium, and scandium)
   for ashes derived from Appalachian sources was 591 mg kg(-1) and
   significantly greater than in ashes from Illinois and Powder River basin
   coals (403 and 337 mg kg(-1), respectively). The fraction of critical
   REEs (Nd, Eu, Tb, Dy, Y, and Er) in the fly ashes was 34-38\% of the
   total and considerably higher than in conventional ores (typically less
   than 15\%). Powder River Basin ashes had the highest extractable REE
   content, with 70\% of the total REE recovered by heated nitric acid
   digestion. This is likely due to the higher calcium content of Powder
   River Basin ashes, which enhances their solubility in nitric acid. Sc,
   Nd, and Dy were the major contributors to the total REE value in fly
   ash, based on their contents and recent market prices. Overall, this
   study shows that coal fly ash production could provide a substantial
   domestic supply of REEs, but the feasibility of recovery depends on the
   development of extraction technologies that could be tailored to the
   major mineral content and origins of the feed coal for the ash.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Terahertz electromagnetic waves have long been proposed to be ideal for
   spectroscopy and imaging through non-polar dielectric materials that
   contain no water. Terahertz radiation may thus be useful for monitoring
   burn and wound injury recovery, as common care treatments involve
   application of both a clinical dressing and topical ointment. Here, we
   investigate the optical properties of typical care treatments in the
   millimeter wave (150-300 GHz), terahertz (0.3-3 THz), and infrared
   (14.5-0.67 mu m) ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. We find that
   THz radiation realizes low absorption coefficients and high levels of
   transmission compared to infrared wavelengths, which were strongly
   attenuated. Terahertz imaging can enable safe, non-ionizing, noninvasive
   monitoring of the healing process directly through clinical dressings
   and recovery ointments, minimizing the frequency of dressing changes and
   thus increasing the rate of the healing process. Published by AIP

Title = {{Neural Network Evidence for the Coupling of Presaccadic Visual Remapping
   to Predictive Eye Position Updating}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{As we look around a scene, we perceive it as continuous and stable even
   though each saccadic eye movement changes the visual input to the
   retinas. How the brain achieves this perceptual stabilization is
   unknown, but a major hypothesis is that it relies on presaccadic
   remapping, a process in which neurons shift their visual sensitivity to
   a new location in the scene just before each saccade. This hypothesis is
   difficult to test in vivo because complete, selective inactivation of
   remapping is currently intractable. We tested it in silico with a
   hierarchical, sheet-based neural network model of the visual and
   oculomotor system. The model generated saccadic commands to move a video
   camera abruptly. Visual input from the camera and internal copies of the
   saccadic movement commands, or corollary discharge, converged at a
   map-level simulation of the frontal eye field (FEF), a primate brain
   area known to receive such inputs. FEF output was combined with eye
   position signals to yield a suitable coordinate frame for guiding arm
   movements of a robot. Our operational definition of perceptual stability
   was ``useful stability,{''} quantified as continuously accurate pointing
   to a visual object despite camera saccades. During training, the
   emergence of useful stability was correlated tightly with the emergence
   of presaccadic remapping in the FEF. Remapping depended on corollary
   discharge but its timing was synchronized to the updating of eye
   position. When coupled to predictive eye position signals, remapping
   served to stabilize the target representation for continuously accurate
   pointing. Graded inactivations of pathways in the model replicated, and
   helped to interpret, previous in vivo experiments. The results support
   the hypothesis that visual stability requires presaccadic remapping,
   provide explanations for the function and timing of remapping, and offer
   testable hypotheses for in vivo studies. We conclude that remapping
   allows for seamless coordinate frame transformations and quick actions
   despite visual afferent lags. With visual remapping in place for
   behavior, it may be exploited for perceptual continuity.}},

Abstract = {{Saccadic eye movements can be elicited by more than one type of sensory
   stimulus. This implies substantial transformations of signals
   originating in different sense organs as they reach a common motor
   output pathway. In this study, we compared the prevalence and magnitude
   of auditory- and visually evoked activity in a structure implicated in
   oculomotor processing, the primate frontal eye fields (FEF). We recorded
   from 324 single neurons while 2 monkeys performed delayed saccades to
   visual or auditory targets. We found that 64\% of FEF neurons were
   active on presentation of auditory targets and 87\% were active during
   auditory- guided saccades, compared with 75 and 84\% for visual targets
   and saccades. As saccade onset approached, the average level of
   population activity in the FEF became indistinguishable on visual and
   auditory trials. FEF activity was better correlated with the movement
   vector than with the target location for both modalities. In summary,
   the large proportion of auditory- responsive neurons in the FEF, the
   similarity between visual and auditory activity levels at the time of
   the saccade, and the strong correlation between the activity and the
   saccade vector suggest that auditory signals undergo tailoring to match
   roughly the strength of visual signals present in the FEF, facilitating
   accessing of a common motor output pathway.}},

Title = {{Reverse Time Migration Using the Pseudospectral Time-Domain Algorithm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We propose a pre-stack reverse time migration (RTM) seismic imaging
   method using the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) algorithm.
   Traditional pseudospectral method uses the fast Fourier transform (FFT)
   algorithm to calculate the spatial derivatives, but is limited by the
   wraparound effect due to the periodicity assumed in the FFT. The PSTD
   algorithm combines the pseudospectral method with a perfectly matched
   layer (PML) for acoustic waves. PML is a highly effective absorbing
   boundary condition that can eliminate the wraparound effect. It enables
   a wide application of the pseudospectral method to complex models. RTM
   based on the PSTD algorithm has advantages in the computational
   efficiency compared to traditional methods such as the second-order and
   high order finite difference time-domain (FDTD) methods. In this work,
   we implement the PSTD algorithm for acoustic wave equation based RTM. By
   applying the PSTD-RTM method to various seismic models and comparing it
   with RTM based on the eighth-order FDTD method, we find that PSTD-RTM
   method has better performance and saves more than 50\% memory. The
   method is suitable for parallel computation, and has been accelerated by
   general purpose graphics processing unit.}},

Title = {{Antibiotics as a selective driver for conjugation dynamics}},
Journal = {{NATURE MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It is generally assumed that antibiotics can promote horizontal gene
   transfer. However, because of a variety of confounding factors that
   complicate the interpretation of previous studies, the mechanisms by
   which antibiotics modulate horizontal gene transfer remain poorly
   understood. In particular, it is unclear whether antibiotics directly
   regulate the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer, serve as a
   selection force to modulate population dynamics after such gene transfer
   has occurred, or both. Here, we address this question by quantifying
   conjugation dynamics in the presence and absence of antibiotic-mediated
   selection. Surprisingly, we find that sublethal concentrations of
   antibiotics from the most widely used classes do not significantly
   increase the conjugation efficiency. Instead, our modelling and
   experimental results demonstrate that conjugation dynamics are dictated
   by antibiotic-mediated selection, which can both promote and suppress
   conjugation dynamics. Our findings suggest that the contribution of
   antibiotics to the promotion of horizontal gene transfer may have been
   overestimated. These findings have implications for designing effective
   antibiotic treatment protocols and for assessing the risks of antibiotic
   use.}},

Title = {{Packet-Level Network Compression: Realization and Scaling of the
   Network-Wide Benefits}},
Journal = {{IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1588-1604}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The existence of considerable amount of redundancy in the Internet
   traffic at the packet level has stimulated the deployment of
   packet-level redundancy elimination techniques within the network by
   enabling network nodes to memorize data packets. Redundancy elimination
   results in traffic reduction which in turn improves the efficiency of
   network links. In this paper, the concept of network compression is
   introduced that aspires to exploit the statistical correlation beyond
   removing large duplicate strings from the flow to better suppress
   redundancy. In the first part of the paper, we introduce
   ``memory-assisted compression,{''} which utilizes the memorized content
   within the network to learn the statistics of the information source
   generating the packets which can then be used toward reducing the length
   of codewords describing the packets emitted by the source. Using
   simulations on data gathered from real network traces, we show that
   memory-assisted compression can result in significant traffic reduction.
   In the second part of the paper, we study the scaling of the average
   network-wide benefits of memory-assisted compression. We discuss routing
   and memory placement problems in network for the reduction of overall
   traffic. We derive a closed-form expression for the scaling of the gain
   in Erdos-Renyi random network graphs, where obtain a threshold value for
   the number of memories deployed in a random graph beyond which
   network-wide benefits start to shine. Finally, the network-wide benefits
   are studied on Internet-like scale-free networks. We show that
   non-vanishing network compression gain is obtained even when only a tiny
   fraction of the total number of nodes in the network are memory-enabled.}},

Abstract = {{International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA)
   activities and partnerships were initiated as a part of the 2007-09
   International Polar Year (IPY) and are expected to continue for many
   decades as a legacy program. The IASOA focus is on coordinating
   intensive measurements of the Arctic atmosphere collected in the United
   States, Canada, Russia, Norway, Finland, and Greenland to create
   synthesis science that leads to an understanding of why and not just how
   the Arctic atmosphere is evolving. The IASOA premise is that there are
   limitations with Arctic modeling and satellite observations that can
   only be addressed with boots-on-the-ground, in situ observations and
   that the potential of combining individual station and network
   measurements into an integrated observing system is tremendous. The
   IASOA vision is that by further integrating with other network observing
   programs focusing on hydrology, glaciology, oceanography, terrestrial,
   and biological systems it will be possible to understand the mechanisms
   of the entire Arctic system, perhaps well enough for humans to mitigate
   undesirable variations and adapt to inevitable change.}},

Abstract = {{Optical spectroscopy is sensitive to morphological composition and has
   potential applications in intraoperative margin assessment. Here, we
   evaluate ex vivo breast tissue and corresponding quantified hematoxylin

   composition stratified by patient characteristics. Adipose sites (213)
   were characterized by their cell area and density. All other benign and

   composition. The relationships between mean reduced scattering
   coefficient (<mu(s)'>), and \% adipose, \% collagen, \% glands,
   adipocyte cell area, and adipocyte density were investigated. These
   relationships were further stratified by age, menopausal status, body
   mass index (BMI), and breast density. We identified a positive
   correlation between <mu(s)'> and \% collagen and a negative correlation
   between <mu(s)'> and age and BMI. Increased collagen corresponded to
   increased <mu(s)'> variability. In postmenopausal women, <mu(s)'> was
   similar regardless of fibroglandular content. Contributions from
   collagen and glands to <mu(s)'> were independent and equivalent in
   benign sites; glands showed a stronger positive correlation than
   collagen to <mu(s)'> in malignant sites. Our data suggest that
   scattering could differentiate highly scattering malignant from benign
   tissues in postmenopausal women. The relationship between scattering and
   tissue composition will support improved scattering models and
   technologies to enhance intraoperative optical margin assessment. (C)

Title = {{Beyond the SCS-CN method: A theoretical framework for spatially lumped
   rainfall-runoff response}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Since its introduction in 1954, the Soil Conservation Service curve
   number (SCS-CN) method has become the standard tool, in practice, for
   estimating an event-based rainfall-runoff response. However, because of
   its empirical origins, the SCS-CN method is restricted to certain
   geographic regions and land use types. Moreover, it does not describe
   the spatial variability of runoff. To move beyond these limitations, we
   present a new theoretical framework for spatially lumped, event-based
   rainfall-runoff modeling. In this framework, we describe the spatially
   lumped runoff model as a point description of runoff that is upscaled to
   a watershed area based on probability distributions that are
   representative of watershed heterogeneities. The framework accommodates
   different runoff concepts and distributions of heterogeneities, and in
   doing so, it provides an implicit spatial description of runoff
   variability. Heterogeneity in storage capacity and soil moisture are the
   basis for upscaling a point runoff response and linking ecohydrological
   processes to runoff modeling. For the framework, we consider two
   different runoff responses for fractions of the watershed area:
   prethreshold and threshold-excess runoff. These occur before and after
   infiltration exceeds a storage capacity threshold. Our application of
   the framework results in a new model (called SCS-CNx) that extends the
   SCS-CN method with the prethreshold and threshold-excess runoff
   mechanisms and an implicit spatial description of runoff. We show proof
   of concept in four forested watersheds and further that the resulting
   model may better represent geographic regions and site types that
   previously have been beyond the scope of the traditional SCS-CN method.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical cyclones (TCs), often associated with massive flooding and
   landslides in the Southeast U.S. (SE U.S.), provide a significant input
   of freshwater to the hydrologic system, and their timing and trajectory
   significantly impact drought severity and persistence. This manuscript
   investigates the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) in the
   SE U.S. to TC activity using the 1-D column implementation of the Duke
   Coupled Hydrology Model with Vegetation (DCHM-V) including coupled water
   and energy cycles and a biochemical representation of photosynthesis.
   Decadal-scale simulations of water, energy, and carbon fluxes were
   conducted at high temporal (30min) and spatial (4km) resolution over the
   period 2002-2012. At local scales, model results without calibration
   compare well against AmeriFlux tower data. At regional scales,
   differences between the DCHM-V estimates and the Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP product reflect the spatial organization
   of soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture dynamics by physiographic
   region, highlighting the links between the water and carbon cycles. To
   isolate the contribution of TC precipitation to SE U.S. productivity,
   control forcing simulations are contrasted with simulations where
   periods of TC activity in the atmospheric forcing data were replaced
   with climatology. During wet years, TC activity impacts productivity in
   40-50\% of the SE U.S. domain and explains a regional GPP increase of
   3-5MgC/m(2) that is 9\% of the warm season total. In dry years, 23-34\%
   of the domain exhibits a smaller positive response that corresponds to
   4-8\% of the seasonal carbon uptake, depending on TC timing and
   trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Patterning cells on material surfaces is an important tool for the study
   of fundamental cell biology, tissue engineering, and cell-based
   bioassays. Here, the authors report a simple approach to pattern cells
   on gold patterned silicon substrates with high precision, fidelity, and
   stability. Cell patterning is achieved by exploiting adsorbed biopolymer
   orientation to either enhance (gold regions) or impede (silicon oxide
   regions) cell adhesion at particular locations on the patterned surface.
   Genetic incorporation of gold binding domains enables C-terminal
   chemisorption of polypeptides onto gold regions with enhanced
   accessibility of N-terminal cell binding domains. In contrast, the
   orientation of polypeptides adsorbed on the silicon oxide regions limit
   the accessibility of the cell binding domains. The dissimilar
   accessibility of cell binding domains on the gold and silicon oxide
   regions directs the cell adhesion in a spatially controlled manner in
   serum-free medium, leading to the formation of well-defined cellular
   patterns. The cells are confined within the polypeptide-modified gold
   regions and are viable for eight weeks, suggesting that bioactive
   polypeptide modified surfaces are suitable for long-term maintenance of
   patterned cells. This study demonstrates an innovative
   surface-engineering approach for cell patterning by exploiting distinct
   ligand accessibility on heterogeneous surfaces. (C) 2016 American Vacuum

Abstract = {{This paper shows how the presence of unstable equilibrium configurations
   of elastic continua is reflected in the behaviour of transients induced
   by large perturbations. A beam that is axially loaded beyond its
   critical state typically exhibits two buckled stable equilibrium
   configurations, separated by one or more unstable equilibria. If the
   beam is then loaded laterally (effectively like a shallow arch) it may
   snap-through between these states, including the case in which the
   loading is applied dynamically and of short duration, i.e. an impact.
   Such impacts, if applied at random locations and of random strength,
   will generate an ensemble of transient trajectories that explore the
   phase space. Given sufficient variety, some of these trajectories will
   possess initial energy that is close to (just less than or just greater
   than) the energy required to cause snap-through and will have a tendency
   to slowdown as they pass close to an unstable configuration: a saddle
   point in a potential energy surface, for example. Although this
   close-encounter is relatively straightforward in a system characterized
   by a single degree of freedom, it is more challenging to identify in a
   higher order or continuous system, especially in a (necessarily) noisy
   experimental system. This paper will show how the identification of
   unstable equilibrium configurations can be achieved using transient
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamical systems are frequently used to model biological systems. When
   these models are fit to data, it is necessary to ascertain the
   uncertainty in the model fit. Here, we present prediction deviation, a
   metric of uncertainty that determines the extent to which observed data
   have constrained the model's predictions. This is accomplished by
   solving an optimization problem that searches for a pair of models that
   each provides a good fit for the observed data, yet has maximally
   different predictions. We develop a method for estimating a priori the
   impact that additional experiments would have on the prediction
   deviation, allowing the experimenter to design a set of experiments that
   would most reduce uncertainty. We use prediction deviation to assess
   uncertainty in a model of interferon-alpha inhibition of viral
   infection, and to select a sequence of experiments that reduces this
   uncertainty. Finally, we prove a theoretical result which shows that
   prediction deviation provides bounds on the trajectories of the
   underlying true model. These results show that prediction deviation is a
   meaningful metric of uncertainty that can be used for optimal
   experimental design. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a method to design and characterize mechanically
   robust solid acoustic metamaterials suitable for operation in dense
   fluids such as water. These structures, also called metafluids, behave
   acoustically as inertial fluids characterized by anisotropic mass
   densities and isotropic bulk modulus. The method is illustrated through
   the design and experimental characterization of a metafluid consisting
   of perforated steel plates held together by rubber coated magnetic
   spacers. The spacers are very effective at reducing the effective shear
   modulus of the structure, and therefore effective at minimizing the
   ensuing coupling between the shear and pressure waves inside the solid
   effective medium. Inertial anisotropy together with fluid-like acoustic
   behavior are key properties that bring transformation acoustics in dense
   fluids closer to reality. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Bacillus cereus is an opportunistic foodborne agent causing food
   poisoning and many infectious diseases. The heat-stable emetic toxin
   cereulide is one of the most prevalent toxins produced by pathogenic B.
   cereus, resulting in symptoms such as emesis and liver failure. In the
   present work, the toxicity and toxicokinetics of cereulide from an
   emetic B. cereus isolate (CAU45) of raw milk were evaluated. The
   production of cereulide was tested by a cytotoxicity test and enzyme
   immunoassay, and confirmed by the presence of the ces (cereulide
   synthetase) gene and the ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem
   mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. All results showed that the
   amount and toxicity of cereulide produced by CAU45 was 7 to 15.3 folds
   higher than the reference emetic B. cereus DSMZ 4312. Cereulide in
   plasma was collected at different time points after a single intravenous
   injection to evaluate its toxicokinetics in rabbits. The maximum
   concentration of cereulide was achieved in 2.6 +/- 3.4 h after
   administration, with the elimination half-life of 10.8 +/- 9.1 h, which
   expands our understanding of the toxic effects of cereulide. Together,
   it suggests that urgent sanitary practices are needed to eliminate
   emetic toxins and emetic B. cereus in raw milk.}},

Abstract = {{Colorectal cancer cells with stem-like properties, referred to as colon
   cancer-initiating cells (CCIC), have high tumorigenic potential. While
   CCIC can differentiate to promote cellular heterogeneity, it remains
   unclear whether CCIC within a tumor contain distinct subpopulations.
   Here, we describe the co-existence of fast-and slow-cycling CCIC, which
   can undergo asymmetric division to generate each other, highlighting
   CCIC plasticity and interconvertibility. Fast-cycling CCIC express
   markers, such as LGR5 and CD133, rely on MYC for their proliferation,
   whereas slow-cycling CCIC express markers, such as BMI1 and hTERT, are
   independent of MYC. NOTCH signaling promotes asymmetric cell fate,
   regulating the balance between these two populations. Overall, our
   results illuminate the basis for CCIC heterogeneity and plasticity by
   defining a direct inter-conversion mechanism between slow-and
   fast-cycling CCIC. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Title = {{Does optimal foraging theory predict the foraging performance of a large
   air-breathing marine predator?}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{223-235}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Optimal foraging theory (OFT) suggests that air-breathing diving animals
   should minimize costs associated with feeding under water (e.g. travel
   time, oxygen loss) while simultaneously maximizing benefits gained from
   doing so (e.g. foraging time, energy gain). Humpback whales, Megaptera
   novaeangliae, foraging along the Western Antarctic Peninsula appear to
   forage according to OFT, but the direct costs and benefits in terms of
   their behaviours (e.g. allocation of time) have not been examined. We
   compared the foraging behaviour of humpback whales in this region
   inferred from multisensor high-resolution recording tags to their
   behaviour predicted by OFT time allocation models assuming the following
   currencies were being maximized: (1) the proportion of time spent
   foraging, (2) the net rate of energetic gain and/or (3) the ratio of
   energy gained to energy expended (i.e. efficiency). Model predictions
   for all three currencies were similar, suggesting any of these OFT
   models were suitable for comparison with the observed data. However,
   agreement between observed and optimal behaviours varied widely
   depending on the physiological and behavioural values used to derive
   optimal predictions, highlighting the need for an improved understanding
   of cetacean physiology. Despite this, many of the theoretical OFT
   predictions were supported: shallow dives (i.e. < 100 m), which were
   short and executed most frequently, yielded the highest proportions of
   foraging time, and the greatest net rates of energy gain and were the
   most efficient. In addition, dive and foraging times increased in
   duration rapidly with increasing maximum dive depths to approximately

Abstract = {{Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established
   treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However,
   the mechanisms of action of DBS are unknown. Random temporal patterns of
   DBS are less effective than regular DBS, but the neuronal basis for this
   dependence on temporal pattern of stimulation is unclear. Using a rat
   model of PD, we quantified the changes in behavior and single-unit
   activity in globus pallidus externa and substantia nigra pars reticulata
   during high-frequency STN DBS with different degrees of irregularity.
   Although all stimulus trains had the same average rate, 130-Hz regular
   DBS more effectively reversed motor symptoms, including circling and
   akinesia, than 130-Hz irregular DBS. A mixture of excitatory and
   inhibitory neuronal responses was present during all stimulation
   patterns, and mean firing rate did not change during DBS. Low-frequency
   (7-10 Hz) oscillations of single-unit firing times present in
   hemiparkinsonian rats were suppressed by regular DBS, and neuronal
   firing patterns were entrained to 130 Hz. Irregular patterns of DBS less
   effectively suppressed 7- to 10-Hz oscillations and did not regularize
   firing patterns. Random DBS resulted in a larger proportion of neuron
   pairs with increased coherence at 7-10 Hz compared with regular 130-Hz
   DBS, which suggested that long pauses (interpulse interval >50 ms)
   during random DBS facilitated abnormal low-frequency oscillations in the
   basal ganglia. These results suggest that the efficacy of high-frequency
   DBS stems from its ability to regularize patterns of neuronal firing and
   thereby suppress abnormal oscillatory neural activity within the basal
   ganglia.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the imaging capabilities of a one-dimensional, dynamic,
   metamaterial aperture that operates at the lower part of K-band
   microwave frequencies (17.5-21.1 GHz). The dynamic aperture consists of
   a microstrip transmission line with an array of radiating,
   complementary, subwavelength metamaterial irises patterned into the
   upper conductor. Diodes integrated into the metamaterial resonators
   provide voltage-controlled switching of the resonant metamaterial
   elements between radiating and nonradiating states. Applying a series of
   on/off patterns to the metamaterial resonators produces a series of
   distinct radiation patterns that sequentially illuminate a scene. The
   backscattered signal contains encoded scene information over a set of
   measurements that can be postprocessed to reconstruct an image. We
   present a series of design considerations for the dynamic aperture, as
   well as a series of experimental studies performed using a dynamic
   aperture prototype. High-fidelity, real-time, diffractionlimited imaging
   using the prototype is demonstrated. The dynamic aperture suggests a
   path to fast and reliable imaging with low-cost and versatile hardware,
   for a variety of applications including security screening, biomedical
   diagnostics, and through-wall imaging. (C) 2016 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (EITL, also known as type II
   enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma) is an aggressive intestinal
   disease with poor prognosis and its molecular alterations have not been
   comprehensively characterized. We aimed to identify actionable
   easy-to-screen alterations that would allow better diagnostics and/or
   treatment of this deadly disease. By performing whole-exome sequencing
   of four EITL tumor-normal pairs, followed by amplicon deep sequencing of
   42 tumor samples, frequent alterations of the JAK-STAT and
   G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways were discovered in
   a large portion of samples. Specifically, STAT5B was mutated in a
   remarkable 63\% of cases, JAK3 in 35\% and GNAI2 in 24\%, with the
   majority occurring at known activating hotspots in key functional
   domains. Moreover, STAT5B locus carried copy-neutral loss of
   heterozygosity resulting in the duplication of the mutant copy,
   suggesting the importance of mutant STAT5B dosage for the development of
   EITL. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT and GPCR pathways was also supported
   by gene expression profiling and further verified in patient tumor
   samples. In vitro overexpression of GNAI2 mutants led to the
   upregulation of pERK1/2, a member of MEK-ERK pathway. Notably,
   inhibitors of both JAK-STAT and MEK-ERK pathways effectively reduced
   viability of patient-derived primary EITL cells, indicating potential
   therapeutic strategies for this neoplasm with no effective treatment
   currently available.}},

Abstract = {{Estrogen exerts cellular effects through both nuclear (ESR1 and ESR2)
   and membrane-bound estrogen receptors (G-protein coupled estrogen
   receptor, GPER); however, it is unclear if they act independently or
   engage in crosstalk to influence hormonal responses. To investigate each
   receptor's role in proliferation, transcriptional activation, and
   protein phosphorylation in breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we employed
   selective agonists for ESR1 propyl-pyrazole-triol (PPT), ESR2
   diarylpropionitrile (DPN), and GPER (G-1) and also determined the impact
   of xenoestrogens bisphenol-A (BPA) and genistein on these effects. As
   anticipated, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), PPT, DPN, BPA, and genistein each
   enhanced proliferation and activation of an ERE-driven reporter gene
   whereas G-1 had no significant impact. However, G-1 significantly
   reduced E2-, PPT-, DPN-, BPA-, and genistein-induced proliferation and
   ERE activation at doses greater than 500nM indicating that G-1 mediated
   inhibition is not ESR isotype specific. As membrane receptors initiate
   cascades of phosphorylation events, we performed a global
   phosphoproteomic analysis on cells exposed to E2 or G-1 to identify
   potential targets of receptor crosstalk via downstream protein
   phosphorylation targets. Of the 211 phosphorylated proteins identified,
   40 and 13 phosphoproteins were specifically modified by E2 and G-1,
   respectively. Subnetwork enrichment analysis revealed several processes
   related to cell cycle were specifically enriched by G-1 compared with
   E2. Further there existed a number of newly identified proteins that
   were specifically phosphorylated by G-1. These phosphorylation networks
   highlight specific proteins that may modulate the inhibitory effects of
   G-1 and suggest a novel role for interference with nuclear receptor
   activity driven by E2 and xenoestrogens.}},

Abstract = {{Functional fault diagnosis is widely used in board manufacturing to
   ensure product quality and improve product yield. Advanced
   machine-learning techniques have recently been advocated for
   reasoning-based diagnosis; these techniques are based on the historical
   record of successfully repaired boards. However, traditional diagnosis
   systems fail to provide appropriate repair suggestions when the
   diagnostic logs are fragmented and some error outcomes, or syndromes,
   are not available during diagnosis. We describe the design of a
   diagnosis system that can handle missing syndromes and can be applied to
   four widely used machine-learning techniques. Several imputation methods
   are discussed and compared in terms of their effectiveness for
   addressing missing syndromes. Moreover, a syndrome-selection technique
   based on the minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance criteria is also
   incorporated to further improve the efficiency of the proposed methods.
   Two large-scale synthetic data sets generated from the log information
   of complex industrial boards in volume production are used to validate
   the proposed diagnosis system in terms of diagnosis accuracy and
   training time.}},

Abstract = {{A mixture of 85\% nitrogen and 15\% carbon dioxide (N-2/CO2) is
   separable at ambient temperature on a continuous basis. A high-pressure,
   density-driven separator (HDS) was designed and fabricated to explore
   the process. The effect of the fluid variables, including pressure and
   mixture flow rate, was assessed on a separation efficiency metric. An
   important design parameter, the length of the HDS, was also evaluated in
   the experimental design. Essentially perfect separation is observed over
   a wide-range of conditions. Separation efficiency is correlated with two
   dimensionless groups. The first is the Archimedes number. It is a ratio
   of buoyant force to viscous force. The second dimensionless group is
   defined in this work. The Espanani number is the ratio of the pressure
   force to the viscous force. Excellent correlation between separation
   efficiency and the product of the Archimedes number and the Espanani
   number is observed. This observation informs both process and equipment
   design. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control the surface topography of orthopedic implant
   materials is desired to improve osseointegration but is often at the
   expense of mechanical performance in load bearing environments. Here we
   investigate the effects of surface modifications, roughness and
   porosity, on the mechanical properties of a set of polymers with diverse
   chemistry and structure. Both roughness and surface porosity resulted in
   samples with lower strength, failure strain and fatigue life due to
   stress concentrations at the surface; however, the decrease in ductility
   and fatigue strength were greater than the decrease in monotonic
   strength. The fatigue properties of the injection molded polymers did
   not correlate with yield strength as would be traditionally observed in
   metals. Rather, the fatigue properties and the capacity to maintain
   properties with the introduction of surface porosity correlated with the
   fracture toughness of the polymers. Polymer structure impacted the
   materials relative capacity to maintain monotonic and cyclic properties
   in the face of surface texture and porosity. Generally, amorphous
   polymers with large ratios of upper to lower yield points demonstrated a
   more significant drop in ductility and fatigue strength with the
   introduction of porosity compared to crystalline polymers with smaller
   ratios in their upper to lower yield strength. The latter materials have
   more effective dissipation mechanisms to minimize the impact of surface
   porosity on both monotonic and cyclic damage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Prior studies have investigated heart rate dynamics from a variety of
   perspectives, but are often inadequate for predicting heart rate
   responses across a broad range of transient exercise intensities. The
   aim of this study was to develop a nonlinear model to describe the heart
   rate response of an individual during cycling and to investigate whether
   heart rate is more accurately predicted by a combination of power output
   and cadence than by power output alone. The proposed model can account
   for the transient fluctuations of an individual's heart rate while they
   participate in exercise that varies in intensity. The participants for
   this study each performed a fifty minute bout of cycling on an
   electric-braked cycle ergometer in the laboratory. The testing protocol
   for the cycling bout was designed to challenge the predictive
   capabilities of the model and the participants therefore abruptly
   changed their power outputs and cadences throughout the tests, which
   resulted in significant transient fluctuations in their heart rate
   responses. Due to the nonlinear nature of the proposed heart rate model,
   a heuristic algorithm was developed to perform the parameter estimation.
   The model predictions for heart rate matched very well with the
   experimental heart rate responses for each of the participants,
   especially when considering the challenges inherent to predicting abrupt
   transient behavior in the heart rate response. Model comparisons also
   indicated that heart rate is more accurately predicted by a combination
   of power output and cadence than by power output alone.}},

Journal = {{FUZZY OPTIMIZATION AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{155-175}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have introduced a new approach to solve a class of
   interval linear programming (ILP) problems. Firstly, the novel concept
   of an interval ordering relation is further developed to make desired
   solution feasible. Secondly, according to the 3 law of normal
   distribution, a new equivalent transformation for constraints with the
   interval-valued coefficients of ILP is justified. Accordingly, the
   uncertainty stemmed from interval number could be replaced by the
   uncertainty of random variables. Consequently, the classical methodology
   of stochastic linear programming, a chance constrained programming model
   based on normal distribution is designed to work out the equivalent form
   of the original problem. This is because it allows us to carry out the
   optimization operation with a certain calibrated probability. A typical
   numerical example is given to illustrate how to apply equivalent
   transformation in order to realize ILP. Finally, we conclude this paper
   by elaborated comparisons among our method and selected existing
   solutions to advance our confidence of our research results as to their
   correctness and effectiveness.}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve (PN) is a promising
   approach to restore continence and micturition following bladder
   dysfunction resulting from neurological disease or injury. Although the
   pudendo-vesical reflex and its physiological properties are well
   established, there is limited understanding of the specific neural
   mechanisms that mediate this reflex. We sought to develop a
   computational model of the spinal neural network that governs the reflex
   bladder response to PN stimulation. We implemented and validated a
   neural network architecture based on previous neuroanatomical and
   electrophysiological studies. Using synaptically-connected integrate and
   fire model neurons, we created a network model with realistic spiking
   behavior. The model produced expected sacral parasympathetic nucleus
   (SPN) neuron firing rates from prescribed neural inputs and predicted
   bladder activation and inhibition with different frequencies of pudendal
   afferent stimulation. In addition, the model matched experimental
   results from previous studies of temporal patterns of pudendal afferent
   stimulation and selective pharmacological blockade of inhibitory
   neurons. The frequency- and pattern-dependent effects of pudendal
   afferent stimulation were determined by changes in firing rate of spinal
   interneurons, suggesting that neural network interactions at the
   lumbosacral level can mediate the bladder response to different
   frequencies or temporal patterns of pudendal afferent stimulation.
   Further, the anatomical structure of excitatory and inhibitory
   interneurons in the network model was necessary and sufficient to
   reproduce the critical features of the pudendo-vesical reflex, and this
   model may prove useful to guide development of novel, more effective
   electrical stimulation techniques for bladder control.}},

Abstract = {{Overly aggressive prostate cancer (PCa) treatment adversely affects
   patients and places an unnecessary burden on our health care system. The
   inability to identify and grade clinically significant PCa lesions is a
   factor contributing to excessively aggressive PCa treatment, such as
   radical prostatectomy, instead of more focal, prostate-sparing
   procedures such as cryotherapy and high-dose radiation therapy. We have
   performed 3-D in vivo B-mode and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)
   imaging using a mechanically rotated, side-fire endorectal imaging array
   to identify regions suspicious for PCa in 29 patients being treated with
   radical prostatectomies for biopsy-confirmed PCa. Whole-mount
   histopathology analyses were performed to identify regions of clinically
   significant/insignificant PCa lesions, atrophy and benign prostatic
   hyperplasia. Regions of suspicion for PCa were reader-identified in ARFI
   images based on boundary delineation, contrast, texture and location.
   These regions of suspicion were compared with histopathology identified
   lesions using a nearest-neighbor regional localization approach. Of all
   clinically significant lesions identified on histopathology, 71.4\% were
   also identified using ARFI imaging, including 79.3\% of posterior and
   33.3\% of anterior lesions. Among the ARFI-identified lesions, 79.3\%
   corresponded to clinically significant PCa lesions, with these lesions
   having higher indices of suspicion than clinically insignificant PCa.
   ARFI imaging had greater sensitivity for posterior versus anterior
   lesions because of greater displacement signal-to-noise ratio and finer
   spatial sampling. Atrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia can cause
   appreciable prostate anatomy distortion and heterogeneity that confounds
   ARFI PCa lesion identification; however, in general, ARFI regions of
   suspicion did not coincide with these benign pathologies. (E-mail:

Abstract = {{This paper covers a comprehensive forced response analysis conducted on
   a multistage compressor and compared with the largest forced response
   experimental data set ever obtained in the field. The steady-state
   aerodynamic performance and stator wake predictions compare well with
   the experimental data, although losses are underestimated. Coupled and
   uncoupled unsteady simulations are conducted on the stator-rotor
   configuration. It is shown that the use of a decoupled method for forced
   response cannot yield accurate results for cases with strong inter-row
   interactions. The individual and combined contributions of the upstream
   and downstream stators are also assessed. The downstream stator is found
   to have a tremendous impact on the forced response predictions due to
   the constructive interactions of the two stator rows. Finally, predicted
   mistuned blade amplitudes are compared to mistuned experimental data.
   The average amplitudes match the experiments very well, while the
   maximum response amplitude is underestimated.}},

Title = {{Interfacial thermal resistance between the graphene-coated copper and
   liquid water}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{The thermal coupling at water-solid interfaces is a key factor in
   controlling thermal resistance and the performance of nanoscale devices.
   This is especially important across the recently engineered
   nano-composite structures composed of a graphene-coated-metal surface.
   In this paper, a series of molecular dynamics simulations were conducted
   to investigate Kapitza length at the interface of liquid water and
   nano-composite surfaces of graphene-coated-Cu(111). We found that
   Kapitza length gradually increased and converged to the value measured
   on pure graphite surface with the increase of the number of graphene
   layers inserted on the Cu surface. Different than the earlier hypothesis
   on the ``transparency of graphene,{''} the Kapitza length at the
   interface of mono-layer graphene coated Cu and water was found to be 2.5
   times larger than the value of bare Cu surface. This drastic change of
   thermal resistance with the additional of a single graphene is validated
   by the surface energy calculations indicating that the mono-layer
   graphene allows only similar to 18\% van der Waals energy of underneath
   Cu to transmit. We introduced an ``overall interaction strength{''}
   value for the nano-composites based the quantitative contribution of
   pair interaction potentials of each material with water into the total
   surface energy in each case. Similar to earlier studies, results
   revealed that Kapitza length shows exponentially variation as a function
   of the estimated interaction strength of the nano-composite surfaces.
   The effect of Cu/graphene coupling on thermal behavior between the
   nano-composite with water was characterized. The Kapitza length was
   found to decrease significantly with increased Cu/graphene strength in
   the case of weak coupling, while this behavior becomes negligible with
   strong coupling of Cu and graphene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{54-62}},

Abstract = {{Digital image correlation (DIC) is essentially implicated in a class of
   inverse problem. Here, a regularization scheme is developed for the
   subset-based DIC technique to effectively inhibit potential illposedness
   that likely arises in actual deformation calculations and hence enhance
   numerical stability, accuracy and precision of correlation measurement.
   With the aid of a parameterized two-dimensional Butterworth window, a
   regularized subpixel registration strategy is established, in which the
   amount of speckle information introduced to correlation calculations may
   be weighted through equivalent subset size constraint. The optimal
   regularization parameter associated with each individual sampling point
   is determined in a self-adaptive way by numerically investigating the
   curve of 2-norm condition number of coefficient matrix versus the
   corresponding equivalent subset size, based on which the regularized
   solution can eventually be obtained. Numerical results deriving from
   both synthetic speckle images and actual experimental images demonstrate
   the feasibility and effectiveness of the set of newly-proposed
   regularized DIC algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{By comparing the source position of pulses during initial leaders and
   the paths of subsequent dart leaders from typical bilevel intracloud
   (IC) flashes, we demonstrate a new method to image the detailed
   three-dimensional (3-D) structure and stepping dynamics of IC initial
   leaders. Using this approach, we show that nearly half of the initial
   breakdown pulses are not involved in the main channel extension but
   instead originate in nonpropagating branches. The primary upward but
   significantly tilted initial leader channels propagated with measured
   mean/median 3-D step length of 295/265m and mean/median step interval of
   1.05/0.6 ms. The structure and dynamics of IC initial upward negative
   leaders are distinct from those of highly branched cloud-to-ground
   downward negative leaders. We suggest that the tilted initial leader
   channel and electric field could affect the observation on
   leader-associated high-energy radiation phenomena, such as the
   position-dependent observation of terrestrial gamma ray flashes from
   space-based detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocyte spheroids microencapsulated in hydrogels can contribute to
   liver research in various capacities. The conventional approach of
   microencapsulating spheroids produces a variable number of spheroids per
   microgel and requires an extra step of spheroid loading into the gel.
   Here, a microfluidics technology bypassing the step of spheroid loading
   and controlling the spheroid characteristics is reported.
   Double-emulsion droplets are used to generate microencapsulated
   homotypic or heterotypic hepatocyte spheroids (all as single spheroids
   <200 mu m in diameter) with enhanced functions in 4 h. The composition
   of the microgel is tunable as demonstrated by improved hepatocyte
   functions during 24 d culture (albumin secretion, urea secretion, and
   cytochrome P450 activity) when alginate-collagen composite hydrogel is
   used instead of alginate. Hepatocyte spheroids in alginate-collagen also
   perform better than hepatocytes cultured in collagen-sandwich
   configuration. Moreover, hepatocyte functions are significantly enhanced
   when hepatocytes and endothelial progenitor cells (used as a novel
   supporting cell source) are co-cultured to form composite spheroids at
   an optimal ratio of 5: 1, which could be further boosted when
   encapsulated in alginate-collagen. This microencapsulated-spheroid
   formation technology with high yield, versatility, and uniformity is
   envisioned to be an enabling technology for liver tissue engineering as
   well as biomanufacturing.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating organ dose for clinical patients requires accurate modeling
   of the patient anatomy and the dose field of the CT exam. The modeling
   of patient anatomy can be achieved using a library of representative
   computational phantoms (Samei et al 2014 Pediatr. Radiol. 44 460-7). The
   modeling of the dose field can be challenging for CT exams performed
   with a tube current modulation (TCM) technique. The purpose of this work
   was to effectively model the dose field for TCM exams using a
   convolution-based method. A framework was further proposed for
   prospective and retrospective organ dose estimation in clinical
   practice.
   The study included 60 adult patients (age range: 18-70 years, weight
   range: 60-180 kg). Patient-specific computational phantoms were
   generated based on patient CT image datasets. A previously validated
   Monte Carlo simulation program was used to model a clinical CT scanner
   (SOMATOM Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). A
   practical strategy was developed to achieve real-time organ dose
   estimation for a given clinical patient. CTDIvol-normalized organ dose
   coefficients (h(Organ)) under constant tube current were estimated and
   modeled as a function of patient size. Each clinical patient in the
   library was optimally matched to another computational phantom to obtain
   a representation of organ location/distribution. The patient organ
   distribution was convolved with a dose distribution profile to generate
   (CTDIvol)(organ, convolution) values that quantified the regional dose
   field for each organ. The organ dose was estimated by multiplying
   (CTDIvol)(organ,) (convolution) with the organ dose coefficients
   (h(Organ)). To validate the accuracy of this dose estimation technique,
   the organ dose of the original clinical patient was estimated using
   Monte Carlo program with TCM profiles explicitly modeled. The
   discrepancy between the estimated organ dose and dose simulated using
   TCM Monte Carlo program was quantified. We further compared the
   convolution-based organ dose estimation method with two other strategies
   with different approaches of quantifying the irradiation field.
   The proposed convolution-based estimation method showed good accuracy
   with the organ dose simulated using the TCM Monte Carlo simulation. The
   average percentage error (normalized by CTDIvol) was generally within
   10\% across all organs and modulation profiles, except for organs
   located in the pelvic and shoulder regions.
   This study developed an improved method that accurately quantifies the
   irradiation field under TCM scans. The results suggested that organ dose
   could be estimated in real-time both prospectively (with the localizer
   information only) and retrospectively (with acquired CT data).}},

Abstract = {{Acoustophoresis uses acoustic radiation force to remotely manipulate
   particles suspended in a host fluid for many scientific, technological,
   and medical applications, such as acoustic levitation, acoustic
   coagulation, contrast ultrasound imaging, ultrasound-assisted drug
   delivery, etc. To estimate the magnitude of acoustic radiation forces,
   equations derived for an inviscid host fluid are commonly used. However,
   there are theoretical predictions that, in the case of a traveling wave,
   viscous effects can dramatically change the magnitude of acoustic
   radiation forces, which make the equations obtained for an inviscid host
   fluid invalid for proper estimation of acoustic radiation forces. To
   date, experimental verification of these predictions has not been
   published. Experimental measurements of viscous effects on acoustic
   radiation forces in a traveling wave were conducted using a confocal
   optical and acoustic system and values were compared with available
   theories. Our results show that, even in a low-viscosity fluid such as
   water, the magnitude of acoustic radiation forces is increased manyfold
   by viscous effects in comparison with what follows from the equations
   derived for an inviscid fluid.}},

   between lgr5 and bmi1 expressing intestinal stem cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Rapidly cycling LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) located at the base
   of crypts are the primary driver of regeneration. Additionally, BMI1
   expression is correlated with a slow cycling pool of ISCs located at + 4
   position. While previous reports have shown interconversion between
   these two populations following tissue injury, we provide evidence that
   NOTCH signaling regulates the balance between these two populations and
   promotes asymmetric division as a mechanism for interconversion in the
   mouse intestine. In both in vitro and in vivo models, NOTCH suppression
   reduces the ratio of BMI1+/LGR5+ ISCs while NOTCH stimulation increases
   this ratio. Furthermore, NOTCH signaling can activate asymmetric
   division after intestinal inflammation. Overall, these data provide
   insights into ISC plasticity, demonstrating a direct interconversion
   mechanism between slow-and fast-cycling ISCs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{This article proposes ``distributed energy storage{''} as a basic design
   problem of distributing energy storage material on an area. The energy
   flows by fluid flow from a concentrated source to points (users)
   distributed equidistantly on the area. The flow is time-dependent.
   Several scenarios are analyzed: sensible-heat storage, latent-heat
   storage, exergy storage vs energy storage, and the distribution of a
   finite supply of heat transfer surface between the source fluid and the
   distributed storage material. The chief conclusion is that the finite
   amount of storage material should be distributed proportionally with the
   distribution of the flow rate of heating agent arriving on the area. The
   total time needed by the source stream to ``invade{''} the area is
   cumulative (the sum of the storage times required at each storage site)
   and depends on the energy distribution paths and the sequence in which
   the users are served by the source stream. Directions for future designs
   of distributed storage and retrieval are outlined in the concluding
   section. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Surface stress of graphene layers supported on soft substrate}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{We obtain the surface stress of a single layer and multilayers of
   graphene supported on silicone substrates by measuring the deformation
   of the graphene-covered substrates induced by the surface tension of
   liquid droplets together with the Neumann's triangle concept. We find
   that the surface stress of the graphene-covered substrate is significant
   larger than that of the bare substrate, and it increases with increasing
   graphene layers, and finally reaches a constant value of about 120 mN/m
   on three and more layers of graphene. This work demonstrates that the
   apparent surface stress of graphene-substrate systems can be tuned by
   the substrate and the graphene layers. The surface stress and the tuning
   effect of the substrate on it may have applications in design and
   characterization of graphene-based ultra-sensitive sensors and other
   devices. Moreover, the method may also be used to measure the surface
   stress of other ultrathin films supported on soft substrates.}},

   CNT/poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (MWCNT)/(PCL) solution was electrospun to
   form nanofibers of empty set approximate to 100 nm. The MWCNTs aligned
   in fiber direction within the MWCNT/PCL nanofibers. The first time
   creation of the NHSK during electrospinning was confirmed by bright

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between the auditory selectivity of
   neurons and their contribution to perception is critical to the design
   of effective auditory brain prosthetics. These prosthetics seek to mimic
   natural activity patterns to achieve desired perceptual outcomes. We
   measured the contribution of inferior colliculus (IC) sites to
   perception using combined recording and electrical stimulation. Monkeys
   performed a frequency-based discrimination task, reporting whether a
   probe sound was higher or lower in frequency than a reference sound.
   Stimulation pulses were paired with the probe sound on 50\% of trials
   (0.5-80 mu A, 100-300 Hz, n = 172 IC locations in 3 rhesus monkeys).
   Electrical stimulation tended to bias the animals' judgments in a
   fashion that was coarsely but significantly correlated with the best
   frequency of the stimulation site compared with the reference frequency
   used in the task. Although there was considerable variability in the
   effects of stimulation (including impairments in performance and shifts
   in performance away from the direction predicted based on the site's
   response properties), the results indicate that stimulation of the IC
   can evoke percepts correlated with the frequency-tuning properties of
   the IC. Consistent with the implications of recent human studies, the
   main avenue for improvement for the auditory midbrain implant suggested
   by our findings is to increase the number and spatial extent of
   electrodes, to increase the size of the region that can be electrically
   activated, and to provide a greater range of evoked percepts.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid development of nanotechnology has led to concerns over their
   environmental risk. Current analytical techniques are underdeveloped and
   lack the sensitivity and specificity to characterize these materials in
   complex environmental and biological matrices. To this end, single
   particle ICP-MS (spICP-MS) has been developed in the past decade, with
   the capability to detect and characterize nanomaterials at
   environmentally relevant concentrations in complex environmental and
   biological matrices. However, some nanomaterials are composed of
   elements inherently difficult to quantify by quadrupole ICP-MS due to
   abundant molecular interferences, such as dinitrogen ions interfering
   with the detection of silicon. Three approaches aimed at reducing the
   contribution of these background molecular interferences in the analysis
   of Si-28 are explored in an attempt to detect and characterize silica
   colloids. Helium collision cell gases and reactive ammonia gas are
   investigated for their conventional use in reducing the signal generated
   from the dinitrogen interference and background silicon ions leaching
   from glass components of the instrumentation. A new approach brought on
   by the advent of microsecond dwell times in single particle ICP-MS
   allows for the detection and characterization of silica colloids without
   the need for these cell gases, as at shorter dwell times the proportion
   of signal attributed to a nanopartide event is greater relative to the
   constant dinitrogen signal. It is demonstrated that the accurate
   detection and characterization of these materials will be reliant on
   achieving a balance between reducing the contribution of the background
   interference, while still registering the maximum amount of signal
   generated by the particle, event.}},

Abstract = {{Networks of fluorophores arranged at the nanoscale can perform basic
   computation using resonance energy transfer (RET) to transport and
   manipulate information in the form of excitons. As excitons travel
   through RET circuits, they are red-shifted due to vibrational energy
   loss at each transfer event. This loss prohibits RET circuits from being
   cascaded to form larger, more computationally complex systems. To
   address this issue, a nanoassembly capable of converting three or more
   low energy excitons into a single high energy exciton is designed and
   fabricated. Deemed the RET relay, this device uses upconverting
   nanoparticles to achieve anti-Stokes energy transfer from near-infrared
   excited fluorophores to visibly excited fluorophores. In this work, the
   relay is explored by first breaking it into its halves. Each
   fluorophore's ability to donate energy to or from the nanoparticle is
   characterized by a series of photoluminescence experiments. The
   adsorption of these fluorophores to the particle is modeled as a
   Langmuir process, revealing the fractional occupancy of each dye that
   optimizes energy transfer. A fully functional relay is then demonstrated
   by exciting the near-infrared dye and extracting the visible dye's
   fluorescence. Lastly, the performance of the entire construct is
   optimized over a small sampling of assembly reaction coordinates.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{We report an experimental demonstration of electrical tuning of plasmon
   resonances of optical nanopatch antennas over a wide wavelength range.
   The antennas consist of silver nanocubes separated from a gold film by a
   thin 8 nm polyelectrolyte spacer layer. By using ionic liquid and indium
   tin oxide coated glass as a top electrode, we demonstrate dynamic and
   reversible tuning of the plasmon resonance over 100 nm in the visible
   wavelength range using low applied voltages between -3.0V and 2.8V. The
   electrical potential is applied across the nanoscale gap causing changes
   in the gap thickness and dielectric environment which, in turn, modifies
   the plasmon resonance. The observed tuning range is greater than the
   full-width-at-half-maximum of the plasmon resonance, resulting in a
   tuning figure of merit of 1.05 and a tuning contrast greater than 50\%.
   Our results provide an avenue to create active and reconfigurable
   integrated nanophotonic components for applications in optoelectronics
   and sensing. (C) 2016 Author(s). All article content, except where

Abstract = {{The Tongue of the Ocean (TOTO) region located within the Bahamas
   archipelago is a relatively understudied region in terms of both its
   biological and physical oceanographic characteristics. A prey-field
   mapping cruise took place in the fall between 15 September 2008 and 1
   October 2008, consisting of a series of transects and ``clovers{''} to
   study the spatial and temporal variability. The region is characterized
   by a deep scattering layer (DSL), which is preyed on by nekton that
   serves as the food for beaked whale and other whale species. This study
   marks the first of its kind where concurrent measurements of acoustic
   backscatter and turbulence have been conducted for a nekton scattering
   layer well below the euphotic zone. Turbulence data collected from a
   Deep Microstructure Profiler are compared to biological and shear data
   collected by a 38 kHz Simrad EK 60 echo sounder and a hydrographic
   Doppler sonar system, respectively. From these measurements, the primary
   processes responsible for the turbulent production in the TOTO region
   are assessed. The DSL around 500 m and a surface scattering layer (SSL)
   are investigated for raised epsilon values. Strong correlation between
   turbulence levels and scattering intensity of prey is generally found in
   the SSL with dissipation levels as large as similar to 10(-7) W kg(-1),
   3 orders of magnitude above background levels. In the DSL and during the
   diel vertical migration, dissipation levels similar to 10(-8) W kg(-1)
   were observed.}},

Abstract = {{Polynomial Chaos expansions are used to analyze uncertainties in an
   integral oil-gas plume model simulating the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
   The study focuses on six uncertain input parameters-two entrainment
   parameters, the gas to oil ratio, two parameters associated with the
   droplet-size distribution, and the flow rate-that impact the model's
   estimates of the plume's trap and peel heights, and of its various gas
   fluxes. The ranges of the uncertain inputs were determined by
   experimental data. Ensemble calculations were performed to construct
   polynomial chaos-based surrogates that describe the variations in the
   outputs due to variations in the uncertain inputs. The surrogates were
   then used to estimate reliably the statistics of the model outputs, and
   to perform an analysis of variance. Two experiments were performed to
   study the impacts of high and low flow rate uncertainties. The analysis
   shows that in the former case the flow rate is the largest contributor
   to output uncertainties, whereas in the latter case, with the
   uncertainty range constrained by aposteriori analyses, the flow rate's
   contribution becomes negligible. The trap and peel heights uncertainties
   are then mainly due to uncertainties in the 95\% percentile of the
   droplet size and in the entrainment parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainties in parameter values in microbicide pharmacokinetics (PK)
   models confound the models' use in understanding the determinants of
   drug delivery and in designing and interpreting dosing and sampling in
   PK studies. A global sensitivity analysis (Sobol' indices) was performed
   for a compartmental model of the pharmacokinetics of gel delivery of
   tenofovir to the vaginal mucosa. The model's parameter space was
   explored to quantify model output sensitivities to parameters
   characterizing properties for the geledrug product (volume, drug
   transport, initial loading) and host environment (thicknesses of the
   mucosal epithelium and stroma and the role of ambient vaginal fluid in
   diluting gel). Greatest sensitivities overall were to the initial drug
   concentration in gel, gel-epithelium partition coefficient for drug, and
   rate constant for gel dilution by vaginal fluid. Sensitivities for 3 PK
   measures of drug concentration values were somewhat different than those
   for the kinetic PK measure. Sensitivities in the stromal compartment
   (where tenofovir acts against host cells) and a simulated biopsy also
   depended on thicknesses of epithelium and stroma. This methodology and
   results here contribute an approach to help interpret uncertainties in
   measures of vaginal microbicide gel properties and their host
   environment. In turn, this will inform rational gel design and
   optimization. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published

   and Nanophotonics}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{111}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We present a method for colloidal synthesis of silver nanocubes and the
   use of these in combination with a smooth gold film, to fabricate
   plasmonic nanoscale patch antennas. This includes a detailed procedure
   for the fabrication of thin films with a well-controlled thickness over
   macroscopic areas using layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolyte
   polymers, namely poly(allylamine) hydrochloride (PAH) and polystyrene
   sulfonate (PSS). These polyelectrolyte spacer layers serve as a
   dielectric gap in between silver nanocubes and a gold film. By
   controlling the size of the nanocubes or the gap thickness, the plasmon
   resonance can be tuned from about 500 nm to 700 nm. Next, we demonstrate
   how to incorporate organic sulfo-cyanine5 carboxylic acid (Cy5) dye
   molecules into the dielectric polymer gap region of the nanopatch
   antennas. Finally, we show greatly enhanced fluorescence of the Cy5 dyes
   by spectrally matching the plasmon resonance with the excitation energy
   and the Cy5 absorption peak. The method presented here enables the
   fabrication of plasmonic nanopatch antennas with well-controlled
   dimensions utilizing colloidal synthesis and a layer-by-layer
   dip-coating process with the potential for low cost and large-scale
   production. These nanopatch antennas hold great promise for practical
   applications, for example in sensing, ultrafast optoelectronic devices
   and for high-efficiency photodetectors.}},

Title = {{The Ex Vivo Culture and Pattern Recognition Receptor Stimulation of
   Mouse Intestinal Organoids}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{111}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Primary intestinal organoids are a valuable model system that has the
   potential to significantly impact the field of mucosal immunology.
   However, the complexities of the organoid growth characteristics carry
   significant caveats for the investigator. Specifically, the growth
   patterns of each individual organoid are highly variable and create a
   heterogeneous population of epithelial cells in culture. With such
   caveats, common tissue culture practices cannot be simply applied to the
   organoid system due to the complexity of the cellular structure.
   Counting and plating based solely on cell number, which is common for
   individually separated cells, such as cell lines, is not a reliable
   method for organoids unless some normalization technique is applied.
   Normalizing to total protein content is made complex due to the resident
   protein matrix. These characteristics in terms of cell number, shape and
   cell type should be taken into consideration when evaluating secreted
   contents from the organoid mass. This protocol has been generated to
   outline a simple procedure to culture and treat small intestinal
   organoids with microbial pathogens and pathogen associated molecular
   patterns (PAMPs). It also emphasizes the normalization techniques that
   should be applied when protein analysis are conducted after such a
   challenge.}},

Title = {{How does c-view image quality compare with conventional 2D FFDM?}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The FDA approved the use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)
   in 2011 as an adjunct to 2D full field digital mammography (FFDM) with
   the constraint that all DBT acquisitions must be paired with a 2D image
   to assure adequate interpretative information is provided. Recently
   manufacturers have developed methods to provide a synthesized 2D image
   generated from the DBT data with the hope of sparing patients the
   radiation exposure from the FFDM acquisition. While this much needed
   alternative effectively reduces the total radiation burden, differences
   in image quality must also be considered. The goal of this study was to
   compare the intrinsic image quality of synthesized 2D C-VIEW and 2D FFDM
   images in terms of resolution, contrast, and noise.
   Methods: Two phantoms were utilized in this study: the American College
   of Radiology mammography accreditation phantom (ACR phantom) and a novel
   3D printed anthropomorphic breast phantom. Both phantoms were imaged
   using a Hologic Selenia Dimensions 3D system. Analysis of the ACR
   phantom includes both visual inspection and objective automated analysis
   using in-house software. Analysis of the 3D anthropomorphic phantom
   includes visual assessment of resolution and Fourier analysis of the
   noise.
   Results: Using ACR-defined scoring criteria for the ACR phantom, the
   FFDM images scored statistically higher than C-VIEW according to both
   the average observer and automated scores. In addition, between 50\% and
   70\% of C-VIEW images failed to meet the nominal minimum ACR
   accreditation requirements-primarily due to fiber breaks. Software
   analysis demonstrated that C-VIEW provided enhanced visualization of
   medium and large microcalcification objects; however, the benefits
   diminished for smaller high contrast objects and all low contrast
   objects. Visual analysis of the anthropomorphic phantom showed a
   measureable loss of resolution in the C-VIEW image (11 lp/mm FFDM, 5
   lp/mm C-VIEW) and loss in detection of small microcalcification objects.
   Spectral analysis of the anthropomorphic phantom showed higher total
   noise magnitude in the FFDM image compared with C-VIEW Whereas the FFDM
   image contained approximately white noise texture, the C-VIEW image
   exhibited marked noise reduction at midfrequency and high frequency with
   far less noise suppression at low frequencies resulting in a mottled
   noise appearance.
   Conclusions: Their analysis demonstrates many instances where the C-VIEW
   image quality differs from FFDM. Compared to FFDM, C-VIEW offers a
   better depiction of objects of certain size and contrast, but provides
   poorer overall resolution and noise properties. Based on these findings,
   the utilization of C-VIEW images in the clinical setting requires
   careful consideration, especially if considering the discontinuation of
   FFDM imaging. Not explicitly explored in this study is how the
   combination of DBT + C-VIEW performs relative to DBT + FFDM or FFDM
   alone. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Title = {{Finite-element modeling of compression and gravity on a population of
   breast phantoms for multimodality imaging simulation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors are developing a series of computational breast
   phantoms based on breast CT data for imaging research. In this work, the
   authors develop a program that will allow a user to alter the phantoms
   to simulate the effect of gravity and compression of the breast
   (craniocaudal or mediolateral oblique) making the phantoms applicable to
   multimodality imaging.
   Methods: This application utilizes a template finite-element (FE) breast
   model that can be applied to their presegmented voxelized breast
   phantoms. The FE model is automatically fit to the geometry of a given
   breast phantom, and the material properties of each element are set
   based on the segmented voxels contained within the element. The loading
   and boundary conditions, which include gravity, are then assigned based
   on a user-defined position and compression. The effect of applying these
   loads to the breast is computed using a multistage contact analysis in
   FEBio, a freely available and well-validated FE software package
   specifically designed for biomedical applications. The resulting
   deformation of the breast is then applied to a boundary mesh
   representation of the phantom that can be used for simulating medical
   images. An efficient script performs the above actions seamlessly. The
   user only needs to specify which voxelized breast phantom to use, the
   compressed thickness, and orientation of the breast.
   Results: The authors utilized their FE application to simulate
   compressed states of the breast indicative of mammography and
   tomosynthesis. Gravity and compression were simulated on example
   phantoms and used to generate mammograms in the craniocaudal or
   mediolateral oblique views. The simulated mammograms show a high degree
   of realism illustrating the utility of the FE method in simulating
   imaging data of repositioned and compressed breasts.
   Conclusions: The breast phantoms and the compression software can become
   a useful resource to the breast imaging research community. These
   phantoms can then be used to evaluate and compare imaging modalities
   that involve different positioning and compression of the breast. (C)

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{One key limiting factor to groundwater remediation is contaminant
   sequestered in pores whose contents do not mix well with the bulk flow.
   Mixing between well-connected (pores whose volume is flushed as water
   flows through the aquifer) and poorly connected pores (pores whose
   volume does not exchange readily when water flows through the aquifer)
   is of primary concern. Under steady flow, contaminants are effectively
   trapped in the poorly connected pores and are transferred only by
   molecular diffusion. This slow mixing process between pore types is a
   bottleneck to remediation. We present a novel rapidly pulsed pumping
   method that increases the mixing between these pore types. We do it in
   the context of pump-and-treat remediation because it is the most common
   remediation practice. In rapidly pulsed pumping, the increase in flow
   causes a deep sweep, which pushes the flow into poorly connected pores
   and sweeps out sequestered contaminants. The decrease in flow causes a
   vortex ejection, which causes the vortex within the poorly connected
   pore to emerge with contaminant. These actions are modeled with
   computational fluid mechanics to elucidate the individual mechanisms and
   determine how they function and interact. Cleanup of single and multiple
   poorly connected pore systems were simulated and show the acceleration
   possible. This technique can decrease the time and cost needed to
   remediate contaminated aquifers, which in the United States has been
   estimated to exceed \$1 trillion. Since our rapidly pulsed pumping
   method enhances mixing between well-connected and poorly connected
   pores, it can be applied to other remediation schemes such as in situ
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Several high-performance fighter aircraft exhibit store-induced
   limit-cycle oscillations, leading to pilot discomfort, potential
   structural fatigue, and flight envelope restrictions. The roles of
   various aerodynamic and structural factors causing the limit-cycle
   oscillation are not sufficiently understood, and their numerical
   exploration via time marching is computationally expensive. In this
   paper, the effects of nonlinear stiffness and damping in the wing-store
   attachments of the F-16 aircraft are examined, in the presence of steady
   flow aerodynamic nonlinearity, using the computationally efficient
   harmonic balance method. Structural mechanisms including cubic restoring
   force of both softening and hardening types, freeplay, and Coulomb
   friction are systematically evaluated, and the most likely among these
   are identified by comparing the computed limit-cycle oscillation results
   to flight data. An extension of the harmonic balance method to handle
   nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics along with structural nonlinearity is
   also proposed to enable rapid and accurate limit-cycle oscillation
   assessment of candidate store configurations.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The current study empirically tested Greene, Azevedo, and Turney-Purta's
   (2008) combined theory of personal epistemology development among a
   sample of college engineering students (N = 917). Participants were
   invited to complete surveys assessing personal epistemology at the
   beginning and end of a semester. Using cluster analysis, students were
   categorized into six clusters. Four of these clusters mapped onto the
   epistemic positions predicted by the combined theory (realist,
   dogmatist, skeptic, rationalist), with two novel groups identified
   (uncommitted, low-all-beliefs). Shifts between clusters over the
   semester were examined. There was evidence for some of the theoretically
   predicted shifts in membership (i.e., skeptics to rationalists), but not
   others (i.e., realist to dogmatist or skeptic; dogmatists to
   rationalist). Finally, dogmatists earned lower course grades than
   students in other clusters. Implications for educational practice and
   proposed modifications to the combined theory of personal epistemology
   development are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a frequency-diverse aperture for microwave imaging based
   on a planar cavity at K-band frequencies (18-26.5 GHz). The structure
   consists of an array of radiating circular irises patterned into the
   front surface of a double-sided printed circuit board. The irises are
   distributed in a Fibonacci pattern to maximize spatial diversity at the
   scene. The printed cavity is a phase-diverse system and encodes imaged
   scene information onto a set of frequencies that span the K-band.
   Similar to recently reported metamaterial apertures, the printed cavity
   imager does not require any mechanically moving parts or complex phase
   shifting networks. Imaging of a number of targets is shown; these
   reconstructed images demonstrate the ability of the system to perform
   imaging at the diffraction limit. The proposed printed cavity imager
   possesses a relatively large quality factor that can be traded off to
   achieve higher radiation efficiency. The general mode characteristics of
   the printed cavity suggest advantages when used in computational imaging
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) printed into thin films have been
   shown to yield high mobility, thermal conductivity, mechanical
   flexibility, and chemical stability as semiconducting channels in
   field-effect, thin-film transistors (TFTs). Printed CNT-TFTs of many
   varieties have been studied; however, there has been limited effort
   toward improving overall CNT-TFT performance. In particular, contact
   resistance plays a dominant role in determining the performance and
   degree of variability in the TFTs, especially in fully printed devices
   where the contacts and channel are both printed. In this work, we have
   systematically investigated the contact resistance and overall
   performance of fully printed CNT-TFTs employing three different printed
   contact materials-Ag nanoparticles, Au nanoparticles, and metallic CNTs
   each in the following distinct contact geometries: top, bottom, and
   double. The active channel for each device was printed from the
   dispersion of high purity (>99\%) semiconducting CNTs, and all printing
   was carried out using an aerosol jet printer. Hundreds of devices with
   different channel lengths (from 20 to 500 fun) were fabricated for
   extracting contact resistance and determining related contact effects.
   Printed bottom contacts are shown to be advantageous compared to the
   more common top contacts, regardless of contact material. Further,
   compared to single (top or bottom) contacts, double contacts offer a
   significant decrease (>35\%) in contact resistance for all types of
   contact materials, with the metallic CNTs yielding the best overall
   performance. These findings underscore the impact of printed contact
   materials and structures when interfacing with CNT thin films, providing
   key guidance for the further development of printed nanomaterial
   electronics.}},

Title = {{Relating Retinal Morphology and Function in Aging and Early to

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{65-77}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate relationships between age-related macular
   degeneration (AMD) morphology on spectral domain optical coherence
   tomography (SDOCT) and visual function.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational.
   METHODS: From the Alabama Study on Early AMD baseline visit, visual
   acuity, cone-mediated sensitivity, rod-mediated dark adaptation, and
   SDOCT were obtained in 1 eye per subject with no apparent retinal aging
   (n = 15), normal aging (n = 15), early AMD (n = 15), and intermediate
   AMD (n = 46). The volumes of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-drusen
   complex, RPE-drusen complex abnormal thinning, RPE-drusen complex
   abnormal thickening, and inner and outer retina were calculated in
   specified regions using semi-automated SDOCT segmentation.
   RESULTS: Better cone-mediated sensitivity was associated with greater
   RPE-drusen complex volume (r = 0.34, P < .001) and less RPE-drusen
   complex abnormal thinning volume (r = -0.31, P = .003). Longer
   rod-mediated dark adaptation time, the duration for rod-mediated
   sensitivity to recover from photo bleach exposure, correlated with lower
   RPE-drusen complex volume (r = -0.34, P = .005) and greater RPE-drusen
   complex abnormal thinning volume (r = 0.280, P = .023). In 19 eyes with
   subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) vs 47 eyes without SDD, rod-mediated
   dark adaptation time was longer (mean +/- SD 13.5 +/- 7.0 vs 10.2 +/-
   3.1 minutes, P = .004), RPE-drusen complex abnormal thinning volume was
   greater (P < .0001), and visual acuity and cone sensitivity did not
   differ.
   CONCLUSION: Decreased function relates to structural markers on SDOCT in
   AMD. Because the RPE-drusen complex includes the interdigitation of
   outer segments and RPE apical processes and SDD in eyes with AMD, slower
   dark adaptation might be related to structural abnormalities of the RPE,
   the RPE-photoreceptor interface, or both. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In vitro research on vascular tissue engineering has extensively used
   isolated primary human or animal smooth muscle cells (SMC). Research
   programs that lack such facilities tend towards commercially available
   primary cells sources. Here, we aim to evaluate the capacity of
   commercially available human SMC to maintain their contractile
   phenotype, and determine if dedifferentiation towards the synthetic
   phenotype occurs in response to conventional cell culture and passaging
   without any external biochemical or mechanical stimuli. Lower passage
   SMC adopted a contractile phenotype marked by a relatively slower
   proliferation rate, higher expression of proteins of the contractile
   apparatus and smoothelin, elongated morphology, and reduced deposition
   of collagen types I and III. As the passage number increased, migratory
   capacity was enhanced, average cell speed, total distance and net
   distance travelled increased up to passage 8. Through the various
   assays, corroborative evidence pinpoints SMC at passage 7 as the
   transition point between the contractile and synthetic phenotypes, while
   passage 8 distinctly and consistently exhibited characteristics of
   synthetic phenotype. This knowledge is particularly useful in selecting
   SMC of appropriate passage number for the target vascular tissue
   engineering application, for example, a homeostatic vascular graft for
   blood vessel replacement versus recreating atherosclerotic blood vessel
   model in vitro. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{37-45}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We study the reclamation process of a sodic soil by irrigation with
   water amended with calcium cations. In order to explore the entire range
   of time-dependent strategies, this task is framed as an optimal control
   problem, where the amendment rate is the control and the total
   rehabilitation time is the quantity to be minimized. We use a minimalist
   model of vertically averaged soil salinity and sodicity, in which the
   main feedback controlling the dynamics is the nonlinear coupling of soil
   water and exchange complex, given by the Gapon equation. We show that
   the optimal solution is a bang-bang control strategy, where the
   amendment rate is discontinuously switched along the process from a
   maximum value to zero. The solution enables a reduction in remediation
   time of about 50\%, compared with the continuous use of good-quality
   irrigation water. Because of its general structure, the bang-bang
   solution is also shown to work for the reclamation of other soil
   conditions, such as saline-sodic soils. The novelty in our modeling
   approach is the capability of searching the entire ``strategy space{''}
   for optimal time-dependent protocols. The optimal solutions found for
   the minimalist model can be then fine-tuned by experiments and numerical
   simulations, applicable to realistic conditions that include spatial
   variability and heterogeneities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Advanced tissue engineered heart valves must be constructed from
   multiple materials to better mimic the heterogeneity found in the native
   valve. The trilayered structure of aortic valves provides the ability to
   open and close consistently over a full human lifetime, with each layer
   performing specific mechanical functions. The middle spongiosa layer
   consists primarily of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, providing
   lubrication and dampening functions as the valve leaflet flexes open and
   closed. In this study, hyaluronan hydrogels were tuned to perform the
   mechanical functions of the spongiosa layer, provide a biomimetic
   scaffold in which valve cells were encapsulated in 3D for tissue
   engineering applications, and gain insight into how valve cells maintain
   hyaluronan homeostasis within heart valves. Expression of the HAS1
   isoform of hyaluronan synthase was significantly higher in hyaluronan
   hydrogels compared to blank-slate poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate
   (PEGDA) hydrogels. Hyaluronidase and matrix metalloproteinase enzyme
   activity was similar between hyaluronan and PEGDA hydrogels, even though
   these scaffold materials were each specifically susceptible to
   degradation by different enzyme types. KIAA1199 was expressed by valve
   cells and may play a role in the regulation of hyaluronan in heart
   valves. Cross-linked hyaluronan hydrogels maintained healthy phenotype
   of valve cells in 3D culture and were tuned to approximate the
   mechanical properties of the valve spongiosa layer. Therefore,
   hyaluronan can be used as an appropriate material for the spongiosa
   layer of a proposed laminate tissue engineered heart valve scaffold.}},

Abstract = {{Intra-operative optical coherence tomography (OCT) requires a display
   technology which allows surgeons to visualize OCT data without
   disrupting surgery. Previous research and commercial intrasurgical OCT
   systems have integrated heads-up display (HUD) systems into surgical
   microscopes to provide monoscopic viewing of OCT data through one
   microscope ocular. To take full advantage of our previously reported
   real-time volumetric microscope-integrated OCT (4D MIOCT) system, we
   describe a stereoscopic HUD which projects a stereo pair of OCT volume
   renderings into both oculars simultaneously. The stereoscopic HUD uses a
   novel optical design employing spatial multiplexing to project dual OCT
   volume renderings utilizing a single micro-display. The optical
   performance of the surgical microscope with the HUD was quantitatively
   characterized and the addition of the HUD was found not to substantially
   effect the resolution, field of view, or pincushion distortion of the
   operating microscope. In a pilot depth perception subject study, five
   ophthalmic surgeons completed a pre-set dexterity task with 50.0\% (SD =
   37.3\%) higher success rate and in 35.0\% (SD = 24.8\%) less time on
   average with stereoscopic OCT vision compared to monoscopic OCT vision.
   Preliminary experience using the HUD in 40 vitreo-retinal human
   surgeries by five ophthalmic surgeons is reported, in which all surgeons
   reported that the HUD did not alter their normal view of surgery and
   that live surgical maneuvers were readily visible in displayed
   stereoscopic OCT volumes. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{A Binaural Cochlear Implant Sound Coding Strategy Inspired by the
   Contralateral Medial Olivocochlear Reflex}},
Journal = {{EAR AND HEARING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{E138-E148}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: In natural hearing, cochlear mechanical compression is
   dynamically adjusted via the efferent medial olivocochlear reflex
   (MOCR). These adjustments probably help understanding speech in noisy
   environments and are not available to the users of current cochlear
   implants (CIs). The aims of the present study are to: (1) present a
   binaural CI sound processing strategy inspired by the control of
   cochlear compression provided by the contralateral MOCR in natural
   hearing; and (2) assess the benefits of the new strategy for
   understanding speech presented in competition with steady noise with a
   speech-like spectrum in various spatial configurations of the speech and
   noise sources.
   Design: Pairs of CI sound processors (one per ear) were constructed to
   mimic or not mimic the effects of the contralateral MOCR on compression.
   For the nonmimicking condition (standard strategy or STD), the two
   processors in a pair functioned similarly to standard clinical
   processors (i.e., with fixed back-end compression and independently of
   each other). When configured to mimic the effects of the MOCR (MOC
   strategy), the two processors communicated with each other and the
   amount of back-end compression in a given frequency channel of each
   processor in the pair decreased/increased dynamically (so that output
   levels dropped/increased) with increases/decreases in the output energy
   from the corresponding frequency channel in the contralateral processor.
   Speech reception thresholds in speech-shaped noise were measured for 3
   bilateral CI users and 2 single-sided deaf unilateral CI users.
   Thresholds were compared for the STD and MOC strategies in unilateral
   and bilateral listening conditions and for three spatial configurations
   of the speech and noise sources in simulated free-field conditions:
   speech and noise sources colocated in front of the listener, speech on
   the left ear with noise in front of the listener, and speech on the left
   ear with noise on the right ear. In both bilateral and unilateral
   listening, the electrical stimulus delivered to the test ear(s) was
   always calculated as if the listeners were wearing bilateral processors.
   Results: In both unilateral and bilateral listening conditions, mean
   speech reception thresholds were comparable with the two strategies for
   colocated speech and noise sources, but were at least 2 dB lower
   (better) with the MOC than with the STD strategy for spatially separated
   speech and noise sources. In unilateral listening conditions, mean
   thresholds improved with increasing the spatial separation between the
   speech and noise sources regardless of the strategy but the improvement
   was significantly greater with the MOC strategy. In bilateral listening
   conditions, thresholds improved significantly with increasing the
   speech-noise spatial separation only with the MOC strategy.
   Conclusions: The MOC strategy (1) significantly improved the
   intelligibility of speech presented in competition with a spatially
   separated noise source, both in unilateral and bilateral listening
   conditions; (2) produced significant spatial release from masking in
   bilateral listening conditions, something that did not occur with fixed
   compression; and (3) enhanced spatial release from masking in unilateral
   listening conditions. The MOC strategy as implemented here, or a
   modified version of it, may be usefully applied in CIs and in hearing
   aids.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the formulation of reverse time migration (RTM) is
   improved for impulse borehole radar imaging in the subsurface scenarios
   with layered media. By fully adopting the prior information of
   surrounding media, the time gating function is designed and applied to
   the incident wave field and scattering wave field for each imaging
   point, which strengthens the correlation between the wave fields in the
   time domain. The clutters partly caused by the multiple reflections
   between different media layers are suppressed due to the gating
   function. A normalized zero-offset cross correlation with gated samples
   is conducted and used to weight the result of RTM. The improved approach
   is compared with the conventional RTM, the back-projection method, and
   the Stolt migration algorithm with synthetic data and is then validated
   by a single-borehole radar experiment in a layered media scenario. The
   results demonstrate that the developed approach is superior to the
   conventional methods in locating targets and robust in complex
   subsurface environments.}},

Abstract = {{Uncontrolled bleeding threatens patients undergoing major surgery and in
   care for traumatic injury. This paper describes a novel method of
   diagnosing coagulation dysfunction by repeatedly measuring the shear
   modulus of a blood sample as it clots in vitro. Each measurement applies
   a high-energy ultrasound pulse to induce a shear wave within a rigid
   walled chamber, and then uses low energy ultrasound pulses to measure
   displacements associated with the resonance of that shear wave. Measured
   displacements are correlated with predictions from finite difference
   time domain models, with the best fit corresponding to the modulus
   estimate. In our current implementation each measurement requires 62.4
   ms. Experimental data was analyzed using a fixed-viscosity algorithm and
   a free-viscosity algorithm. In experiments utilizing human blood induced
   to clot by exposure to kaolin, the free-viscosity algorithm quantified
   the shear modulus of formed clots with a worst-case precision of 2.5\%.
   Precision was improved to 1.8\% by utilizing the fixed-viscosity
   algorithm. Repeated measurements showed a smooth evolution from liquid
   blood to a firm clot with a shear modulus between 1.4 and 3.3 kPa. These
   results show the promise of this technique for rapid, point of care
   assessment of coagulation.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel methodology for characterizing and simulating
   non-stationary stochastic wind records. In this new method,
   non-stationarity is characterized and modelled via temporal coherence,
   which is quantified in the discrete frequency domain by probability
   distributions of the differences in phase between adjacent Fourier
   components. Temporal coherence can also be used to quantify
   non-stationary characteristics in wind data. Three case studies are
   presented that analyze the non-stationarity of turbulent wind data
   obtained at the National Wind Technology Center near Boulder, Colorado,
   USA. The first study compares the temporal and spectral characteristics
   of a stationary wind record and a non-stationary wind record in order to
   highlight their differences in temporal coherence. The second study
   examines the distribution of one of the proposed temporal coherence
   parameters and uses it to quantify the prevalence of nonstationarity in
   the dataset. The third study examines how temporal coherence varies with
   a range of atmospheric parameters to determine what conditions produce
   more non-stationarity.}},

Abstract = {{The Euler-Lagrange equations and the associated boundary conditions have
   been derived for an inextensible beam undergoing large deflections. The
   inextensibility constraint between axial and transverse deflection is
   considered via two alternative approaches based upon Hamilton's
   principle, which have been proved to yield equivalent results. In one
   approach, the constraint has been appended to the system Lagrangian via
   a Lagrange multiplier, while in the other approach the axial deflection
   has been expressed in terms of the transverse deflection, and the
   equation of motion for the transverse deflection has been determined
   directly. Boundary conditions for a cantilevered beam and a free-free
   beam have been considered and allow for explicit results for each
   system's equations of motion. Finally, the Lagrange multiplier approach
   has been extended to equations of motion of cantilevered and free-free
   plates.}},

Abstract = {{Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has an established reputation as
   a useful data analysis technique in numerous applications. However, its
   usage in practical situations is undergoing challenges in recent years.
   The fundamental factor to this is the increasingly growing size of the
   datasets available and needed in the information sciences. To address
   this, in this work we propose to use structured random compression, that
   is, random projections that exploit the data structure, for two NMF
   variants: classical and separable. In separable NMF (SNMF), the left
   factors are a subset of the columns of the input matrix. We present
   suitable formulations for each problem, dealing with different
   representative algorithms within each one. We show that the resulting
   compressed techniques are faster than their uncompressed variants,
   vastly reduce memory demands, and do not encompass any significant
   deterioration in performance. The proposed structured random projections
   for SNMF allow to deal with arbitrarily shaped large matrices, beyond
   the standard limit of tall-and-skinny matrices, granting access to very
   efficient computations in this general setting. We accompany the
   algorithmic presentation with theoretical foundations and numerous and
   diverse examples, showing the suitability of the proposed approaches.
   Our implementations are publicly available.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on thoroughly exploring the finite-time transient
   behaviors occurring in a periodically driven non-smooth dynamical
   system. Prior to settling down into a long-term behavior, such as a
   periodic forced oscillation, or a chaotic attractor, responses may
   exhibit a variety of transient behaviors involving regular dynamics,
   co-existing attractors, and super-persistent chaotic transients. A
   simple and fundamental impacting mechanical system is used to
   demonstrate generic transient behavior in an experimental setting for a
   single degree of freedom non-smooth mechanical oscillator. Specifically,
   we consider a horizontally driven rigid-arm pendulum system that impacts
   an inclined rigid barrier. The forcing frequency of the horizontal
   oscillations is used as a bifurcation parameter. An important feature of
   this study is the systematic generation of generic experimental initial
   conditions, allowing a more thorough investigation of basins of
   attraction when multiple attractors are present. This approach also
   yields a perspective on some sensitive features associated with grazing
   bifurcations. In particular, super persistent chaotic transients lasting
   much longer than the conventional settling time (associated with linear
   viscous damping) are characterized and distinguished from regular
   dynamics for the first time in an experimental mechanical system. (C)

Abstract = {{This article introduces the use of suspended substrate microstrip lines
   (SSMLs) as high-Z sections in the design of lowpass filters (LPFs) to
   extend the stopband. The SSMLs are formed by etching slots on the
   backside of microstrip lines and placing the substrate on an aluminum
   base with grooves that cover these slots. The higher characteristic
   impedance property of SSMLs brings about not only shorter length for
   high-Z lines but also a larger high-to-low impedance ratio, thus
   deepening the stopband suppression and shifting the spurious passband
   away. As a demonstration, a wide stopband LPF combining this structure
   with hammer-shaped stubs is designed, fabricated, and measured. The 20
   dB stopband is obtained from 1.45 to 11.77 GHz. Compared with reported
   LPFs, this shows the widest fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 156\% without
   sacrificing other performances. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{An added-mass partitioned (AMP) algorithm is described for solving
   fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems coupling incompressible flows
   with thin elastic structures undergoing finite deformations. The new AMP
   scheme is fully second-order accurate and stable, without sub-time-step
   iterations, even for very light structures when added-mass effects are
   strong. The fluid, governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes
   equations, is solved in velocity-pressure form using a fractional-step
   method; large deformations are treated with a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian
   approach on deforming composite grids. The motion of the thin structure
   is governed by a generalized Euler-Bernoulli beam model, and these
   equations are solved in a Lagrangian frame using two approaches, one
   based on finite differences and the other on finite elements. The key
   AMP interface condition is a generalized Robin (mixed) condition on the
   fluid pressure. This condition, which is derived at a continuous level,
   has no adjustable parameters and is applied at the discrete level to
   couple the partitioned domain solvers. Special treatment of the AMP
   condition is required to couple the finite-element beam solver with the
   finite-difference-based fluid solver, and two coupling approaches are
   described. A normal-mode stability analysis is performed for a
   linearized model problem involving a beam separating two fluid domains,
   and it is shown that the AMP scheme is stable independent of the ratio
   of the mass of the fluid to that of the structure. A traditional
   partitioned (TP) scheme using a Dirichlet-Neumann coupling for the same
   model problem is shown to be unconditionally unstable if the added mass
   of the fluid is too large. A series of benchmark problems of increasing
   complexity are considered to illustrate the behavior of the AMP
   algorithm, and to compare the behavior with that of the TP scheme. The
   results of all these benchmark problems verify the stability and
   accuracy of the AMP scheme. Results for one benchmark problem modeling
   blood flow in a deforming artery are also compared with corresponding
   results available in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Intratumoral radiation therapy - `brachytherapy' - is a highly effective
   treatment for solid tumors, particularly prostate cancer. Current
   titanium seed implants, however, are permanent and are limited in
   clinical application to indolent malignancies of low-to
   intermediate-risk. Attempts to develop polymeric alternatives, however,
   have been plagued by poor retention and off-target toxicity due to
   degradation. Herein, we report on a new approach whereby thermally
   sensitive micelles composed of an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) are
   labeled with the radio-nuclide I-131 to form an in situ hydrogel that is
   stabilized by two independent mechanisms: first, body heat triggers the
   radioactive ELP micelles to rapidly phase transition into an insoluble,
   viscous coacervate in under 2 min; second, the high energy
   beta-emissions of I-131 further stabilize the depot by introducing
   crosslinks within the ELP depot over 24 h. These injectable
   brachytherapy hydrogels were used to treat two aggressive orthotopic
   tumor models in athymic nude mice: a human PC-3 M-luc-C6 prostate tumor
   and a human BxPc3-luc2 pancreatic tumor model. The ELP depots retained
   greater than 52\% and 70\% of their radioactivity through 60 days in the
   prostate and pancreatic tumors with no appreciable radioactive
   accumulation (<= 0.1\% ID) in off-target tissues after 72 h. The
   I-131-ELP depots achieved >95\% tumor regression in the prostate tumors
   (n = 8); with a median survival of more than 60 days compared to 12 days
   for control mice. For the pancreatic tumors, ELP brachytherapy (n = 6)
   induced significant growth inhibition (p = 0.001, ANOVA) and enhanced
   median survival to 27 days over controls. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{On the morning of 5 June 2013, two cameras of the SpriteCam network
   concurrently captured a red sprite with diffuse halo over a mesoscale
   convective system (MCS) passing the panhandle area of Oklahoma. This
   sprite was produced by a negative cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke with peak
   current of -103 kA in a manner different from previous observations in
   several aspects. First of all, the causative stroke of sprite is located
   by the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) in the trailing
   stratiform of MCS, instead of the deep convection typically for negative
   sprites. Second, the sprite-producing stroke was likely the first stroke
   of a multistroke negative CG flash (with >= 6 CG strokes) whose
   evolution was mainly confined in the lower part of thunderstorm;
   although the parent flash of sprite might contain relatively long
   in-cloud evolution prior to the first stroke, there is no evidence that
   the negative leader had propagated into the upper positive region of
   thundercloud as typically observed for the sprite-producing/class
   negative CG strokes. Third, as shown by the simulation with a
   two-dimensional full-wave electrodynamic model, although the impulse
   charge moment change (-190 C km) produced by the main stroke was not
   sufficient to induce conventional breakdown in the mesosphere, a second
   impulse charge transfer occurred with similar to 2 ms delay to cause a
   substantial charge transfer (-290 C km) so that the overall charge
   moment change (-480 C km) exceeded the threshold for sprite production;
   this is a scenario different from the typical case discussed by Li et
   al. (2012). As for the source of the second current pulse that played a
   critical role to produce the sprite, it could be an M component whose
   charge source was at least 9 km horizontally displaced from the main
   stroke or a negative CG stroke (with weak peak current for the return
   stroke) that was not detected by the NLDN.}},

Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Point-defect formation energies calculated within the framework of
   density functional theory often depend on the choice of the exchange and
   correlation (xc) functional. We show that variations between the local
   density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA),
   and hybrid functionals mainly arise from differences in the position of
   the bulk valence-band maximum, as well as in the reference energies for
   the chemical potential obtained with distinct xc functionals. We
   demonstrate for point defects relevant for p-type GaN that these
   differences can be accounted for by corrections, reducing the maximum
   disagreement between the different functionals from more than 2 eV to
   below 0.2 eV. Our correction scheme should be useful for performing
   high-throughput calculations in cases where full hybrid functional
   calculations are prohibitively expensive.}},

Abstract = {{Scale invariance refers to the maintenance of a constant ratio of
   developing organ size to body size. Although common, its underlying
   mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we examined scaling in
   engineered Escherichia coli that can form self-organized core-ring
   patterns in colonies. We found that the ring width exhibits perfect
   scale invariance to the colony size. Our analysis revealed a collective
   space-sensing mechanism, which entails sequential actions of an integral
   feedback loop and an incoherent feedforward loop. The integral feedback
   is implemented by the accumulation of a diffusive chemical produced by a
   colony. This accumulation, combined with nutrient consumption, sets the
   timing for ring initiation. The incoherent feedforward is implemented by
   the opposing effects of the domain size on the rate and duration of ring
   maturation. This mechanism emphasizes a role of timing control in
   achieving robust pattern scaling and provides a new perspective in
   examining the phenomenon in natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a frequency diverse, multistatic microwave imaging system
   based on a set of transmit and receive, radiating, planar cavity
   apertures. The cavities consist of double-sided, copper-clad circuit
   boards, with a series of circular radiating irises patterned into the
   upper conducting plate. The iris arrangement is such that for any given
   transmitting and receiving aperture pair, a Mills-Cross pattern is
   formed from the overlapped patterns. The Mills-Cross distribution
   provides optimum coverage of the imaging scene in the spatial Fourier
   domain (k-space). The Mills-Cross configuration of the apertures
   produces measurement modes that are diverse and consistent with the
   computational imaging approach used for frequency-diverse apertures, yet
   significantly minimizes the redundancy of information received from the
   scene. We present a detailed analysis of the Mills-Cross aperture
   design, with numerical simulations that predict the performance of the
   apertures as part of an imaging system. Images reconstructed using
   fabricated apertures are presented, confirming the anticipated
   performance. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

   imaged via quantitative phase spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Plasmodium falciparum infection causes structural and biochemical
   changes in red blood cells (RBCs). To quantify these changes, we apply a
   novel optical technique, quantitative phase spectroscopy (QPS) to
   characterize individual red blood cells (RBCs) during the
   intraerythrocytic life cycle of P. falciparum. QPS captures
   hyperspectral holograms of individual RBCs to measure spectroscopic
   changes across the visible wavelength range (475-700 nm), providing
   complex information, i.e. amplitude and phase, about the light field
   which has interacted with the cell. The complex field provides
   complimentary information on hemoglobin content and cell mass, which are
   both found to dramatically change upon infection by P. falciparum. Hb
   content progressively decreases with parasite life cycle, with an
   average 72.2\% reduction observed for RBCs infected by schizont-stage P.
   falciparum compared to uninfected cells. Infection also resulted in a
   33.1\% reduction in RBC's optical volume, a measure of the cells'
   non-aqueous components. Notably, optical volume is only partially
   correlated with hemoglobin content, suggesting that changes in other dry
   mass components such as parasite mass may also be assessed using this
   technique. The unique ability of QPS to discriminate individual healthy
   and infected cells using spectroscopic changes indicates that the
   approach can be used to detect disease.}},

Abstract = {{For over two decades, research groups have been developing methods to
   engineer three-dimensional skeletal muscle tissues. These tissues hold
   great promise for use in disease modeling and pre-clinical drug
   development, and have potential to serve as therapeutic grafts for
   functional muscle repair. Recent advances in the field have resulted in
   the engineering of regenerative muscle constructs capable of survival,
   vascularization, and functional maturation in vivo as well as the
   first-time creation of functional human engineered muscles for screening
   of therapeutics in vitro. In this review, we will discuss the
   methodologies that have progressed work in the muscle tissue engineering
   field to its current state. The emphasis will be placed on the existing
   procedures to generate myogenic cell sources and form highly functional
   muscle tissues in vitro, techniques to monitor and evaluate muscle
   maturation and performance in vitro and in vivo, and surgical strategies
   to both create diseased environments and ensure implant survival and
   rapid integration into the host. Finally, we will suggest the most
   promising methodologies that will enable continued progress in the
   field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of targets with
   complex motions, such as highly maneuvering airplanes and ships
   fluctuating with oceanic waves, azimuth echoes of a range cell have to
   be modeled as multicomponent cubic phase signals (CPSs) after the range
   alignment and the phase adjustment. Due to the time-varying Doppler
   frequencies of scatterers, ISAR image obtained with the standard
   range-Doppler algorithm is blurred, and the range-instantaneous-Doppler
   (RID) technique is required to improve the image quality. In this paper,
   by employing a novel parametric autocorrelation function and the
   generalized scaled Fourier transform, an effective parameter estimation
   algorithm is proposed for multicomponent CPSs and applied to reconstruct
   the RID image for targets with complex motions. Analyses of the
   implementation, the cross-term, the anti-noise performance, and the
   computational cost demonstrate that, compared with other three
   representative estimation algorithms, the proposed algorithm can
   eliminate the brute-force searching procedure and acquire a higher
   anti-noise performance without the nonuniform axis. Through simulations
   and analyses for synthetic models and the real radar data, we verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed estimation algorithm and the corresponding
   ISAR imaging algorithm.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1933-1945}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Subspace models play an important role in a wide range of signal
   processing tasks, and this paper explores how the pairwise geometry of
   subspaces influences the probability of misclassification. When the
   mismatch between the signal and the model is vanishingly small, the
   probability of misclassification is determined by the product of the
   sines of the principal angles between subspaces. When the mismatch is
   more significant, the probability of misclassification is determined by
   the sum of the squares of the sines of the principal angles. Reliability
   of classification is derived in terms of the distribution of signal
   energy across principal vectors. Larger principal angles lead to smaller
   classification error, motivating a linear transform that optimizes
   principal angles. The transform presented here (TRAIT) preserves some
   specific characteristic of each individual class, and this approach is
   shown to be complementary to a previously developed transform (LRT) that
   enlarges inter-class distance while suppressing intraclass dispersion.
   Theoretical results are supported by demonstration of superior
   classification accuracy on synthetic and measured data even in the
   presence of significant model mismatch.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},

Abstract = {{The roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating cancer and
   stem cells are being increasingly appreciated. Its diverse mechanisms
   provide the regulatory network with a bigger repertoire to increase
   complexity. Here we report a novel LncRNA, Lnc34a, that is enriched in
   colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs) and initiates asymmetric division by
   directly targeting the microRNA miR-34a to cause its spatial imbalance.
   Lnc34a recruits Dnmt3a via PHB2 and HDAC1 to methylate and deacetylate
   the miR-34a promoter simultaneously, hence epigenetically silencing
   miR-34a expression independent of its upstream regulator, p53. Lnc34a
   levels affect CCSC self-renewal and colorectal cancer (CRC) growth in
   xenograft models. Lnc34a is upregulated in late-stage CRCs, contributing
   to epigenetic miR-34a silencing and CRC proliferation. The fact that
   lncRNA targets microRNA highlights the regulatory complexity of
   non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which occupy the bulk of the genome.}},

   perovskites have recently received extraordinary research community
   attention because of their unique physical properties, which make them
   promising candidates for application in photovoltaic (PV) and related

   highlight the great chemical flexibility and outstanding potential of
   the broader class of 3-D and lower dimensional organic-based perovskite
   family for electronic, optical, and energy-based applications as well as
   fundamental research. The concept of a multifunctional organic-inorganic
   hybrid, in which the organic and inorganic structural components provide
   intentional, unique, and hopefully synergistic features to the compound,

Title = {{Thin-Film Deposition and Characterization of a Sn-Deficient Perovskite

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2315-2322}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we describe details of a two-step deposition approach that
   enables the preparation of continuous and well-structured thin films of
   Cs2SnI6, which is a one-half Sn-deficient 0-D perovskite derivative
   (i.e., the compound can also be written as CsSn0.5I3, with a structure
   consisting of isolated SnI64- octahedra). The films were characterized
   using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-vis spectroscopy,
   photoluminescence (PL), photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, IPES, XPS), and
   Hall effect measurements. UV-vis and PL measurements indicate that the
   obtained Cs2SnI6 film is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.6 eV. This
   band gap was further confirmed by the UPS and IPES spectra, which were
   well reproduced by the calculated density of states with the HSE hybrid
   functional. The Cs2SnI6 films exhibited n-type conduction with a carrier
   density of 6(1) X 10(16) cm(-3) and mobility of 2.9(3) cm(2)/V.s. While
   the computationally derived band structure for Cs2SnI6 shows significant
   dispersion along several directions in the Brillouin zone near the band
   edges, the valence band is relatively flat along the T-X direction,
   indicative of a more limited hole minority carrier mobility compared to
   analogous values for the electrons. The ionization potential (IP) and
   electron affinity (EA) were determined to be 6.4 and 4.8 eV,
   respectively. The Cs2SnI6 films show some enhanced stability under
   ambient air, compared to methylammonium lead(II) iodide perovskite films
   stored under similar conditions; however, the films do decompose slowly,
   yielding a CsI impurity. These findings are discussed in the context of
   suitability of Cs2SnI6 for photovoltaic and related optoelectronic
   applications.}},

   investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy and ab initio

Abstract = {{We construct a novel recombinant secondary antibody mimic, GST-ABD,
   which can bind to the Fc regions of target-bound primary antibodies and
   acquire multiple HRPs simultaneously. We produce it in tenth of mg
   quantities with a bacterial overexpression system and simple
   purification procedures, significantly reducing the manufacturing cost
   and time without the use of animals. GST-ABD is effectively conjugated
   with 3 HRPs per molecule on an average and selectively bind to the Fc
   region of primary antibodies derived from three different species
   (mouse, rabbit, and rat). HRP-conjugated GST-ABD (HRP-GST-ABD) is
   successfully used as an alternative to secondary antibodies to amplify
   target-specific signals in both ELISA and immunohistochemistry
   regardless of the target molecules and origin of primary antibodies
   used. GST-ABD also successfully serves as an anchoring adaptor on the
   surface of GSH-coated plates for immobilizing antigen-capturing
   antibodies in an orientation-controlled manner for sandwich-type
   indirect ELISA through simple molecular recognition without any

   MA(2)Pb(SCN)(2)I-2 (where MA = CH3NH3+) perovskite using a combination
   of materials synthesis, characterization and density functional theory
   calculation, and determine electronic properties of MA(2)Pb(SCN)(2)I-2
   that are significantly different from those previously reported in
   literature. The layered perovskite with mixed anions exhibits an
   indirect bandgap of similar to 2.04 eV, with a slightly larger direct
   bandgap of similar to 2.11 eV. The carriers (both electrons and holes)
   are also found to be confined within the 2D layers. Our results suggest
   that the 2D MA(2)Pb(SCN)(2)I-2 perovskite may not be among the most
   promising absorbers for efficient single junction solar cell
   applications; however, use as an absorber for the top cell of a tandem
   solar cell may still be a possibility if films are grown with the 2D
   layers aligned perpendicular to the substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) occurs as a myriad of species in environmental media, each
   with different physicochemical properties. The influence of Hg
   speciation on its transport in unsaturated soils is not well studied.
   Transport of four Hg species (dissolved inorganic Hg (II) species, a
   prepared Hg(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) complex, Hg(0), and
   HgS nanoparticles) was measured in sand and soil packed columns with
   partial water saturation under simulated rainfall (low ionic strength
   solution without DOM) and landfill leachate (high DOM content and high
   ionic strength) influent conditions. The Hg(II)-DOM species had the
   highest mobility among the four Hg species evaluated, and HgS particles
   (similar to 230 nm hydrodynamic diameter) had the poorest mobility, for
   all soil and influent conditions tested. The addition of 2 wt \% clay
   particles to sand greatly retarded the transport of all Hg species,
   especially under simulated rainfall. DOM in the column influent
   facilitated the transport of all four Hg species in model and natural
   soils. For simulated rainfall, the transport trends observed in model
   sands were consistent with those measured in a sandy soil, except that
   the mobility of dissolved inorganic Hg(II) species was significantly
   lower in natural soils. For simulated rainfall, Hg transport was
   negligible in a high organic content (similar to 3.72 wt \%) soil for
   all species except Hg-DOM. This work suggests that the Hg-DOM species
   presents the greatest potential for vertical migration to groundwater,
   especially with DOM in the influent solution.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{28-34}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies of sensorimotor processing have benefited from
   decision-making paradigms that emphasize the selection of appropriate
   movements. Selecting when to make those responses, or action timing, is
   important as well. Although the cerebellum is commonly viewed as a
   controller of movement dynamics, its role in action timing is also
   firmly supported. Several lines of research have now extended this idea.
   Anatomical findings have revealed connections between the cerebellum and
   broader timing circuits, neurophysiological results have suggested
   mechanisms for timing within its microcircuitry, and theoretical work
   has indicated how temporal signals are processed through it and decoded
   by its targets. These developments are inspiring renewed studies of the
   role of the cerebellar loops in action timing.}},

Abstract = {{An uncertainty quantification framework is developed for the DeepC Oil
   Model based on a nonintrusive polynomial chaos method. This allows the
   model's output to be presented in a probabilistic framework so that the
   model's predictions reflect the uncertainty in the model's input data.
   The new capability is illustrated by simulating the far-field dispersal
   of oil in a Deepwater Horizon blowout scenario. The uncertain input
   consisted of ocean current and oil droplet size data and the main model
   output analyzed is the ensuing oil concentration in the Gulf of Mexico.
   A 1331 member ensemble was used to construct a surrogate for the model
   which was then mined for statistical information. The mean and standard
   deviations in the oil concentration were calculated for up to 30 days,
   and the total contribution of each input parameter to the model's
   uncertainty was quantified at different depths. Also, probability
   density functions of oil concentration were constructed by sampling the
   surrogate and used to elaborate probabilistic hazard maps of oil impact.
   The performance of the surrogate was constantly monitored in order to
   demarcate the spacetime zones where its estimates are reliable.}},

Abstract = {{We give an overview of four different ensemble-based techniques for
   uncertainty quantification and illustrate their application in the
   context of oil plume simulations. These techniques share the common
   paradigm of constructing a model proxy that efficiently captures the
   functional dependence of the model output on uncertain model inputs.
   This proxy is then used to explore the space of uncertain inputs using a
   large number of samples, so that reliable estimates of the model's
   output statistics can be calculated. Three of these techniques use
   polynomial chaos (PC) expansions to construct the model proxy, but they
   differ in their approach to determining the expansions' coefficients;
   the fourth technique uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). An integral
   plume model for simulating the Deepwater Horizon oil-gas blowout
   provides examples for illustrating the different techniques. A Monte
   Carlo ensemble of 50,000 model simulations is used for gauging the
   performance of the different proxies. The examples illustrate how
   regression-based techniques can outperform projection-based techniques
   when the model output is noisy. They also demonstrate that robust
   uncertainty analysis can be performed at a fraction of the cost of the
   Monte Carlo calculation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonography is a widely used imaging modality to visualize
   anatomical structures due to its low cost and ease of use; however, it
   is challenging to acquire acceptable image quality in deep tissue.
   Synthetic aperture (SA) is a technique used to increase image resolution
   by synthesizing information from multiple sub-apertures, but the
   resolution improvement is limited by the physical size of the array
   transducer. With a large Fnumber, it is difficult to achieve high
   resolution in deep regions without extending the effective aperture
   size. We propose a method to extend the available aperture size for
   SA-called synthetic tracked aperture ultrasound (STRATUS) imaging-by
   sweeping an ultrasound transducer while tracking its orientation and
   location. Tracking information of the ultrasound probe is used to
   synthesize the signals received at different positions. Considering the
   practical implementation, we estimated the effect of tracking and
   ultrasound calibration error to the quality of the final beamformed
   image through simulation. In addition, to experimentally validate this
   approach, a 6 degree-of-freedom robot arm was used as a mechanical
   tracker to hold an ultrasound transducer and to apply in-plane lateral
   translational motion. Results indicate that STRATUS imaging with robotic
   tracking has the potential to improve ultrasound image quality. (C) The

Abstract = {{The corner-free truncation (CFT) strategy is proposed to improve the
   efficiency of numerical simulation in computational electrodynamics. The
   spherical boundary, namely the CFT strategy, is built up in the
   Cartesian coordinate system, which has been implemented via making use
   of the impedance-matched layer. The proposed CFT strategy is used for
   terminating computational domain of the conventional finite-difference
   time-domain (FDTD) to absorb the outward electromagnetic waves.
   Moreover, based on the proposed boundary, the computation becomes
   simpler. The original FDTD computational domain is reduced to be nearly
   a half, and the computational resource is saved significantly, both of
   which are due to the fact that no curvilinear model is applied in
   truncating the boundary. The numerical simulations of target scattering
   problems have been achieved to validate the proposed algorithm.}},

   because key rates for the latter scale at best linearly with

Title = {{The Impact of Blade Loading and Unsteady Pressure Bifurcations on
   Low-Pressure Turbine Flutter Boundaries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The three major aeroelastic issues in the turbomachinery blades of jet
   engines and power turbines are forced response, nonsynchronous
   vibrations, and flutter. Flutter primarily affects high-aspect ratio
   blades found in the fan, fore high-pressure compressor stages, and aft
   low-pressure turbine (LPT) stages as low natural frequencies and high
   axial velocities create smaller reduced frequencies. Often with LPT
   flutter analyses, physical insights are lost in the exhaustive quest for
   determining whether the aerodynamic damping is positive or negative.
   This paper underlines some well-known causes of the LPT flutter in
   addition to one novel catalyst. In particular, an emphasis is placed on
   revealing how local aerodynamic damping contributions change as a
   function of unsteady (e.g., mode shape, reduced frequency) and steady
   (e.g., blade torque, pressure ratio) parameters. To this end, frequency
   domain Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) CFD analyses are used as
   computational wind tunnels to investigate how aerodynamic loading
   variations affect flutter boundaries. Preliminary results show clear
   trends between the aerodynamic work influence coefficients and
   variations in exit Mach number and back pressure, especially for
   torsional mode shapes affecting the passage throat. Additionally,
   visualizations of qualitative bifurcations in the unsteady pressure
   phases around the air-foil light on how local damping contributions
   evolve with steady loading. Final results indicate a sharp drop in
   aeroelastic stability near specific regions of the pressure ratio,
   indicating a strong correlation between blade loading and flutter.
   Passage throat shock behavior is shown to be a controlling factor near
   the trailing edge, and as with critical reduced frequency, this
   phenomenon is shown to be highly dependent on the vibratory mode shape.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To develop image analysis software usable by nonexpert graders
   to segment geographic atrophy (GA) from dry AMD and to quantify rim area
   focal hyperautofluorescence (RAFH) surrounding GA on fundus
   autofluorescence (FAF) images. To compare the GA progression predictions
   based on RAFH with those of a validated qualitative classification
   system.
   METHODS. Retrospective analysis of serial FAF images from 49 eyes of 30
   subjects with GA was performed using MATLAB-based software (MathWorks,
   Natick, MA, USA). Correlation between RAFH and progression of GA was
   analyzed using Spearman correlation. Comparisons of lesion growth rate
   between RAFH tertiles used generalized estimating equations and
   Kruskal-Wallis testing. Interobserver variability in lesion size, growth
   rate and RAFH were compared between two expert and one nonexpert grader
   using Bland-Altman statistics.
   RESULTS. Rim area focal hyperautofluorescence was positively correlated
   with GA progression rate (rho = 0.49, P < 0.001). Subjects in the middle
   or highest RAFH tertile were at greater risk of progression (P = 0.005
   and P = 0.001, respectively). Mean difference in RAFH was 0.012 between
   expert and -0.005 to 0.017 between expert and nonexperts. Mean
   difference in lesion size (mm(2)) was 0.11 between expert and -0.29 to
   0.41 between expert and nonexperts. Mean difference in lesion growth
   rate (mm(2)/mo) was 0.0098 between expert and -0.027 to 0.037 between
   expert and nonexperts. Risk stratification based on RAFH tertile was
   96\% identical across all graders.
   CONCLUSIONS. Our semiautomated image analysis software facilitates
   stratification of progression risk based on RAFH and enabled a nonexpert
   grader with minimal training to obtain results comparable to expert
   graders. Predictions based on RAFH were similar to those of a validated
   qualitative classification system.}},

Abstract = {{This communication presents a design of a new compact circularly
   polarized (CP) slot antenna fed by a microstrip feedline. The 3-dB axial
   ratio band can be achieved by simply protruding a horizontal stub from
   the ground plane toward the center of the wide slot (WS) and then
   feeding the WS with a microstrip feedline positioned to the side of the
   WS, underneath the protruded stub. The feedline and metallic stub are
   perpendicular to each other, and they resemble a T shape when viewed
   from the top. The proposed antenna is fabricated with an area of 25 x 25
   mm(2). Measurement results show that the antenna attains an S-11 <= -10
   dB impedance matching bandwidth of 90.2\%, from 3.5 to 9.25 GHz, and a
   broadband 3 dB-AR bandwidth of 40\%, ranging from 4.6 to 6.9 GHz. A peak
   gain of 0.8-4.5 dBi is achieved within the AR band. The proposed antenna
   is suitable for circular polarization applications in C band.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Micro-electrocorticography (ECoG) offers a minimally invasive
   neural interface with high spatial resolution over large areas of
   cortex. However, electrode arrays with many contacts that are
   individually wired to external recording systems are cumbersome and make
   recordings in freely behaving rodents challenging. We report a novel
   high-density 60-electrode system for itECoG recording in freely moving
   rats. Approach. Multiplexed headstages overcome the problem of wiring
   complexity by combining signals from many electrodes to a smaller number
   of connections. We have developed a low-cost, multiplexed recording
   system with 60 contacts at 406 itm spacing. We characterized the quality
   of the electrode signals using multiple metrics that tracked spatial
   variation, evoked-response detectability, and decoding value.
   Performance of the system was validated both in anesthetized animals and
   freely moving awake animals. Main results. We recorded itECoG signals
   over the primary auditory cortex, measuring responses to acoustic
   stimuli across all channels. Single -trial responses had high
   signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (up to 25 dB under anesthesia), and were
   used to rapidly measure network topography within 10 s by constructing
   all single-channel receptive fields in parallel. We characterized evoked
   potential amplitudes and spatial correlations across the array in the
   anesthetized and awake animals. Recording quality in awake animals was
   stable for at least 30 days. Finally, we used these responses to
   accurately decode auditory stimuli on single trials. Significance. This
   study introduces (1) a itECoG recording system based on practical
   hardware design and (2) a rigorous analytical method for characterizing
   the signal characteristics of itECoG electrode arrays. This methodology
   can be applied to evaluate the fidelity and lifetime of any itECoG
   electrode array. Our ECoG-based recording system is accessible and will
   be useful for studies of perception and decision-making in rodents,
   particularly over the entire time course of behavioral training and
   learning.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Current mapping of epileptic networks in patients prior to
   epilepsy surgery utilizes electrode arrays with sparse spatial sampling
   (-1.0 cm inter -electrode spacing). Recent research demonstrates that
   sub-millimeter, cortical-column-scale domains have a role in seizure
   generation that may be clinically significant. We use high-resolution,
   active, flexible surface electrode arrays with 500 itm inter-electrode
   spacing to explore epileptiform local field potential (LFP) spike
   propagation patterns in two dimensions recorded from subdural
   micro-electrocorticographic signals in vivo in cat. In this study, we
   aimed to develop methods to quantitatively characterize the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of epileptiform activity at high resolution.
   Approach. We topically administered a GABA-antagonist, picrotoxin, to
   induce acute neocortical epileptiform activity leading up to discrete
   electrographic seizures. We extracted features from LFP spikes to
   characterize spatiotemporal patterns in these events. We then tested the
   hypothesis that two-dimensional spike patterns during seizures were
   different from those between seizures. Main results. We showed that
   spatially correlated events can be used to distinguish ictal versus
   interictal spikes. Significance. We conclude that sub-millimeter-scale
   spatiotemporal spike patterns reveal network dynamics that are invisible
   to standard clinical recordings and contain information related to
   seizure-state.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic metamaterial structures with discrete and continuous rotational
   symmetries attract interest of theorists and engineers due to the
   relative simplicity of their design and fabrication. They are also
   likely candidates for omnidirectional acoustic cloaking and other
   transformation-acoustical novelties. In this paper, we employ a
   stratified description of such structures, and develop the theory and an
   efficient symbolic/numerical algorithm for analyzing the scattering
   properties of such structures immersed in homogeneous fluid
   environments. The algorithm calculates the partial scattering amplitudes
   and the related scattering phases for an arbitrary layered distribution
   of acoustic material properties. The efficiency of the algorithm enables
   us to find approximate solutions to certain inverse scattering problems
   through quasi-global optimization. The scattering problems addressed
   here are the three forms of cloaking: (1) extinction cross-section
   suppression, the canonical form of cloaking, (2) monostatic sonar
   invisibility (backscattering suppression), and (3) acoustic force
   cloaking (transport cross-section suppression). We also address the
   efficiency-bandwidth tradeoff and design approximate cloaks with wider
   bandwidth using a new optimization formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization techniques are efficient methods to simplify the design of
   transformation optics devices. Asymmetric devices obtained through these
   methods typically lose omnidirectionality and perform well only when
   illuminated from a finite set of directions. We present here an
   optimization approach that results in simplified, omnidirectional
   designs of fairly large bandwidths. The method leverages a class of
   coordinate transformations that result in transformation media whose
   material parameters follow identical isocontours. We show that
   discretizing these media in a finite number of layers that follow the
   common isocontours and optimizing the material parameters inside each
   layer is an effective way to significantly simplify the design
   complexity while preserving most of the original performance including
   omnidirectionality.}},

Abstract = {{To utilize three-dimensional (3D) engineered human skeletal muscle
   tissue for translational studies and in vitro studies of drug toxicity,
   there is a need to promote differentiation and functional behavior. In
   this study, we identified conditions to promote contraction of
   engineered human skeletal muscle bundles and examined the effects of
   transient inhibition of microRNAs (miRs) on myogenic differentiation and
   function of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cultures of human myotubes. In
   2D cultures, simultaneously inhibiting both miR-133a, which promotes
   myoblast proliferation, and miR-696, which represses oxidative
   metabolism, resulted in an increase in sarcomeric alpha-actinin protein
   and the metabolic coactivator PGC-1 alpha protein compared to
   transfection with a scrambled miR sequence (negative control). Although
   PGC-1 alpha was elevated following joint inhibition of miRs 133a and
   696, there was no difference in myosin heavy chain (MHC) protein
   isoforms. 3D engineered human skeletal muscle myobundles seeded with
   5x10(6) human skeletal myoblasts (HSkM)/mL and cultured for 2 weeks
   after onset of differentiation consistently did not contract when
   stimulated electrically, whereas those seeded with myoblasts at 10x10(6)
   HSkM/mL or higher did contract. When HSkM were transfected with both
   anti-miRs and seeded into fibrin hydrogels and cultured for 2 weeks
   under static conditions, twitch and tetanic specific forces after
   electrical stimulation were greater than for myobundles prepared with
   HSkM transfected with scrambled sequences. Immunofluorescence and
   Western blots of 3D myobundles indicate that anti-miR-133a or
   anti-miR-696 treatment led to modest increases in slow MHC, but no
   consistent increase in fast MHC. Similar to results in 2D, only
   myobundles prepared with myoblasts treated with anti-miR-133a and
   anti-miR-696 produced an increase in PGC-1 alpha mRNA. PGC-1 alpha
   targets were differentially affected by the treatment. HIF-2 alpha mRNA
   showed an expression pattern similar to that of PGC-1 alpha mRNA, but
   COXII mRNA levels were not affected by the anti-miRs. Overall, joint
   inhibition of miR-133a and miR-696 accelerated differentiation, elevated
   the metabolic coactivator PGC-1 alpha, and increased the contractile
   force in 3D engineered human skeletal muscle bundles.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering offer the
   promise of next generation bioprocesses to produce numerous products
   including specialty and bulk chemicals and even biofuels sustainably
   from renewable feedstocks. A primary challenge is the optimization of
   product flux, within a much larger and complex metabolic network. While
   simple gene deletion methods can be used in the case of non-essential
   byproduct pathways, more sophisticated approaches are required when
   competitive fluxes are essential to host cellular functions. Engineering
   essential metabolic networks has been traditionally off-limits to
   metabolic engineers. Newer approaches to be reviewed include the
   rebalancing or rewiring of the metabolic network by tuning the levels of
   essential enzymes and the use of dynamic metabolic control strategies to
   conditionally reduce essential competitive fluxes.}},

Title = {{Mathematical Modeling of Outflow Facility Increase With Trabecular

Abstract = {{Purpose: To mathematically model the conventional aqueous humor outflow
   system with trabecular meshwork (TM) bypass and Schlemm canal (SC)
   dilation.
   Methods: The SC was modeled as a rectangular channel with the TM modeled
   as a permeable membrane. The collector channels (CCs) were modeled as
   fluid sinks distributed along the outer wall of SC. Two different
   implants were investigated in this study. The Hydrus Microstent
   (scaffold) was modeled with a TM bypass and a dilated region in SC that
   was 7 or 15 mm long and approximately 5-fold larger than the normal
   height of SC (h(0)). The iStent trabecular microbypass was modeled with
   a similar structure except that the dilated region in SC was 1 mm long
   and 25\% larger than h(0).
   Results: Creation of a TM bypass structure would increase the pressure
   in the surrounding regions inside the SC and make it close to the
   intraocular pressure. SC dilation would increase the pressure more
   uniformly in the dilated region. The pressure increase led to higher
   flow rates in SC and CCs, and subsequently increased outflow facility
   (C). If CCs were uniformly distributed, the increase in C was the
   smallest after implantation of 1 microbypass, compared with that after
   implantation of 2 microbypasses or 1 scaffold. If CCs were non-uniformly
   distributed, the magnitude of increase in C was sensitive to the
   location of implant, and the sensitivity was higher for the microbypass
   than the scaffold.
   Conclusion: The study showed that creation of TM bypass and SC dilation
   significantly increased outflow facility, and the amount of increase
   correlated with the length of dilated regions in SC.}},

Title = {{In Vivo Zinc Finger Nuclease-mediated Targeted Integration of a
   Glucose-6-phosphatase Transgene Promotes Survival in Mice With Glycogen
   Storage Disease Type IA}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR THERAPY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD Ia) is caused by
   glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) deficiency in association with severe,
   life-threatening hypoglycemia that necessitates lifelong dietary
   therapy. Here we show that use of a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) targeted
   to the ROSA26 safe harbor locus and a ROSA26-targeting vector containing
   a G6PC donor transgene, both delivered with adeno-associated virus (AAV)
   vectors, markedly improved survival of G6Pase knockout (G6Pase-KO) mice
   compared with mice receiving the donor vector alone (P < 0.04).
   Furthermore, transgene integration has been confirmed by sequencing in
   the majority of the mice treated with both vectors. Targeted alleles
   were 4.6-fold more common in livers of mice with GSD Ia, as compared
   with normal littermates, at 8 months following vector administration (P
   < 0.02). This suggests a selective advantage for vector-transduced
   hepatocytes following ZFN-mediated integration of the G6Pase vector. A
   short-term experiment also showed that 3-month-old mice receiving the
   ZFN had significantly-improved biochemical correction, in comparison
   with mice that received the donor vector alone. These data suggest that
   the use of ZFNs to drive integration of G6Pase at a safe harbor locus
   might improve vector persistence and efficacy, and lower mortality in
   GSD Ia.}},
