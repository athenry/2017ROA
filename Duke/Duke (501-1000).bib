Abstract = {{High-resolution tracking of stem cells remains a challenging task. An
   ultra-bright contrast agent with extended intracellular retention is
   suitable for in vivo high-resolution tracking of stem cells following
   the implantation. Here, a plasmonic-active nanoplatform was developed
   for tracking mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in mice. The nanoplatform
   consisted of TAT peptide-functionalized gold nanostars (TAT-GNS) that
   emit ultra-bright two-photon photoluminescence capable of tracking MSCs
   under high-resolution optical imaging. In vitro experiment showed
   TAT-GNS-labeled MSCs retained a similar differentiability to that of
   non-labeled MSCs controls. Due to their star shape, TAT-GNS exhibited
   greater intracellular retention than that of commercial Q-Tracker. In
   vivo imaging of TAT-GNS-labeled MSCs five days following intra-arterial
   injections in mice kidneys showed possible MSCs implantation in
   juxta-glomerular (JG) regions, but non-specifically in glomeruli and
   afferent arterioles as well. With future design to optimize GNS labeling
   specificity and clearance, plasmonic-active nanoplatforms may be a
   useful intracellular tracking tool for stem cell research.
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   An ultra-bright intracellular contrast agent is developed using TAT
   peptide-functionalized gold nanostars (TAT-GNS). It poses minimal
   influence on the stem cell differentiability. It exhibits stronger
   two-photon photoluminescence and superior labeling efficiency than
   commercial Q-Tracker. Following renal implantation, some TAT-GNS-labeled
   MSCs permeate blood vessels and migrate to the juxta-glomerular region.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new OCT method for flow speed quantification and
   directional velocimetry: particle streak velocimetry-OCT (PSV-OCT).
   PSV-OCT generates two-dimensional, 2.5-vector component (nu(x),vertical
   bar nu(y)vertical bar,nu(z)) maps of microscale flow velocity fields.
   Knowledge of 2.5-vector components also enables the estimation of total
   flow speed. The enabling insight behind PSV-OCT is that tracer particles
   in sparsely-seeded fluid flow trace out streaks in (x,z,t)-space. The
   streak orientations in x-t and z-t yield nu(x) and nu(z), respectively.
   The in-plane (x-z plane) residence time yields the out-of-plane speed
   vertical bar nu(y)vertical bar. Vector component values are generated by
   fitting streaks to a model of image formation that incorporates
   equations of motion in 3D space. We demonstrate cross-sectional
   estimation of (nu(x),vertical bar nu(y)vertical bar,nu(z)) in two

Abstract = {{Over the last 13 years, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has affected over
   230,000 U.S. service members through the conflicts in Iraq and
   Afghanistan, mostly as a result of exposure to blast events.
   Blast-induced TBI (bTBI) is multi-phasic, with the penetrating and
   inertia-driven phases having been extensively studied. The effects of
   primary blast injury, caused by the shockwave interacting with the
   brain, remain unclear. Earlier in vivo studies in mice and rats have
   reported mixed results for primary blast effects on behavior and memory.
   Using a previously developed shock tube and in vitro sample receiver, we
   investigated the effect of isolated primary blast on the
   electrophysiological function of rat organotypic hippocampal slice
   cultures (OHSC). We found that pure primary blast exposure inhibited
   long-term potentiation (LTP), the electrophysiological correlate of
   memory, with a threshold between 9 and 39 kPa center dot ms impulse.
   This deficit occurred well below a previously identified threshold for
   cell death (184 kPa center dot ms), supporting our previously published
   finding that primary blast can cause changes in brain function in the
   absence of cell death. Other functional measures such as spontaneous
   activity, network synchronization, stimulus-response curves, and
   paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) were less affected by primary blast exposure,
   as compared with LTP. This is the first study to identify a tissue-level
   tolerance threshold for electrophysiological changes in neuronal
   function to isolated primary blast.}},

Abstract = {{Although graphene's particularly strong third-order susceptibility has
   drawn intensive attention in theoretical and experimental studies, its
   low bulk nonlinear response heavily emphasizes the nanostructure's
   design for a sufficient magnitude of third-harmonic generation (THG).
   Meanwhile, currently few tools are available for accurate theoretical
   analyses of graphene's nonlinear performance within a relatively complex
   structure, which renders the design of graphene-based nonlinear
   optoelectronic devices even more challenging. In this work, a
   high-accuracy self-consistent numerical solver based on the
   boundary-integral spectral element method is first proposed for the THG
   problem. Starting from the coupled vector wave equations, the proposed
   solver solves for the fundamental frequency field and third-harmonic
   field together iteratively, and it covers the optical/electro-optic Kerr
   effects ignored by most previous THG studies. After validating the
   proposed method with the comparison between numerical results and
   experimental data, we extend our study to the THG enhancement strategy
   with ultrastrong localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) and Kerr
   effects. For both optical and electro-optic Kerr effects, the systematic
   simulation is performed for graphene's THG within the incident spectra
   of 400-1000 nm. Compared with the THG of floating single-atom-layer
   graphene, numerical results show that under specific LSPR engineering,
   graphene's THG backward emission is enhanced by 4.4 x 10(5) times.
   Simultaneously applying the electro-optic Kerr process can further boost
   the THG emission. However, its contribution is only secondary compared
   with LSPR. This study is also extended to bilayer and trilayer graphene
   models under strong LSPR. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In medical imaging systems, proper rendition of anatomy is
   essential in discerning normal tissue from disease. Currently, digital
   breast tomosynthesis (DBT) systems are evaluated using subjective
   evaluation of lesion visibility in uniform phantoms. This study involved
   the development of a new methodology to objectively measure the
   rendition of a 3D breast model by an anthropomorphic breast phantom, and
   its implementation on five clinical DBT systems of different makes and
   models.
   Methods: A 3D, patient-based breast phantom was fabricated based on XCAT
   breast models. This phantom was imaged on representative breast
   tomosynthesis systems. The ability of tomosynthesis systems to
   accurately reproduce the 3D structure of the breast was assessed by
   computational analysis of the resultant images in terms of three groups
   of indices: contrast index (CI), reflective of local difference between
   adipose and glandular material; adipose variability index (AVI),
   reflective of contributions of noise and artifacts within uniform
   adipose regions; and contrast detectability, which describes contrast
   against local background variability and is described by contrast
   variability index (CVI), coefficient of variation (COV), contrast to
   adipose variability index (CAVI), and contrast to noise ratio index
   (CNRI). The indices were obtained by comparing the image data to the
   gold standard 3D distribution of breast tissue in the model.
   Corresponding indices were measured within variable region of interest
   (ROI) sizes ranging from 10 to 37 mm. The characterization was performed
   on five tomosynthesis systems: Fuji Aspire Crystal, GE Essential,
   Hologic Dimension, IMS Giotto, and Siemens Inspiration, all evaluated at
   a fixed dose of 1.5 mGy average glandular dose, anonymized in random
   order from A to E.
   Results: Results are provided as a function of ROI size. The systems
   ranked orders in terms of CI with values of 7.4\%, 7.0\%, 6.9\%, 6.4\%,
   and 5.2\% for systems A-E, respectively. This system ranking was
   identical for CNRI. Both CI and CNRI were constant over ROI size. The
   ranking was similar for CVI. The COV also changed little with ROI size
   and was similar across systems. For 10 mm ROIs, the average system COV
   was 0.7, which reduced to 0.5 with 37 mm ROIs. Two systems (A and B)
   exhibited highest AVI values when measured in 10 mm ROIs. This, however,
   was ROI-size-dependent with the three other systems (C-E) yielding
   higher AVI values when measured with 37 mm ROIs. Two systems (B and E)
   showed inferior CAVI compared to others.
   Conclusions: The quality of rendition tracked with differences in image
   appearance across systems. The findings illustrate that the
   anthropomorphic phantom can be used as a basis to extract quantitative
   values of image attributes in DBT. (C) 2016 American Association of

Abstract = {{The unintended release of coal ash to the environment is a concern due
   to the enrichment of contaminants such as arsenic (As) and selenium (Se)
   in this solid waste material. Current risk assessments of coal ash
   disposal focus on pH as the primary driver of leaching from coal ash.
   However, redox speciation of As and Se is a major factor for their
   mobilization potential and has received much less attention for risk
   assessments, particularly in disposal scenarios where coal ash will
   likely be exposed to microbially-driven redox gradients. The aim of this
   study was to demonstrate the differences of aerobic and anaerobic
   conditions for the leaching of As and Se from coal ash. Batch
   sediment-ash slurry microcosms were performed to mimic an ash spill
   scenario and were monitored for changes in As and Se speciation and
   mobilization potential. The results showed that the dissolved As
   concentrations were up to 50 times greater in the anaerobic microcosms
   relative to the aerobic microcosms during the two week incubation. This
   trend was consistent with As redox speciation determined by X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy, which indicated that 55\% of the As in the
   solid phase at the end of the experiment was present as As(III) (a more
   leachable form of arsenic relative to As(V)). In the aerobic microcosms,
   only 13\% of the As was As(III) and the rest was As(V). More than half
   of the Se was present as Se(IV) in the original fly ash and in the
   aerobic microcosms, while in the anaerobic microcosms Se was gradually
   transformed to less soluble Se(0) species. Likewise, dissolved Se
   concentrations were up to 25 times greater in the aerobic microcosms
   relative to anaerobic conditions. While the overall observations of As
   and Se mobilization potential from coal ash were consistent with
   expectations for aqueous and solid phase speciation of these elements,
   the findings directly show the relevance of these processes for coal ash
   disposal. These results highlight the need to select appropriate
   environmental parameters to include in risk assessments as well as
   provide potential geochemical monitoring tools through the use of
   dissolved Se/As ratios to determine the redox conditions of ash storage
   and spill sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Low-frequency subsurface electromagnetic measurements are important
   tools for characterizing natural resources and environmental wastes.
   Rapid simulations of low-frequency subsurface electromagnetic
   measurements are still a challenge because of the large computational
   domain and low-frequency breakdown phenomenon. We develop an effective
   method to simulate these low-frequency subsurface electromagnetic
   measurements by using the spectral element method together with a domain
   decomposition method (DDM). A specific mesh has been designed based on
   the traveling wave nature in the air and the diffusion field nature in
   the underground space to greatly reduce the number of unknowns. The
   frequency-domain version of the Riemann solver (upwind flux) is used as
   an effective transmission condition to simulate the interactions between
   neighboring subdomains in DDM. Several numerical examples demonstrate
   the efficiency of the proposed approach in low-frequency subsurface
   electromagnetics simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in flow-based microfluidics have enabled the emergence
   of biochemistry-on-a-chip as a new paradigm in drug discovery,
   point-of-care disease diagnosis, and biomolecular recognition. However,
   these applications in biology and biochemistry require high precision to
   avoid erroneous assay outcomes and, therefore, are vulnerable to
   contamination between two fluidic flows with different biochemistries.
   Moreover, to wash contaminated sites, the buffer solution in flow-based
   biochips has to be guided along pre-etched channel networks. In this
   paper, we propose the first approach for automated wash optimization for
   contamination removal in flow-based microfluidic biochips. The proposed
   approach targets the generation of washing pathways to clean all
   contaminated microchannels with minimum execution time under physical
   constraints. Two representative and fabricated biochips are used to
   evaluate the proposed washing method. Compared with a baseline approach,
   the proposed approach leads to more efficient washing in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage droop is a major reliability concern in nano-scale very
   large-scale integration designs. Undesirable voltage droop is often a
   result of excessive IR drop. On the other hand, Ldi/dt-induced droop
   occurs when logic gates in the circuit draw high-switching current from
   the on-chip power supply network, and this problem is exacerbated at
   high-clock frequencies and smaller technology nodes. A consequence of
   voltage droop is usually an increase in path delays and the occurrence
   of intermittent faults during circuit operation. The addition of
   conservative timing margins, also known as guardbands, is a common
   practice to tackle the problem of voltage droop. However, such static
   and pessimistic guardbands, which are calculated at design time based on
   worst-case conditions, lead to significant performance loss. Dynamic
   frequency scaling is an alternative approach that enables the dynamic
   adjustment of clock frequency based on the actual voltage droop seen
   during runtime. For dynamic voltage-frequency to be effective, accurate
   and real-time prediction of voltage droop is essential. We propose a
   support-vector machine (SVM)-based regression method to predict voltage
   droop due to pattern-dependent IR drop based on inputs to the chip at
   runtime. Moreover, we reduce the amount of data needed for accurate
   prediction by using correlation-based feature selection. Several
   benchmarks from ITC'99 and International Work on Logic and Synthesis' 05
   highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of
   delay-prediction accuracy. Since real-time droop prediction requires
   hardware implementation of the predictor, we present the hardware design
   and synthesis results to demonstrate that the hardware overhead for the
   SVM predictor is negligible for large circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in unmanned and autonomous vehicle technology are
   accelerating the push to integrate these vehicles into environments,
   such as the National Airspace System, the national highway system, and
   many manufacturing environments. These environments will require close
   collaboration between humans and vehicles, and their large scalesmean
   that real-world field trials may be difficult to execute due to concerns
   of cost, availability, and technological maturity. This paper describes
   the use of an agent-based model to explore the system-level effects of
   unmanned vehicle implementation on the performance of these
   collaborative human-vehicle environments. In particular, this paper
   explores the introduction of three different unmanned vehicle control
   architectures into aircraft carrier flight deck operations. The
   different control architectures are tested under an examplemission
   scenario using 22 aircraft. Results show that certain control
   architectures can improve the rate of launches, but these improvements
   are limited by the structure of flight deck operations and nature of the
   launch task (which is defined independently of vehicles). Until the
   launch task is improved, the effects of unmanned vehicle control
   architectures on flight deck performance will be limited.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We sought to develop and test a clinically feasible 1-point
   Dixon, three-dimensional (3D) radial acquisition strategy to create
   isotropic 3D MR images of Xe-129 in the airspaces, barrier, and red
   blood cells (RBCs) in a single breath. The approach was evaluated in
   healthy volunteers and subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
   (IPF).
   Methods: A calibration scan determined the echo time at which Xe-129 in
   RBCs and barrier were 90 degrees out of phase. At this TE, interleaved
   dissolved and gas-phase images were acquired using a 3D radial
   acquisition and were reconstructed separately using the NUFFT algorithm.
   The dissolved-phase image was phase-shifted to cast RBC and barrier
   signal into the real and imaginary channels such that the image-derived
   RBC: barrier ratio matched that from spectroscopy. The RBC and barrier
   images were further corrected for regional field inhomogeneity using a
   phase map created from the gas-phase Xe-129 image.
   Results: Healthy volunteers exhibited largely uniform Xe-129-barrier and
   (129) Xe-RBC images. By contrast, Xe-129-RBC images in IPF subjects
   exhibited significant signal voids. These voids correlated qualitatively
   with regions of fibrosis visible on CT.
   Conclusion: This study illustrates the feasibility of acquiring
   single-breath, 3D isotropic images of Xe-129 in the airspaces, barrier,
   and RBCs using a 1-point Dixon 3D radial acquisition. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Advances in our understanding of the microbial ecology at sites impacted
   by light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) are needed to drive
   development of optimized bioremediation technologies, support longevity
   models, and develop culture-independent molecular tools. In this study,
   depth-resolved characterization of geochemical parameters and microbial
   communities was conducted for a shallow hydrocarbon-impacted aquifer.
   Four distinct zones were identified based on microbial community
   structure and geochemical data: (i) an aerobic, low-contaminant mass
   zone at the top of the vadose zone; (ii) a moderate to high-contaminant
   mass, low-oxygen to anaerobic transition zone in the middle of the
   vadose zone; (iii) an anaerobic, high-contaminant mass zone spanning the
   bottom of the vadose zone and saturated zone; and (iv) an anaerobic,
   low-contaminant mass zone below the LNAPL body. Evidence suggested that
   hydrocarbon degradation is mediated by syntrophic fermenters and
   methanogens in zone III. Upward flux of methane likely contributes to
   promoting anaerobic conditions in zone II by limiting downward flux of
   oxygen as methane and oxygen fronts converge at the top of this zone.
   Observed sulfate gradients and microbial communities suggested that
   sulfate reduction and methanogenesis both contribute to hydrocarbon
   degradation in zone IV. Pyrosequencing revealed that Syntrophus- and
   Methanosaeta-related species dominate bacterial and archaeal
   communities, respectively, in the LNAPL body below the water table.
   Observed phylotypes were linked with in situ anaerobic hydrocarbon
   degradation in LNAPL-impacted soils.}},

Abstract = {{Most genes are synthesized using seamless assembly methods that rely on
   the polymerase chain reaction(1-3) (PCR). However, PCR of genes encoding
   repetitive proteins either fails or generates nonspecific products.
   Motivated by the need to efficiently generate new protein polymers
   through high-throughput gene synthesis, here we report a
   codon-scrambling algorithm that enables the PCR-based gene synthesis of
   repetitive proteins by exploiting the codon redundancy of amino acids
   and finding the least-repetitive synonymous gene sequence. We also show
   that the codon-scrambling problem is analogous to the well-known
   travelling salesman problem(4), and obtain an exact solution to it by
   using De Bruijn graphs(5) and a modern mixed integer linear programme
   solver. As experimental proof of the utility of this approach, we use it
   to optimize the synthetic genes for 19 repetitive proteins, and show
   that the gene fragments are amenable to PCR-based gene assembly and
   recombinant expression.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation of sub-cortical brain regions (the basal
   ganglia), known as deep brain stimulation (DBS), is an effective
   treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Chronic high frequency (HF) DBS
   in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi)
   reduces motor symptoms including bradykinesia and tremor in patients
   with PD, but the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS are not fully understood.
   We developed a biophysical network model comprising of the closed loop
   cortical-basal ganglia-thalamus circuit representing the healthy and
   parkinsonian rat brain. The network properties of the model were
   validated by comparing responses evoked in basal ganglia (BG) nuclei by
   cortical (CTX) stimulation to published experimental results. A key
   emergent property of the model was generation of low-frequency network
   oscillations. Consistent with their putative pathological role,
   low-frequency oscillations in model BG neurons were exaggerated in the
   parkinsonian state compared to the healthy condition. We used the model
   to quantify the effectiveness of STN DBS at different frequencies in
   suppressing low-frequency oscillatory activity in GPi. Frequencies less
   than 40 Hz were ineffective, low-frequency oscillatory power decreased
   gradually for frequencies between 50 Hz and 130 Hz, and saturated at
   frequencies higher than 150 Hz. HF STN DBS suppressed pathological
   oscillations in GPe/GPi both by exciting and inhibiting the firing in
   GPe/GPi neurons, and the number of GPe/GPi neurons influenced was
   greater for HF stimulation than low-frequency stimulation. Similar to
   the frequency dependent suppression of pathological oscillations, STN
   DBS also normalized the abnormal GPi spiking activity evoked by CTX
   stimulation in a frequency dependent fashion with HF being the most
   effective. Therefore, therapeutic HF STN DBS effectively suppresses
   pathological activity by influencing the activity of a greater
   proportion of neurons in the output nucleus of the BG.}},

Abstract = {{Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in whole body
   metabolism and with appropriate stimulus could potentially mediate
   weight gain and insulin sensitivity. Although imaging techniques are
   available to detect subsurface BAT, there are currently no viable
   methods for continuous acquisition of BAT energy expenditure. Microwave
   (MW) radiometry is an emerging technology that allows the quantification
   of tissue temperature variations at depths of several centimeters. Such
   temperature differentials may be correlated with variations in metabolic
   rate, thus providing a quantitative approach to monitor BAT metabolism.
   In order to optimize MW radiometry, numerical and experimental phantoms
   with accurate dielectric properties are required to develop and
   calibrate radiometric sensors. Thus, we present for the first time, the
   characterization of relative permittivity and electrical conductivity of
   brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues in rats across the MW range
   0.5-10 GHz. Measurements were carried out in situ and post mortem in six
   female rats of approximately 200 g. A Cole-Cole model was used to fit
   the experimental data into a parametric model that describes the
   variation of dielectric properties as a function of frequency.
   Measurements confirm that the dielectric properties of BAT (epsilon(r) =
   14.0-19.4, sigma = 0.3-3.3 Sm-1) are significantly higher than those
   ofWAT(epsilon(r) = 9.1-11.9, sigma = 0.1-1.9 Sm-1), in accordance with
   the higher water content of BAT.}},

Abstract = {{Access to smooth muscle cells (SMC) would create opportunities for
   tissue engineering, drug testing, and disease modeling. Herein we report
   the direct conversion of human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to
   induced smooth muscle cells (iSMC) by induced expression of MYOCD. The
   EPC undergo a cytoskeletal rearrangement resembling that of mesenchymal
   cells within 3 days post initiation of MYOCD expression. By day 7, the
   reprogrammed cells show upregulation of smooth muscle markers ACTA2,
   MYHM, and TAGLN by qRT-PCR and ACTA2 and MYH11 expression by
   immunofluorescence. By two weeks, they resemble umbilical artery SMC in
   microarray gene expression analysis. The iSMC, in contrast to EPC
   control, show calcium transients in response to phenylephrine
   stimulation and a contractility an order of magnitude higher than that
   of EPC as determined by traction force microscopy. Tissue-engineered
   blood vessels constructed using iSMC show functionality with respect to
   flow- and drug-mediated vasodilation and vasoconstriction. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been used therapeutically for
   decades, yet their widespread clinical use is hampered by the inability
   to expand HSCs successfully in vitro. In culture, HSCs rapidly
   differentiate and lose their ability to self-renew. We hypothesize that
   by mimicking aspects of the bone marrow microenvironment in vitro we can
   better control the expansion and differentiation of these cells. In this
   work, derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate hydrogels were
   used as a culture substrate for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell
   (HSPC) populations. Key HSC cytokines, stem cell factor (SCF) and
   interferon- (IFN), as well as the cell adhesion ligands RGDS and
   connecting segment 1 were covalently immobilized onto the surface of the
   hydrogels. With the use of SCF and IFN, we observed significant
   expansion of HSPCs, approximate to 97 and approximate to 104 fold
   respectively, while maintaining c-kit(+)lin(-) and c-kit(+)Sca1(+)lin(-)
   (KSL) populations and the ability to form multilineage colonies after 14
   days. HSPCs were also encapsulated within degradable poly(ethylene
   glycol) hydrogels for three-dimensional culture. After expansion in
   hydrogels, approximate to 60\% of cells were c-kit(+), demonstrating no
   loss in the proportion of these cells over the 14 day culture period,
   and approximate to 50\% of colonies formed were multilineage, indicating
   that the cells retained their differentiation potential. The ability to
   tailor and use this system to support HSC growth could have implications
   on the future use of HSCs and other blood cell types in a clinical
   setting. Biotechnol. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Dissipation Intermittency Increases Long-Distance Dispersal of Heavy
   Particles in the Canopy Sublayer}},
Journal = {{BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{159}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-68}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The dispersion of heavy particles such as seeds within canopies is
   evaluated using Lagrangian stochastic trajectory models, laboratory, and
   field experiments. Inclusion of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation
   rate intermittency is shown to increase long-distance dispersal (LDD) by
   contributing to the intermittent ejection of particles to regions of
   high mean velocity outside the canopy volume. Model evaluation against
   controlled flume experiments, featuring a dense rod canopy, detailed
   flow measurements, and imaged trajectories of spherical particles,
   demonstrates that superimposing a terminal velocity on the fluid
   velocity is insufficient to determine the particle dispersal kernel.
   Modifying the trajectory model by adding dissipation intermittency is
   found to be significant for dispersal predictions along with the
   addition of inertial and crossing trajectories' effects. Comparison with
   manual seed-release experiments in a forest using wind-dispersed seeds
   shows that the model captures most of the measured kernels when accepted
   uncertainties in plant area index and friction velocity are considered.
   Unlike the flume experiments, the model modifications for several
   wind-dispersed seeds have minor effects on short-distance dispersal. A
   large increase was predicted in LDD when including dissipation
   intermittency for the forest experiment. The main results suggest that
   fitting or calibrating models to the `main body' of measured kernels may
   not offer extrapolating foresight to LDD predictions. As inertial
   effects were found mostly negligible in the field conditions here, the
   extended trajectory model requires specifying only the seed's terminal
   velocity and a constant variance of the normalized dissipation rate.
   Therefore, the proposed modifications can be readily applied to
   classical trajectory models so as to improve LDD predictions.}},

   (A = Cs or Ba; B = Sb or Bi; Ch = chalcogen; X = halogen), by examining
   critical issues such as the structural, electronic/optical properties,
   and stability through the combination of density-functional theory
   calculations and solid-state reactions. The calculations show that these
   quaternary Pb-free perovskites are thermodynamically unstable they are
   prone to decompose into ternary and/or binary secondary phases or form
   phases with nonperovskite structures. Solid-state synthesis efforts
   confirm the theoretically predicted difficulty for preparing these
   compounds; all attempted reactions do not form the desired perovskite
   phases with mixed chalcogen and halogen anions under conditions
   examined. Instead, they form separate binary and ternary compounds.
   Despite earlier predictions of promising characteristics for these
   prospective perovskites for photovoltaics, our results suggest that, due
   to their instability, the Pb-free perovskites with mixed chalcogen and

   thin films using photoluminescence (PL). We used a 10 MeV proton beam
   with varying doses from 10(9) to 10(12) cm(-2). Intensity-dependent low
   temperature PL measurements suggest that the proton irradiation does not
   create a new defect level but instead changes the number of preexisting
   defects in the detection range of the PL system. By comparing PL spectra
   after the proton irradiation with those obtained after thermal annealing
   under inert gas aswell as under hydrogen gas ambient, we find that the
   irradiation-induced change in the defect structure does not originate
   from the incorporation of hydrogen but fromenergetics of the irradiating
   particles. Electrical resistivity of the proton irradiated CIGS thin
   films is shown to decrease after the proton irradiation, and this is
   explained by the reduction of the concentration of compensating
   donor-like defects, specifically selenium vacancies, based on the PL
   results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports observation and modeling of five negative sprites
   occurring above two Florida thunderstorms. The sprites were triggered by
   unusual types of negative cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning discharges with
   impulse charge moment change ranging from 600 to 1300Ckm and charge
   transfer characterized by a timescale of 0.1-0.2ms. The negative sprite
   typically consists of a few generally vertical elements that each
   contain a bright core and dimmer streamers extending from the core in
   both downward and upward directions. Modeling results using the measured
   charge moment change waveforms indicate that the lower ionosphere was
   significantly modified by the CGs and the lower ionospheric density
   might have been increased by nearly 4 orders of magnitude due to the
   most intense CG. Finally, streamer modeling results show that the
   ionospheric inhomogeneities produced by atmospheric gravity waves can
   initiate negative sprite streamers, assuming that they can modulate the
   ionization coefficient.}},

Title = {{Reproducibility in density functional theory calculations of solids}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE}},

Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to
   an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and
   crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a
   different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such
   predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that
   compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis
   set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations
   of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from
   recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise
   differences that are comparable to those between different
   high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise
   agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers
   to document the precision of new applications and methodological
   improvements.}},

Abstract = {{We present a scheme to controllably improve the accuracy of
   tight-binding Hamiltonian matrices derived by projecting the solutions
   of plane-wave ab initio calculations on atomic-orbital basis sets. By
   systematically increasing the completeness of the basis set of atomic
   orbitals, we are able to optimize the quality of the band-structure
   interpolation over wide energy ranges including unoccupied states. This
   methodology is applied to the case of interlayer and image states, which
   appear several eV above the Fermi level in materials with large
   interstitial regions or surfaces such as graphite and graphene. Due to
   their spatial localization in the empty regions inside or outside of the
   system, these states have been inaccessible to traditional tight-binding
   models and even to ab initio calculations with atom-centered basis
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{Metamaterial absorbers have been demonstrated across much of the
   electromagnetic spectrum and exhibit both broad and narrow-band
   absorption for normally incident radiation. Absorption diminishes for
   increasing angles of incidence and transverse electric polarization
   falls off much more rapidly than transverse magnetic. We unambiguously
   demonstrate that broad-angle TM behavior cannot be associated with
   periodicity, but rather is due to coupling with a surface
   electromagnetic mode that is both supported by, and well described via
   the effective optical constants of the metamaterial where we achieve a
   resonant wavelength that is 19.1 times larger than the unit cell.
   Experimental results are supported by simulations and we highlight the
   potential to modify the angular response of absorbers by tailoring the
   surface wave. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{We have examined the morphology and composition of embedded nanowires
   that can be formed during molecular beam epitaxy of GaAs1-xBix using
   high angle annular dark field ('Z-contrast') imaging in an
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Samples
   were grown in Ga-rich growth conditions on a stationary GaAs substrate.
   Ga-rich droplets are observed on the surface with lateral trails
   extending from the droplet in the {[}110] direction. Cross-sectional
   scanning transmission electron microscopy of the film reveals epitaxial
   nanowire structures of composition similar to GaAs embedded in the
   GaAs1-xBix epitaxial layers. These nanowires extend from a surface
   droplet to the substrate at a shallow angle of inclination (similar to 4
   degrees). They typically are 4 mu m long and have a lens-shaped cross
   section with major and minor axes dimensions of 800 and 120 nm. The top
   surface of the nanowires exhibits a linear trace in longitudinal
   cross-section, across which the composition change from similar to GaAs
   to GaAs1-xBix appears abrupt. The bottom surfaces of the nanowires
   appear wavy and the composition change appears to be graded over similar
   to 25 nm. The droplets have phase separated into Ga- and Bi-rich
   components. A qualitative model is proposed in which Bi is gettered into
   Ga droplets, leaving Bi depleted nanowires in the wakes of the droplets
   as they migrate in one direction across the surface during GaAs1-xBix
   film growth.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2837-2845}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional shale gas development holds promise, for reducing the
   predominant consumption of coal and increasing the utilization of
   natural gas in China. While China possesses some of the most abundant
   technically recoverable shale gas resources in the world, water
   availability could still be a limiting factor for hydraulic fracturing
   operations, in addition to geological, infrastructural, and
   technological barriers. Here, we project the baseline water availability
   for the text 15 years in Sichuan Basin, one of the most promising shale
   gas basins in China. Our projection shows that continued water demand
   for the domestic sector in Sichuan Basin could result in high to
   extrerriely high water stress in certain areas. By simulating shale gas
   development and using information from current water use for hydraulic
   fracturing in Sichuan Basin (20000-30000 m(3) per well), we project that
   during the next decade water use for shale gas development could reach
   20-30 million m(3)/year, when shale gas well development is projected to
   be most active. While this volume is negligible relative to the
   projected overall domestic water use of similar to 36 billion m(3)/year,
   we posit that intensification of hydraulic fracturing and water use
   might compete with other water utilization in local water stress areas
   in Sichuan Basin.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between mercury (Hg) and selenium (Se) toxicity is
   complex, with coexposure reported to reduce, increase, and have no
   effect on toxicity. Different interactions may be related to chemical
   compound, but this has not been systematically examined. Our goal was to
   assess the interactive effects between the two elements on growth in the
   nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, focusing on inorganic and organic Hg
   (HgCl2 and MeHgCl) and Se (selenomethionine, sodium selenite, and sodium
   selenate) compounds. We utilized aqueous Hg/Se dosing molar ratios that
   were either above, below, or equal to 1 and measured the internal
   nematode total Hg and Se concentrations for the highest concentrations
   of each Se compound. Observed interactions were complicated, differed
   between Se and Hg compounds, and included greater-than-additive,
   additive, and less-than-additive growth impacts. Biologically
   significant interactions were only observed when the dosing Se solution
   concentration was 100-25 000 times greater than the dosing Hg
   concentration. Mitigation of growth impacts was not predictable on the
   basis of internal Hg/Se molar ratio; improved growth was observed at
   some internal Hg/Se molar ratios both above and below 1. These findings
   suggest that future assessments of the Hg and Se relationship should
   incorporate chemical compound into the evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Uptake, transport and toxicity of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) into
   plant cells are complex processes that are currently still not well
   understood. Parts of this problem are the multifaceted plant anatomy,
   and analytical challenges to visualize and quantify ENMs in plants. We
   critically reviewed the currently known ENM uptake, translocation, and
   accumulation processes in plants. A vast number of studies showed
   uptake, clogging, or translocation in the apoplast of plants, most
   notably of nanoparticles with diameters much larger than the commonly
   assumed size exclusion limit of the cell walls of approximate to 5-20nm.
   Plants that tended to translocate less ENMs were those with low
   transpiration, drought-tolerance, tough cell wall architecture, and tall
   growth. In the absence of toxicity, accumulation was often linearly
   proportional to exposure concentration. Further important factors
   strongly affecting ENM internalization are the cell wall composition,
   mucilage, symbiotic microorganisms (mycorrhiza), the absence of a
   cuticle (submerged plants) and stomata aperture. Mostly unexplored are
   the roles of root hairs, leaf repellency, pit membrane porosity, xylem
   segmentation, wounding, lateral roots, nodes, the Casparian band,
   hydathodes, lenticels and trichomes. The next steps towards a realistic
   risk assessment of nanoparticles in plants are to measure ENM uptake
   rates, the size exclusion limit of the apoplast and to unravel plant
   physiological features favoring uptake.}},

Title = {{Universally Conserved Relationships between Nuclear Shape and
   Cytoplasmic Mechanical Properties in Human Stem Cells}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{The ability of cells to proliferate, differentiate, transduce
   extracellular signals and assemble tissues involves structural
   connections between nucleus and cytoskeleton. Yet, how the mechanics of
   these connections vary inside stem cells is not fully understood. To
   address those questions, we combined two-dimensional particle-tracking
   microrheology and morphological measures using variable reduction
   techniques to measure whether cytoplasmic mechanics allow for
   discrimination between different human adherent stem cell types and
   across different culture conditions. Here we show that nuclear shape is
   a quantifiable discriminant of mechanical properties in the perinuclear
   cytoskeleton (pnCSK) of various stem cell types. Also, we find the pnCSK
   is a region with different mechanical properties than elsewhere in the
   cytoskeleton, with heterogeneously distributed locations exhibiting
   subdiffusive features, and which obeys physical relations conserved
   among various stem cell types. Finally, we offer a prospective basis to
   discriminate between stem cell types by coupling perinuclear mechanical
   properties to nuclear shape.}},

Title = {{Kilohertz Frequency Deep Brain Stimulation Is Ineffective at
   Regularizing the Firing of Model Thalamic Neurons}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for movement
   disorders, including tremor, dystonia, and Parkinson's disease, but the
   mechanisms of action are not well understood. Symptom suppression by DBS
   typically requires stimulation frequencies >= 100 Hz, but when the
   frequency is increased above similar to 2 kHz, the effectiveness in
   tremor suppression declines (Benabid et al., 1991). We sought to test
   the hypothesis that the decline in efficacy at high frequencies is
   associated with desynchronization of the activity generated within a
   population of stimulated neurons. Regularization of neuronal firing is
   strongly correlated with tremor suppression by DBS, and
   desynchronization would disrupt the regularization of neuronal activity.
   We implemented computational models of CNS axons with either
   deterministic or stochastic membrane dynamics, and quantified the
   response of populations of model nerve fibers to extracellular
   stimulation at different frequencies and amplitudes. As stimulation
   frequency was increased from 2 to 80 Hz the regularity of neuronal
   firing increased (as assessed with direct estimates of entropy), in
   accord with the clinical effects on tremor of increasing stimulation
   frequency (Kuncel et al., 2006). Further, at frequencies between 80 and
   500 Hz, increasing the stimulation amplitude (i.e., the proportion of
   neurons activated by the stimulus) increased the regularity of neuronal
   activity across the population, in accord with the clinical effects on
   tremor of stimulation amplitude (Kuncel et al., 2007). However, at
   stimulation frequencies above 1 kHz the regularity of neuronal firing
   declined due to irregular patterns of action potential generation and
   conduction block. The reductions in neuronal regularity that occurred at
   high frequencies paralleled the previously reported decline in tremor
   reduction and may be responsible for the loss of efficacy of DBS at very
   high frequencies. This analysis provides further support for the
   hypothesis that effective DBS masks the intrinsic patterns of activity
   in the stimulated neurons and replaces it with regularized firing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{305}},
Pages = {{156-163}},

Abstract = {{Ball milling was used to prepare two ultrafine magnetic biochar/Fe3O4
   and activated carbon (AC)/Fe3O4 hybrid materials targeted for use in
   pharmaceutical removal by adsorption and mechanochemical degradation of
   pharmaceutical compounds. Both hybrid adsorbents prepared after 2 h
   milling exhibited high removal of carbamazepine (CBZ), and were easily
   separated magnetically. These adsorbents exhibited fast adsorption of
   CBZ and tetracycline (TC) in the initial 1 h. The biochar/Fe3O4 had a
   maximum adsorption capacity of 62.7 mg/g for CBZ and 94.2 mg/g for TC,
   while values obtained for AC/Fe3O4 were 135.1 mg/g for CBZ and 45.3 mg/g
   for TC respectively when data were fitted using the Langmuir expression.
   Solution pH values slightly affected the sorption of TC on the
   adsorbents, while CBZ sorption was almost pH-independent. The spent
   adsorbents with adsorbed CBZ and TC were milled to degrade the adsorbed
   pollutants. The adsorbed TC itself was over 97\% degraded after 3 h of
   milling, while about half of adsorbed CBZ were remained. The addition of
   quartz sand was found to improve the mechanochemical degradation of CBZ
   on biochar/Fe3O4, and its degradation percent was up to 98.4\% at the
   dose of 0.3 g quarts sand/g adsorbent. This research provided an easy
   method to prepare ultrafine magnetic adsorbents for the effective
   removal of typical pharmaceuticals from water or wastewater and degrade
   them using ball milling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Probing the origin of excitonic states in monolayer WSe2}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have spurred
   excitement for potential applications in optoelectronic and valleytronic
   devices; however, the origin of the dynamics of excitons, trions, and
   other localized states in these low dimensional materials is not
   well-understood. Here, we experimentally probed the dynamics of
   excitonic states in monolayer WSe2 by investigating the temperature and
   polarization dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra. Four pronounced
   PL peaks were identified below a temperature of 60 K at near-resonant
   excitation and assigned to exciton, trion and localized states from
   excitation power dependence measurements. We find that the localized
   states vanish above 65 K, while exciton and trion emission peaks remain
   up to room temperature. This can be explained by a multi-level model
   developed for conventional semiconductors and applied to monolayer TMDCs
   for the first time here. From this model, we estimated a lower bound of
   the exciton binding energy of 198 meV for monolayer WSe2 and explained
   the vanishing of the localized states. Additionally, we observed a rapid
   decrease in the degree of circular polarization of the PL at increasing
   temperatures indicating a relatively strong electron-phonon coupling and
   impurity-related scattering. Our results reveal further insight into the
   excitonic states in monolayer WSe2 which is critical for future
   practical applications.}},

Title = {{Wireless Cortical Brain-Machine Interface for Whole-Body Navigation in
   Primates}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Several groups have developed brain-machine-interfaces (BMIs) that allow
   primates to use cortical activity to control artificial limbs. Yet, it
   remains unknown whether cortical ensembles could represent the
   kinematics of whole-body navigation and be used to operate a BMI that
   moves a wheelchair continuously in space. Here we show that rhesus
   monkeys can learn to navigate a robotic wheelchair, using their cortical
   activity as the main control signal. Two monkeys were chronically
   implanted with multichannel microelectrode arrays that allowed wireless
   recordings from ensembles of premotor and sensorimotor cortical neurons.
   Initially, while monkeys remained seated in the robotic wheelchair,
   passive navigation was employed to train a linear decoder to extract 2D
   wheelchair kinematics from cortical activity. Next, monkeys employed the
   wireless BMI to translate their cortical activity into the robotic
   wheelchair's translational and rotational velocities. Over time, monkeys
   improved their ability to navigate the wheelchair toward the location of
   a grape reward. The navigation was enacted by populations of cortical
   neurons tuned to whole-body displacement. During practice with the
   apparatus, we also noticed the presence of a cortical representation of
   the distance to reward location. These results demonstrate that
   intracranial BMIs could restore whole-body mobility to severely
   paralyzed patients in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Deciding upon a cost effective and sustainable method to address soil
   pollution is a challenge for many remedial project managers. High
   pressure to quickly achieve cleanup goals pushes for energy-intensive
   remedies that rapidly address the contaminants of concern with
   established technologies, often leaving little room for research and
   development especially for slower treatment technologies, such as
   bioremediation, for the more heavily polluted sites. In this case study,
   new genomic approaches have been leveraged to assess fungal
   biostimulation potential in soils polluted with particularly persistent
   hydrophobic contaminants. This new approach provides insights into the
   genetic functions available at a given site in a way never before
   possible. In particular, this article presents a case study where
   next-generation sequencing has been used to categorize fungi in soils
   from the AtlanticWood Industries Superfund site in Portsmouth, Virginia.
   Data suggest that original attempts to harness fungi for bioremediation
   may have focused on fungal genera poorly suited to survive under heavily
   polluted site conditions, and that more targeted approaches relying on
   native indigenous fungi which are better equipped to survive under
   site-specific conditions may be more appropriate. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Conventional magnetic resonance (MR) faces serious sensitivity
   limitations which can be overcome by hyperpolarization methods, but the
   most common method (dynamic nuclear polarization) is complex and
   expensive, and applications are limited by short spin lifetimes
   (typically seconds) of biologically relevant molecules. We use a
   recently developed method, SABRE-SHEATH, to directly hyperpolarize
   N-15(2) magnetization and long-lived N-15(2) singlet spin order, with
   signal decay time constants of 5.8 and 23 min, respectively. We find
   >10,000-fold enhancements generating detectable nuclear MR signals that
   last for over an hour. N-15(2)-diazirines represent a class of
   particularly promising and versatile molecular tags, and can be
   incorporated into a wide range of biomolecules without significantly
   altering molecular function.}},

Title = {{Controlling sound with acoustic metamaterials}},
Journal = {{NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Acoustic metamaterials can manipulate and control sound waves in ways
   that are not possible in conventional materials. Metamaterials with
   zero, or even negative, refractive index for sound offer new
   possibilities for acoustic imaging and for the control of sound at
   subwavelength scales. The combination of transformation acoustics theory
   and highly anisotropic acoustic metamaterials enables precise control
   over the deformation of sound fields, which can be used, for example, to
   hide or cloak objects from incident acoustic energy. Active acoustic
   metamaterials use external control to create effective material
   properties that are not possible with passive structures and have led to
   the development of dynamically reconfigurable, loss-compensating and
   parity-time-symmetric materials for sound manipulation. Challenges
   remain, including the development of efficient techniques for
   fabricating large-scale metamaterial structures and converting
   laboratory experiments into useful devices. In this Review, we outline
   the designs and properties of materials with unusual acoustic parameters
   (for example, negative refractive index), discuss examples of extreme
   manipulation of sound and, finally, provide an overview of future
   directions in the field.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency mistuning that occurs due to manufacturing variations and
   wear and tear of the blades has been shown to significantly affect the
   flutter and forced response behavior of a blade row. While tuned
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses are now an integral part of
   the design process, designers need a fast method to evaluate the
   localized high blade responses due to mistuning. In this research,
   steady and unsteady analyses are conducted on the second- stage rotor of
   an axial compressor, excited at the first torsion vibratory mode. A
   deterministic mistuning analysis is conducted using the numerical modal
   forces and the individual blade frequencies obtained experimentally by
   tip timing data. The mistuned blade responses are compared in the
   physical and traveling wave coordinates to the experimental data. The
   individual and combined impacts of frequency, aerodynamic, and forcing
   function perturbations on the predictions are assessed, highlighting the
   need to study mistuned systems probabilistically.}},

Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Biofouling, or accumulation of unwanted biofilms, on surfaces is a major
   concern for public health and human industry. Materials either avoiding
   contamination (fouling resistant) and/or directly killing attached
   microbes (biocidal) have thus far failed to achieve the goal of
   eliminating biofouling; fouling resistant surfaces eventually foul and
   biocidal surfaces accumulate debris that eventually decrease their
   efficacy. Combined biocidal and fouling release materials offer the
   potential for both killing and removing debris and are promising
   candidates for reducing biofouling on manufactured materials.
   Interference lithography was used to create nanopatterns of initiators,
   which were then used to initiate atom transfer radical polymerization of
   the temperature-responsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   (PNIPAAm) as a fouling release component. Biocidal activity was
   conferred by subsequent layer-by-layer deposition of cationic and
   anionic poly(phenylene ethynylenes) into the valleys between the
   PNIPAAm. For both Gram positive and Gram negative model bacteria,
   dark-regime biocidal activity was observed that did not increase upon
   exposure to light, suggesting that the mode of antimicrobial activity is
   due to ionic disruption of the cell wall. Subsequent to killing,
   bacteria and cellular debris were removed upon a temperature-induced
   phase transition of the PNIPAAm. These materials exhibited capture,
   killing, and release activity over multiple cycles of use. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is usually based on
   hemodynamic and/or clinical criteria. Noninvasive imaging of the heart
   and proximal vasculature can also provide useful information. An
   alternate approach to such criteria in the diagnosis of PVD is to image
   the vascular abnormalities in the lungs themselves. Hyperpolarized (HP)
   Xe-129 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a novel technique for
   assessing abnormalities in ventilation and gas exchange in the lungs. We
   applied this technique to two patients for whom there was clinical
   suspicion of PVD. Two patients who had significant hypoxemia and dyspnea
   with no significant abnormalities on computed tomography imaging or
   ventilation-perfusion scan and only mild or borderline pulmonary
   arterial hypertension at catheterization were evaluated. They underwent
   HP Xe-129 imaging and subsequently had tissue diagnosis obtained from
   lung pathology. In both patients, HP Xe-129 imaging demonstrated normal
   ventilation but markedly decreased gas transfer to red blood cells with
   focal defects on imaging, a pattern distinct from those previously
   described for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or obstructive lung disease.
   Pathology on both patients later demonstrated severe PVD. These findings
   suggest that HP Xe-129 MRI may be useful in the diagnosis of PVD and
   monitoring response to therapy. Further studies are required to
   determine its sensitivity and specificity in these settings.}},

Abstract = {{While the claim that water-carbon interactions result in spatially
   coherent vegetation patterning is rarely disputed in many arid and
   semiarid regions, the significance of the detailed water pathways and
   other high frequency variability remain an open question. How the short
   temporal scale meteorological fluctuations form the long-term spatial
   variability of available soil water in complex terrains due to the
   various hydrological, land surface, and vegetation dynamic feedbacks
   frames the scope of the work here. Knowledge of the detailed mechanistic
   feedbacks among soil, plants, and the atmosphere will lead to advances
   in our understanding of plant water availability in arid and semiarid
   ecosystems and will provide insights for future model development
   concerning vegetation pattern formation. In this study, quantitative
   estimates of water fluxes and vegetation productivity are provided for a
   semiarid ecosystem with established vegetation bands on hillslopes using
   numerical simulations. A state-of-the-science process based
   ecohydrological model is used, which resolves hydrological and plant
   physiological processes at the relevant space and time scales, for
   relatively small periods (e.g., decades) of mature ecosystems (i.e.,
   spatially static vegetation distribution). To unfold the mechanisms that
   shape the spatial distribution of soil moisture, plant productivity and
   the relevant surface/subsurface and atmospheric water fluxes, idealized
   hillslope numerical experiments are constructed, where the effects of
   soil type, slope steepness, and overland flow accumulation area are
   quantified. Those mechanisms are also simulated in the presence of
   complex topography features on landscapes. The main results are (a)
   short temporal scale meteorological variability and accurate
   representation of the scales at which each ecohydrological process
   operates are crucial for the estimation of the spatial variability of
   soil water availability to the plant root zone; (b) water fluxes such as
   evapotranspiration, infiltration, runoff-run-on, and subsurface soil
   water movement have a dynamic short temporal scale behavior that
   determines the long-term spatial organization of plant soil water
   availability in ecosystems with established vegetation patterns; and (c)
   hypotheses concerning the hydrological responses that can lead to
   vegetation pattern formation have to accommodate realistic and
   physically based representations of the fast dynamics of key
   ecohydrological fluxes.}},

   Acoustic Standing Waves for Sheathless Focusing of Particles}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{109}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Acoustophoresis refers to the displacement of suspended objects in
   response to directional forces from sound energy. Given that the
   suspended objects must be smaller than the incident wavelength of sound
   and the width of the fluidic channels are typically tens to hundreds of
   micrometers across, acoustofluidic devices typically use ultrasonic
   waves generated from a piezoelectric transducer pulsating at high
   frequencies (in the megahertz range). At characteristic frequencies that
   depend on the geometry of the device, it is possible to induce the
   formation of standing waves that can focus particles along desired
   fluidic streamlines within a bulk flow. Here, we describe a method for
   the fabrication of acoustophoretic devices from common materials and
   clean room equipment. We show representative results for the focusing of
   particles with positive or negative acoustic contrast factors, which
   move towards the pressure nodes or antinodes of the standing waves,
   respectively. These devices offer enormous practical utility for
   precisely positioning large numbers of microscopic entities (e.g.,
   cells) in stationary or flowing fluids for applications ranging from
   cytometry to assembly.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{As we make saccades, the image on each retina is displaced, yet our
   visual perception is uninterrupted. This is commonly referred to as
   transsaccadic perceptual stability, but such a description is
   inadequate. Some visual objects are stable (e.g., rocks) and should be
   perceived as such across saccades, but other objects may move at any
   time (e.g., birds). Stability is probabilistic in natural scenes. Here
   we extend the common notion of transsaccadic visual stability to a more
   general, ecologically based hypothesis of transsaccadic visual
   continuity in which postsaccadic percepts of objects depend on
   expectations about their probability of movement. Subjects made a
   saccade to a target and reported whether it seemed displaced after the
   saccade. Targets had varying probabilities of movement (ranging from
   0.1-0.9) that corresponded to their color (spectrum from blue to red).
   Performance was compared before and after subjects were told about the
   color-probability pairings ({''}uninformed{''} vs. ``informed{''}
   conditions). Analyses focused on signal detection and psychometric
   threshold measures. We found that in the uninformed condition,
   performance was similar across color-probability pairings, but in the
   informed condition, response biases varied with probability of movement,
   and movement-detection sensitivities were higher for rarely moving
   targets. We conclude that subjects incorporate priors about object
   movement into their judgments of visual continuity across saccades.}},

Abstract = {{It is common in biomedical research to run case-control studies
   involving high-dimensional predictors, with the main goal being
   detection of the sparse subset of predictors having a significant
   association with disease. Usual analyses rely on independent screening,
   considering each predictor one at a time, or in some cases on logistic
   regression assuming no interactions. We propose a fundamentally
   different approach based on a nonparametric Bayesian low rank tensor
   factorization model for the retrospective likelihood. Our model allows a
   very flexible structure in characterizing the distribution of
   multivariate variables as unknown and without any linear assumptions as
   in logistic regression. Predictors are excluded only if they have no
   impact on disease risk, either directly or through interactions with
   other predictors. Hence, we obtain an omnibus approach for screening for
   important predictors. Computation relies on an efficient Gibbs sampler.
   The methods are shown to have high power and low false discovery rates
   in simulation studies, and we consider an application to an epidemiology
   study of birth defects.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a complete framework (estimation, identification and

   humanoid robots, this is one of the first implementations of torque
   control on a robot that was originally built to be position controlled

   to the best of our knowledge). The challenge comes from both the
   hardware, which does not include joint-torque sensors and presents large
   friction due to the high-ratio gear boxes, and the software interface,
   which only accepts desired joint-angle commands (no motor current/
   voltage control). The contribution of the paper is to provide a complete
   methodology that is very likely to be reproduced as most robots are
   designed to provide only position control capabilities. Additionally,
   the method is validated by exhaustive experiments on one leg of the
   robot, including a comparison with the original position controller. We
   tested the torque controller in both motion control and cartesian force
   control. The torque control can track better a reference trajectory
   while using lower values for the feedback gains (up to 25\%). Moreover,
   we verified the quality of the identified motor models by analyzing the
   contribution of the feedforward terms of our torque controller, which
   dominate the feedback terms.}},

Title = {{Mean-velocity profile of smooth channel flow explained by a cospectral
   budget model with wall-blockage}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A series of recent studies has shown that a model of the turbulent
   vertical velocity variance spectrum (F-vv) combined with a simplified
   cospectral budget can reproduce many macroscopic flow properties of
   turbulent wall-bounded flows, including various features of the
   mean-velocity profile (MVP), i.e., the ``law of the wall{''}. While the
   approach reasonably models the MVP's logarithmic layer, the buffer layer
   displays insufficient curvature compared to measurements. The
   assumptions are re-examined here using a direct numerical simulation
   (DNS) dataset at moderate Reynolds number that includes all the
   requisite spectral and co-spectral information. Starting with several
   hypotheses for the cause of the ``missing{''} curvature in the buffer
   layer, it is shown that the curvature deficit is mainly due to
   mismatches between (i) the modelled and DNS-observed pressure-strain
   terms in the cospectral budget and (ii) the DNS-observed F-vv and the
   idealized form used in previous models. By replacing the current
   parameterization for the pressure-strain term with an expansive version
   that directly accounts for wall-blocking effects, the modelled and DNS
   reported pressure-strain profiles match each other in the buffer and
   logarithmic layers. Forcing the new model with DNS-reported Fv v rather
   than the idealized form previously used reproduces the missing buffer
   layer curvature to high fidelity thereby confirming the ``spectral
   link{''} between Fv v and the MVP across the full profile. A broad
   implication of this work is that much of the macroscopic properties of
   the flow (such as the MVP) may be derived from the energy distribution
   in turbulent eddies (i.e., F-vv) representing the microstate of the
   flow, provided the link between them accounts for wall-blocking. (C)

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Multiphoton microscopy has rapidly gained popularity in biomedical
   imaging and materials science because of its ability to provide
   three-dimensional images at high spatial and temporal resolution even in
   optically scattering environments. Currently the majority of commercial
   and home-built devices are based on two-photon fluorescence and harmonic
   generation contrast. These two contrast mechanisms are relatively easy
   to measure but can access only a limited range of endogenous targets.
   Recent developments in fast laser pulse generation, pulse shaping, and
   detection technology have made accessible a wide range of optical
   contrasts that utilize multiple pulses of different colors. Molecular
   excitation with multiple pulses offers a large number of adjustable
   parameters. For example, in two-pulse pump-probe microscopy, one can
   vary the wavelength of each excitation pulse, the detection wavelength,
   the timing between the excitation pulses, and the detection gating
   window after excitation. Such a large parameter space can provide much
   greater molecular specificity than existing single-color techniques and
   allow for structural and functional imaging without the need for
   exogenous dyes and labels, which might interfere with the system under
   study. In this review, we provide a tutorial overview, covering
   principles of pump-probe microscopy and experimental setup, challenges
   associated with signal detection and data processing, and an overview of
   applications. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A network of reader proteins and enzymes precisely controls gene
   transcription through the dynamic addition, removal, and recognition of

   research aims to elucidate the functions of this code, but our
   understanding of the effects of PTMs, specifically the methylation of

   tools to study PTMs relies sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms

Abstract = {{The design of drug delivery systems capable of efficiently delivering
   poorly soluble drugs to target sites still remains a major challenge.
   Such materials require several different functionalities; typically,
   these materials should be biodegradable and nontoxic, nonimmunogenic,
   responsive to their environment, and soluble in aqueous solution while
   retaining the ability to solubilize hydrophobic drugs. Here, a
   polypeptide-polymer hybrid of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) and
   poly(2-oxazoline)s (POx) is reported. This paper describes the chemical
   synthesis, physical characteristics, and drug loading potential of these
   novel hybrid macromolecules. A novel method is introduced for terminal
   functionalization of POx with protected maleimide moieties. Following
   recovery of the maleimide group via a retro Diels-Alder reaction, the
   consecutive Michael addition of thiol-functionalized ELPs yields the
   desired protein-polymer conjugate. These conjugates form nanoparticles
   in aqueous solution capable of solubilizing the anti-cancer drug
   paclitaxel with up to 8 wt\% loading.

Abstract = {{Surgical mesh has become an indispensable tool in hernia repair to
   improve outcomes and reduce costs; however, efforts are constantly being
   undertaken in mesh development to overcome postoperative complications.
   Common complications include infection, pain, adhesions, mesh extrusion
   and hernia recurrence. Reducing the complications of mesh implantation
   is of utmost importance given that hernias occur in hundreds of
   thousands of patients per year in the United States. In the present
   review, the authors present the different types of hernia meshes,
   discuss the key properties of mesh design, and demonstrate how each
   design element affects performance and complications. The present
   article will provide a basis for surgeons to understand which mesh to
   choose for patient care and why, and will explain the important
   technological aspects that will continue to evolve over the ensuing
   years.}},

Abstract = {{For perfectly electric conducting (PEC) objects, one difference between
   the electric-field integral equation (EFIE) and the magnetic-field
   integral equation (MFIE) is related to the solid angle, which only
   exists in the latter. In this communication, the correct computation of
   solid-angle contribution in MFIE is first summarized and clarified.
   Through testing strictly inside triangles (TSIT) and testing on edges
   (TOE) with or without the correct limit value (CLV) for the solid-angle
   integral, six versions of MFIE are then implemented by utilizing
   Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) functions for expansion and utilizing RWG or
   rotated Buffa-Christiansen (BC) functions for testing. Based on the
   simulations of typical sharp-edged targets and a sphere by the EFIE and
   six MFIEs, it is found that using CLVs for the solid-angle integral will
   improve the simulation accuracy substantially in comparison to that with
   incorrect limit values (ILVs). Moreover, if the singularities are
   properly handled, the MFIE implemented by TSIT can achieve the same
   accuracy with the MFIE implemented by TOE with CLVs.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-87}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Software failures are still a major concern in mission-and
   enterprise-critical contexts, despite significant efforts spent in
   software testing. In fact, while software testing is effective against
   easily-reproducible bugs (Bohrbugs), it is considerably less suitable
   for dealing with bugs that lead to hard-to-reproduce failures
   (Mandelbugs). On the positive side, the elusive nature of Mandelbugs
   provides opportunities for failure recovery, which are investigated in
   this paper. Based on real cases of Mandelbugs in eleven Information
   Technology (IT) systems running in production, the paper proposes a
   model that describes the recovery processes in IT systems. It then
   presents closed-form expressions, and a numerical analysis, of the mean
   time to recovery, and the software (un)availability. This analysis
   allows the designer to compare recovery strategies, as well as to
   determine the parameters having a high influence on the efficacy of
   recovery from failures caused by Mandelbugs.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic quantitative shear-wave imaging methods have been developed
   over the last decade to estimate tissue elasticity by measuring the
   speed of propagating shear waves following acoustic radiation force
   excitation. This work discusses eight sources of uncertainty and bias
   arising from ultrasound system-dependent parameters in ultrasound
   shear-wave speed (SWS) measurements. Each of the eight sources of error
   is discussed in the context of a linear, isotropic, elastic, homogeneous
   medium, combining previously reported analyses with Field II
   simulations, full-wave 2-D acoustic propagation simulations, and
   experimental studies. Errors arising from both spatial and temporal
   sources lead to errors in SWS measurements. Arrival time estimation
   noise, speckle bias, hardware fluctuations, and phase aberration cause
   uncertainties (variance) in SWS measurements, while pulse repetition
   frequency (PRF) and beamforming errors, as well as coupling medium sound
   speed mismatch, cause biases in SWS measurements (accuracy errors).
   Calibration of the sources of bias is an important step in the
   development of shear-wave imaging systems. In a well-calibrated system,
   where the sources of bias are minimized, and averaging over a region of
   interest (ROI) is employed to reduce the sources of uncertainty, an SWS
   error < 3\% can be expected.}},

Abstract = {{Intratumoral collagen cross-links heighten stromal stiffness and
   stimulate tumor cell invasion, but it is unclear how collagen
   cross-linking is regulated in epithelial tumors. To address this
   question, we used Kras(LA1) mice, which develop lung adenocarcinomas
   from somatic activation of a Kras(G12D) allele. The lung tumors in
   KrasLA1 mice were highly fibrotic and contained cancer-associated
   fibroblasts (CAF) that produced collagen and generated stiffness in
   collagen gels. In xenograft tumors generated by injection of wild-type
   mice with lung adenocarcinoma cells alone or in combination with CAFs,
   the total concentration of collagen cross-links was the same in tumors
   generated with or without CAFs, but coinjected tumors had higher
   hydroxylysine aldehyde-derived collagen cross-links (HLCC) and lower
   lysine-aldehyde-derived collagen cross-links (LCCs). Therefore, we
   postulated that an LCC-to-HLCC switch induced by CAFs promotes the
   migratory and invasive properties of lung adenocarcinoma cells. To test
   this hypothesis, we created coculture models in which CAFs are
   positioned interstitially or peripherally in tumor cell aggregates,
   mimicking distinct spatial orientations of CAFs in human lung cancer. In
   both contexts, CAFs enhanced the invasive properties of tumor cells in
   three-dimensional (3D) collagen gels. Tumor cell aggregates that
   attached to CAF networks on a Matrigel surface dissociated and migrated
   on the networks. Lysyl hydroxylase 2 (PLOD2/LH2), which drives HLCC
   formation, was expressed in CAFs, and LH2 depletion abrogated the
   ability of CAFs to promote tumor cell invasion and migration.}},

Abstract = {{Burn injuries in the United States account for over one million hospital
   admissions per year, with treatment estimated at four billion dollars.
   Of severe burn patients, 30-90\% will develop hypertrophic scars (HSc).
   In this study, we evaluate the impact of an elastomeric,
   randomly-oriented biostable polyurethane (PU) scaffold on HSc-related
   outcomes. In vitro, fibroblast-seeded PU scaffolds contracted
   significantly less and demonstrated fewer alpha SMA(+) myofibroblasts
   compared to fibroblast-seeded collagen lattices. In a murine HSc model,
   collagen coated PU (ccPU) scaffolds significantly reduced HSc
   contraction as compared to untreated control wounds and wounds treated
   with the clinical standard of care. Our data suggest that electrospun
   ccPU scaffolds meet the requirements to reduce HSc contraction including
   reduction of in vitro HSc related outcomes, diminished scar stiffness,
   and reduced scar contraction. While clinical dogma suggests treating
   severe burn patients with rapidly biodegrading skin equivalents, our
   data suggest that a more long-term scaffold may possess merit in
   reducing HSc.
   Statement of Significance
   In severe burns treated with skin grafting, between 30\% and 90\% of
   patients develop hypertrophic scars (HSc). There are no therapies to
   prevent HSc, and treatments are marginally effective. This work is the
   first example we are aware of which studies the impact of a permanent
   electrospun elastomer on HSc contraction in a murine model that mimics
   the human condition. Collagen coated polyurethane scaffolds decrease
   alpha SMA+ myofibroblast formation in vitro, prevent stiffening of scar
   tissue, and mitigate HSc contraction. Unlike current standards of care,
   electrospun, polyurethane scaffolds do not lose architecture over time.
   We propose that the future bioengineering strategy of mitigating HSc
   contraction should consider a long-term elastomeric matrix which
   persists within the wound bed throughout the remodeling phase of repair.

Abstract = {{The reliability of the MacCormack finite difference method for solving
   the contaminant transport equations of wetland model WETSAND is
   investigated. WETSAND solves the coupled advection-dispersion-reaction
   equations for the nitrogen cycle, total nitrogen and total phosphorus
   concentrations by using the implicit finite difference method. In
   addition to the implicit scheme, the MacCormack algorithm is implemented
   within WETSAND. Then, the results obtained by using the MacCormack
   algorithm are compared with the results obtained by using the implicit
   finite difference method for both synthetic examples and real data which
   is collected at the restored wetland site of Duke University at Sandy
   Creek watershed. Results show that the numerical methods are in good
   agreement. While the MacCormack scheme may be computationally more
   efficient for small velocities and dispersion coefficients (as is
   commonly the case for wetlands and lakes), much longer computational
   times are needed for the cases with high velocity and dispersion
   coefficient values (e.g., streams) since the magnitude of the time step
   has to be selected according to the CFL stability condition. (C) 2015

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Efficiency of energy piles is strongly affected by soil saturation
   conditions: low water contents considerably decrease their performance
   thus limiting the possibility to extend their application to arid
   environments. This paper investigates the microbially induced calcite
   precipitation (MICP) technique as a potential means of enhancing the
   soil-pile heat exchange rates by improving the thermal properties of
   soil. The study puts the focus on measuring the thermal conductivity of
   untreated and treaded sand at various degrees of saturation.
   Experimental results clearly show a significant improvement of the
   thermal conductivity of soil especially for low degrees of saturation.
   This enhancement is attributed to the mineralised calcite crystals
   acting as `thermal bridges' between the soil grains, offering a larger
   surface area for heat exchange compared with the untreated material in
   which exchanges occur through smaller contact points.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the need for surveillance of fugitive methane
   emissions over broad geographical regions. Most existing techniques
   suffer from being either extensive (but qualitative) or quantitative
   (but intensive with poor scalability). A total of two novel advancements
   are made here. First, a recursive Bayesian method is presented for
   probabilistically characterizing fugitive point-sources from mobile
   sensor data. This approach is made possible by a new cross-plume
   integrated dispersion formulation that overcomes much of the need for
   time-averaging concentration data. The method is tested here against a
   limited data set of controlled methane release and shown to perform
   well. We then present an information-theoretic approach to plan the
   paths of the sensor equipped vehicle, where the path is chosen so as to
   maximize expected reduction in integrated target source rate uncertainty
   in the region, subject to given starting and ending positions and
   prevailing meteorological conditions. The information-driven sensor path
   planning algorithm is tested and shown to provide robust results across
   a wide range of conditions. An overall system concept is presented for
   optionally piggybacking of these techniques onto normal industry
   maintenance operations using sensor equipped work trucks.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We review historical and more recent efforts in boredom
   research and related fields. A framework is presented that organizes the
   various facets of boredom, particularly in supervisory control settings,
   and research gaps and future potential areas for study are highlighted.
   Background: Given the ubiquity of boredom across a wide spectrum of work
   environmentsexacerbated by increasingly automated systems that remove
   humans from direct, physical system interaction and possibly increasing
   tedium in the workplacethere is a need not only to better understand the
   multiple facets of boredom in work environments but to develop targeted
   mitigation strategies.
   Method: To better understand the relationships between the various
   influences and outcomes of boredom, a systems-based framework, called
   the Boredom Influence Diagram, is proposed that describes various
   elements of boredom and their interrelationships.
   Results: Boredom is closely related to vigilance, attention management,
   and task performance. This review highlights the need to develop more
   naturalistic experiments that reflect the characteristics of a boring
   work environment.
   Conclusion: With the increase in automation, boredom in the workplace
   will likely become a more prevalent issue for motivation and retention.
   In addition, developing continuous measures of boredom based on
   physiological signals is critical.
   Application: Personnel selection and improvements in system and task
   design can potentially mitigate boredom. However, more work is needed to
   develop and evaluate other potential interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Gene therapy has historically been defined as the addition of new genes
   to human cells. However, the recent advent of genome-editing
   technologies has enabled a new paradigm in which the sequence of the
   human genome can be precisely manipulated to achieve a therapeutic
   effect. This includes the correction of mutations that cause disease,
   the addition of therapeutic genes to specific sites in the genome, and
   the removal of deleterious genes or genome sequences. This review
   presents the mechanisms of different genome-editing strategies and
   describes each of the common nuclease-based platforms, including zinc
   finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases
   (TALENs), meganucleases, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We then summarize
   the progress made in applying genome editing to various areas of gene
   and cell therapy, including antiviral strategies, immunotherapies, and
   the treatment of monogenic hereditary disorders. The current challenges
   and future prospects for genome editing as a transformative technology
   for gene and cell therapy are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The development of rapid, cost-effective DNA detection methods for
   molecular diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC) has been receiving
   increasing interest. This article reviews several DNA detection
   techniques based on plasmonic-active nanochip platforms developed in our
   laboratory over the last 5 years, including the molecular
   sentinel-on-chip (MSC), the multiplex MSC, and the inverse molecular
   sentinel-on-chip (iMS-on-Chip). DNA probes were used as the recognition
   elements, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was used as the
   signal detection method. Sensing mechanisms were based on hybridization
   of target sequences and DNA probes, resulting in a distance change
   between SERS reporters and the nanochip's plasmonic-active surface. As
   the field intensity of the surface plasmon decays exponentially as a
   function of distance, the distance change in turn affects SERS signal
   intensity, thus indicating the presence and capture of the target
   sequences. Our techniques were single-step DNA detection techniques.
   Target sequences were detected by simple delivery of sample solutions
   onto DNA probe-functionalized nanochips and measuring the SERS signal
   after appropriate incubation times. Target sequence labeling or washing
   to remove unreacted components was not required, making the techniques
   simple, easy-to-use, and cost-effective. The usefulness of the nanochip
   platform-based techniques for medical diagnostics was illustrated by the
   detection of host genetic biomarkers for respiratory viral infection and
   of the dengue virus gene.}},

Abstract = {{Online solid-phase extraction was combined with nano-liquid
   chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for
   the analysis of micropollutants in environmental samples from small
   volumes. The method was validated in surface water, Microcystis
   aeruginosa cell lysate, and spent Microcystis growth medium. For 41
   analytes, quantification limits of 0.1-28 ng/L (surface water) and
   0.1-32 ng/L (growth medium) were obtained from only 88 mu L of sample.
   In cell lysate, quantification limits ranged from 0.1-143 ng/L or
   0.33-476 ng/g dry weight from a sample of 88 mu L, or 26 mu g dry
   weight, respectively. The method matches the sensitivity of established
   online and offline solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry methods but requires only a fraction of the sample used by
   those techniques, and is among the first applications of nano-LC-MS for
   environmental analysis. The method was applied to the determination of

Abstract = {{Interest in deep probabilistic graphical models has increased in recent
   years, due to their state-of-the-art performance on many machine
   learning applications. Such models are typically trained with the
   stochastic gradient method, which can take a significant number of
   iterations to converge. Since the computational cost of gradient
   estimation is prohibitive even for modestly sized models, training
   becomes slow and practically usable models are kept small. In this paper
   we propose a new, largely tuning-free algorithm to address this problem.
   Our approach derives novel majorization bounds based on the
   Schatten-norm. Intriguingly, the minimizers of these bounds can be
   interpreted as gradient methods in a non-Euclidean space. We thus
   propose using a stochastic gradient method in non-Euclidean space. We
   both provide simple conditions under which our algorithm is guaranteed
   to converge, and demonstrate empirically that our algorithm leads to
   dramatically faster training and improved predictive ability compared to
   stochastic gradient descent for both directed and undirected graphical
   models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze dynamic switching networks, wherein the
   networks switch arbitrarily among a set of topologies. For this class of
   dynamic networks, we derive an epidemic threshold, considering the
   susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model. First, an epidemic
   probabilistic model is developed assuming independence between states of
   nodes. We identify the conditions under which the epidemic dies out by
   linearizing the underlying dynamical system and analyzing its asymptotic
   stability around the origin. The concept of joint spectral radius is
   then used to derive the epidemic threshold, which is later validated
   using several networks (Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert, MIT reality
   mining graphs, Regular, and Gilbert). A simplified version of the
   epidemic threshold is proposed for undirected networks. Moreover, in the
   case of static networks, the derived epidemic threshold is shown to
   match conventional analytical results. Then, analytical results for the
   epidemic threshold of dynamic networks are proved to be applicable to
   periodic networks. For dynamic regular networks, we demonstrate that the
   epidemic threshold is identical to the epidemic threshold for static
   regular networks. An upper bound for the epidemic spread probability in
   dynamic Gilbert networks is also derived and verified using simulation.}},

Title = {{A real-time spike classification method based on dynamic time warping
   for extracellular enteric neural recording with large waveform
   variability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{261}},
Pages = {{97-109}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Computationally efficient spike recognition methods are
   required for real-time analysis of extracellular neural recordings. The
   enteric nervous system (ENS) is important to human health but less
   well-understood with few appropriate spike recognition algorithms due to
   large waveform variability.
   New method: Here we present a method based on dynamic time warping (DTW)
   with high tolerance to variability in time and magnitude. Adaptive
   temporal gridding for ``fastDTW{''} in similarity calculation
   significantly reduces the computational cost. The automated threshold
   selection allows for real-time classification for extracellular
   recordings.
   Results: Our method is first evaluated on synthesized data at different
   noise levels, improving both classification accuracy and computational
   complexity over the conventional cross-correlation based
   template-matching method (CCTM) and PCA+k-means clustering without time
   warping. Our method is then applied to analyze the mouse enteric neural
   recording with mechanical and chemical stimuli. Successful
   classification of biphasic and monophasic spikes is achieved even when
   the spike variability is larger than millisecond in width and millivolt
   in magnitude.
   Comparison with existing method(s): In comparison with conventional
   template matching and clustering methods, the fastDTW method is
   computationally efficient with high tolerance to waveform variability.
   Conclusions: We have developed an adaptive fastDTW algorithm for
   real-time spike classification of ENS recording with large waveform
   variability against colony motility, ambient changes and cellular
   heterogeneity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to influenza virus triggers a complex cascade of events in the
   human host. In order to understand more clearly the evolution of this
   intricate response over time, human volunteers were inoculated with
   influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and then had serial peripheral
   blood samples drawn and tested for the presence of 25 major human
   cytokines. Nine of 17 (53\%) inoculated subjects developed symptomatic
   influenza infection. Individuals who will go on to become symptomatic
   demonstrate increased circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8,
   IL-15, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and interferon (IFN)
   gamma-induced protein (IP)-10 as early as 12-29 h post-inoculation
   (during the presymptomatic phase), whereas challenged patients who
   remain asymptomatic do not. Overall, the immunological pathways of
   leucocyte recruitment, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-signalling, innate
   anti-viral immunity and fever production are all over-represented in
   symptomatic individuals very early in disease, but are also dynamic and
   evolve continuously over time. Comparison with simultaneous peripheral
   blood genomics demonstrates that some inflammatory mediators (MCP-1,
   IP-10, IL-15) are being expressed actively in circulating cells, while
   others (IL-6, IL-8, IFN- and IFN-) are probable effectors produced
   locally at the site of infection. Interestingly, asymptomatic exposed
   subjects are not quiescent either immunologically or genomically, but
   instead exhibit early and persistent down-regulation of important
   inflammatory mediators in the periphery. The host inflammatory response
   to influenza infection is variable but robust, and evolves over time.
   These results offer critical insight into pathways driving
   influenza-related symptomatology and offer the potential to contribute
   to early detection and differentiation of infected hosts.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMethods for the detection of the temporal and spatial
   generation of painful symptoms are needed to improve the diagnosis and
   treatment of painful neuropathies and to aid preclinical screening of
   molecular therapeutics.
   MethodsIn this study, we utilized invivo luminescent imaging of NF-B
   activity and serum cytokine measures to investigate relationships
   between the NF-B regulatory network and the presentation of painful
   symptoms in a model of neuropathy.
   ResultsThe chronic constriction injury model led to temporal increases
   in NF-B activity that were strongly and non-linearly correlated with the
   presentation of pain sensitivities (i.e. mechanical allodynia and
   thermal hyperalgesia). The delivery of NEMO-binding domain peptide
   reduced pain sensitivities through the inhibition of NF-B activity in a
   manner consistent with the demonstrated non-linear relationship.
   Importantly, the combination of non-invasive measures of NF-B activity
   and NF-B-regulated serum cytokines produced a highly predictive model of
   both mechanical (R-2=0.86) and thermal (R-2=0.76) pain centred on the
   NF-B regulatory network (NF-B, IL-6, CXCL1).
   ConclusionsUsing invivo luminescent imaging of NF-B activity and serum
   cytokine measures, this work establishes NF-B and NF-B-regulated
   cytokines as novel multivariate biomarkers of pain-related sensitivity
   in this model of neuropathy that may be useful for the rapid screening
   of novel molecular therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{The development of stable, functional microvessels remains an important
   obstacle to overcome for tissue engineered organs and treatment of
   ischemia. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a promising cell
   source for vascular tissue engineering as they are readily obtainable
   and carry the potential to differentiate towards all endothelial
   phenotypes. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of
   human umbilical cord blood-derived EPCs to form vessel-like structures
   within a tissue engineering scaffold material, a cell-adhesive and
   proteolytically degradable polyethylene glycol hydrogel. EPCs in
   co-culture with angiogenic mural cells were encapsulated in hydrogel
   scaffolds by mixing with polymeric precursors and using a mild
   photocrosslinking process to form hydrogels with homogeneously dispersed
   cells. EPCs formed 3D microvessels networks that were stable for at
   least 30 days in culture, without the need for supplemental angiogenic
   growth factors. These 3D EPC microvessels displayed aspects of
   physiological microvasculature with lumen formation, expression of
   endothelial cell proteins (connexin 32, VE-cadherin, eNOS), basement
   membrane formation with collagen IV and laminin, perivascular investment
   of PDGFR-beta and alpha-SMA positive cells, and EPC quiescence (< 1\%
   proliferating cells) by 2 weeks of co-culture. Our findings demonstrate
   the development of a novel, reductionist system that is well-defined and
   reproducible for studying progenitor cell-driven microvessel formation.}},

Volume = {{260}},
Pages = {{59-65}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{On the evening of February 17th, 1864, the Confederate submarine H.L.
   Hunley attacked the Union ship USS Housatonic outside Charleston, South
   Carolina and became the first submarine in history to successfully sink
   an enemy ship in combat. One hypothesis for the sinking of the
   Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley is that the crew, in the enclosed
   vessel, suffered a lack of oxygen and suffocated. This study estimates
   the effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on the crew based on submarine
   gas volume and crew breathing dynamics. The calculations show the crew
   of the Hunley had a minimum of 10 min between the onset of uncomfortable
   hypercapnia symptoms and danger of loss of consciousness from hypoxia.
   Based on this result and the location of the crew when discovered,
   hypoxia and hypercapnia do not explain the sinking of the world's first
   successful combat submarine. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A new mixed finite-element method is proposed for computing the

   the tangential component of the electric field, and the modified
   nodal-based scalar basis functions to expand the longitudinal component.
   A smaller scale generalized eigenvalue problem is obtained by employing
   the mass lumping technique. Numerical examples verify that the mixed
   finite-element method with mass lumping is free of any spurious

Abstract = {{Cervical spine injuries continue to be a costly societal problem. Future
   advancements in injury prevention depend on improved physical and
   computational models, which are predicated on a better understanding of
   the neck response during dynamic loading. Previous studies have shown
   that the tolerance of the neck is dependent on its initial position and
   its budding behavior. This study uses a computational model to examine
   three important factors hypothesized to influence the loads experienced
   by vertebrae in the neck under compressive impact: muscle activation,
   torso constraints, and pre flexion angle of the cervical spine. Since
   cadaver testing is not practical for large scale parametric analyses,
   these factors were studied using a previously validated computational
   model. On average, simulations with active muscles had 32\% larger
   compressive forces and 25\% larger shear forces well in excess of what
   was expected from the muscle forces alone. In the short period of time
   required for neck injury, constraints on torso motion increased the
   average neck compression by less than 250 N. The pre-flexion hypothesis
   was tested by examining pre-flexion angles from neutral (0 degrees) to
   64 degrees. Increases in pre-flexion resulted in the largest increases
   in peak loads and the expression of higher-order buckling modes. Peak
   force and buckling modality were both very sensitive to pre-flexion
   angle. These results validate the relevance of prior cadaver models for
   neck injury and help explain the wide variety of cervical spine
   fractures that can result from ostensibly similar compressive loadings.
   They also give insight into the mechanistic differences between burst
   fractures and lower cervical spine dislocations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   in medical applications involving photothermal therapy. In this study,
   the problem of calculating the temperature elevation of a fluid arising
   from the absorption of light by a suspension of plasmonic nanoparticles
   is examined. The dependence of this temperature increase on the
   absorption cross section of nanoparticles of different shapes, in
   particular, nanospheres, nanospheroids, and nanostars, is studied. The
   nanoparticles behave as point sources of heat production and the
   time-dependent heat transfer equation is solved assuming that the
   nanoparticles are confined to a limited region. From this solution, the
   steady-state temperature of the fluid medium can be calculated and the
   time constant to achieve this temperature determined. (C) 2016 AIP

Abstract = {{Structural, electronic and optical properties of copper, silver and gold
   sulfides have been analyzed using density functional theory (DFT). A
   systematic study of all these properties using different functionals has
   been carried out and compared to the performance of more expensive
   hybrids functionals (HSE06). On-site Coulomb repulsion terms (DFT + U)
   and the inclusion of London dispersion forces (B86b-vdW) seem to be
   crucial for the good description of these solids, even improving the
   predictions of hybrids functionals in some cases. This article describes
   how the inclusion of some corrections in GGA functional makes possible a
   balanced description of the properties of this group of complex
   materials and makes affordable the future investigation of more complex
   systems that contain these solids within a reasonable computational

Abstract = {{Can the adult brain assimilate a novel, topographically organized,
   sensory modality into its perceptual repertoire? To test this, we
   implemented a microstimulation-based neuroprosthesis that rats used to
   discriminate among infrared (IR) light sources. This system continuously
   relayed information from four IR sensors that were distributed to
   provide a panoramic view of IR sources, into primary somatosensory
   cortex (S1). Rats learned to discriminate the location of IR sources in
   <4 d. Animals in which IR information was delivered in spatial register
   with whisker topography learned the task more quickly. Further, in
   animals that had learned to use the prosthesis, altering the topographic
   mapping from IR sensor to stimulating electrode had immediate
   deleterious effects on discrimination performance. Multielectrode
   recordings revealed that S1 neurons had multimodal (tactile/IR)
   receptive fields, with clear preferences for those stimuli most likely
   to be delivered during the task. Neuronal populations predicted, with
   high accuracy, which stimulation pattern was present in small (75 ms)
   time windows. Surprisingly, when identical microstimulation patterns
   were delivered during an unrelated task, cortical activity in S1 was
   strongly suppressed. Overall, these results show that the adult
   mammalian neocortex can readily absorb completely new information
   sources into its representational repertoire, and use this information
   in the production of adaptive behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Physics is concise, simple, unambiguous, and constantly improving. Yet,
   confusion reigns in the field especially with respect to complexity and
   the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper, we step back and take a
   look at these notions-their meaning and definition-on the background
   provided by nature and thermodynamics. We review the central concepts
   and words that underpin the physics of evolutionary design today:
   information, knowledge, evolution, change, arrow of time, pattern,
   organization, drawings, complexity, fractal dimension, object, icon,
   model, empiricism, theory, disorder, second law, the ``any{''} system in
   thermodynamics, morphing freely, and the constructal law. We show, for
   example, that information is not knowledge, fractal dimension is not a
   measure of complexity, and pattern is not a live flow architecture.
   Drawings, as physical means to facilitate the flow of knowledge, are
   subject to the natural tendency toward design evolution. Complexity,
   organization, and evolution in nature are most powerful and useful when
   pursued as a discipline, with precise terms, rules, and principles. (C)

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally realize the concept of

   relies entirely on metamaterial spatial light modulators, the advent of
   which has permitted advanced modulation techniques difficult to achieve
   with alternative approaches. So far, implementations of single-pixel
   imaging have used a single encoding frequency, making them sensitive to
   narrowband noise. Here, we implement frequency-division methods to
   parallelize the single-pixel imaging process at 3.2 THz. Our technique
   enables a trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio and acquisition
   speed-without altering detector integration time-thus realizing a key
   development due to the limitations imposed by slow thermal detectors in
   terahertz and far IR. In addition, our technique yields high image
   fidelity and marries communications concepts to single-pixel imaging,
   opening a new path forward for future imaging systems. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{In vitro human tissue engineered human blood vessels (TEBV) that exhibit
   vasoactivity can be used to test human toxicity of pharmaceutical drug
   candidates prior to pre-clinical animal studies. TEBVs with 400-800 mu M
   diameters were made by embedding human neonatal dermal fibroblasts or
   human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in dense collagen gel.
   TEBVs were mechanically strong enough to allow endothelialization and
   perfusion at physiological shear stresses within 3 hours after
   fabrication. After 1 week of perfusion, TEBVs exhibited endothelial
   release of nitric oxide, phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction, and
   acetylcholine-induced vasodilation, all of which were maintained up to 5
   weeks in culture. Vasodilation was blocked with the addition of the
   nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-N-G-Nitroarginine methyl ester
   (L-NAME). TEBVs elicited reversible activation to acute inflammatory
   stimulation by TNF-alpha which had a transient effect upon
   acetylcholine-induced relaxation, and exhibited dose-dependent
   vasodilation in response to caffeine and theophylline. Treatment of
   TEBVs with 1 mu M lovastatin for three days prior to addition of Tumor
   necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha) blocked the injury response and
   maintained vasodilation. These results indicate the potential to develop
   a rapidly-producible, endothelialized TEBV for microphysiological
   systems capable of producing physiological responses to both
   pharmaceutical and immunological stimuli.}},

   protonation states of the backbone (uncharged and zwitterionic) were
   considered for the amino acids as well as varied side chain protonation
   states. Furthermore, we studied amino acids and dipeptides in complex
   with divalent cations (Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+). The
   database covers the conformational hierarchies of 280 systems in a wide
   relative energy range of up to 4 eV (390 kJ/mol), summing up to a total
   of 45,892 stationary points on the respective potential-energy surfaces.
   All systems were calculated on equal first-principles footing, applying
   density-functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation
   corrected for long-range van der Waals interactions. We show good
   agreement to available experimental data for gas-phase ion affinities.
   Our curated data can be utilized, for example, for a wide comparison

Abstract = {{We analyze broadband electromagnetic measurements of pulse sequences
   occurring prior to first return strokes of negative cloud-to-ground
   lightning flashes. Signals generated by lightning discharges were
   recorded close to the thunderstorm by a magnetic field receiver and
   traveled up to 600km to three distant electric field receivers. We found
   that amplitudes of observed preliminary breakdown pulses, as well as
   amplitudes of the corresponding return strokes, are attenuated
   approximately by 2dB/100km when propagating in the Earth-ionosphere
   waveguide over mountainous terrain. Propagation simulations show that
   there is a significant contribution of the sky wave signals in the
   waveforms observed beyond 500km from their source. The estimated peak
   currents of the largest preliminary breakdown pulses reach over 60kA.
   Such current pulses propagating through in-cloud lightning leader
   channels in a strong electric field may be able to initiate terrestrial
   gamma ray flashes.}},

Title = {{Optimal architectures for long distance quantum communication}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the tremendous progress of quantum cryptography, efficient
   quantum communication over long distances (>= 1000 km) remains an
   outstanding challenge due to fiber attenuation and operation errors
   accumulated over the entire communication distance. Quantum repeaters
   (QRs), as a promising approach, can overcome both photon loss and
   operation errors, and hence significantly speedup the communication
   rate. Depending on the methods used to correct loss and operation
   errors, all the proposed QR schemes can be classified into three
   categories (generations). Here we present the first systematic
   comparison of three generations of quantum repeaters by evaluating the
   cost of both temporal and physical resources, and identify the optimized
   quantum repeater architecture for a given set of experimental parameters
   for use in quantum key distribution. Our work provides a roadmap for the
   experimental realizations of highly efficient quantum networks over
   transcontinental distances.}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput ab initio calculations, cluster expansion techniques,

   characterize the binodal and the spinodal decompositions features in the

   While our results agree with the available experimental data, our
   consolute temperatures substantially improve with respect to previous
   computational modeling. The computed phase diagrams corroborate that in
   ad hoc synthesis conditions the formation of nanostructure may occur
   justifying the low thermal conductivities in these alloys. The presented
   approach, making a rational use of online quantum repositories, can be
   extended to study thermodynamical and kinetic properties of materials of

Abstract = {{Through density functional theory calculations, we show that the alloy
   perovskite system BaZr1-xTixS3 (x < 0.25) is a promising candidate for
   producing high power conversion efficiency (PCE) solar cells with
   ultrathin absorber layers. To maximize the minority carrier lifetime,
   which is important for achieving high PCE, the defect calculations show
   that RaZr1-xTixS3 films should be synthesized under moderate (i.e., near
   stoichiometric) growth conditions to minimize the formation of
   deep-level defects. The perovskite BaZrS3 is also found to exhibit
   ambipolar self-doping properties, indicating the ability to form homo
   p-n junctions. However, our theoretical calculations and experimental
   solid-state reaction efforts indicate that the doped perovskite
   BaZr1-xTixS3 (x > 0) may not be stable under thermal equilibrium growth
   conditions. Calculations of decomposition energies suggest that
   introducing compressive strain may be a plausible approach to stabilize
   BaZr1-xTixS3 thin films.}},

Title = {{Elastic metamaterial beam with remotely tunable stiffness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a dynamically tunable elastic metamaterial, which employs
   remote magnetic force to adjust its vibration absorption properties. The
   1D metamaterial is constructed from a flat aluminum beam milled with a
   linear array of cylindrical holes. The beam is backed by a thin elastic
   membrane, on which thin disk-shaped permanent magnets are mounted. When
   excited by a shaker, the beam motion is tracked by a Laser Doppler
   Vibrometer, which conducts point by point scanning of the vibrating
   element. Elastic waves are unable to propagate through the beam when the
   driving frequency excites the first elastic bending mode in the unit
   cell. At these frequencies, the effective mass density of the unit cell
   becomes negative, which induces an exponentially decaying evanescent
   wave. Due to the non-linear elastic properties of the membrane, the
   effective stiffness of the unit cell can be tuned with an external
   magnetic force from nearby solenoids. Measurements of the linear and
   cubic static stiffness terms of the membrane are in excellent agreement
   with experimental measurements of the bandgap shift as a function of the
   applied force. In this implementation, bandgap shifts by as much as 40\%
   can be achieved with similar to 30 mN of applied magnetic force. This
   structure has potential for extension in 2D and 3D, providing a general
   approach for building dynamically tunable elastic metamaterials for
   applications in lensing and guiding elastic waves. (C) 2016 AIP

Abstract = {{Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs can initiate asymmetric
   division, but whether microRNA and protein cell fate determinants
   coordinate with each other remains unclear. Here, we show that miR-34a
   directly suppresses Numb in early-stage colon cancer stem cells (CCSCs),
   forming an incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) targeting Notch to
   separate stem and non-stem cell fates robustly. Perturbation of the IFFL
   leads to a new intermediate cell population with plastic and ambiguous
   identity. Lgr5+ mouse intestinal/colon stem cells (ISCs) predominantly
   undergo symmetric division but turn on asymmetric division to curb the
   number of ISCs when proinflammatory response causes excessive
   proliferation. Deletion of miR-34a inhibits asymmetric division and
   exacerbates Lgr5+ ISC proliferation under such stress. Collectively, our
   data indicate that microRNA and protein cell fate determinants
   coordinate to enhance robustness of cell fate decision, and they provide
   a safeguard mechanism against stem cell proliferation induced by
   inflammation or oncogenic mutation.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is implicated in habit formation.
   However, the DLS circuit mechanisms underlying habit remain unclear. A
   key role for DLS is to transform sensorimotor cortical input into firing
   of output neurons that project to the mutually antagonistic direct and
   indirect basal ganglia pathways. Here we examine whether habit alters
   this input-output function. By imaging cortically evoked firing in large
   populations of pathway-defined striatal projection neurons (SPNs), we
   identify features that strongly correlate with habitual behavior on a
   subject-by-subject basis. Habitual behavior correlated with strengthened
   DLS output to both pathways as well as a tendency for action-promoting
   direct pathway SPNs to fire before indirect pathway SPNs. In contrast,
   habit suppression correlated solely with a weakened direct pathway
   output. Surprisingly, all effects were broadly distributed in space.
   Together, these findings indicate that the striatum imposes broad,
   pathway-specific modulations of incoming activity to render learned
   motor behaviors habitual.}},

Abstract = {{Safety concerns and/or the stochastic nature of current transduction
   approaches have hampered nuclear reprogramming's clinical translation.
   We report a novel non-viral nanotechnology-based platform permitting
   deterministic large-scale transfection with single-cell resolution. The
   superior capabilities of our technology are demonstrated bymodification
   of the well-established direct neuronal reprogramming paradigm using
   overexpression of the transcription factors Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l
   (BAM). Reprogramming efficiencies were comparable to viral methodologies
   (up to similar to 9-12\%) without the constraints of capsid size and
   with the ability to control plasmid dosage, in addition to showing
   superior performance relative to existing non-viralmethods. Furthermore,
   increased neuronal complexity could be tailored by varying BAM ratio and
   by including additional proneural genes to the BAM cocktail.
   Furthermore, high-throughput NEP allowed easy interrogation of the
   reprogramming process. We discovered that BAM-mediated reprogramming is
   regulated by AsclI dosage, the S-phase cyclin CCNA2, and that some
   induced neurons passed through a nestin-positive cell stage.
   From the Clinical Editor: In the field of regenerative medicine, the
   ability to direct cell fate by nuclear reprogramming is an important
   facet in terms of clinical application. In this article, the authors
   described their novel technique of cell reprogramming through
   overexpression of the transcription factors Brn2, Ascl1, and Myt1l (BAM)
   by in situ electroporation through nanochannels. This new technique
   could provide a platform for further future designs. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic eigenvalue problems are contaminated by nonphysical zero
   modes in the conventional finite-element method (FEM) with edge
   elements. Here, we investigate the cavities with anisotropic lossless
   media, complex geometry structure, and perfect electric conductor (PEC)
   walls and eliminate all nonphysical zero and nonzero modes successfully.
   We introduce a Lagrangian multiplier to deal with the constraint of
   divergence-free condition. Our method is based on the mixed FEM
   employing the first-order edge basis functions to expand electric field
   and linear element basis functions to expand Lagrangian multiplier. The
   validity of our method is confirmed by several numerical experiments.
   Meanwhile, the numerical experiments show that when the cavity has a
   connected boundary, there is no physical zero mode; when the cavity has
   several disconnected boundaries, then the number of physical zero modes
   is equal to one less than the number of disconnected PEC boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a novel way to calculate the response amplitude of an

   The method couples a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of the
   shedding vortex flow to a structural model representation of the
   elastically supported cylinder. The aerodynamic forces on the cylinder
   are calculated using a harmonic balance, frequency domain solver. Three
   cases are considered: the cylinder vibrating transverse to the flow,
   in-line with the flow, and with both degrees of freedom. Two shedding
   patterns are observed, symmetric and antisymmetric, depending on the
   lock-in region considered. The in-line degree of freedom does not have a
   significant effect on the cylinder cross-flow response, except for very
   low mass or very low damping. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Engineered bacteria have great potential for medical and environmental
   applications. Fulfilling this potential requires controllability over
   engineered behaviors and scalability of the engineered systems. Here, we
   present a platform technology, microbial swarmbot, which employs spatial
   arrangement to control the growth dynamics of engineered bacteria. As a
   proof of principle, we demonstrated a safeguard strategy to prevent
   unintended bacterial proliferation. In particular, we adopted several
   synthetic gene circuits to program collective survival in Escherichia
   coli: the engineered bacteria could only survive when present at
   sufficiently high population densities. When encapsulated by permeable
   membranes, these bacteria can sense the local environment and respond
   accordingly. The cells inside the microbial swarmbot capsules will
   survive due to their high densities. Those escaping from a capsule,
   however, will be killed due to a decrease in their densities. We
   demonstrate that this design concept is modular and readily
   generalizable. Our work lays the foundation for engineering integrated
   and programmable control of hybrid biological-material systems for
   diverse applications.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer that has been identified as a
   critical component of cancer progression, facilitating rapid tumor
   growth and metastasis. Anti-angiogenic therapies have exhibited only
   modest clinical success, highlighting a need for better models that can
   be used to gain a more thorough understanding of tumor angiogenesis and
   screen potential therapeutics more accurately. This review explores how
   recent progress in in vitro cancer and vascular models individually can
   be applied to the development of in vitro tumor angiogenesis models.
   Current in vitro tumor angiogenesis models are also discussed, with a
   focus on aspects of the process that have been successfully
   recapitulated and opportunities for applying new technologies to expand
   model complexity to better represent the tumor microenvironment
   Continued advances in vascularized tumor models will provide tools to
   identify novel therapeutic targets and validate their therapeutic

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{263}},
Pages = {{108-115}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate long-lived states involving a pair of
   chemically equivalent protons, with lifetimes similar to 30 times T-1 up
   to a total lifetime of similar to 117 s at high field (8.45 T). This is
   demonstrated on trans-ethylene-d(2) in solution, where magnetic
   inequivalence gives access to the long-lived states. It is shown that
   the remaining J-coupling between the two quadrupolar deuterium spins,
   J(QQ), splits the conditions for optimally generating proton singlet
   states. Detailed simulations of the spin evolution are performed,
   shedding light on the coherent evolution during singlet-triplet
   conversion as well as on the incoherent evolution that causes
   relaxation. Subsequently, the simulations are compared with experimental
   results validating the theoretical insights. Possible applications
   include storage of hyperpolarization in the proton long-lived state. Of
   particular interest may be utilization of parahydrogen induced
   polarization to directly induce the examined long-lived states. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) is present in a variety of solid wastes including
   industrial wastes, household products, consumer electronics, and medical
   wastes, some of which can be disposed in conventional landfills. The
   presence of this neurotoxic metal in landfills is a concern due to the
   potential for it to leach or volatilize from the landfill and impact
   local ecosystems. The objective of this review is to describe general
   practices for the disposal of mercury-bearing solid wastes, summarize
   previous studies on the release of mercury from landfills, and delineate
   the expected transformations of Hg within landfill environments that
   would influence transport of Hg via landfill gas and leachate. A few
   studies have documented the emissions of Hg as landfill gas, primarily
   as gaseous elemental Hg(0) and smaller amounts as methylated Hg species.
   Much less is known regarding the release of Hg in leachate. Landfill
   conditions are unique from other subsurface environments in that they
   can contain water with very high conductivity and organic carbon
   concentration. Landfills also experience large changes in redox
   potential (and the associated microbial community) that greatly
   influence Hg speciation, transformations, and mobilization potential.
   Generally, Hg is not likely to persist in large quantities as dissolved
   species, since Hg(0) tends to evolve in the gas phase and divalent
   Hg(II) sorbs strongly to particulate phases including organic carbon and
   sulfides. However, Hg(II) has the potential to associate with or form
   colloidal particles that can be mobilized in porous media under high
   organic carbon conditions. Moreover, the anaerobic conditions within
   landfills can foster the growth of microorganisms that produced
   monomethyl-and dimethyl-Hg species, the forms of mercury with high
   potential for bioaccumulation. Much advancement has recently been made
   in the mercury biogeochemistry research field, and this study seeks to
   incorporate these findings for landfill settings.}},

Abstract = {{We present an end-to-end design of a built-in self-test (BIST) and
   BIST-based diagnosis infrastructure for 3-D-stacked integrated circuits
   (ICs) that facilitates the use of BIST at multiple stages of 3-D
   integration. The proposed BIST design is distributed, reusable, and
   reconfigurable, hence it is attractive for both prebond and post-bond
   testing. We also provide support for translating a static BIST schedule
   into a set of BIST control instructions. The BIST design is validated
   using detailed simulations of the various operating modes. A framework
   for fault diagnosis using the BIST infrastructure for 3-D-stacked ICs is
   also proposed. We present results on synthetic stacks created from
   ITC'99 and Open-Core benchmark circuits and assess the impact of
   inserting BIST in these designs in terms of area, timing, and power
   overhead. Results show that the overhead due to BIST is negligible. We
   also formulate a test-scheduling problem that aims at minimizing test
   time under BIST-resource and power constraints, and use two algorithms
   based on bin packing for solving the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Board-level functional fault diagnosis is needed for high-volume
   production to improve product yield. However, to ensure diagnosis
   accuracy and effective board repair, a large number of syndromes must be
   used. Therefore, the diagnosis cost can be prohibitively high due to the
   increase in diagnosis time and the complexity of test execution and
   analysis. We propose an adaptive diagnosis method based on incremental
   decision trees (DTs). Faulty components are classified according to the
   discriminative ability of the syndromes in DT training. The diagnosis
   procedure is constructed as a binary tree, with the most discriminative
   syndrome as the root and final repair suggestions are available as the
   leaf nodes of the tree. The syndrome to be used in the next step is
   determined based on the observation of syndromes thus far in the
   diagnosis procedure. The number of syndromes required for diagnosis can
   be significantly reduced compared to the total number of syndromes used
   for system training. Moreover, online learning is facilitated in the
   proposed diagnosis system using an incremental version of DTs, so as to
   bridge the knowledge obtained at test-design stage with the knowledge
   gained during volume production. The diagnosis system can thus adapt to
   occurrences of new error scenarios onthe- fly. Diagnosis results for
   three complex boards from industry, currently in volume production,
   highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{A simultaneous multiple frequency contrast source inversion (CSI) method
   is applied to reconstructing hydrocarbon reservoir targets in a complex
   multilayered medium in two dimensions. It simulates the effects of a
   salt dome sedimentary formation in the context of reservoir monitoring.
   In this method, the stabilized biconjugate-gradient fast Fourier
   transform (BCGS-FFT) algorithm is applied as a fast solver for the 2D
   volume integral equation for the forward computation. The inversion
   technique with CSI combines the efficient FFT algorithm to speed up the
   matrix-vector multiplication and the stable convergence of the
   simultaneous multiple frequency CSI in the iteration process. As a
   result, this method is capable of making quantitative conductivity image
   reconstruction effectively for large-scale electromagnetic oil
   exploration problems, including the vertical electromagnetic profiling
   (VEP) survey investigated here. A number of numerical examples have been
   demonstrated to validate the effectiveness and capacity of the
   simultaneous multiple frequency CSI method for a limited array view in

Journal = {{CLIMATE DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{1331-1350}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this diagnostic study we analyze changes of rainfall seasonality and
   dry spells by the end of the twenty-first century under the most extreme
   IPCC5 emission scenario (RCP8.5) as projected by twenty-four coupled
   climate models contributing to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5
   (CMIP5). We use estimates of the centroid of the monthly rainfall
   distribution as an index of the rainfall timing and a
   threshold-independent, information theory-based quantity such as
   relative entropy (RE) to quantify the concentration of annual rainfall
   and the number of dry months and to build a monsoon dimensionless
   seasonality index (DSI). The RE is projected to increase, with high
   inter-model agreement over Mediterranean-type regions-southern Europe,
   northern Africa and southern Australia-and areas of South and Central
   America, implying an increase in the number of dry days up to 1 month by
   the end of the twenty-first century. Positive RE changes are also
   projected over the monsoon regions of southern Africa and North America,
   South America. These trends are consistent with a shortening of the wet
   season associated with a more prolonged pre-monsoonal dry period. The
   extent of the global monsoon region, characterized by large DSI, is
   projected to remain substantially unaltered. Centroid analysis shows
   that most of CMIP5 projections suggest that the monsoonal annual
   rainfall distribution is expected to change from early to late in the
   course of the hydrological year by the end of the twenty-first century
   and particularly after year 2050. This trend is particularly evident
   over northern Africa, southern Africa and western Mexico, where more
   than of the models project a delay of the rainfall centroid from a few
   days up to 2 weeks. Over the remaining monsoonal regions, there is
   little inter-model agreement in terms of centroid changes.}},

Abstract = {{Cocopeat, a byproduct of coconut processing, was evaluated as a packing
   medium in vertical flow constructed wetlands for the treatment of septic
   tank effluent in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Vertical flow constructed
   wetlands are typically packed with gravel and then planted with
   ornamental plants. For this study, varying percentages of cocopeat were
   added to the gravel and the systems assessed for supplemental treatment
   efficiency. A secondary treatment step of gravel planters with
   ornamental plants was assessed for supplemental treatment efficiency.
   Removal efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus, coliform, and biological
   oxygen demand were measured. Microbial community samples were collected
   periodically in order to chronologically analyze community shifts within
   and between different wetland cells. Ammonium transformation and removal
   was greater than 95\% in each wetland containing cocopeat throughout the
   course of the study. Ammonium concentrations were significantly higher
   in the effluent of the wetland without cocopeat, indicating reduced
   nitrification activity, suggesting that cocopeat was critical for
   supporting nitrification. At steady state, each wetland had
   significantly lower phosphate concentrations than the influent. Complete
   removal of ammonium or phosphate in the constructed wetlands was not
   achieved; however, a secondary treatment step consisting of ornamental
   planters provided additional removal. This field study suggests that
   cocopeat is an adequate packing medium for constructed wetlands treating
   wastewater in Southeast Asia. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Cocopeat, a by-product of coconut processing plants widely available in
   Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Indonesia, was studied
   for its ability to support biological nutrient removal in lab-scale
   vertical flow columns treating simulated wastewater. Treatment
   performance for cocopeat was compared to sphagnum peat, a traditional
   packing medium, and Celite, an inert clay pellet. Removal efficiencies
   of nitrogen, phosphorus, and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were
   measured over a period of 325 days. During the treatment period, varying
   configurations were tested to determine the effect of varying aerobic,
   anoxic, and anaerobic zones on nutrient removal. Overall, similar BOD
   removal profiles were obtained for cocopeat and sphagnum peat. Slightly
   more efficient anoxic conditions and a less acidic environment developed
   with the cocopeat. Up to 75\% nitrogen removal was obtained; however,
   phosphorus removal was not accomplished using the experimental setup,
   likely due to the absence of a completely anaerobic treatment zone.

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{198-202}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship
   between digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) difficulty and radiology
   trainee performance.
   Methods: Twenty-seven radiology residents and fellows and three expert
   breast imagers reviewed 60 DBT studies consisting of unilateral
   craniocaudal and medial lateral oblique views. Trainees had no prior DBT
   experience. All readers provided difficulty ratings and final BI-RADS
   (R) scores. Expert breast imager consensus interpretations were used to
   determine the ground truth. Trainee sensitivity, specificity, and area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated
   for low- and high-difficulty subsets of cases as assessed by each
   trainee him or herself (self-assessed difficulty) and consensus
   expert-assessed difficulty.
   Results: For self-assessed difficulty, the trainee AUC was 0.696 for
   high-difficulty and 0.704 for low-difficulty cases (P = .753). Trainee
   sensitivity was 0.776 for high-difficulty and 0.538 for low-difficulty
   cases (P < .001). Trainee specificity was 0.558 for high-difficulty and
   0.810 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). For expert-assessed
   difficulty, the trainee AUC was 0.645 for high-difficulty and 0.816 for
   low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee sensitivity was 0.612 for
   high-difficulty and .784 for low-difficulty cases (P < .001). Trainee
   specificity was 0.654 for high-difficulty and 0.765 for low-difficulty
   cases (P = .021).
   Conclusions: Cases deemed difficult by experts were associated with
   decreases in trainee AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. In contrast, for
   self-assessed more difficult cases, the trainee AUC was unchanged
   because of increased sensitivity and compensatory decreased specificity.
   Educators should incorporate these findings when developing educational
   materials to teach interpretation of DBT.}},

Abstract = {{Our previous preclinical study demonstrated that both visible diffuse

   In this report, we further evaluated our technique for the early

   autofluorescence measurements on the skin flap model and statistically
   differentiated between flaps with and without occlusions as well as
   between flaps with venous occlusion and those with arterial occlusion

Abstract = {{Purpose: A novel ball tip (BT) holmium laser fiber has recently been
   developed, which features a modified rounded tip. The modification is
   purported to aid in insertion and minimize damage to the ureteroscope
   working channel. We evaluated this laser fiber with regard to stone
   comminution, tip degradation, insertional force into the ureteroscope,
   and impact on ureteroscope deflection. Materials and Methods: A 242m BT
   fiber and a standard flat tip (SF) fiber were compared. Four kilojoules
   was delivered to a BegoStone over a constant surface area using settings
   of 0.2/50, 0.6/6, 0.8/8, and 1J/10Hz. Fiber tip degradation was measured
   at 1 and 4kJ. Ureteroscope deflection was measured with the Olympus
   URF-P5, URF-P6, and URF-V. Insertion force into a 270 degrees angled
   ureteroscope sheath model was measured. Results: A sample size of five
   fibers was used for each comminution energy setting. Comminution
   increased with pulse energy without significant difference between
   fibers. No significant differences in tip degradation were observed.
   Both fibers reduced deflection (10 degrees-30 degrees) in all
   ureteroscopes without significant differences between fibers. Four new
   fibers paired with new sheath models were used to test insertion force.
   The BT insertion forces were approximately one-third of the SF. One SF
   fiber caused significant damage to the sheath and could not be advanced
   completely. Conclusions: The BT fiber has comparable comminution, tip
   degradation, and ureteroscope deflection performance compared with the
   SF fiber while exhibiting reduced insertion force within an aggressively
   deflected working sheath. The new tip design is likely protective of the
   working channel without loss of performance.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporally photoradiation-controlled intratumoral depot for
   combination of brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy for solid tumor}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{79-87}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In an attempt to spatiotemporally control both tumor retention and the
   coverage of anticancer agents, we developed a photoradiation-controlled
   intratumoral depot (PRCITD) driven by convection enhanced delivery
   (CED). This intratumoral depot consists of recombinant elastin-like
   polypeptide (ELP) containing periodic cysteine residues and is
   conjugated with a photosensitizer, chlorin-e6 (Ce6) at the N-terminus of
   the ELF. We hypothesized that this cysteine-containing ELP (cELP) can be
   readily crosslinked through disulfide bonds upon exposure to oxidative
   agents, specifically the singlet oxygen produced during photodynamic
   stimulation. Upon intratumoral injection, CED drives the distribution of
   the soluble polypeptide freely throughout the tumor interstitium.
   Formation and retention of the depot was monitored using fluorescence
   molecular tomography imaging. When imaging shows that the poly peptide
   has distributed throughout the entire tumor, 660-nm light is applied
   externally at the tumor site. This photo-radiation wavelength excites
   Ce6 and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of
   oxygen. The ROS induce in situ disulfide crosslinking of the cysteine
   thiols, stabilizing the ELP biopolymer into a stable therapeutic depot.
   Our results demonstrate that this ELP design effectively forms a
   hydrogel both in vitro and in vivo. These depots exhibit high stability
   in subcutaneous tumor xenografts in nude mice and significantly improved
   intratumoral retention compared to controls without crosslinking, as
   seen by fluorescent imaging and iodine-125 radiotracer studies. The
   photodynamic therapy provided by the PRCITD was found to cause
   significant tumor inhibition in a Ce6 dose dependent manner.
   Additionally, the combination of PDT and intratumoral radionuclide
   therapy co-delivered by PRCITD provided a greater antitumor effect than
   either monotherapy alone. These results suggest that the PRCITD could
   provide a stable platform for delivering synergistic, anti-cancer drug
   depots. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{268-282}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The use of soft, synthetic materials for the replacement of soft,
   load-bearing tissues has been largely unsuccessful due to a lack of
   materials with sufficient fatigue and wear properties, as well as a lack
   of fundamental understanding on the relationship between material
   structure and behavior under cyclic loads. In this study, we
   investigated the response of several soft, biomedical polymers to cyclic
   compressive stresses under aqueous conditions and utilized dynamic
   mechanical analysis and{''} differential scanning calorimetry to
   evaluate the role of thermo-mechanical transitions on such behavior.
   Studied materials include: polycarbonate urethane, polydimethylsiloxane,
   four acrylate copolymers with systematically varied thermo-mechanical
   transitions, as well as bovine meniscal tissue for comparison. Materials
   showed compressive moduli between 2.3 and 1900 MPa, with polycarbonate
   urethane (27.3 MPa) matching closest to meniscal tissue (37.0 MPa), and
   also demonstrated a variety of thermo-mechanical transition behaviors.
   Cyclic testing resulted in distinct fatigue-life curves, with failure
   defined as either classic fatigue fracture or a defined increased in
   maximum strain due to ratcheting. Our study found that polymers with
   sufficient dissipation mechanisms at the testing temperature, as
   evidenced by tan delta values, were generally tougher than those with
   less dissipation and exhibited ratcheting rather than fatigue fracture
   much like meniscal tissue. Strain recovery tests indicated that, for
   some toughened polymers, the residual strain following our cyclic
   loading protocol could be fully recovered. The similarity in ratcheting
   behavior, and lack of fatigue fracture, between the meniscal tissue and
   toughened polymers indicates that such polymers may have potential as
   artificial soft tissue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gene regulation is a complex and tightly controlled process that defines
   cell identity, health and disease, and response to pharmacologic and
   environmental signals. Recently developed DNA-targeting platforms,
   including zinc finger proteins, transcription activator-like effectors
   (TALEs) and the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic
   repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system, have enabled the recruitment of
   transcriptional modulators and epigenome-modifying factors to any
   genomic site, leading to new insights into the function of epigenetic
   marks in gene expression. Additionally, custom transcriptional and
   epigenetic regulation is facilitating refined control over cell function
   and decision making. The unique properties of the CRISPR-Cas9 system
   have created new opportunities for high-throughput genetic screens and
   multiplexing targets to manipulate complex gene expression patterns.
   This Review summarizes recent technological developments in this area

Abstract = {{Objective: We conducted intraoperative measurements of tremor during DBS
   containing short pauses (<= 50 ms) to determine if there is a minimum
   pause duration that preserves tremor suppression.
   Methods: Nine subjects with ET and thalamic DBS participated during IPG
   replacement surgery. Patterns of DBS included regular 130 Hz stimulation
   interrupted by 0, 15, 25 or 50 ms pauses. The same patterns were applied
   to a model of the thalamic network to quantify effects of pauses on
   activity of model neurons.
   Results: All patterns of DBS decreased tremor relative to `off'.
   Patterns with pauses generated less tremor reduction than regular high
   frequency DBS. The model revealed that rhythmic burst-driver inputs to
   thalamus were masked during DBS, but pauses in stimulation allowed
   propagation of bursting activity. The mean firing rate of bursting-type
   model neurons as well as the firing pattern entropy of model neurons
   were both strongly correlated with tremor power across stimulation
   conditions.
   Conclusions: The temporal pattern of stimulation influences the efficacy
   of thalamic DBS. Pauses in stimulation resulted in decreased tremor
   suppression indicating that masking of pathological bursting is a
   mechanism of thalamic DBS for tremor.
   Significance: Pauses in stimulation decreased the efficacy of open-loop
   DBS for suppression of tremor. (C) 2015 International Federation of

Abstract = {{The prediction of critical speeds of a rotating shaft is a crucial issue
   in a variety of industrial applications ranging from turbomachinery to
   disk storage systems. The modeling and analysis of rotordynamic systems
   is subject to a number of complications, but perhaps the most important
   characteristic is to pass through a critical speed under spin-up
   conditions. This is associated with classical resonance phenomena and
   high amplitudes, and is often a highly undesirable situation. However,
   given uncertainties in the modeling of such systems, it can be very
   difficult to predict critical speeds based on purely theoretical
   considerations. Thus, it is clearly useful to gain knowledge of the
   critical speeds of rotordynamic systems under in situ conditions. The
   present study describes a relatively simple method to predict the first
   critical speed using data from low rotational speeds. The method is
   shown to work well for two standard rotordynamic models, and with data
   from experiments conducted during this study.}},

Abstract = {{As a carrier of local deformation information, speckle pattern inside a
   subset is usually crucial for surface displacement acquisition based
   upon a digital image correlation (DIC) method, since both accuracy and
   precision of DIC method are closely related to the amount of speckle
   information in a subset. Although some comprehensive theoretical
   frameworks have been developed to estimate the quality of local speckle
   patterns, it is still a great challenge how to effectively integrate the
   subset speckle information into the well-developed correlation criteria
   used for DIC. By means of a well-designed square window function, we
   here propose the concept of continuous subset in order to modulate
   subset size in a continuously derivable manner. Afterwards, we further
   develop a new constrained zero-normalized sum-of-squared differences
   (CZNSSD) criterion and construct the corresponding iterative algorithm,
   based on which the subset size involved can be automatically determined
   according to the necessary amount of speckle information. Numerical
   results of synthetic speckle images indicate that the set of algorithm
   can enhance the accuracy and precision of displacement measurement,
   especially for spatially variant speckle images. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study we analyze the discharge morphologies of five confirmed
   negative sprite-parent discharges and the associated charge structures
   of the thunderstorms that produced them. The negative sprite-parent
   lightning took place in two thunderstorms that were associated with a
   tropical disturbance in east central and south Florida. The first
   thunderstorm, which moved onshore in east central Florida, produced four
   of the five negative sprite-parent discharges within a period of 17min,
   as it made landfall from the Atlantic Ocean. These negative
   sprite-parents were composed of bolt-from-the-blue (BFB), hybrid
   intracloud-negative cloud-to-ground (IC-NCG), and multicell IC-NCGs
   discharges. The second thunderstorm, which occurred inland over south
   Florida, produced a negative sprite-parent that was a probable hybrid
   IC-NCG discharge and two negative gigantic jets (GJs). Weakened upper
   positive charge with very large midlevel negative charge was inferred
   for both convective cells that initiated the negative-sprite-parent
   discharges. Our study suggests tall, intense convective systems with
   high wind shear at the middle to upper regions of the cloud accompanied
   by low cloud-to-ground (CG) flash rates promote these charge structures.
   The excess amount of midlevel negative charge results in these CG
   discharges transferring much more charge to ground than typical negative
   CG discharges. We find that BFB discharges prefer an asymmetrical charge
   structure that brings the negative leader exiting the upper positive
   charge region closer to the lateral positive screening charge layer.
   This may be the main factor in determining whether a negative leader
   exiting the upper positive region of the thundercloud forms a BFB or GJ.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Intraoperative assessment of surgical margins is critical to ensuring
   residual tumor does not remain in a patient. Previously, we developed a
   fluorescence structured illumination microscope (SIM) system with a
   single-shot field of view (FOV) of 2.1x1.6 mm (3.4 mm(2)) and
   sub-cellular resolution (4.4 mu m). The goal of this study was to test
   the utility of this technology for the detection of residual disease in
   a genetically engineered mouse model of sarcoma. Primary soft tissue
   sarcomas were generated in the hindlimb and after the tumor was
   surgically removed, the relevant margin was stained with acridine orange
   (AO), a vital stain that brightly stains cell nuclei and fibrous
   tissues. The tissues were imaged with the SIM system with the primary
   goal of visualizing fluorescent features from tumor nuclei. Given the
   heterogeneity of the background tissue (presence of adipose tissue and
   muscle), an algorithm known as maximally stable extremal regions (MSER)
   was optimized and applied to the images to specifically segment nuclear
   features. A logistic regression model was used to classify a tissue site
   as positive or negative by calculating area fraction and shape of the
   segmented features that were present and the resulting receiver operator
   curve (ROC) was generated by varying the probability threshold. Based on
   the ROC curves, the model was able to classify tumor and normal tissue
   with 77\% sensitivity and 81\% specificity (Youden's index). For an
   unbiased measure of the model performance, it was applied to a separate
   validation dataset that resulted in 73\% sensitivity and 80\%
   specificity. When this approach was applied to representative whole
   margins, for a tumor probability threshold of 50\%, only 1.2\% of all
   regions from the negative margin exceeded this threshold, while over
   14.8\% of all regions from the positive margin exceeded this threshold.}},

Abstract = {{Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating disease affecting
   about 1 out of 5000 male births and caused by mutations in the
   dystrophin gene. Genome editing has the potential to restore expression
   of a modified dystrophin gene from the native locus to modulate disease
   progression. In this study, adeno-associated virus was used to deliver
   the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
   (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to the mdx mouse model of DMD to remove the mutated
   exon 23 from the dystrophin gene. This includes local and systemic
   delivery to adult mice and systemic delivery to neonatal mice. Exon 23
   deletion by CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in expression of the modified
   dystrophin gene, partial recovery of functional dystrophin protein in
   skeletal myofibers and cardiac muscle, improvement of muscle
   biochemistry, and significant enhancement of muscle force. This work
   establishes CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing as a potential therapy to

Abstract = {{Acute respiratory infections caused by bacterial or viral pathogens are
   among the most common reasons for seeking medical care. Despite
   improvements in pathogen-based diagnostics, most patients receive
   inappropriate antibiotics. Host response biomarkers offer an alternative
   diagnostic approach to direct antimicrobial use. This observational
   cohort study determined whether host gene expression patterns
   discriminate noninfectious from infectious illness and bacterial from
   viral causes of acute respiratory infection in the acute care setting.
   Peripheral whole blood gene expression from 273 subjects with
   community-onset acute respiratory infection (ARI) or noninfectious
   illness, as well as 44 healthy controls, was measured using microarrays.
   Sparse logistic regression was used to develop classifiers for bacterial
   ARI (71 probes), viral ARI (33 probes), or a noninfectious cause of
   illness (26 probes). Overall accuracy was 87\% (238 of 273 concordant
   with clinical adjudication), which was more accurate than procalcitonin
   (78\%, P < 0.03) and three published classifiers of bacterial versus
   viral infection (78 to 83\%). The classifiers developed here externally
   validated in five publicly available data sets (AUC, 0.90 to 0.99). A
   sixth publicly available data set included 25 patients with
   co-identification of bacterial and viral pathogens. Applying the ARI
   classifiers defined four distinct groups: a host response to bacterial
   ARI, viral ARI, coinfection, and neither a bacterial nor a viral
   response. These findings create an opportunity to develop and use host
   gene expression classifiers as diagnostic platforms to combat
   inappropriate antibiotic use and emerging antibiotic resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Plastic pollution represents a major and growing global problem. It is
   well-known that plastics are a source of chemical contaminants to the
   aquatic environment and provide novel habitats for marine organisms. The
   present study quantified the impacts of plastic leachates from the seven
   categories of recyclable plastics on larval survival and settlement of
   barnacle Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite. Leachates from plastics
   significantly increased barnacle nauplii mortality at the highest tested
   concentrations (0.10 and 0.50 m(2)/L). Hydrophobicity (measured as
   surface energy) was positively correlated with mortality indicating that
   plastic surface chemistry may be an important factor in the effects of
   plastics on sessile organisms. Plastic leachates significantly inhibited
   barnacle cyprids settlement on glass at all tested concentrations.
   Settlement on plastic surfaces was significantly inhibited after 24 and
   48 h, but settlement was not significantly inhibited compared to the
   controls for some plastics after 72-96 h. In 24 h exposure to seawater,
   we found larval toxicity and inhibition of settlement with all seven
   categories of recyclable commercial plastics. Chemical analysis revealed
   a complex mixture of substances released in plastic leachates. Leaching
   of toxic compounds from all plastics should be considered when assessing
   the risks of plastic pollution.}},

Abstract = {{The non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) of Bacillus cereus is a
   three-partite toxin formed of the components NheA, -B and -C. Pore
   formation and subsequent lysis of target cells caused by Nhe is an
   orchestrated process comprising three steps: (i) formation of NheB/C
   oligomers in solution, (ii) attachment of the oligomers to the cell
   membrane, (iii) binding of NheA to the oligomers. The present study
   aimed to characterize the properties of the NheB/C complex and the fate
   of the target cell upon binding. An enzyme immunoassay allowing kinetic
   measurements and surface plasmon resonance revealed the fast and high
   affinity formation of the NheB/C oligomers. The benefit of these
   complexes is a more stable cell binding as well as stronger and earlier
   cytotoxic effect. High molecular mass hetero-oligomers (620 kDa)
   probably consisting of one NheC and up to 15 NheB were detected by
   size-exclusion chromatography and on native PAGE immunoblots. Due to the
   NheBC application the morphology and membrane permeability of Vero cells
   is partly disturbed. Formation of stable transmembrane channels with a
   conductance of about 870 pS and a diameter of about 2 nm due to the
   application of NheBC could be demonstrated in lipid bilayer experiments.
   Thus, the NheBC complex itself has a tendency to increase the membrane
   permeability prior to the emergence of full pores containing also NheA.

Abstract = {{Periaxin (Prx), a PDZ domain protein expressed preferentially in
   myelinating Schwann cells and lens fibers, plays a key role in membrane
   scaffolding and cytoarchitecture. Little is known, however, about how
   Prx is anchored to the plasma membrane. Here we report that ankyrin-B
   (AnkB), a well-characterized adaptor protein involved in linking the
   spectrinactin cytoskeleton to integral membrane proteins, is required
   for membrane association of Prx in lens fibers and colocalizes with Prx
   in hexagonal fiber cells. Under AnkB haploinsufficiency, Prx accumulates
   in the soluble fraction with a concomitant loss from the
   membrane-enriched fraction of mouse lenses. Moreover, AnkB
   haploinsufficiency induced age-dependent disruptions in fiber cell
   hexagonal geometry and radial alignment and decreased compressive
   stiffness in mouse lenses parallel to the changes observed in Prx null
   mouse lens. Both AnkB-and Prx-deficient mice exhibit disruptions in
   membrane organization of the spectrin-actin network and the
   dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in lens fiber cells. Taken together,
   these observations reveal that AnkB is required for Prx membrane
   anchoring and for maintenance of lens fiber cell hexagonal geometry,
   membrane skeleton organization, and biomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{We present a platform for detecting cellular deformations from
   mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear stress, using rapid quantitative
   phase imaging. Rapid quantitative phase imaging was used to analyze
   changes in the optical path length of adherent skin cancer cells during
   mechanical displacement. Both the whole-cell phase displacement and the
   resultant shift of the cellular center of mass were calculated over the
   duration of the stimulus. Whole-cell phase displacement images were
   found to match expectation. Furthermore, center-of-mass shifts of
   adherent cells were found to resemble that of a one-dimensional
   Kelvin-Voigt (KV) viscoelastic solid. Cellular steady-state
   displacements from step fluid shear stimuli were found to be linearly
   related to the shear stress. Shear stiffness constants for cells exposed
   to a cytoskeletal disrupting toxin were found to be significantly lower
   than unexposed cells. This novel technique allows for elastographic
   analysis of whole-cell effective shear stiffness without the use of an
   exogenous force applicator, a specialized culture substrate, or tracking

Abstract = {{Continuous glucose sensors offer the promise of tight glycemic control
   for insulin dependent diabetics; however, utilization of such systems
   has been hindered by issues of tissue compatibility. Here we report on
   the in vivo performance of implanted glucose sensors coated with
   Dexamethasone-loaded (Dexloaded) porous coatings employed to mediate the
   tissue-sensor interface. Two animal studies were conducted to (1)
   characterize the tissue modifying effects of the porous Dex-loaded
   coatings deployed on sensor surrogate implants and (2) investigate the
   effects of the same coatings on the in vivo performance of Medtronic
   MiniMed SOF-SENSOR (TM) glucose sensors. The tissue response to implants
   was evaluated by quantifying macrophage infiltration, blood vessel
   formation, and collagen density around implants. Sensor function was
   assessed by measuring changes in sensor sensitivity and time lag,
   calculating the Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) for each sensor
   treatment, and performing functional glucose challenge test at relevant
   time points. Implants treated with porous Dex-loaded coatings diminished
   inflammation and enhanced vascularization of the tissue surrounding the
   implants. Functional sensors with Dex-loaded porous coatings showed
   enhanced sensor sensitivity over a 21-day period when compared to
   controls. Enhanced sensor sensitivity was accompanied with an increase
   in sensor signal lag and MARD score. These results indicate that
   Dex-loaded porous coatings were able to elicit an attenuated tissue
   response, and that such tissue microenvironment could be conducive
   towards extending the performance window of glucose sensors in vivo.
   Statement of Significance
   In the present article, a coating to extend the functionality of
   implantable glucose sensors in vivo was developed. Our study showed that
   the delivery of an anti-inflammatory agent with the presentation of
   micro-sized topographical cues from coatings may lead to improved
   long-term glucose sensor function in vivo. We believe that improved
   function of sensors treated with the novel coatings was a result of the
   observed decreases in inflammatory cell density and increases in vessel
   density of the tissue adjacent to the devices. Furthermore, extending
   the in vivo functionality of implantable glucose sensors may lead to
   greater adoption of these devices by diabetic patients. (C) 2015 Acta

Abstract = {{Many image processing applications benefited remarkably from the theory
   of sparsity. One model of sparsity is the cosparse analysis one. It was
   shown that using l(1)-minimization one might stably recover a cosparse
   signal from a small set of random linear measurements if the operator is
   a frame. Another effort has provided guarantee for dictionaries that
   have a near optimal projection procedure using greedy-like algorithms.
   However, no claims have been given for frames. A common drawback of all
   these existing techniques is their high computational cost for large
   dimensional problems.
   In this work we propose a new greedy-like technique with theoretical
   recovery guarantees for frames as the analysis operator, closing the gap
   between greedy and relaxation techniques. Our results cover both the
   case of bounded adversarial noise, where we show that the algorithm
   provides us with a stable reconstruction, and the one of random Gaussian
   noise, for which we prove that it has a denoising effect, closing
   another gap in the analysis framework. Our proposed program, unlike the
   previous greedy-like ones that solely act in the signal domain, operates
   mainly in the analysis operator's transform domain. Besides the
   theoretical benefit, the main advantage of this strategy is its
   computational efficiency that makes it easily applicable to visually big
   data. We demonstrate its performance on several high dimensional images.

Abstract = {{More than 30 years separate the two largest oil spills in North American
   history (the Ixtoc I and Macondo well blowouts), yet the responses to
   both disasters were nearly identical in spite of advanced material
   innovation during the same time period. Novel, mechanically durable
   sorbents could enable (a) sorbent use in the open ocean, (b) automated
   deployment to minimize workforce exposure to toxic chemicals, and (c)
   mechanical recovery of spilled oils. Here, we explore the use of two
   mechanically durable, low-density (0.1-0.2 g cm(-3)), highly porous
   (85-99\% porosity), hydrophobic (water contact angles >120 degrees),
   flexible aerogel composite blankets as sorbent materials for automated
   oil capture and recovery: Cabot Thermal Wrap (TW) and Aspen Aerogels
   Spaceloft (SL). Uptake of crude oils (Iraq and Sweet Bryan Mound oils)
   was 8.0 +/- 0.1 and 6.5 +/- 0.3 g g(-1) for SL and 14.0 +/- 0.1 and 12.2
   +/- 0.1 g g(-1) for TW, respectively, nearly twice as high as similar
   polyurethane- and polypropylene-based devices. Compound-specific uptake
   experiments and discrimination against water uptake suggested an
   adsorption-influenced sorption mechanism. Consistent with that
   mechanism, chemical extraction oil recoveries were 95 +/- 2 (SL) and 90
   +/- 2\% (TW), but this is an undesirable extraction route in
   decentralized oil cleanup efforts. In contrast, mechanical extraction
   routes are favorable, and a modest compression force (38 N) yielded 44.7
   +/- 0.5\% initially to 42.0 +/- 0.4\% over 10 reuse cycles for SL and
   initially 55.0 +/- 0.1\% for TW, degrading to 30.0 +/- 0.2\% by the end
   of 10 cycles. The mechanical integrity of SL deteriorated substantially
   (800 +/- 200 to 80 +/- 30 kPa), whereas TW was more robust (380 +/- 80
   to 700 +/- 100 kPa) over 10 uptake-and-compression extraction cycles.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Optical conformal mapping has been used to construct several isotropic
   devices with novel functionalities. In particular, a conformal cloak
   could confer omnidirectional invisibility. However, the maximum values
   of the refractive indexes needed for current designs are too large to
   implement, even in microwave experiments. Furthermore, most devices
   designed so far have had imperfect impedance matching and therefore
   incomplete invisibility functionalities. Here we describe a perfect
   conformal invisible device with full impedance matching everywhere. The
   maximum value of refractive index required by our device is just about
   five, which is feasible for microwave and terahertz experiments using
   current metamaterial techniques. To construct the device, we use a
   logarithmic conformal mapping and a Mikaelian lens. Our results should
   enable a conformal invisible device with almost perfect invisibility to
   be made soon.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Abstract = {{Projection of Bloch states obtained from quantum-mechanical calculations
   onto atomic orbitals is the fastest scheme to construct ab initio
   tight-binding Hamiltonian matrices. However, the presence of spurious
   states and unphysical hybridizations of the tight-binding eigenstates
   has hindered the applicability of this construction. Here we demonstrate
   that those spurious effects are due to the inclusion of Bloch states
   with low projectability. The mechanism for the formation of those
   effects is derived analytically. We present an improved scheme for the
   removal of the spurious states which results in an efficient scheme for
   the construction of highly accurate ab initio tight-binding

Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Electric fields alter adhesive forces between materials. Electroadhesive
   forces have been utilized in diverse applications ranging from climbing
   robots, electrostatic levitation to electro-sticky boards. However, the
   design of electroadhesive devices still largely relies on empirical or
   ``trial-and-error{''} approaches. In this work, a theoretical model is
   presented to analyze the electrostatic field between the supporting wall
   and the electroadhesive device with periodic coplanar electrodes. The
   air-gap between the surface of electroadhesive device and the dielectric
   wall is explicitly taken into account in the model to consider its
   significant impact on electroadhesive forces. On the basis of this
   model, the electroadhesive force is calculated by using the Maxwell
   stress tensor. The effects of key design parameters and working
   environments on the electroadhesion behavior are further investigated.
   This study not only provides a tool to reveal the underlying mechanisms
   of electroadhesion but also suggests potential strategies to optimize
   novel electroadhesive devices for engineering applications. (C) 2015

Journal = {{EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{In spite of recent advances in the genetics and neuroscience of early
   childhood mental health, behavioral observation is still the gold
   standard in screening, diagnosis, and outcome assessment. Unfortunately,
   clinical observation is often subjective, needs significant rater
   training, does not capture data from participants in their natural
   environment, and is not scalable for use in large populations or for
   longitudinal monitoring. To address these challenges, we developed and
   tested a self-contained app designed to measure toddlers' social
   communication behaviors in a primary care, school, or home setting.
   Twenty 16-30 month old children with and without autism participated in
   this study. Toddlers watched the developmentally-appropriate visual
   stimuli on an iPad in a pediatric clinic and in our lab while the iPad
   camera simultaneously recorded video of the child's behaviors. Automated
   computer vision algorithms coded emotions and social referencing to
   quantify autism risk behaviors. We validated our automatic computer
   coding by comparing the computer-generated analysis of facial expression
   and social referencing to human coding of these behaviors. We report our
   method and propose the development and testing of measures of young
   children's behaviors as the first step toward development of a novel,
   fully integrated, low-cost, scalable screening tool for autism and other
   neurodevelopmental disorders of early childhood.}},

Abstract = {{The P300 speller is a brain-computer interface that enables people with
   neuromuscular disorders to communicate based on eliciting event-related
   potentials (ERP) in electroencephalography (EEG) measurements. One
   challenge to reliable communication is the presence of refractory
   effects in the P300 ERP that induces temporal dependence in the user's
   EEG responses. We propose a model for the P300 speller as a
   communication channel with memory. By studying the maximum information
   rate on this channel, we gain insight into the fundamental constraints
   imposed by refractory effects. We construct codebooks based on the
   optimal input distribution, and compare them to existing codebooks in
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of verifying software implementations of linear
   time-invariant controllers against mathematical specifications. Given a
   controller specification, multiple correct implementations may exist,
   each of which uses a different representation of controller state (e.g.,
   due to optimizations in a third-party code generator). To accommodate
   this variation, we first extract a controller's mathematical model from
   the implementation via symbolic execution, and then check input-output
   equivalence between the extracted model and the specification by
   similarity checking. We show how to automatically verify the correctness
   of C code controller implementation using the combination of techniques
   such as symbolic execution, satisfiability solving and convex
   optimization. Through evaluation using randomly generated controller
   specifications of realistic size, we demonstrate that the scalability of
   this approach has significantly improved compared to our own earlier
   work based on the invariant checking method.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud cover impacts the quality of optical remote sensing images.
   Generally, temporal methods and inpainting methods are used to remove
   the clouds. The temporal methods reconstruct cloudy areas via a series
   of multi-temporal images, thus suffer from the assumption that the
   landscape does not change over a period of time. The inpainting methods
   fill the areas via image patches from the image itself. Lacking prior
   information of the cloudy areas, these methods are limited in
   reconstructing accuracy, especially when clouds lie on the boundaries of
   two types of landscapes. We propose a new method based on the inpanting
   method which take the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images as a prior
   structure information of contaminated. Using information from two kinds
   of images acquired at the same time, the proposed method also avoids
   inaccuracy caused by land changes in temporal methods. This idea has
   been demonstrated by experiments carried out on Theme Mapper data and
   Sentinel-1A data. In terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), the
   proposed method is evaluated and compared with several other cloud
   removal algorithm.}},

   transmit and receive microstrip patch array antennas, with the receiving
   antenna connected to a power-harvesting half-wave rectifier (rectenna).
   Fresnel region operation enables the fields radiated by the transmitting
   aperture to be localized both in range and cross-range. Using Fresnel
   region focusing, we achieve an increase of 66.8\% in the amount of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we focus on the design and analysis of channel access in
   vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) for event-driven multi-hop safety
   services. First, a novel channel access scheme that incorporates an
   application-level distance (timer)-based rebroadcast is designed to
   enhance the reliability and efficiency of safety message delivery. In
   the scheme, an effective new approach integrating transmitter-oriented
   repetitions, ESD bitmap, message sequence number, and modulo based
   waiting mini-slot is provided to overcome possible concurrent timer due
   among close nodes and possible message collisions in the conventional
   distance-based timer for selection of multi-hop forwarders. The
   reliability and performance of the proposed scheme are analyzed and
   compared with that of other broadcast schemes for VANET event-driven
   safety services on highways. The new analytic models account for the
   impact of the Nakagami fading channel with distance dependent path loss
   and vehicle mobility on the reliability and performance. Extensive
   simulations are conducted to verify the correctness of our proposed
   scheme and models under realistic network parameter settings.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1D) cable model is used to study electrical excitation
   of nerves and muscle fibers, and to aid in the design of electrical
   therapies. However, approximations inherent in the cable model limit its
   validity. More realistic three-dimensional (3D) fiber models have been
   advocated but they require long computational times. This study
   investigates whether better accuracy of 3D models is worth the cost by
   computing the probability p that the difference between outputs from 3D
   and 1D models could have arisen from uncertainties in parameter values.
   The results are summarized in contour maps of probability p in the space
   of fiber-electrode distances and stimulus durations. The cable model is
   considered valid where p > 0.05. This region of validity depends on
   uncertainties in the parameters. In particular, the uncertainties must
   exceed 0.05 (0.02) of the nominal parameter values for the cable model
   to be valid in the regions where retinal (cochlear) implants operate.}},

   develop a scalable variational inference framework, which builds upon
   the ideas of the variational auto-encoder, by allowing latent variables

   real-valued, binary and count data. We show theoretically and with

   benchmark our algorithms on image, text and collaborative filtering

Title = {{Design and Simulation of a Frequency-Diverse Aperture for Imaging of
   Human-Scale Targets}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{We present the design and simulation of a frequency-diverse aperture for
   imaging of human size targets at microwave wavelengths. Predominantly
   relying on a frequency sweep to produce diverse radiation patterns, the
   frequency-diverse aperture provides a path to all-electronic operation,
   sampling a scene without the requirement for mechanical scanning or
   expensive active components. Similar to other computational imaging
   schemes, the frequency diverse aperture removes many hardware
   constraints by placing an increased burden on processing and analysis.
   While proof-of-concept simulations of scaled-down versions of the
   frequency-diverse imager and simple targets can be performed with
   relative ease, the end-to end modeling of a full-size aperture capable
   of fully resolving human-size targets presents many challenges,
   particularly if parametric studies need to be performed during a design
   or optimization phase. Here, we show that an in-house developed
   simulation code can be adapted and parallelized for the rapid design and
   optimization of a full-size, frequency-diverse aperture. Using files of
   human models in stereolithography format, the software can model the
   entire imaging scenario in seconds, including mode generation and
   propagation, scattering from the human model, and measured backscatter.
   We illustrate the performance of several frequency-diverse aperture
   designs using images of human-scale targets reconstructed with various
   algorithms and compare with a conventional synthetic aperture radar
   approach. We demonstrate the potential of one aperture for threat object
   detection in security-screening applications.}},

Abstract = {{The development of atherosclerosis in the aorta is associated with low
   and oscillatory wall shear stress for normal patients. Moreover,
   localized differences in wall shear stress heterogeneity have been
   correlated with the presence of complex plaques in the descending aorta.
   While it is known that coarctation of the aorta can influence indices of
   wall shear stress, it is unclear how the degree of narrowing influences
   resulting patterns. We hypothesized that the degree of coarctation would
   have a strong influence on focal heterogeneity of wall shear stress. To
   test this hypothesis, we modeled the fluid dynamics in a
   patient-specific aorta with varied degrees of coarctation. We first
   validated a massively parallel computational model against experimental
   results for the patient geometry and then evaluated local shear stress
   patterns for a range of degrees of coarctation. Wall shear stress
   patterns at two cross sectional slices prone to develop atherosclerotic
   plaques were evaluated. Levels at different focal regions were compared
   to the conventional measure of average circumferential shear stress to
   enable localized quantification of coarctation-induced shear stress
   alteration. We find that the coarctation degree causes highly
   heterogeneous changes in wall shear stress.}},

   {[}1], {[}2]. Here, we report the in vitro electrical performance of
   five mu ECoG designs undergoing an accelerated aging protocol. The
   impedance and yield of the mu ECoG arrays were tracked over time. The
   equivalent lifetime at 37(omicron)C depended on the manufacturer and
   material stack-up, and ranged between 30 and greater than 760 days
   (ongoing). The main failure modes of these devices were delamination at
   the site of the electrode contact and broken traces due to metal
   dissolution. Based on these in vitro results, we offer several
   recommendations for mu ECoG designs suitable for chronic implantation.}},

Abstract = {{The P300 speller is a brain-computer interface that enables people with
   severe neuromuscular disorders to communicate. It is based on eliciting
   and detecting event-related potentials (ERP) in electroencephalography
   (EEG) measurements, in response to rare target stimulus events. One of
   the challenges to fast and reliable communication is the fact that the
   P300-based ERP has a refractory period that induces temporal dependence
   in the user's EEG responses. Refractory effects negatively affects the
   performance of the speller. The contribution of this paper is to provide
   a model for the P300 speller as a communication process with memory to
   account for refractory effects. Using this model, we design codebooks
   that maximize the mutual information rate between the user's desired
   characters and the measured EEG responses to the stimulus events. We
   show simulation results that compare our codebook with other codebooks
   described in literature.}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed convex optimization problems that involve a
   separable objective function and nontrivial convex local constraints,
   such as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). We propose a decentralized,
   computationally inexpensive algorithm to solve such problems over
   time-varying directed networks of agents, that is based on the concept
   of approximate projections. Our algorithm is one of the consensus based
   methods in that, at every iteration, every agent performs a consensus
   update of its decision variables followed by an optimization step of its
   local objective function and local constraint. Unlike other methods, the
   last step of our method is not a projection to the feasible set, but
   instead a subgradient step in the direction that minimizes the local
   constraint violation. We show that the algorithm converges almost
   surely, i.e., every agent agrees on the same optimal solution, when the
   objective functions and constraint functions are nondifferentiable and
   their subgradients are bounded.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an intermittent communication framework for
   mobile robot networks. Specifically, we consider robots that move along
   the edges of a connected mobility graph and communicate only when they
   meet at the nodes of that graph giving rise to a dynamic communication
   network. Our proposed distributed controllers ensure intermittent
   connectivity of the network and path optimization, simultaneously. We
   show that the intermittent connectivity requirement can be encapsulated
   by a global Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. Then we approximately
   decompose it into local LTL expressions which are then assigned to the
   robots. To avoid conflicting robot behaviors that can occur due to this
   approximate decomposition, we develop a distributed conflict resolution
   scheme that generates non-conflicting discrete motion plans for every
   robot, based on the assigned local LTL expressions, whose composition
   satisfies the global LTL formula. By appropriately introducing delays in
   the execution of the generated motion plans we also show that the
   proposed controllers can be executed asynchronously.}},

   sensors to estimate a collection of hidden states to a user-specified

   hidden states, fuse them in a distributed filter, and plan their next
   views in order to minimize expected uncertainty. This formulation leads
   to an optimization problem with as many coupled LMI constraints as the
   number of hidden states. The network solves this problem by means of a
   new distributed random approximate projections method that is robust to
   the state disagreement errors that will exist among the robots as the
   distributed filter fuses the collected measurements and is
   computationally light enough to handle large numbers of hidden states.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces saddle-point methods for distributed
   continuous-time online convex optimization, where the system objective
   function varies arbitrarily over time subject to some global inequality
   constraints. The overall dynamics of the proposed saddle-point
   controller are described by a system of differential equations, coupled
   linearly through the network Laplacian. The controller pushes actions
   along the negative gradient direction of the objective, constraint
   violation, as well as network disagreement using only causal and locally
   available information, while dynamically adapting the Lagrange
   multipliers in a decentralized fashion. We define regret as the cost
   difference with the optimal action over time. We show that the proposed
   saddle-point controller achieves a regret of order 0(root T) with the
   time horizon T. We also address the impact of the network topology,
   encoded in the spectrum of the network Laplacian, as a factor on the

Abstract = {{Two-player single-controller zero-sum stochastic games are a class of
   zero-sum dynamic games with Markovian state dynamics, where only one
   player controls the state transitions. Design of optimal strategies for
   such games with large state and action spaces relies on computationally
   demanding dynamic programming. Linear programming can also be used, but
   the number of constraints equals the number of states. This paper
   presents a class of simple suboptimal strategies that can be constructed
   by playing a certain repeated static game where neither player observes
   the specific mixed strategies used by the other player at each round. We
   quantify the suboptimality of the resulting strategies and show that,
   when the two players honestly follow the prescribed protocol, each
   player can exploit the regularity or predictability of the moves of the
   other player, and thus speed up convergence to the minimax value.}},

Abstract = {{A shaped power pattern synthesis with reduction of dynamic range ratio
   (DRR) is presented in this paper. Controlling the DRR of the excitations
   for the shaped power pattern synthesis is very useful since it can
   reduce the output power loss and also simplifies the complexity of the
   feeding network design. The synthesis of shaped pattern is typically a
   nonconvex optimization problem. To solve this problem efficiently, we
   formulate the synthesis as Semi-definite relaxation (SDR) form which
   allows to relax some non-convex constraints so as to formulate the
   problem into a convex form. Then it can be efficiently solved using
   readily available toolbox. Finally, numerical example is presented to
   show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Some studies of the influences from typical scene (target, rough
   surface) parameters on the target and rough surface composite
   electromagnetic scattering characteristics are carrying out. The target
   and rough surface with specific type and spectrum cases are considered.
   The composite scattering integral equations are built. The numerical
   hybrid strategies, such as the Propagation-Inside-Layer-Expansion (PILE)
   combined with the Forward-Backward Method (FBM) scheme, etc., are
   applied. The influence from different target parameters, such as, size,
   depth, etc., to the coupling inductions is investigated. The influence
   from different rough surface parameters, such as rms height, correlation
   length etc., to the composite scattering is implemented. The
   experiential and prediction models between typical scattering phenomenon
   and coupling interaction mechansium under different parameters can be
   built and analyzed. The presented studies will make considerable sense
   to the fields of electromagnetics, remote sensing, optics, radar
   surveillance, target recognition, material science, etc..}},

   transistor loaded SRR unit cells is described in which the transistor
   acts as a variable resistor. From the mathematical analysis, we

   experimentally measure two SRRs with tunable quality factors and thus
   tunable bandwidth based upon modulating the effective loading circuit
   resistance to confirm the calculations. From the agreement between the
   calculated and measured transmission coefficients, we expand the

Abstract = {{DNA is a biocompatible scaffold that allows for the design of a variety
   of nanostructures, from straightforward double stranded DNA to more
   complex DNA origami and 3-D structures. By modifying the structures,
   with dyes, nanoparticles, or enzymes, they can be used to create light
   harvesting and energy transfer systems. We have focused on using Forster
   resonance energy transfer (FRET) between organic fluorophores separated
   with nanometer precision based on the DNAs defined positioning. Using
   FRET theory we can control the direction of the energy flow and optimize
   the design parameters to increase the systems efficiency. The design
   parameters include fluorophore selection, separation, number, and
   orientation among others. Additionally the use of bioluminescence
   resonance energy transfer (BRET) allowed the use of chemical energy, as
   opposed to photonic, to activate the systems. Here we discuss a variety
   of systems, such as the longest reported DNA-based molecular photonic
   wires (> 30 nm), dendrimeric light harvesting systems, and semiconductor
   nanocrystals integrated systems where they act as both scaffold and
   antennae for the original excitation. Using a variety of techniques, a
   comparison of different types of structures as well as heterogeneous vs.
   homogenous FRET was realized.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop an intermittent communication framework for
   mobile robot networks. Intermittent communication provides significantly
   more flexibility to the robots to accomplish their tasks compared to
   approaches that enforce communication constraints for all time. We
   consider robots that move along the edges of a mobility graph and
   communicate only when they meet at the nodes of that graph giving rise
   to a dynamic communication network. Assuming that the mobility graph is
   connected, we design distributed controllers for the robots that
   determine meeting times at the vertices of the mobility graph so that
   connectivity of the communication network is ensured over time,
   infinitely often. We show that this requirement can be captured by a
   global Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that forces robots to meet
   infinitely often at the rendezvous points. To generate discrete
   high-level motion plans for all robots that satisfy the LTL expression,
   we propose a novel technique that performs an approximate decomposition
   of the global LTL expression into local LTL expressions and assigns them
   to the robots. Since the approximate decomposition of the global LTL
   formula can result in conflicting robot behaviors, we develop a
   distributed conflict resolution scheme that generates discrete motion
   plans for every robot, based on the assigned local LTL expressions,
   whose composition satisfies the global LTL formula. Computer simulations
   are provided that verify the efficacy of the proposed distributed
   control scheme.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a novel approach to the problem of model-based
   source identification in steady-state transport phenomena given a set of
   noisy measurements. We formulate the problem as an optimization problem
   in function space and utilize the adjoint method to calculate the
   gradient. To obtain a finite dimensional representation of this problem
   we employ proper orthogonal decomposition, which provides a small number
   of basis functions that best approximate the function space in which the
   concentration function lives. Similarly, we parametrize the source
   function by nonlinear tower functions, which allow us to reduce the size
   of the problem from thousands of unknowns to a handful of variables. The
   above approximations give rise to a low dimensional nonlinear
   optimization problem, for which we provide explicit expressions for the
   gradient and Hessian that can be used with available optimization
   techniques to solve for the desired source function. We provide
   simulation results that demonstrate a drastic reduction in computation
   time. At the same time we are able to solve complex advection-diffusion
   problems in non-convex environments.}},

   The results of a laboratory experiment on a volcanic ash pit demonstrate
   that the upper and lower interfaces of a marble slab of 3 cm thickness
   buried at a depth up to 2 m can be clearly imaged. A full waveform
   inversion algorithm based on Born iterative method is applied to invert
   the dielectric properties of the subsurface objects. The preliminary

Abstract = {{Lignite is a reliable raw energy material with abundant supply
   worldwide. However, the efficient use of lignite to generate power
   remains challenging, because lignite exhibits undesirable
   characteristics, including low heating value and high moisture content.
   Despite these disadvantages, the efficiency of lignite-fired power
   plants can be increased by predrying lignite. In this study, a predried
   lignite-fired power plant, which uses steam extracted from steam
   turbines as a heat source to dry lignite, was simulated using Aspen
   Plus. This study then analyzed the performance of the predried
   lignite-fired power plant at rated and partial loads on the basis of the
   thermodynamics principles. This study also examined the influence of
   lignite predrying on the exergy losses and destructions of the power
   plant components. Results indicate that the exergy destructed the
   combustion process decreases significantly because of lignite predrying,
   by 5.78 percentage points. The plant thermal efficiency based on the
   lower heating value of raw lignite relatively increases by 4.35\%. The
   efficiency improvement of the power plant reduces as the load ratio
   decreases, because exergy is destructed in the admission opening, which
   is used to control the pressure of the steam leading to the dryer. The
   integration of the dryer saves energy only when the load ratio is >50\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of blending functions to improve
   nonlinear frequency response predictions for a pendulum system. The
   harmonic balance method is used to generate approximate analytical
   solutions for the amplitude-dependent natural frequency of an unforced
   pendulum, as well as the frequency response behavior of a forced
   pendulum. For both cases, separate results are obtained and compared
   from two different approximations for the sine function: Taylor series
   expansion (evaluated at the stable equilibrium position of the pendulum)
   and Legendre polynomial series expansion (evaluated for the pendulum's
   entire range of motion). The solutions obtained from these two
   approximations feature a classical trade-off, with the Taylor series
   predictions offering superior accuracy at small to moderate amplitudes
   of oscillation, while the Legendre polynomial series predictions offer
   superior accuracy at moderate to large amplitudes of oscillation. We
   propose a method for blending these two results in order to obtain a
   hybrid analytical expression that captures the nonlinear
   amplitude-dependent characteristics of the pendulum system across its.
   entire range of motion, and we validate these results with numerical
   studies and experimentation. We believe that this blending approach
   could also be applied to more complex systems whose dynamics exhibit
   similar nonlinear behavior to the pendulum.}},

Abstract = {{The starting field position is often a deciding factor in an American
   football game. In the case of a defensive stop, a kick, known as a punt,
   is used to give the receiving team afield position that is more
   advantageous to the kicking team when possession changes. The goal of
   the punter is to kick the ball along a desired flight path, where a
   delicate balance between the distance traveled before impact, hang time
   in the air, and the distance traveled after bouncing is favorable for
   the kicking team. However, the punter has only imprecise control over
   the initial conditions, such as the angular velocity, linear velocity,
   and orientation of the football. Due to the highly nonlinear behavior of
   the football, from aerodynamic and impact forces, even small changes in
   initial conditions can produce large changes in the final position of
   the football, but there may be regions of initial conditions with
   relatively consistent results. If punters could target such large
   contiguous regions of initial conditions with desirable football paths,
   they could improve their chances of successful kicks.
   For nonlinear systems, basins of attraction diagrams are often used to
   graphically display the initial conditions that lead to different final
   attractors. In this case, the regions of initial conditions that lead to
   a desirable final field position can be grouped and shown graphically. A
   numerical simulation program was developed including models for
   aerodynamic flight and bouncing of the irregularly shaped football. The
   flight model used fourth order Runge-Kutta integration of the equations
   of motion of the football, including gravitational and aerodynamic
   forces and moments with empirical lift, drag, and yaw coefficients in
   three dimensions. The bounce model was based on an empirical
   two-dimensional coefficient of restitution model that was published in
   the literature. The behavior of a football in flight and during bouncing
   was simulated for a range of initial angular velocities and launch
   angles, and the characteristics of the flight paths were analyzed. The
   characteristics of some regions of initial conditions were relatively
   sensitive to small changes, while other regions were relatively uniform.
   This shows that this approach, with a quantitatively accurate bounce
   model, could be practically applied to develop a guide for punters to
   optimize their kicks. With such a guide and sufficient practice, punters
   could select and target the larger regions of initial conditions that
   produced desirable behavior, which would improve their chances of
   successful punts.}},

Abstract = {{Fault tolerance is used in communication systems to ensure high
   reliability and rapid error recovery. The effectiveness of most
   proactive fault-tolerant mechanism depends on whether anomalies can be
   accurately detected before a failure occurs. However, traditional
   anomaly detection techniques fail to detect ``outliers{''} when the
   monitored data involves temporal measurements and exhibits significantly
   different statistical characteristics for its constituent features. We
   describe the design of an anomaly detector that monitors the time-series
   data of a complex core router system. Anomaly detection techniques are
   compared in terms of their effectiveness for detecting different types
   of anomalies. A feature-categorizing-based hybrid method is proposed to
   overcome the difficulty of detecting anomalies in features with
   different statistical characteristics. Furthermore, a correlation
   analyzer is implemented to remove irrelevant and redundant features.
   Three types of synthetic anomalies, generated using a small amount of
   real data for a commercial telecom system, are used to validate the
   proposed anomaly detector.}},

Abstract = {{A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive platform for
   immunoassays, point-of-care clinical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and
   other laboratory procedures in biochemistry. However, today's DMFBs
   suffer from several limitations, including (i) the lack of integrated
   sensors for real-time detection, (ii) constraints on droplet size and
   the inability to vary droplet volume in a fine-grained manner, and (iii)
   the need for special fabrication processes and the associated
   reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above limitations, DMFBs
   based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been
   proposed recently. Droplet manipulation on MEDA biochips has also been
   experimentally demonstrated. In order to ensure robust fluidic
   operations and high confidence in the outcome of biochemical
   experiments, MEDA biochips must be adequately tested before they can be
   used for bioassay execution. We present an efficient built-in self-test
   (BIST) architecture for MEDA biochips. The proposed BIST architecture
   can effectively detect defects in a MEDA biochip, and faulty microcells
   can be identified. Simulation results based on HSPICE and experiments
   using fabricated MEDA biochips highlight the effectiveness of the
   proposed BIST architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The greater reliance on concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)
   for livestock production presents both environmental challenges and
   opportunities for renewable energy and resource recovery. In this
   article, the design, economics of construction and operation, and
   environmental process performance of an innovative swine waste to
   renewable energy management system are presented and discussed. The
   system was installed at a feeder-to-finish swine CAFO permitted for
   8,640 head of swine. It is comprised of an in-ground 7,600 m(3)
   anaerobic digester that receives the hog manure and generates biogas
   that is used on-site for renewable energy generation in a 65 kW
   microturbine. The effluent of the anaerobic digester is further treated
   biologically in a 4,200 m(3) intermittently aerated basin, providing
   both organics removal and some nitrogen control. Water from that basin
   recharges and flushes the pits in the animal barns. The system has been
   operational for over two years and is efficiently converting swine
   manure to biogas. The biogas production rate typically fluctuates
   seasonally from 350 to 900 m(3) d(-1). The overall chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal are 92\% and
   99\%, respectively, while total nitrogen removal is about 77\% and total
   phosphorous removal is 82\%. Thus far, carbon offset and Renewable
   Energy Certificate (REC) production have averaged 2485 offsets and 385
   RECs per year when running without issue. The overall cost per 1,000 kg
   of steady-state live weight (SSLW) per year was estimated at \$462, a
   value that is competitive as an environmentally superior technology.
   Overall, this large-scale project illustrates the significant potential
   of this system while simultaneously highlighting the important economic
   challenges of waste-to-energy bioprocesses.}},

Title = {{Experimental field studies to measure behavioral responses of cetaceans
   to sonar}},
Journal = {{ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{293-315}},
Abstract = {{Substantial recent progress has been made in directly measuring
   behavioral responses of free-ranging marine mammals to sound using
   controlled exposure experiments. Many studies were motivated by concerns
   about observed and potential negative effects of military sonar,
   including stranding events. Well-established experimental methods and
   increasingly sophisticated technologies have enabled fine-resolution
   measurement of many aspects of baseline behavior and responses to sonar.
   Studies have considered increasingly diverse taxa, but primarily
   odontocete and mysticete cetaceans that are endangered, particularly
   sensitive, or frequently exposed to sonar. This review focuses on recent
   field experiments studying cetacean responses to simulated or actual
   active military sonars in the 1 to 8 kHz band. Overall results
   demonstrate that some individuals of different species display clear yet
   varied responses, some of which have negative implications, while others
   appear to tolerate relatively high levels, although such exposures may
   have other consequences not measured. Responses were highly variable and
   may not be fully predictable with simple acoustic exposure metrics (e.g.
   received sound level). Rather, differences among species and individuals
   along with contextual aspects of exposure (e.g. behavioral state) appear
   to affect response probability. These controlled experiments provide
   critically needed documentation of identified behavioral responses
   occurring upon known sonar exposures, and they directly inform
   regulatory assessments of potential effects. They also inform more
   targeted opportunistic monitoring of potential responses of animals
   during sonar operations and have stimulated adaptations of field methods
   to consider increasingly realistic exposure scenarios and how contextual
   factors such as behavioral state and source proximity influence response
   type and probability.}},

Title = {{Electronic Health Record Analysis via Deep Poisson Factor Models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Abstract = {{Electronic Health Record (EHR) phenotyping utilizes patient data
   captured through normal medical practice, to identify features that may
   represent computational medical phenotypes. These features may be used
   to identify at-risk patients and improve prediction of patient morbidity
   and mortality. We present a novel deep multi-modality architecture for
   EHR analysis (applicable to joint analysis of multiple forms of EHR
   data), based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. Each modality,
   composed of observed counts, is represented as a Poisson distribution,
   parameterized in terms of hidden binary units. Information from
   different modalities is shared via a deep hierarchy of common hidden
   units. Activation of these binary units occurs with probability
   characterized as Bernoulli-Poisson link functions, instead of more
   traditional logistic link functions. In addition, we demonstrate that
   PFA modules can be adapted to discriminative modalities. To compute
   model parameters, we derive efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   inference that scales efficiently, with significant computational gains
   when compared to related models based on logistic link functions. To
   explore the utility of these models, we apply them to a subset of
   patients from the Duke-Durham patient cohort. We identified a cohort of
   over 16,000 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) based on
   diagnosis codes and laboratory tests out of our patient population of
   over 240,000. Examining the common hidden units uniting the PFA modules,
   we identify patient features that represent medical concepts.
   Experiments indicate that our learned features are better able to
   predict mortality and morbidity than clinical features identified
   previously in a large-scale clinical trial.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Abstract = {{We provide a hierarchical Bayesian model for estimating the effects of
   transient drug exposures on a collection of health outcomes, where the
   effects of all drugs on all outcomes are estimated simultaneously. The
   method possesses properties that allow it to handle important challenges
   of dealing with large-scale longitudinal observational databases. In
   particular, this model is a generalization of the self-controlled case
   series (SCCS) method, meaning that certain patient specific baseline
   rates never need to be estimated. Further, this model is formulated with
   layers of latent factors, which substantially reduces the number of
   parameters and helps with interpretability by illuminating latent
   classes of drugs and outcomes. We believe our work is the first to
   consider multivariate SCCS (in the sense of multiple outcomes) and is
   the first to couple latent factor analysis with SCCS. We demonstrate the
   approach by estimating the effects of various time-sensitive insulin
   treatments for diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are currently being used in a variety of
   commercial products and processes, however the material characteristics'
   employed in standard regulatory fate models (e.g. FOCUS surface and
   ground water) do. not fully capture nano-specific behaviours. One such
   instance is the use of partitioning coefficients (e.g. k(oc)) to
   describe fate. ENPs do not reach equilibrium in the way
   ``traditional{''} chemicals do, therefore attachment efficiency (a) is a
   more appropriate measure of adsorption to different surfaces. In this
   study we demonstrate the use of attachment efficiency and collision
   frequency in predicting the fate of PVP-coated silver nanoparticles in
   three model aquatic systems: a wastewater activated sludge unit, river
   and lake. Heteroaggregation with background environmental particles was
   considered removal of ENPs, with the collision rate ((3) defined in
   terms of system (mixing rate; residence time), background particle
   (concentration; size; density) and ENP characteristics (size; density).
   The attachment efficiency (a) was defined in terms of system (ionic
   strength; dissolved organic carbon) and material (surface chemistry)
   characteristics. Complete removal (> 10 order; t(50) 5.25 min) was
   predicted for the activated sludge unit (assuming a residence time of 6
   hr), while 50 \% (t(50) 24.2 hr) and 73 \% (t(50) 88 hr) removal were
   predicted for the river (residence time 24 hr) and lake (residence time
   7 days) systems, respectively. A sensitivity analysis found background
   particle size and concentration, attachment efficiency and residence
   time had the greatest influence on predicted removal. This study
   demonstrates the utility of ENP attachment efficiency in predicting fate
   in the environment, employing both material and system characteristics.
   For this method to be applied as part of a regulatory scheme, a database
   of attachment efficiencies for different surfaces under varied
   conditions (e.g. ionic strength, pH, OM content, etc.) must be
   developed, while typical aquatic and porous systems must be further
   defined and standardized in terms of mixing rate and background material

Abstract = {{Previous studies have defined different types of software bugs based on
   their complexity and reproducibility. Simple bugs, which involve only
   direct factors and are often easy to reproduce, have been called
   ``Bohrbugs{''}, while complex bugs, with at least one indirect factor
   and generally much more difficult to reproduce, were called Mandelbugs.
   Locating Mandelbugs in software is often difficult and expensive during
   the development phase due to their complexity. In this paper we consider
   the relationship between different types of software bugs and the
   average t-way interaction involved in triggering them. Analysis suggests
   that Mandelbugs have a higher interaction strength when triggering their
   faults. This suggests that both direct and indirect factors play a role
   in triggering the fault. By using combinatorial testing methods, we can
   have high assurance of locating Mandelbugs as long as the indirect
   factors are present at the time of testing.}},

Abstract = {{Transient survivability analysis of a virtualized system (VS) is
   critical to the wide deployment of cloud services. The existing research
   of VS availability and/or reliability focused on the steady-state
   analysis. This paper presents a model and the closed-form solutions to
   analyze the survivability of both cloud service and VS after a service
   breakdown occurrence by using continuous-time Markov chain. Service
   breakdown may be caused by software rejuvenation of virtual machine (VM)
   and/or VM monitor (VMM), or caused by VM and/or VMM bugs. The VS applies
   two techniques for improving service survivability: VM failover and live
   VM migration. The proposed model and the defined survivability metrics
   not only enable us to quantitatively assess the system survivability but
   also provide insights on the investment efforts in system recovery
   strategies. Sensitivity analysis through numerical analysis is carried
   out to study the impact of key parameters on system survivability.}},

Abstract = {{The proposed hybrid DGTD method aims to realize hybridization of finite
   difference method with Cartesian grid, spectral element method with
   hexahedron elements, and finite element method with tetrahedron elements
   in time domain based on the DG framework. For homogeneous, smoothly
   inhomogeneous areas and the perfectly matched layer (PML), finite
   difference method is employed to improve the computational efficiency,
   as the staircasing approximation in these areas causes negligible errors
   and moreover Cartesian grid discretization results in fewer numbers of
   unknowns with respect to a tetrahedron mesh. For irregular geometries,
   spectral element or finite element method is utilized by employing
   unstructured mesh to eliminate the staircasing errors. The proposed
   hybrid DGTD method divide the original model into FDTD, buffer and
   SETD/FETD regions. When the buffer and SETD/FETD regions are with large
   DoFs, they can be further split into multiple subdomains to reduce
   computational complexity. To improve the time-marching efficiency, the
   explicit leapfrog (LF) time integration is employed for the FDTD and
   buffer regions, and an implicit Crank-Nicolson (CN) based time
   integration is used for the FETD region. For the SETD region both
   explicit and implicit time integration can apply. Thus, a global
   implicit-explicit time integration is given for the hybrid method.
   Numerical results are shown to demonstrate the accuracy and long-time
   stability of the proposed hybrid method.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles designed with high electric conductivity and magnetic
   permeability are injected into oil reservoir to enhance the tracking of
   the fluid movement. The injection of fluid with nanoparticles will
   displace the original fluid and change the fluid content in the pore
   space, thus changing the electric conductivity and magnetic permeability
   distributions in the flooded zone. The movement of nanoparticles in a
   porous medium can be modeled by solving the flow transport equation and
   the resultant electromagnetic properties distribution can be calculated
   by the effective medium theory. These inhomogeneous electromagnetic
   property distributions will induce secondary electromagnetic fields in
   the receivers which can be modeled by Maxwell's equations. For
   subsurface sensing, in order to be detected, the secondary fields
   measured in the receivers should be above a certain threshold (1\% above
   the primary fields, an empirical value). By injecting the high contrast
   nanoparticles, the conductivity and magnetic permeability of the flooded
   zone will be increased, thus increasing the secondary fields which will
   be more possibly detected. Also the detection range of electromagnetic
   measurements will be larger. With the technique of coupling of the
   dynamic fluid flow and crosswell electromagnetic measurement, we are
   able to analyze the detection range of electromagnetic sensing with high
   contrast nanoparticle injection.}},

Abstract = {{We consider multi-static imaging systems composed of frequency-diverse
   transmitting antenna arrays (or apertures). In these frequency diverse
   imaging modalities, accurate near-field characterization of the antennas
   is vital to achieving imaging. It is shown that considerable
   simplification in system characterization can be achieved without
   compromising the image quality when planar cavity antennas are used,
   because their radiation characteristics can be manufacture repeatable.
   In contrast, it is also demonstrated that the increased complexity of
   antennas utilizing sub-wavelength elements significantly reduces
   fabrication tolerances, making it necessary to characterize the
   metamaterial apertures individually.}},

Abstract = {{A mode-mixing cavity, consisting of an electrically-large rectangular
   cavity with one deformed corner, supports distinct modes as a function
   of driving frequency. Perforating one side of this cavity, the modes
   formed within can be projected into an imaging domain, multiplexing the
   scene's spatial content into backscattered signals that is
   post-processed to obtain high-quality images. While this device has
   shown great promise as a platform for computational imaging at microwave
   frequencies, its premise necessitates a large bandwidth, a requirement
   that complicates circuit design and may not be readily available. In
   this presentation, we propose and report preliminary experimental
   results for a cavity containing a tunable artificial impedance surface
   in one of its walls. By varying the electromagnetic response of the
   cavity's boundary the field distribution within the cavity can be
   altered, thus generating distinct radiation patterns without a large
   bandwidth.}},

Title = {{Multiscale Dictionary Learning: Non-Asymptotic Bounds and Robustness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Abstract = {{High-dimensional datasets are well-approximated by low-dimensional
   structures. Over the past decade, this empirical observation motivated
   the investigation of detection, measurement, and modeling techniques to
   exploit these low-dimensional intrinsic structures, yielding numerous
   implications for high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, and
   signal processing. Manifold learning (where the low-dimensional
   structure is a manifold) and dictionary learning (where the
   low-dimensional structure is the set of sparse linear combinations of
   vectors from a fi nite dictionary) are two prominent theoretical and
   computational frameworks in this area. Despite their ostensible
   distinction, the recently-introduced Geometric Multi-Resolution Analysis
   (GMRA) provides a robust, computationally efficient, multiscale
   procedure for simultaneously learning manifolds and dictionaries.
   In this work, we prove non-asymptotic probabilistic bounds on the
   approximation error of GMRA for a rich class of data-generating
   statistical models that includes ``noisy{''} manifolds, thereby
   establishing the theoretical robustness of the procedure and con firming
   empirical observations. In particular, if a dataset aggregates near a
   low-dimensional manifold, our results show that the approximation error
   of the GMRA is completely independent of the ambient dimension. Our work
   therefore establishes GMRA as a provably fast algorithm for dictionary
   learning with approximation and sparsity guarantees. We include several
   numerical experiments con fi rming these theoretical results, and our
   theoretical framework provides new tools for assessing the behavior of
   manifold learning and dictionary learning procedures on a large class of
   interesting models.}},

Abstract = {{High-dimensional (dimension d > 2) quantum key distribution (QKD)
   protocols that encode information in the temporal degree of freedom
   promise to overcome some of the challenges of qubit-based (d = 2) QKD
   systems. In particular, the long recovery time of single -photon
   detectors and large channel noise at long distance both limit the rate
   at which a final secure key can be generated in a low-dimension QKD
   system. We propose and demonstrate a practical discrete-variable
   time-frequency protocol with d = 4 at a wavelength of 1550 nm, where the
   temporal states are secured by transmitting and detecting their dual
   states under Fourier transformation, known as the frequency -basis
   states, augmented by a decoy-state protocol. We show that the discrete
   temporal and frequency states can be generated and detected using
   commercially-available equipment with high timing and spectral
   efficiency. In our initial experiments, we only have access to detectors
   that have low efficiency (1\%) at 1550 nm. Together with other component
   losses, our system is equivalent to a QKD system with ideal components
   and a50-km-long optical-fiber quantum channel. We find that our system
   maintains a spectral visibility of over 99.0\% with a quantum bit error
   rate of 2.3\%, which is largely due to the finite extinction ratio of
   the intensity modulators used in the transmitter. The estimated secure
   key rate of this system is 7.7 x 10(4) KHz, which should improve
   drastically when we use detectors optimized for 1550 nm.}},

Abstract = {{For any prime power q, Mori and Tanaka introduced a family of q-ary
   polar codes based on q by q Reed-Solomon polarization kerneis. For
   transmission over a q-ary erasure channel, they also derived a
   closed-form recursion for the erasure probability of each effective
   channel. In this paper, we use that expression to analyze the
   finite-Iength scaling of these codes on q-ary erasure channel with
   erasure probability is an element of is an element of(0,1). Our primary
   result is that, for any gamma > 0 and delta > 0, there is a q(0) such
   that, for all q >= q(0), the fraction of effective channels with erasure
   rate at most N-gamma is at least 1 - is an element of - O( N-1/2+delta),
   where N = q(n) is the blocklength. Since the gap to the channel capacity
   1 - is an element of cannot vanish faster than O( N-1/2), this
   establishes near-optimal finite-Iength scaling for this family of codes.

Abstract = {{The question whether RM codes are capacityachieving is a long-standing
   open problem in coding theory that was recently answered in the
   affirmative for transmission over erasure channels {[}1], {[}2].
   Remarkably, the proof does not rely on specific properties of RM codes,
   apart from their symmetry. Indeed, the main technical result consists in
   showing that any sequence of linear codes, with doubly-transitive
   permutation groups, achieves capacity on the memoryless erasure channel
   under bit-MAP decoding. Thus, a natural question is what happens under
   block-MAP decoding. In {[}1], {[}2], by exploiting further symmetries of
   the code, the bit-MAP threshold was shown to be sharp enough so that the
   block erasure probability also converges to 0. However, this technique
   relies heavily on the fact that the transmission is over an erasure
   channel.
   We present an alternative approach to strengthen results regarding the
   bit-MAP threshold to block-MAP thresholds. This approach is based on a
   careful analysis of the weight distribution of RM codes. In particular,
   the flavor of the main result is the following: assume that the bit-MAP
   error probability decays as N-delta, for some delta > 0. Then, the
   block-MAP error probability also converges to 0. This technique applies
   to transmission over any binary memoryless symmetric channel. Thus, it
   can be thought of as a first step in extending the proof that RM codes
   are capacityachieving to the general case.}},

   parametrized family of generalized PCs that recovers some of these codes
   (e.g., staircase and block-wise braided codes) as special cases and
   study the iterative decoding performance over the binary erasure
   channel. Even though our code construction is deterministic (and not
   based on a randomized ensemble), we show that it is still possible to
   rigorously derive the density evolution (DE) equations that govern the
   asymptotic performance. The obtained DE equations are then compared to
   those for a related spatially-coupled PC ensemble. In particular, we
   show that there exists a family of (deterministic) braided codes that
   follows the same DE equation as the ensemble, for any spatial length and
   coupling width.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new method that remotely measures the initial continuous
   current in classical rocket-and-wire triggered lightning using a compact
   dB/dt sensor deployed at 78 m distance from the channel base. The
   current waveform retrieved from the numerical integration of close
   magnetic signals perfectly shows the general feature and all the slow
   variations (such as Mcomponents) embedded in the channel-base current
   measured with a shunt. This method was applied to several
   rocket-triggered lightning flashes in 2014, including one flash
   containing a long continuous current similar to that occurring in
   natural lightning. In comparison with the shunt measurement, the new
   method has the advantage of significantly reduced noise (with the lower
   detection threshold as small as a few mA). Our method could be applied
   to remotely probe the initial continuous current in upward lightning
   from high objects and altitude-triggered lightning, as well as
   continuing current in natural cloud-to-ground lightning strokes at a
   sufficiently close range.}},

Abstract = {{Most state-of-the-art dictionary learning algorithms (DLAs) are
   iterative, and must begin with an initial estimate of the dictionary,
   referred to as the seed. A seed can be generated randomly, but it has
   been shown that choosing a more intelligent seed often yields a better
   solution. For example, a seed inferred using data from a related
   problem, or one hand-crafted based on a priori knowledge of the problem
   at hand can yield better solutions. Seed dictionaries appear to encode
   valuable a priori information however, most DLAs discard the seed after
   initialization. This work investigates the questions of whether the
   information encoded in a good seed can be leveraged further, by
   potentially using the seed to influence learning ether initialization.
   This is achieved by modifying the popular DLA K-SVD to use the seed as a
   prior during learning, by penalizing differences between the learned
   dictionary and the seed. The resulting algorithm referred to as Seed
   Shrinkage Dictionary Learning (SSDL), is examined against K-SVD on image
   denoising experiments using several benchmark images. The results
   indicate that utilizing the seed as a prior in this way consistently
   yields improved denoising performance in our experiments. This simple
   approach motivates the development of more sophisticated approaches that
   leverage a priori information in useful seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in digital-microfluidic biochips have led to miniaturized
   platforms that can implement biomolecular assays. However, these designs
   are not adequate for running multiple sample pathways because they
   consider unrealistic static schedules; hence runtime adaptation based on
   assay outcomes is not supported and only a rigid path of bioassays can
   be run on the chip. We present a design framework that performs fluidic
   task assignment, scheduling, and dynamic decision-making for
   quantitative epigenetics. We first describe our benchtop experimental
   studies to understand the relevance of chromatin structure on the
   regulation of gene function and its relationship to biochip design
   specifications. The proposed method models biochip design in terms of
   real-time multiprocessor scheduling and utilizes a heuristic algorithm
   to solve this NP-hard problem. Simulation results show that the proposed
   algorithm is computationally efficient and it generates effective
   solutions for multiple sample pathways on a resource-limited biochip. We
   also present experimental results using an embedded microcontroller as a
   testbed.}},

Abstract = {{A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology
   platform for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry. However,
   today's DMFBs suffer from several limitations: (i) constraints on
   droplet size and the inability to vary droplet volume in a fine-grained
   manner; (ii) the lack of integrated sensors for real-time detection;
   (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and the associated
   reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above problems, DMFBs based
   on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed
   recently, and droplet manipulation on these devices has been
   experimentally demonstrated. Errors are likely to occur due to defects,
   chip degradation, and the lack of precision inherent in biochemical
   experiments. Therefore, an efficient error-recovery strategy is
   essential to ensure the correctness of assays executed on MEDA biochips.
   By exploiting MEDA-specific advances in droplet sensing, we present a
   novel error-recovery technique to dynamically reconfigure the biochip
   using real-time data provided by on-chip sensors. Local recovery
   strategies based on probabilistic-timed-automata are presented for
   various types of errors. A control flow is also proposed to connect
   local recovery procedures with global error recovery for the complete
   bioassay. Laboratory experiments using a fabricated MEDA chip are used
   to characterize the outcomes of key droplet operations. The PRISM model
   checker and three analytical chemistry benchmarks are used for an
   extensive set of simulations. Our results highlight the effectiveness of
   the proposed error-recovery strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Despite increasing popularity of compliant and underactuated hands, few
   tools are available for modeling them. Thus, we propose a simulation
   technique to predict the success of a compliant gripper grasping
   irregular objects, which could be used in mechanism design as well as
   grasp planning. The simulator we propose integrates joint compliance
   simulation with a Boundary Layer Expanded Mesh (BLEM) technique to
   enhance the stability of contact estimation. We compare the proposed
   simulator with existing simulators via a set of stability and fidelity
   criteria, including contact force variation, contact position variation,
   and contact normal variation. Scores along these criteria are correlated
   with the simulator's accuracy of predicting the success/failure of a
   given grasp pose and preshape. A test set of 13 grasps, with two
   compliant underactuated hands were manually generated on 4 objects.
   Experiments suggest that our simulator leads to improvements in the
   stability criteria, predictability of grasp success, and reduction of
   simulation artifacts.}},

   effectively accelerate the acquisition of common-source GPR datasets.
   The antenna phase center was calibrated to estimate the velocity and
   thickness of both the air gap and asphalt pavement layer, through
   velocity spectrum analysis. Numerical experimental results show that the
   off-ground antenna array is one ideal method for inspecting asphalt
   pavements.}},

Abstract = {{Modern manufacturing systems require fast and effective adaptation to
   fluctuating market conditions and product diversification. This high
   level adaptability can be achieved through the utilization of
   Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS), which should be based on
   modular equipment that is easily integrated, scalable, convertible in
   terms of functionality, and self diagnosable. RMS also necessitate the
   use of a dynamic controller architecture that is distributed, fully
   modular, and self configurable.
   In this paper, we present a control system design approach for
   reconfigurable machine tools through the use of modularized and
   decentralized CNC control. Specifically, we investigate design
   challenges for Plug-n-Play automation systems, where new system
   functionalities, such as adding new axes in existing CNC units, can be
   introduced without significant reconfiguration efforts and downtime
   costs. We propose a fully decentralized motion control architecture
   realized through a network of individual axis control modules.
   Reconfiguration of motion control systems based on this architecture can
   be achieved by only presenting the controller on each axis with
   information about machine configuration and the type of axis. This
   effectively enables modularity, reconfigurability, and interoperability
   of the machine control system. Finally, we present an implementation of
   the decentralized architecture based on the use of a real-time operating
   system, wireless networking, and low-cost ARM Cortex-M3 MCUs; we
   illustrate its effectiveness by considering machining of a standard test
   part defined in ISO 10791-7 using a software-in-the-loop testbed.}},

   introduce a framework for transferring a convolutional neural network
   (CNN), trained on available large collections of labelled natural
   images, to the context of drawings. We retrain both the top and the
   bottom layer of the network, responsible for the high-level
   classification output and the low-level features detection respectively,
   by transforming natural images into drawings. We apply this procedure to
   the drawings in the Jan Brueghel Wiki, and show the transferred CNN
   learns a discriminative metric on drawings and achieves good recognition
   accuracy. We also discuss why standard descriptor-based methods is
   problematic in the context of drawings.}},

   Specifically, using analytical theory and PIC simulations we look into
   three fundamental physical processes and their interplay, which are
   critical to the understanding of spectral control by making the

Abstract = {{Gaze analysis has gained much popularity over the years due to its
   relevance in a wide array of applications, including human-computer
   interaction, fatigue detection, and clinical mental health diagnosis.
   However, accurate gaze estimation from low resolution images outside of
   the lab ( in the wild) still proves to be a challenging task. The new
   Intel low-cost RealSense 3D camera, capable of acquiring sub-millimeter
   resolution depth information, is currently available in laptops, and
   such technology is expected to become ubiquitous in other portable
   devices. In this paper, we focus on low-cost, scalable and real time
   analysis of human gaze using this RealSense camera. We exploit the
   direct measurement of eye surface geometry captured by the RGB-D camera,
   and perform gaze estimation through novel synthesis-based training and
   testing. Furthermore, we synthesize different eye movement appearances
   using a linear approach. From each 3D eye training sample captured by
   the RealSense camera, we synthesize multiple novel 2D views by varying
   the view angle to simulate head motions expected at testing. We then
   learn from the synthesized 2D eye images a gaze regression model using
   regression forests. At testing, for each captured RGB-D eye image, we
   first repeat the same synthesis process. For each synthesized image, we
   estimate the gaze from our gaze regression model, and factor-out the
   associated camera/head motion. In this way, we obtain multiple gaze
   estimations for each RGB-D eye image, and the consensus is adopted. We
   show that this synthesis-based training and testing significantly
   improves the precision in gaze estimation, opening the door to true
   low-cost solutions.}},

   implications for the design of nanocarrier agents and drug delivery
   systems. In this work, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD)
   simulations of the CNPs with vesicles were performed to evaluate the
   effects of hydrophobicity, surface charge density and distribution on
   the curved vesicle membrane. The simulations reveal that there exist
   four distinct modes (insertion, repulsion, adhesion, and penetration) in
   the CNP-vesicle interaction. In contrast to previous studies on a planar
   membrane, the interactions of CNPs and a curved vesicle membrane show
   some novel properties. CNPs with low surface charge density (or neutral
   ones) can penetrate into the interior of the vesicle membrane more
   easily because of the increased membrane tension. The asymmetry between
   two leaflets of the membrane induces different interaction strengths of
   the negatively CNPs with the outer and inner leaflets. After
   penetration, the negatively CNPs prefer to stay close to the inner
   leaflet inside the vesicle where CNPs have stronger interactions with
   their surroundings. In the present work, we analyze the detailed
   mechanism of CNP's spontaneous penetration into vesicles, which is
   rarely mentioned in previous simulations. Moreover, we found that the
   negatively CNPs with the same surface charge density but different
   distribution result in different modes: the homogeneous mode is more
   likely to adsorb on the vesicle surface while the inhomogeneous mode
   tends to be more penetrable. In addition, the flip-flop phenomenon of
   the lipid membrane and the exchanging of water in or out of the vesicle
   were observed during penetration. Our results demonstrate that the
   electrostatic effect plays an essential role in the interaction between
   CNPs and vesicles. These findings suggest a way of controlling the
   CNP-vesicle interaction by coupling the hydrophobic properties, surface
   charge density and distribution of CNPs to enhance the probability of
   CNP's penetration into vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{Reverberation and aberration clutter can significantly degrade the
   ability to image deep abdominal structures in clinical practice. Despite
   increased hardware complexity and computing power, modern ultrasound
   arrays are still commonly limited to a length of several centimeters. We
   hypothesize that using a larger active aperture will improve image
   quality even in the presence of clutter. We use a simulated abdominal
   wall model to study the impact of an extended aperture and analyze both
   the point spread function and lesion imaging performance over a range of
   aperture sizes from 1 cm to 10 cm. Simulations demonstrate improved
   image quality as described by resolution and lesion detectability with
   growing aperture size up to the full extent of the 10 cm aperture.
   Although clutter degrades the overall imaging performance, it does not
   appear to impose a limit on the gains that can be made with increasing
   array size.}},

Abstract = {{The speckle texture in ultrasound images is inherent to the coherent
   beamforming process for diffuse targets and limits the detectability of
   low contrast targets. Speckle compounding takes advantage of the limited
   spatial and frequency correlation of speckle by incoherently averaging
   multiple realizations to reduce the variance and smooth the background
   texture. Conventionally, spatial compounding requires multiple
   transducer positions, multiple transmit firings or splitting the active
   receive aperture. We propose a method to separate multiple decorrelated
   components from within a focused transmit beam in order to overcome
   these limitations. Synthetic aperture focusing methods are used in
   conjunction with a traditional phased array scan to produce multiple
   subimages to be used in spatial compounding. An average 21.7 +/- 5.6 \%
   improvement in contrast- to- noise ratio was observed for small (5-10
   mm) hypoechoic targets in simulation and in vivo liver using the
   proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) measures the elastic properties of
   the liver noninvasively, with application to staging liver fibrosis. To
   make a useful estimate, a shear wave of sufficient amplitude must be
   generated in the liver. Tracking speckle size determines the distance
   over which the wave must be tracked, as speckle bias overwhelms
   estimates made over only a few speckles, but amplitude decays with
   propagation due to geometric spreading and attenuation.
   Single-track-location SWEI (STL-SWEI) has shown promise for eliminating
   speckle bias, and is demonstrated here to yield accurate measurements
   with reduced propagation windows in an in vivo volunteer study. Transmit
   focusing for displacement tracking is demonstrated to be important for

Abstract = {{Momentum created by a high intensity acoustic wave emitted in
   intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse
   (ARFI) imaging sequences is absorbed by the backing material of the
   catheter causing a kickback motion. This study was designed to
   characterize this motion. An elastography phantom was imaged with an 8Fr
   Soundstar (TM) ICE catheter and a 10Fr, 128 element ICE catheter with
   various fulcrum lengths and mechanical steering angles to assess the
   kickback motion. The fulcrum lengths (FLs) varied from 30 mm to 50 mm
   and showed irregularities in the motion in FLs over 40 mm in the 8Fr
   SoundStar (TM), but not in the 10Fr, 128 element ICE catheter. The
   mechanical steering, over the range tested in the 8Fr SoundStar (TM),
   did not have a statistically significant effect on the kickback motion.
   The motion was on the same order of magnitude of the induced
   displacements in both catheters. The kickback motion induces a bias of
   0.5 to 3 mu m to the ARFI images that is not consistent over the ARFI
   imaging ensemble. The current motion filtering techniques that are used
   to remove bulk cardiac or respiratory motion from the induced ARFI
   displacements are not sufficient for removing the kickback motion. In
   some cases, the motion filter increases the present bias. For both
   catheters, failure to properly account for this effect could degrade ICE
   ARFI image quality. New motion filtering techniques are necessary to
   reduce the kickback motion effect on induced displacements during ICE
   ARFI imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Current prostate cancer screening methods involve non-targeted needle
   biopsies and detection of clinically-insignificant lesions that receive
   excessive treatments, exposing patients to unnecessary adverse side
   effects and placing a burden on our health care systems. There is a
   strong clinical need for improved prostate imaging methods that are
   sensitive and specific for clinically-significant prostate cancer
   lesions to guide needle biopsies, target focal treatments, and improve
   overall patient outcomes. In this study, we compared 3D in vivo Acoustic
   Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging with 3 Tesla, endorectal coil,
   multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to correlate the
   ability for each modality to identify clinically-significant prostate
   cancer lesions. We also correlated Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)
   values from Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) MR sequences with ARFI
   indices of suspicion and MR Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data
   Systems (PI-RADS) scores, testing the hypothesis that increased cellular
   density is associated with regions suspicious for prostate cancer in
   ARFI images. Overall, ARFI and mpMR imaging were well-correlated in
   identifying clinically-significant prostate cancer lesions. There were
   several cases where only one of the imaging modalities was able to
   identify the prostate cancer lesion, highlighting the potential to
   further improve prostate cancer lesion detection and localization with a
   fused ARFI: mpMRI imaging system. ADC values were decreased in all
   prostate cancer lesions identified with mpMRI, but there were no obvious
   trends between the absolute ADC values and the ARFI image indices of
   suspicion.}},

Abstract = {{Skin represents a complex structure for the quantification of
   viscoelastic (VE) properties using shear waves. Wave propagation through
   skin has been modeled as propagating both as a Lamb wave and as a
   Rayleigh wave, but both assumptions are limited due to the structure of
   the skin, which is a multi-layered tissue. This complexity of structure
   makes it difficult to accurately assess the relative contributions of
   geometry and viscosity to shear wave dispersion. In this study we used
   finite element modeling (FEM) to simulate the layering and VE properties
   of skin and subcutaneous tissues to assess characteristics of shear wave
   propagation through skin. Results were compared to the expected
   solutions using pure Rayleigh wave or Lamb wave models. From the
   simulation it was established that under most physiological
   circumstances the Lamb wave model is more appropriate than the Rayleigh
   wave model, higher frequencies should be used for viscoelasticity
   characterization, and imaging thicker regions of skin facilitates higher
   accuracy for characterizing its VE properties.}},

   propagation following localized, impulsive excitations and measuring the
   group shear wave speeds V-disp and V-vel determined using the shear wave
   displacement and velocity signals, respectively. The stiffness and
   viscosity are found by analytically solving the equation of motion
   describing shear wave propagation and calculating lookup tables mu(0)
   (V-disp, V-vel) and eta(V-disp, V-vel) to give mu(0) and eta from the
   measured shear wave speeds. Results are presented for three viscoelastic
   phantoms and one approximately elastic phantom. The method is robust
   because group shear wave speeds are easily measured experimentally, the
   lookup tables are relatively insensitive to the size and shape of the
   excitation, and the difference Delta V = V-vel - V-disp gives a first
   order measure of viscosity in the same way that the group shear wave
   speed gives a measure of the material stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic radiation force (ARF) has been used to generate shear waves in
   many different tissues for the purpose of quantifying material
   properties of those tissues. This method has also been applied to
   arteries, but care must be taken in this application because waves
   produced in the arterial wall are guided waves. To obtain accurate
   measurements of mechanical properties of arteries, guided wave inversion
   can be used, where experimental wave dispersion is iteratively matched
   with theoretical dispersion curves. In this paper we study wave
   propagation in three sets of rubber tubes with different mechanical
   properties, and compare their measured and theoretical dispersion
   curves. Three sets of tubes were made with outer diameters of 8 mm and
   wall thicknesses of 1 mm to mimic an adult carotid artery. A different
   rubber mixture was used for each set of tubes, VytaFlex 10, VytaFlex20,
   and ReoFlex 30. Reference samples were also poured for testing with
   hyperfrequency viscoelastic spectroscopy (HFVS) instrument for
   measurement of the material complex modulus. Wave propagation
   measurements were made with a Verasonics system and linear array with
   water inside and surrounding the tubes. Acoustic radiation force was
   used to generate the waves with a 200 mu s push at 4.1 MHz and plane
   wave imaging at a frame rate of 14.9 kHz was used for measuring the
   propagating waves. A two-dimensional Fourier transform method was used
   to extract the dispersion curves from the measured particle velocity.
   Theoretical dispersion curves for flexural modes with circumferential
   wavenumber n = 1, 2, 3 were calculated from the material properties
   measured with HFVS for comparison with the ultrasound-based results. The
   measured dispersion curve matches well with theoretical results.
   However, the match is not with a single theoretical dispersion curve,
   but with different theoretical curves at different frequencies. This new
   approach of matching with multiple theoretical curves can be used for
   better understanding of wave propagation in arterial walls and improved
   characterization of their mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{This research quantitatively estimates stiffness by measuring the
   time-to-peak displacement directly along the acoustic radiation force
   (ARF) axis in contrast to shear wave elasticity imaging (SWEI) that
   measures shear wave velocity at lateral locations. We have shown
   previously in simulation results that an advanced displacement estimator
   reduces variability in the final stiffness estimate. Here, we tested the
   on-axis approach in 10 simulations and 5 phantoms. We created a
   stiffness look-up table of the time-to-peak displacement as a function
   of depth. We generated the look-up table using a 3D FEM model coupled to
   Field II simulations. We evaluated both normalized cross-correlation
   (NCC) and the Bayesian displacement estimator. To evaluate the error of
   the on-axis method as compared to traditional shear wave methods, we
   computed a robust lateral time-of-flight-based shear wave speed and
   converted to a shear modulus for each phantom. The 5 phantoms had a mean
   shear modulus of 1.90 kPa and standard deviation of 0.18 kPa. The root
   mean square error between the lateral method and the on-axis method was
   0.98 kPa for the Bayesian displacement estimator and 1.14 kPa for NCC on
   average in the depth of field. These phantom results show that on-axis
   methods coupled with a Bayesian displacement estimator produce stiffness
   estimates comparable to laterally offset shear wave methods.}},

Title = {{Impacts of coal ash on methylmercury production and the methylating
   microbial community in anaerobic sediment slurries}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Mercury (Hg) associated with coal ash is an environmental concern,
   particularly if the release of coal ash to the environment is associated
   with the conversion of inorganic Hg to methylmercury (MeHg), a
   bioaccumulative form of Hg that is produced by anaerobic microorganisms.
   In this study, sediment slurry microcosm experiments were performed to
   understand how spilled coal ash might influence MeHg production in
   anaerobic sediments of an aquatic ecosystem. Two coal ash types were
   used: (1) a weathered coal ash; and (2) a freshly collected, unweathered
   fly ash that was relatively enriched in sulfate and Hg compared to the
   weathered ash. These ash samples were added to anaerobic sediment
   slurries constructed with a relatively pristine sediment (containing
   0.03 mg kg(-1) Hg) and a Hg-contaminated sediment (containing 0.29 mg
   kg(-1) Hg). The results of these experiments showed negligible net
   production of MeHg in microcosms with no ash and in microcosms amended
   with the low sulfate/low Hg ash. In contrast, slurry microcosms amended
   with high sulfate/high Hg ash showed increases in total MeHg content
   that was 2 to 3 times greater than control microcosms without ash (p <
   0.001). 16S amplicon sequencing of microbial communities in the slurries
   indicated that the coal ash addition generally increased the relative
   abundance of the methylating microbial community, including
   sulfate-reducing bacteria and iron-reducing bacteria species that are
   known to be efficient methylators of Hg. The stimulation of these
   microorganisms was likely caused by the release of substrates (sulfate
   and Fe) originating from the ash. Overall, the results highlight the
   need to incorporate both environmental parameters and coal ash
   characteristics into risk assessments that guide coal ash management and
   disposal.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromuscular diseases are a diverse range of conditions that include
   myopathic and neuropathic disorders related to muscular dysfunction.
   Inherited neuromuscular diseases are the result of a broad spectrum of
   genetic mutations, including point mutations, insertions and deletions,
   chromosomal rearrangements, epigenetic aberrations, and repeat
   expansions or contractions. Targeted genome editing is a promising
   method to correct the inherited mutations underlying these disorders.
   Over the last decade there have been many significant advances in
   engineering targeted DNA-binding proteins to manipulate specific
   sequences of complex genomes. These genome editing tools are rapidly
   becoming viable therapeutics that will allow the targeted addition,
   exchange, or removal of almost any genetic sequence in the human genome.
   In this chapter, selected neuromuscular diseases representing inherited
   myopathies or neuropathies are discussed. The genome editing tools
   available to create targeted genetic modifications are reviewed.
   Promising cell-and gene-based therapies are introduced in the context of
   the treatment of neuromuscular disorders in combination with genome
   editing therapies. Finally, specific examples of how genome editing may
   be applied to correct the genetic basis of particular neuromuscular
   disorders are presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Computer systems are potentially targeted by cybercriminals by means of
   specially crafted malicious software called Advanced Persistent Threats
   (APTs). As a consequence, any security attribute of the computer system
   may be compromised: disruption of service (availability), unauthorized
   data modification (integrity), or exfiltration of sensitive data
   (confidentiality). An APT starts with the exploitation of software
   vulnerability within the system. Thus, vulnerability mitigation
   strategies must be designed and deployed in a timely manner to reduce
   the window of exposure of vulnerable systems. In this paper, we evaluate
   the survivability of a computer system under an APT attack using a
   Markov model. Generation and solution of the Markov model are
   facilitated by means of a high-level formalism based on stochastic Petri
   nets. Survivability metrics are defined to quantify security attributes
   of the system from the public announcement of a software vulnerability
   and during the system recovery. The proposed model and metrics not only
   enable us to quantitatively assess the system survivability in terms of
   security attributes but also provide insights on the cost/revenue
   trade-offs of investment efforts in system recovery such as
   vulnerability mitigation strategies. Sensitivity analysis through
   numerical experiments is carried out to study the impact of key
   parameters on system secure survivability.}},

Abstract = {{On-chip microparticle and cell coating technologies enable a myriad of

   microfluidic coating technologies often rely on magnetic labeling and

   Herein, we introduce an acoustofluidic approach for microparticle and
   cell coating by implementing tilted-angle standing surface acoustic
   waves (taSSAWs) into microchannels with multiple inlets. The primary
   acoustic radiation force generated by the taSSAW field was exploited in
   order to migrate the particles across the microchannel through multiple
   laminar streams, which contained the buffer and coating chemicals. We
   demonstrate effective coating of polystyrene microparticles and HeLa
   cells without the need for magnetic labelling. We characterized the
   coated particles and HeLa cells with fluorescence microscopy and
   scanning electron microscopy. Our acoustofluidic-based particle and cell
   coating method is label-free, biocompatible, and simple. It can be
   useful in the on-chip manufacturing of many functional particles and

Abstract = {{Through-silicon vias (TSVs) are used as high-speed interconnects between
   dies in a 3D System-on-Chip (SoC). However, their speed cannot be
   utilized during test application due to inherent limitations of the scan
   chains of the cores, which prevent the use of high shift frequencies.
   Moreover, due to their high area cost, only a limited number of TSVs can
   be used for test application. As a result, the time needed for
   transferring test data to the cores in multiple dies can be
   considerable. We propose an efficient test-access mechanism (TAM)
   architecture, which exploits the high speed of TSVs to minimize the time
   for testing 3D SoCs. By the means of time-division multiplexing and an
   effective test scheduling method, the proposed TAM architecture offers
   significant savings in test time, TSV count and TAM cost.}},

Abstract = {{Monolithic 3D (M3D) integration is a promising technology that offers
   considerable performance and area benefits. A number of techniques have
   been proposed in the literature for the design and fabrication of M3D
   integrated circuits (ICs). Despite these advances, test challenges have
   remained unexplored. As a first step towards the development of test
   solutions, we analyze electrostatic coupling in M3D ICs and quantify its
   impact on delay testing. We carry out a detailed study of coupling
   between device layers, and quantify the change in threshold voltage of
   transistors in the top layers. Such variations in threshold voltage can
   significantly impact circuit timing. Next, we analyze the impact of
   coupling on the effectiveness of delay-test patterns using the
   statistical delay quality level (SDQL) as a metric. Our results show
   that significant rethinking in test generation is needed to effectively
   screen delay defects in M3D ICs.}},

Abstract = {{Monolithic three-dimensional integrated circuits (M3D ICs) are being
   advocated as the next generation of 3D integration beyond 3D ICs based
   on through-silicon-vias. Testing of the bottom layer of an M3D IC is
   necessary to target defects arising from the layered manufacturing
   process. We present an efficient design-for-test (DfT) method for the
   bottom layer by isolating it from the top layer. A bypass structure
   based on e-fuses is proposed to connect pairs of inter-layer vias
   (ILVs). In order to minimize the wire length between paired ILVs, an
   ILV-pairing problem is formulated and then solved using a technique
   based on maximum-weighted bipartite matching. The independent ILVs,
   i.e., those that are not paired, are made controllable and observable
   using four different types of DfT structures. A cost-optimization
   problem is solved to minimize the DfT cost. We present ILV-pairing and
   cost-optimization results for designs based on the ITC'02 benchmarks as
   well as for an industry design. We also present HSpice simulation
   results to show that testing using e-fuses is feasible.}},

   decoding of these code ensembles over a BMS channel and in the presence
   of a single random burst of erasures. We show that in the limit of code
   length, codewords can be recovered successfully if the length of the
   burst is smaller than some maximum recoverable burst length. We observe
   that the maximum recoverable burst length is practically the same if the
   transmission takes place over binary erasure channel or over binary
   additive white Gaussian channel with the same capacity. Analyzing the
   stopping sets, we also estimate the decoding failure probability (the
   error floor) when the code length is finite.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized product codes (GPCs) are extensions of product codes (PCs)
   where coded bits are protected by two component codes but not
   necessarily arranged in a rectangular array. It has recently been shown
   that there exists a large class of deterministic GPCs (including, e.g.,
   irregular PCs, half-product codes, staircase codes, and certain braided
   codes) for which the asymptotic performance under iterative
   bounded-distance decoding over the binary erasure channel (BEC) can be
   rigorously characterized in terms of a density evolution analysis. In
   this paper, the analysis is extended to the case where transmission
   takes place over parallel BECs with different erasure probabilities. We
   use this model to predict the code performance in a coded modulation
   setup with higher-order signal constellations. We also discuss the
   design of the bit mapper that determines the allocation of the coded
   bits to the modulation bits of the signal constellation.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, sequences of error-correcting codes with doubly-transitive
   permutation groups were shown to achieve capacity on erasure channels
   under symbol-wise maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding. From this, it
   follows that Reed-Muller and primitive narrow-sense BCH codes achieve
   capacity in the same setting. In this article, we extend this result to
   a large family of cyclic codes by considering codes whose permutation
   groups satisfy a condition weaker than double transitivity.
   The article combines two simple technical contributions. First, we show
   that the transition width of a monotone boolean function is O (1 / log
   k), where k is the size of the smallest orbit induced by its symmetry
   group. The proof is based on Talagrand's lower bound on influences for
   monotone boolean functions. Second, we consider the extrinsic
   information transfer (EXIT) function of an F-q-linear cyclic code whose
   blocklength N divides q(t) - 1 and is coprime with q - 1. We show that
   this EXIT function is a monotone boolean function whose symmetry group
   contains no orbits of size smaller than the smallest prime divisor of t.
   Combining these, we show that sequences of cyclic codes, whose
   blocklengths satisfy the above conditions, achieve capacity on the q-ary
   erasure channel if all prime divisors of t tend to infinity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the software reliability analysis of the
   flight software of a recently launched space mission. For our analysis,
   we use the defect reports collected during the flight software
   development. We find that this software was developed in multiple
   releases, each release spanning across all software life-cycle phases.
   We also find that the software releases were developed and tested for
   four different hardware platforms, spanning from off-the-shelf or
   emulation hardware to actual flight hardware. For releases that exhibit
   reliability growth or decay, we fit Software Reliability Growth Models
   (SRGM); otherwise we fit a distribution function. We find that most
   releases exhibit reliability growth, with Log-Logistic (NHPP) and
   S-Shaped (NHPP) as the best-fit SRGMs. For the releases that experience
   reliability decay, we investigate the causes for the same. We find that
   such releases were the first software releases to be tested on a new
   hardware platform, and hence they encountered major hardware integration
   issues. Also such releases seem to have been developed under time
   pressure in order to start testing on the new hardware platform sooner.
   Such releases exhibit poor reliability growth, and hence exhibit high
   predicted failure rate. Other problems include hardware specification
   changes and delivery delays from vendors. Thus, our analysis provides
   critical insights and inputs to the management to improve the software
   development process. As NASA has moved towards a product line
   engineering for its flight software development, software for future
   space missions will be developed in a similar manner and hence the
   analysis results for this mission can be considered as a baseline for
   future flight software missions.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (GPR), as one of the promising non-destructive
   detection and imaging tools, has been popularly applied in various
   fields. In this paper, we present a milti-input and multi-output (MIMO)
   GPR system for subsurface imaging of lunar regolith structure. This
   system is equipped with twelve Vivaldi antennas, each of which can be
   used as transmitter and receiver. Unlike a traditional GPR system, this
   system works in a stationary mode, and would not move along the survey
   line. We developed a two-dimensional reverse time migration algorithm
   for high-resolution subsurface imaging using this MIMO GPR system.
   RTM algorithm mainly consists three steps, i.e. the forward and backward
   modeling of the electromagnetic fields, and the imaging condition. As a
   mature technology, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method
   simulates the transient electromagnetic wave field. Those antennas in
   the computation region are simplified as point sources at corresponding
   position. In the underground area. Cross-correlation of the forward and
   backward electromagnetic fields in the computation domain is used as the
   imaging condition.
   Fig. 1 shows the model for a two-dimensional numerical experiment. Only
   ten antennas are applied in the 2-D RTM algorithm since the other two
   antennas are out of the imaging plane. The relative dielectric
   permittivity and electric conductivity of the lunar soil are
   respectively set to be 2.5 and 0.01 mS/m. Since no prior information
   about the subsurface structure and the buried objects could be obtained,
   a half-space initial model is employed for the 2D RTM. After the image
   reconstruction by RTM, we can clearly identify the buried object as well
   as the air/soil interface, as shown in Fig. 2.
   In the laboratory experiment, as shown in Fig. 3, a marble slab of 60 cm
   x 60 cm is buried at the depth of 2 m in a volcanic ash pit. The
   dielectric properties of the volcanic ash are close to those of lunar
   soil. The relative dielectric permittivity of the volcanic ash is about
   2.5 and the electric conductivity is negligibly small. The thickness and
   relative dielectric permittivity of the marble slab are 3 cm and about
   8, respectively. At the depth of 2.5 m, e.g. the bottom of the ash pit,
   there is a metal plate. A frequency domain filter is applied to the
   acquired three-dimensional laboratory dataset to the two-dimensional
   counterpart required for the 2D RTM. Fig. 4 depicts the RTM result of
   the buried marble slab. We can identify the upper and lower interfaces
   of the slabs, although they are only 3 cm in thickness. This means that
   the MIMO GPR system has a depth resolution better than 3 cm in marble
   rock. Considering the velocity difference in marble and lunar soil, we
   can conclude that the MIMO GPR system has a depth resolution of about 5
   cm in lunar soil.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the problem of estimating the blood oxygen
   concentration in children during surgery. Currently, the oxygen content
   can only be measured through invasive means such as drawing blood from
   the patient. In this work, we attempt to perform estimation by only
   using other non-invasive measurements (e.g., fraction of oxygen in
   inspired air, volume of inspired air) collected during surgery. Although
   models mapping these measurements to blood oxygen content contain
   multiple parameters that vary widely across patients, the non-invasive
   measurements can be used to provide binary information about whether the
   oxygen concentration is rising or dropping. This information can then be
   incorporated in a context-aware filter that is used to combine regular
   continuous measurements with discrete detection events in order to
   improve estimation. We evaluate the filter using real-patient data
   collected over the last decade at the Children's Hospital of
   Philadelphia and show that it is a promising approach for the estimation
   of unobservable physiological variables.}},

Abstract = {{Radiation-induced soft errors are a major reliability concern in
   circuits fabricated at advanced technology nodes. Online soft-error
   vulnerability estimation offers the flexibility of exploiting dynamic
   fault-tolerant mechanisms for cost-effective reliability enhancement. We
   propose a generic run-time method with low area and power overhead to
   predict the soft-error vulnerability of on-chip memory arrays. The
   vulnerability prediction is based on signal probabilities (SPs) of a
   small set of flip-flops, chosen at design time, by studying the
   correlation between the soft-error vulnerability and the flip-flop SPs
   for representative workloads. We exploit machine learning to develop a
   predictive model that can be deployed in the system in software form.
   Simulation results on two processor designs show that the proposed
   technique can accurately estimate the soft-error vulnerability of
   on-chip memory arrays that constitute the instruction cache, the data
   cache, and the register file.}},

Abstract = {{This work describes initial measurements with the CT subsystem of the
   assembled, fully-3D, hybrid SPECT-CT system for dedicated breast
   imaging. The hybrid system, designed for clinical breast imaging,
   consists of fully-flexible SPECT and CT subsystems, with each capable of
   3D acquisition motions. The SPECT subsystem employs a 16 x 20 cm(2) CZT
   detector with 2.5 mm pixellation, is capable of viewing into the chest
   wall in addition to imaging the complete breast volume, and has been
   extensively reported elsewhere. The polar tilting capability of the CT
   subsystem has marked improvement in volumetric sampling while
   eliminating cone beam artifacts due to the fully-3D acquisitions. The CT
   subsystem can also view into the chest wall, while delivering < 5 mGy
   total dose, compared with a simple circular orbit breast CT. The CT
   subsystem consists of a 0.4 mm focal spot x-ray tube with a rotating 14
   degrees W-anode angle, and a 40 x 30 cm(2) CsI(Tl) flat panel imager
   having 127 micron pixellation and 8.0 mm bezel edge, placed on opposing
   ends of the completely suspended gantry. A linear stage mechanism is
   used to tilt the suspended CT gantry up to +/- 15 degrees in the polar
   directions about the 3D center of rotation; the SPECT system is nestled
   inside the suspended CT gantry, oriented perpendicular to the CT
   source-detector pair. Both subsystems rest on an azimuthal rotation
   stage enabling truncated spherical trajectories independently for each.
   Several simple and more complex 3D trajectories were implemented and
   characterized for the CT subsystem. Imaging results demonstrate that
   additional off-axis projection views of various geometric phantoms and
   intact cadaveric breast, facilitated by the polar tilting yield more
   complete breast-volume sampling and markedly improved iteratively
   reconstructed images, especially compared to simple circular orbit data.
   This is the first implementation of a hybrid SPECT-CT system with
   fully-3D positioning for the two subsystems, and could have various
   applications in diagnostic breast imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to direct and sort individual biological and non-biological
   particles into spatially addressable locations is fundamentally
   important to the emerging field of single cell biology. Towards this
   goal, we demonstrate a new class of magnetophoretic transistors, which
   can switch single magnetically labeled cells and magnetic beads between
   different paths in a microfluidic chamber. Compared with prior work on
   magnetophoretic transistors driven by a two-dimensional in-plane
   rotating field, the addition of a vertical magnetic field bias provides
   significant advantages in preventing the formation of particle clumps
   and in better replicating the operating principles of circuits in
   general. However, the three-dimensional driving field requires a
   complete redesign of the magnetic track geometry and switching
   electrodes. We have solved this problem by developing several types of
   transistor geometries which can switch particles between two different
   tracks by either presenting a local energy barrier or by repelling
   magnetic objects away from a given track, hereby denoted as
   ``barrier{''} and ``repulsion{''} transistors, respectively. For both
   types of transistors, we observe complete switching of magnetic objects
   with currents of similar to 40 mA, which is consistent over a range of
   particle sizes (8-15 mu m). The switching efficiency was also tested at
   various magnetic field strengths (50-90 Oe) and driving frequencies
   (0.1-0.6 Hz); however, we again found that the device performance only
   weakly depended on these parameters. These findings support the use of
   these novel transistor geometries to form circuit architectures in which
   cells can be placed in defined locations and retrieved on demand.}},

Title = {{Guidance to improve the scientific value of zetapotential measurements
   in nanoEHS}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-NANO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{953-965}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticle zeta-potentials are relatively easy to measure, and have
   consistently been proposed in guidance documents as a particle property
   that must be included for complete nanoparticle characterization. There
   is also an increasing interest in integrating data collected on
   nanomaterial properties and behavior measured in different systems (e.g.
   in vitro assays, surface water, soil) to identify the properties
   controlling nanomaterial fate and effects, to be able to integrate and
   reuse datasets beyond their original intent, and ultimately to predict
   behaviors of new nanomaterials based on their measured properties (i.e.
   read across), including zeta-potential. Several confounding factors pose
   difficulty in taking, integrating and interpreting this measurement
   consistently. Zeta-potential is a modeled quantity determined from
   measurements of the electrophoretic mobility in a suspension, and its
   value depends on the nanomaterial properties, the solution conditions,
   and the theoretical model applied. The ability to use zeta-potential as
   an explanatory variable for measured behaviors in different systems (or
   potentially to predict specific behaviors) therefore requires robust
   reporting with relevant meta-data for the measurement conditions and the
   model used to convert mobility measurements to zeta-potentials. However,
   there is currently no such standardization for reporting in the nanoEHS
   literature. The objective of this tutorial review is to familiarize the
   nanoEHS research community with the zeta-potential concept and the
   factors that influence its calculated value and interpretation,
   including the effects of adsorbed macromolecules. We also provide
   practical guidance on the precision of measurement, interpretation of
   zeta-potential as an explanatory variable for processes of interest
   (e.g. toxicity, environmental fate), and provide advice for addressing
   common challenges associated with making meaningful zeta-potential
   measurements using commercial instruments. Finally, we provide specific
   guidance on the parameters that need to be reported with zetapotential
   measurements to maximize interpretability and to support scientific
   synthesis across data sets.}},

   dynamics simulation}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{93}},
Pages = {{90388-90396}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of fullerene with biological systems has been an issue
   of great research interest for the past decade. Mechanisms of C-60
   penetrating and disrupting cell membranes have been widely investigated
   but are not fully understood. Here we report on coarse grained molecular
   dynamics (CGMD) simulations of the translocation of monomeric C-60 and a
   fullerene pair across a model DPPC (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine)
   vesicle. Our simulations suggest that monomeric C-60 tends to dwell
   between the head groups of the inner leaflet of the vesicle. This
   characteristic can be verified from the PMF profiles and the
   Lennard-Jones interaction energy analysis. The fullerene pair can enter
   the vesicle membrane as a whole, then disaggregate on a nanosecond
   timescale inside the membrane. To study the toxicity of C-60 on the
   vesicle, the interactions of the fullerene aggregations with the vesicle
   are also examined in our simulations. Small fullerene aggregations can
   penetrate into the vesicle membrane, and do not cause significant
   mechanical damage to the vesicle membrane. However, as the size of the
   aggregations increases to greater than the thickness of the vesicle
   membrane, this can induce a change in the structure of the vesicle
   membrane or even lead to rupture of the vesicle. Our simulations
   describe the mechanism for the interactions of C-60 with the vesicle,
   and point out the potential toxicity of fullerenes on the vesicle. These
   results may provide a useful blue print for drug or gene delivery, and
   improve our understanding of fullerene cytotoxicity.}},

   by developing a micro-structure inspired model, which is then validated
   against a number of different chemo-mechanical experiments on
   calcarenite. The model is shown to provide a flexible framework for
   consistent interpretation of experimental loading paths, and can be
   readily applied to challenging boundary value problems, such as studying
   the stability of slopes exposed to acid rain or predicting the
   effectiveness of CO2 injection in carbonate rocks. The model can be also
   easily extended to materials involving cementation bonds with different

Abstract = {{Carbon nitride-based nanostructures have attracted special attention

   dynamics of these membranes was studied for deformations along their two

   show that g-CN membranes have the lowest ultimate fracture strain value,
   followed by heptazine-based and triazine-based ones, respectively. This
   behavior can be explained in terms of their differences in density
   values, topologies and types of chemical bonds. The dependency of the
   fracture patterns on the stretching directions is also discussed.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{80}},
Abstract = {{We present a new method to fabricate semiconducting, transition metal
   nanoparticles (NPs) with tunable bandgap energies using engineered
   Escherichia coli. These bacteria overexpress the Treponema denticola
   cysteine desulfhydrase gene to facilitate precipitation of cadmium
   sulphide (CdS) NPs. Analysis with transmission electron microscopy,
   X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the
   bacterially precipitated NPs are agglomerates of mostly quantum dots,
   with diameters that can range from 3 to 15 nm, embedded in a carbon-rich
   matrix. Additionally, conditions for bacterial CdS precipitation can be
   tuned to produce NPs with bandgap energies that range from
   quantum-confined to bulk CdS. Furthermore, inducing precipitation at
   different stages of bacterial growth allows for control over whether the
   precipitation occurs intra-or extracellularly. This control can be
   critically important in utilizing bacterial precipitation for the
   environmentally-friendly fabrication of functional, electronic and
   catalytic materials. Notably, the measured photoelectrochemical current
   generated by these NPs is comparable to values reported in the
   literature and higher than that of synthesized chemical bath deposited
   CdS NPs. This suggests that bacterially precipitated CdS NPs have
   potential for applications ranging from photovoltaics to photocatalysis
   in hydrogen evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Operations of critical care departments in health systems are
   increasingly reliant on the availability of interoperable medical
   devices. Many large health care systems have fully transitioned in
   recent years to uniform electronic health record platforms, introducing
   the need for a computing infrastructure at each point of care. As demand
   on national health infrastructures increases, the management of finite
   resources such as capacity to treat in a ward requires thorough
   consideration. We produce a model for evaluating technology-reliant
   intensive care units (ICU) using the extensive Stochastic Reward Net
   formalisms. The technology-reliant model evaluates ICU performance in
   the context of reliance on fallible computer systems and medical
   devices. Technical enhancements to the model specification are discussed
   in relation to the problem context. The final structured model is
   contrasted to the currently employed queuing models, and solved using
   discrete event simulation. We then demonstrate the model's ability to
   quantify several planning decision trade-offs in capacity, the
   probability of meeting varying service demands, and estimating the
   utilization of medical devices. These results motivate continued
   development of the outlined approach, as well as discussion of the
   technical feasibility of SRN solution in relatively large systems of
   practical interest.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise in quantifiable approaches to health care, lessons from
   reliability modeling provide new avenues for improving patient outcomes.
   Describing the development of conditions leading to organ system failure
   provides visceral motivation for quantifying reliability, or project
   outcomes in the face of uncertain disease progression. As prime
   examples, progressive kidney diseases leading to renal failure place
   increasing strain on finite health care resources. We propose a method
   of projecting future health states and cost by means of transient and
   cumulative numeric solutions of a homogeneous continuous time Markov
   chain.
   This publication constructs a model based on the clinical guidelines for
   kidney disease diagnosis, then populates the model with parameters from
   publically available data for the most general-case patient.
   Subsequently the model is solved for measures such as survival rate and
   expected cost incurred by a patient in a one year interval. Utility of
   the method is demonstrated in estimating future patient health and costs
   incurred at an individual level as well as how the results scale for
   practitioners and health care administrators.
   Results for the most general case population are presented, with
   recommendations for tailoring this method to specific patients. Finally
   we contrast this approach to similar studies, highlighting many of the
   common assumptions used in predictive models and in forecasting kidney
   disease prevalence to outline directions for future development of
   personalized models for prognosis.}},

Journal = {{BIOFOULING}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Silicone-oil additives are often used in fouling-release silicone
   coatings to reduce the adhesion strength of barnacles and other
   biofouling organisms. This study follows on from a recently reported
   active approach to detach barnacles, which was based on the surface
   strain of elastomeric materials, by investigating a new, dual-action
   approach to barnacle detachment using Ecoflex (R)-based elastomers
   incorporated with poly(dimethylsiloxane)-based oil additives. The
   experimental results support the hypothesis that silicone-oil additives
   reduce the amount of substratum strain required to detach barnacles. The
   study also de-coupled the two effects of silicone oils (ie
   surface-activity and alteration of the bulk modulus) and examined their
   contributions in reducing barnacle adhesion strength. Further, a finite
   element model based on fracture mechanics was employed to qualitatively
   understand the effects of surface strain and substratum modulus on
   barnacle adhesion strength. The study demonstrates that dynamic
   substratum deformation of elastomers with silicone-oil additives
   provides a bifunctional approach towards management of biofouling by
   barnacles.}},

   case study is presented to illustrate the application of this technique
   to the design of wingtip devices. The optimization model includes two
   objectives: the ratio of drag-lift coefficients, and the wing root
   bending moment coefficient. The solutions obtained are discussed, and a
   Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis is performed to test the robustness of
   the results to uncertainties in the variables. Finally, a winglet
   geometry is suggested to be retrofitted to the base wing, providing an
   increased lift to drag ratio at the expense of increasing the root
   bending moment of the wing.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid biopsies hold enormous promise for the next generation of medical
   diagnoses. At the forefront of this effort, many are seeking to capture,
   enumerate and analyze circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a means to
   prognosticate and develop individualized treatments for cancer.
   Capturing these rare cells, however, represents a major engineering
   challenge due to their low abundance, morphology and heterogeneity. A
   variety of microfluidic tools have been developed to isolate CTCs from
   drawn blood samples; however, few of these approaches offer a means to
   separate and analyze cells in an integrated system. We have developed a
   microfluidic platform comprised of three modules that offers high
   throughput separation of cancer cells from blood and on-chip
   organization of those cells for streamlined analyses. The first module
   uses an acoustic standing wave to rapidly align cells in a contact-free
   manner. The second module then separates magnetically labeled cells from
   unlabeled cells, offering purities exceeding 85\% for cells and 90\% for
   binary mixtures of synthetic particles. Finally, the third module
   contains a spatially periodic array of microwells with underlying
   micromagnets to capture individual cells for on-chip analyses (e.g.,
   staining, imaging and quantification). This array is capable of
   capturing with accuracies exceeding 80\% for magnetically labeled cells
   and 95\% for magnetic particles. Overall, by virtue of its holistic
   processing of complex biological samples, this system has promise for
   the isolation and evaluation of rare cancer cells and can be readily
   extended to address a variety of applications across single cell biology
   and immunology.}},

   growth in a mixture of magnetic and nonmagnetic particles suspended in
   ferrofluid. The growth process is quantified using both a bond order
   parameter and a mean domain size parameter. The largest single crystals
   obtained in experiments consist of approximately 1000 particles and form
   if the area fraction is held between 65-70\% and the field strength is
   kept in the range of 8.5-10.5 Oe. Simulations indicate that much larger
   single crystals containing as many as 5000 particles can be obtained
   under impurity-free conditions within a few hours. If our simulations
   are modified to include impurity concentrations as small as 1-2\%, then
   the results agree quantitatively with the experiments. These findings
   provide an important step toward developing strategies for growing
   single crystals that are large enough to enable follow-on investigations
   across many subdisciplines in condensed matter physics.}},

Abstract = {{The forward-looking ground penetrating radar (FLGPR) is a remote sensing
   modality that has recently been investigated for buried threat
   detection. The FLGPR considered in this work uses stepped frequency
   sensing followed by filtered backprojection to create images of the
   ground, where each image pixel corresponds to the radar energy reflected
   from the subsurface at that location. Typical target detection
   processing begins with a prescreening operation where a small subset of
   spatial locations are chosen to consider for further processing. Image
   statistics, or features, are then extracted around each selected
   location and used for training a machine learning classification
   algorithm. A variety of features have been proposed in the literature
   for use in classification. Thus far, however, predominantly hand-crafted
   or manually designed features from the computer vision literature have
   been employed (e.g., HOG, Gabor filtering, etc.). Recently, it has been
   shown that image features learned directly from data can obtain
   state-of-the-art performance on a variety of problems. In this work we
   employ a feature learning scheme using k-means and a bag-of-visual-words
   model to learn effective features for target and non-target
   discrimination in FLGPR data. Experiments are conducted using several
   lanes of FLGPR data and learned features are compared with several
   previously proposed static features. The results suggest that learned
   features perform comparably, or better, than existing static features.
   Similar to other feature learning results, the features consist of edges
   or texture primitives, revealing which structures in the data are most
   useful for discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology is an effective method of
   detecting buried explosive threats. The system uses a binary classifier
   to distinguish ``targets{''}, or buried threats, from ``nontargets{''}
   arising from system prescreener false alarms; this classifier is trained
   on a dataset of previously-observed buried threat types. However, the
   threat environment is not static, and new threat types that appear must
   be effectively detected even if they are not highly similar to every
   previously-observed type. Gathering a new dataset that includes a new
   threat type is expensive and time-consuming; minimizing the amount of
   new data required to effectively detect the new type is therefore
   valuable. This research aims to reduce the number of training examples
   needed to effectively detect new types using transfer learning, which
   leverages previous learning tasks to accelerate and improve new ones.
   Further, new types have attribute data, such as composition, components,
   construction, and size, which can be observed without GPR and typically
   are not explicitly included in the learning process. Since attribute
   tags for buried threats determine many aspects of their GPR
   representation, a new threat type's attributes can be highly relevant to
   the transfer-learning process. In this work, attribute data is used to
   drive transfer learning, both by using attributes to select relevant
   dataset examples for classifier fusion, and by extending a relevance
   vector machine (RVM) model to perform intelligent attribute clustering
   and selection. Classification performance results for both the
   attribute-only case and the low-data case are presented, using a dataset
   containing a variety of threat types.}},

Abstract = {{Many remote sensing modalities have been developed for buried target
   detection (BTD), each one offering relative advantages over the others.
   There has been interest in combining several modalities into a single
   BTD system that benefits from the advantages of each constituent sensor.
   Recently an approach was developed, called multi-state management (MSM),
   that aims to achieve this goal by separating BTD system operation into
   discrete states, each with different sensor activity and system
   velocity. Additionally, a modeling approach, called Q-MSM, was developed
   to quickly analyze multi-modality BTD systems operating with MSM. This
   work extends previous work by demonstrating how Q-MSM modeling can be
   used to design BTD systems operating with MSM, and to guide research to
   yield the most performance benefits. In this work an MSM system is
   considered that combines a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera and a
   ground penetrating radar (GPR). Experiments are conducted using a
   dataset of real, field-collected, data which demonstrates how the Q-MSM
   model can be used to evaluate performance benefits of altering, or
   improving via research investment, various characteristics of the GPR
   and FLIR systems. Q-MSM permits fast analysis that can determine where
   system improvements will have the greatest impact, and can therefore
   help guide BTD research.}},

Abstract = {{Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a popular remote sensing modality for
   buried threat detection. Many algorithms have been developed to detect
   buried threats using GPR data. One on-going challenge with GPR is the
   detection of very deeply buried targets. In this work a detection
   approach is proposed that improves the detection of very deeply buried
   targets, and interestingly, shallow targets as well. First, it is shown
   that the signal of a target (the target ``signature{''}) is well
   localized in time, and well correlated with the target's burial depth.
   This motivates the proposed approach, where GPR data is split into two
   disjoint subsets: an early and late portion corresponding to the time at
   which shallow and deep target signatures appear, respectively.
   Experiments are conducted on real GPR data using the previously
   published histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) prescreener: a fast
   supervised processing method operated on HOG features. The results show
   substantial improvements in detection of very deeply buried targets
   (4.1\% to 17.2\%) and in overall detection performance (81.1\% to
   83.9\%). Further, it is shown that the performance of the proposed
   approach is relatively insensitive to the time at which the data is
   split. These results suggest that other detection methods may benefit
   from depth-based processing as well.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamics is brief, simple, unambiguous and improving. Yet,
   confusion reigns in the field. The word ``entropy{''} is pasted on
   almost any new thing, without any respect for its proper definition in
   thermodynamics. Every author bows to his own maximum or minimum
   principle, even when it contradicts English, not just thermodynamics.
   Minimizing resistance cannot be the same as maximizing resistance.
   Minimizing entropy generation cannot be the same as maximizing entropy
   generation. Because of the word ``entropy{''}, many believe that entropy
   generation minimization and maximization are covered by the second law,
   which is incorrect, twice. Because for an isolated system (or an
   adiabatic closed system) the second law states that the system entropy
   inventory increases during changes inside the system, many believe that
   the second law accounts for organization, evolution, and the arrow of
   time. This too is incorrect. It is time for a reality check, and this
   means to take a look at nature, at the physics, at the science of all
   the natural things that ``happen{''}. Here then is a review of the few,
   the noble, the laws with which in science we cover the few distinct

Abstract = {{We report the investigation of the self-assembly mechanism of

   Combining experimental and simulation methods, we identify the
   self-assembly pathways in the solution and on the substrates,

   nucleation process to grow into nanofibers. The nanofibers can further
   twist into high-ordered nanofibers with aging. On the substrates,
   peptide amphiphiles form nanofibers and nanosheet structures
   simultaneously. This surface-induced nanosheet consists of rod-like

Abstract = {{Considerable effort has recently been directed towards the
   implementation of molecular bioassays on digital-microfluidic biochips.
   However, today's solutions suffer from the drawback that multiple sample
   pathways are not supported and on-chip reconfigurable devices are not
   efficiently exploited. To overcome this problem, we present a
   spatial-reconfiguration technique that incorporates resource-sharing
   specifications into the synthesis flow. This technique is combined with
   cyberphysical integration to develop the first design-automation
   framework for quantitative gene expression. The proposed framework is
   based on a real-time resource-allocation algorithm that responds
   promptly to decisions about the protocol flow received from a firmware
   layer. Simulation results show that our adaptive framework efficiently
   utilizes on-chip resources to reduce time-to-result without sacrificing
   the chip's lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{User performance in virtual environments with degraded visual conditions
   due to low frame rates is an interesting area of inquiry. Visual content
   shown in a low frame rate simulation has the quality of the original
   image, but persists for an extended period until the next frame is
   displayed (so-called high persistence - HP). An alternative, called low
   persistence (LP), involves displaying the rendered frame for a single
   display frame and blanking the screen while waiting for the next frame
   to be generated. Previous research has evaluated the usefulness of the
   LP technique in low frame rate simulations during a static target
   acquisition task. To gain greater knowledge about the LP technique, we
   have conducted a user study to evaluate user performance and learning
   during a dynamic target acquisition task. The acquisition task was
   evaluated under a high frame rate, (60 fps) condition, a traditional low
   frame rate HP condition (10 fps), and the experimental low frame rate LP
   technique. The task involved the acquisition of targets moving along
   several different trajectories, modeled after a shotgun trap shooting
   task. The results of our study indicate the LP condition approaches high
   frame rate performance within certain classes of target trajectories.
   Interestingly we also see that learning is consistent across conditions,
   indicating that it may not always be necessary to train under a visually
   high frame rate system to learn a particular task. We discuss
   implications of using the LP technique to mitigate low frame rate issues
   as well as its potential usefulness for training in low frame rate
   virtual environments.}},

Abstract = {{Supposing that, in a system operated by two users in different
   positions, it is easier for one of them to perform some operations, we
   developed a 3D User Interface (3DUI) that allows two users to interact
   together with an object, using the three modification operations (scale,
   rotate and translate) to reach a goal. The operations can be performed
   using two augmented reality cubes, which can obtain up to 6 degrees of
   freedom, and every user can select any operation by using a button on
   the keyboard to cycle through them. To the cubes are assigned two
   different points of view: an exocentric view, where the user will stand
   at a given distance from the object, with a point of view similar to the
   one of a human being; and an egocentric view, where the user will stand
   much closer to the object, having the point of view from the object's
   perspective. These points of view are locked to each user, which means
   that one user cannot use both views, just the one assigned to his ID.
   The cameras have a small margin of movement, allowing just a tilt to the
   sides, according to the Oculus's movements. With these features, this
   3DUI aims to test which point of view is better for each operation, and
   how the degrees of freedom should be separated between the users.}},

Abstract = {{Coded aperture X-ray coherent scatter imaging is a novel modality for
   ascertaining the molecular structure of an object. Measurements from
   different spatial locations and spectral channels in the object are
   multiplexed through a radiopaque material (coded aperture) onto the
   detectors. Iterative algorithms such as penalized expectation
   maximization (EM) and fully separable spectrally-grouped edge-preserving
   reconstruction have been proposed to recover the spatially-dependent
   coherent scatter spectral image from the multiplexed measurements. Such
   image recovery methods fall into the category of domain decomposition
   methods since they recover independent pieces of the image at a time.
   Ordered subsets has also been utilized in conjunction with penalized EM
   to accelerate its convergence. Ordered subsets is a range decomposition
   method because it uses parts of the measurements at a time to recover
   the image. In this paper, we analyze domain and range decomposition
   methods as they apply to coded aperture X-ray coherent scatter imaging
   using a spectrally-grouped edge-preserving regularizer and discuss the
   implications of the increased availability of parallel computational
   architecture on the choice of decomposition methods. We present results
   of applying the decomposition methods on experimental coded aperture
   X-ray coherent scatter measurements. Based on the results, an underlying
   observation is that updating different parts of the image or using
   different parts of the measurements in parallel, decreases the rate of
   convergence, whereas using the parts sequentially can accelerate the
   rate of convergence.}},

Abstract = {{Materials with different atomic or molecular structures give rise to
   unique scatter spectra when measured by X-ray diffraction. The details
   of these spectra, though, can vary based on both intrinsic (e.g., degree
   of crystallinity or doping) and extrinsic (e.g., pressure or
   temperature) conditions. While this sensitivity is useful for detailed
   characterizations of the material properties, these dependences make it
   difficult to perform more general classification tasks, such as
   explosives threat detection in aviation security. A number of
   challenges, therefore, currently exist for reliable substance detection
   including the similarity in spectral features among some categories of
   materials combined with spectral feature variations from materials
   processing and environmental factors. These factors complicate the
   creation of a material dictionary and the implementation of conventional
   classification and detection algorithms. Herein, we report on two
   prominent factors that lead to variations in spectral features:
   crystalline texture and temperature variations. Spectral features
   associated with crystalline texture will be described for solid metallic
   sheet, polymer sheet, and metallic, organic, and inorganic powder
   specimens. While liquids are largely immune to texture effects, they are
   susceptible to temperature changes that can modify their density or
   produce phase changes. We will describe in situ temperature dependent
   measurement of aqueous-based commercial goods in the temperature range
   of-20 degrees C to 35 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Rolling Isolation Systems provide a simple and effective means for
   protecting components from horizontal floor vibrations. In these systems
   a platform rolls on four steel balls which, in turn, rest within shallow
   bowls. The trajectories of the balls is uniquely determined by the
   horizontal and rotational components of the rolling platform, and thus
   provides nonholonomic constraints. In general, the bowls are not
   parabolic, so the potential energy function of this system is not
   quadratic. This paper presents the application of Gauss's Principle of
   Least Constraint to the modeling of rolling isolation platforms. The
   equations of motion are described in terms of a redundant set of
   constrained coordinates. Coordinate accelerations are uniquely
   determined at any point in time via Gauss's Principle by solving a
   linearly-constrained quadratic minimization. In the absence of any
   modeled damping, the equations of motion conserve energy. Simulations
   and experiments show that responses are highly sensitive to small
   changes in the initial conditions; peak responses can be predicted only
   statistically.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method for recovering base shear forces of
   building structures with unknown nonlinearities from sparse
   seismic-response measurements of floor accelerations. The method
   requires only direct matrix calculations (factorizations and
   multiplications); no iterative trial-and-error methods are required. The
   method requires a mass matrix, or at least an estimate of the floor
   masses. A stiffness matrix may be used, but is not necessary.
   Essentially, the method operates on a matrix of incomplete measurements
   of floor accelerations. In the special case of complete floor
   measurements of systems with linear dynamics and real modes, the
   principal components of this matrix are the modal responses. In the more
   general case of partial measurements and nonlinear dynamics, the method
   extracts a number of linearly-dependent components from Hankel matrices
   of measured horizontal response accelerations, assembles these
   components row-wise and extracts principal components from the singular
   value decomposition of this large matrix of linearly-dependent
   components. These principal components are then interpolated between
   floors in a way that minimizes the curvature energy of the
   interpolation. This interpolation step can make use of a reduced-order
   stiffness matrix, a backward difference matrix or a central difference
   matrix. The measured and interpolated floor acceleration components at
   all floors are then assembled and multiplied by a mass matrix. A sum (or
   weighted sum) of the resulting vector of inertial forces gives the base
   shear. The proposed algorithm is suitable for linear and nonlinear
   hysteretic structural systems.}},

Abstract = {{The stiffness of the uterine cervix changes during pregnancy,
   significantly softening at term. A pathologically rapid softening can
   result in preterm birth. Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) methods
   can be used to track these changes. Difficulties of in vivo human
   research during pregnancy motivate the study of animal models with
   anatomy and physiology similar to humans. This work presents preliminary
   results of the use of SWEI methods to assess cervical stiffness changes
   during pregnancy in a rhesus macaque non-human primate (NHP) model.
   Pregnant NHP subjects are being scanned during two consecutive menstrual
   cycles before pregnancy and five times between weeks 4 to 23 after
   conception and once two weeks after delivery. Shear waves are remotely
   induced with an Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse excitation within
   regions of interest (ROIs) centered in the uterine end of cervix. Shear
   wave speed (SWS) was quantified with different estimators and at various
   ROI locations to choose the more consistent and precise estimates. From
   25 subjects currently enrolled, 8 have successfully completed the study.
   At late pregnancy, SWS values significantly decreased to less than 40\%
   of their pre-pregnancy values, and recovered two weeks after delivery.

Abstract = {{In the present paper, isolated response curves in a nonlinear system
   consisting of two masses sliding on a horizontal guide are examined.
   Transverse springs are attached to one mass to provide the nonlinear
   restoring force, and a harmonic motion of the complete system is imposed
   by prescribing the displacement of their supports. Numerical simulations
   are carried out to study the conditions of existence of isolated
   solutions, their bifurcations, their merging with the main response
   branch and their basins of attraction. This is achieved using tools
   including nonlinear normal modes, energy balance, harmonic balance-based
   continuation and bifurcation tracking, and global analysis.}},

Title = {{Thermal dosimetry for bladder hyperthermia treatment. An overview}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{417-433}},
Abstract = {{The urinary bladder is a fluid-filled organ. This makes, on the one
   hand, the internal surface of the bladder wall relatively easy to heat
   and ensures in most cases a relatively homogeneous temperature
   distribution; on the other hand the variable volume, organ motion, and
   moving fluid cause artefacts for most non-invasive thermometry methods,
   and require additional efforts in planning accurate thermal treatment of
   bladder cancer. We give an overview of the thermometry methods currently
   used and investigated for hyperthermia treatments of bladder cancer, and
   discuss their advantages and disadvantages within the context of the
   specific disease (muscle-invasive or non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer)
   and the heating technique used. The role of treatment simulation to
   determine the thermal dose delivered is also discussed. Generally
   speaking, invasive measurement methods are more accurate than
   noninvasive methods, but provide more limited spatial information;
   therefore, a combination of both is desirable, preferably supplemented
   by simulations. Current efforts at research and clinical centres
   continue to improve non-invasive thermometry methods and the reliability
   of treatment planning and control software. Due to the challenges in
   measuring temperature across the non-stationary bladder wall and
   surrounding tissues, more research is needed to increase our knowledge
   about the penetration depth and typical heating pattern of the various
   hyperthermia devices, in order to further improve treatments. The
   ability to better determine the delivered thermal dose will enable
   clinicians to investigate the optimal treatment parameters, and
   consequentially, to give better controlled, thus even more reliable and
   effective, thermal treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Despite current knowledge of the myriad physiological effects of vagus
   nerve stimulation (VNS) in various mammalian species (including humans),
   the impact of varying stimulation parameters on nerve recruitment and
   physiological responses is not well understood. We investigated nerve
   recruitment, cardiovascular responses, and skeletal muscle responses to
   different temporal patterns of VNS across 39 combinations of stimulation
   amplitude, frequency, and number of pulses per burst. Anesthetized dogs
   were implanted with stimulating and recording cuff electrodes around the
   cervical vagus nerve, whereas laryngeal electromyogram (EMG) and heart
   rate were recorded. In seven of eight dogs, VNS-evoked bradycardia
   (defined as >= 10\% decrease in heart rate) was achieved by applying
   stimuli at amplitudes equal to or greater than the threshold for
   activating slow B-fibers. Temporally patterned VNS (minimum 5 pulses per
   burst) was sufficient to elicit bradycardia while reducing the
   concomitant activation of laryngeal muscles by more than 50\%. Temporal
   patterns of VNS can be used to modulate heart rate while minimizing
   laryngeal motor fiber activation, and this is a novel approach to reduce
   the side effects produced by VNS.}},

Abstract = {{The aerodynamic force between a bristle pack and a rotor should be
   considered in order to predict the stability of a rotor brush seal
   system. The high pressure flow region in a brush seal makes the
   interaction of bristle pack, leakage flow and rotor complicated. It
   provides a challenge to the study of rotor brush seal system dynamic
   characteristics. To analyze the rotordynamic coefficients of a rotor
   brush seal system, a 3D CFD rotor labyrinth brush seal computational
   model was created using Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions
   coupled with a non-Darcian porous medium model. The results show that
   for the same geometry parameters the radial force rises when the
   pressure ratio increases, the tangential force rises when the pressure
   ratio increases, and the radial force is much greater than the
   tangential force. And the flow leakage will increase when the pressure
   load increases and the mass flow rate increases with the clearance
   increase. Direct and cross-coupled stiffness and direct damping and
   cross-coupled damping under different operating condition are discussed.
   The direct damping and cross-coupled damping both increase when the
   clearance increases. The cross-coupled stiffness will increase when the
   inlet pressure increases.}},

Title = {{Software Calibration of a Frequency-Diverse, Multistatic, Computational
   Imaging System}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{2488-2497}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a technique for calibrating a frequency-diverse,
   multistatic, computational imaging system. A frequency-diverse aperture
   enables an image to be reconstructed primarily from a set of scattered
   field measurements taken over a band of frequencies, avoiding mechanical
   scanning and active components. Since computational imaging systems
   crucially rely on the accuracy of a forward model that relates the
   measured and transmitted fields, deviations of the actual system from
   that model will rapidly degrade imaging performance. Here, we study the
   performance of a computational imaging system at microwave frequencies
   based on a set of frequency-diverse aperture antennas, or panels. We
   propose a calibration scheme that compares the measured versus simulated
   scattered field from a cylinder and calculates a compensating phase
   difference to be applied at each of the panels comprising the system.
   The calibration of the entire system needs be performed only once,
   avoiding a more laborious manual calibration step for each transmitting
   and receiving path. Imaging measurements performed using the system
   confirm the efficacy and importance of the calibration step.}},

   genome engineering to genetic modification in vitro, and clinical trials
   have begun using cells modified by genome editing. Now, promising
   preclinical work is beginning to apply these tools in vivo. This article
   summarizes the development of genome engineering platforms, including
   meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9, and their
   flexibility for precise genetic modifications. The prospects for the
   development of safe and effective viral and nonviral delivery vehicles

Abstract = {{We used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study the roles of
   endocytosis and lysosomal function in uptake and subsequent toxicity of
   silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in vivo. To focus on AgNP uptake and effects
   rather than silver ion (AgNO3) effects, we used a minimally dissolvable
   AgNP, citrate-coated AgNPs (CIT-AgNPs). We found that the
   clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor chlorpromazine reduced the
   toxicity of CIT-AgNPs but not AgNO3. We also tested the sensitivity of
   three endocytosis-deficient mutants (rme-1, rme-6 and rme-8) and two
   lysosomal function deficient mutants (cup-5 and glo-1) as compared to
   wild-type (N2 strain). One of the endocytosis-deficient mutants (rme-6)
   took up less silver and was resistant to the acute toxicity of CIT-AgNPs
   compared to N2s. None of those mutants showed altered sensitivity to
   AgNO3. Lysosome and lysosome-related organelle mutants were more
   sensitive to the growth-inhibiting effects of both CIT-AgNPs and AgNO3.
   Our study provides mechanistic evidence suggesting that early endosome
   formation is necessary for AgNP-induced toxicity in vivo, as rme-6
   mutants were less sensitive to the toxic effects of AgNPs than C.

Abstract = {{Based on lambda/4 resonators, the synthesis design method for a
   miniaturized high-selectivity microstrip quad band bandpass filter (BPF)
   with alternative J/K inverters has been presented. Two dual-band
   lambda/4 stepped impedance resonators (SIRS) are employed to generate
   the 1st and 4th passbands, while the 2nd and 3rd passbands are achieved
   by utilizing four coupled lambda/4 uniform impedance resonators (UIRs).
   Moreover, the alternative J/K inverters form is proposed to create an
   additional cross coupling, resulting in one pair of transmission zeros
   (TZs) at each side of all the four passbands. To verify the validity of
   the proposed method, a quad-band BPF centered at 1.9, 4.1, 4.6 and 6.1
   GHz with respectively fractional bandwidths of 13.7\%, 5.1\%, 5.9\% and
   7.6\% has been designed and fabricated, whose measured results show

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on three-dimensional (3-D) imaging for the human body
   with different postures to enhance the situation awareness ability of
   through-wall radar. First, we design a two-dimensional MIMO array where
   the receiving antennas are uniformly and sparsely arranged in horizontal
   and vertical directions and four time-division multiplexing transmitting
   elements are placed at the four array corners. As a result, the
   equivalent aperture is closed to four times the size of the physical
   array. Second, an identical time-delay wall compensation algorithm
   attached to back-projection algorithm is presented to easily and
   approximately correct the image distortion caused by wall penetration,
   which employs an identical time-delay offset in the whole 3-D
   pixel-to-pixel imaging process to partially balance out multiple
   different focusing time-delay errors corresponding to multiple
   transmit-receive channels in each pixel. Finally, we develop a human
   body model with three typical postures in the FDTD simulation. Based on
   the MIMO array and the timedelay compensation algorithm, the simulated
   images created via the back-projection algorithm clearly provide the
   identifiable posture characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{When imaging with ultrasound through the chest wall, it is not uncommon
   for parts of the array to get blocked by ribs, which can limit the
   acoustic window and significantly impede visualization of the structures
   of interest. With the development of large-aperture, high-element-count,
   2-D arrays and their potential use in transthoracic imaging, detecting
   and compensating for the blocked elements is becoming increasingly
   important.
   We synthesized large coherent 2-D apertures and used them to image a
   point target through excised samples of canine chest wall. Blocked
   elements are detected based on low amplitude of their signals. As a part
   of compensation, blocked elements are turned off on transmit (Tx) and
   receive (Rx), and point-target images are created using: coherent
   summation of the remaining channels, compounding of intercostal
   apertures, and adaptive weighting of the available Tx/Rx channel-pairs
   to recover the desired k-space response. The adaptive compensation
   method also includes a phase aberration correction to ensure that the
   non-blocked Tx/Rx channel pairs are summed coherently.
   To evaluate the methods, we compare the point-spread functions (PSFs)
   and near-field clutter levels for the transcostal and control
   acquisitions. Specifically, applying k-space compensation to the sparse
   aperture data created from the control acquisition reduces sidelobes
   from -6.6 dB to -12 dB. When applied to the transcostal data in
   combination with phase-aberration correction, the same method reduces
   sidelobes only by 3 dB, likely due to significant tissue induced
   acoustic noise. For the transcostal acquisition, turning off blocked
   elements and applying uniform weighting results in maximum clutter
   reduction of 5 dB on average, while the PSF stays intact. Compounding
   reduces clutter by about 3 dB while the k-space compensation increases
   clutter magnitude to the non-compensated levels.}},

Abstract = {{Cells exposed to nanosecond-pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) exhibit a
   wide variety of nonspecific effects, including blebbing, swelling,
   intracellular calcium bursts, apoptotic and necrotic cell death,
   formation of nanopores, and depletion of phosphatidylinositol
   4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to induce activation of the inositol
   trisphosphate/diacylglycerol pathway. While several studies have taken
   place in which multiple pulses were delivered to cells, the effect of
   pulse repetition rate (PRR) is not well understood. To better understand
   the effects of PRR, a laser scanning confocal microscope was used to
   observe CHO-K1 cells exposed to ten 600ns, 200V pulses at varying
   repetition rates (5Hz up to 500KHz) in the presence of either FM 1-43,
   YO-PRO-1, or Propidium Iodide (PI) fluorescent dyes, probes frequently
   used to indicate nanoporation or permeabilization of the plasma
   membrane. Dye uptake was monitored for 30 seconds after pulse
   application at a rate of 1 image/second. In addition, a single long
   pulse of equivalent energy (200V, 6 mu s duration) was applied to test
   the hypothesis that very fast PRR will approximate the biological
   effects of a single long pulse of equal energy. Upon examination of the
   data, we found strong variation in the relationship between PRR and
   uptake in each of the three dyes. In particular, PI uptake showed little
   frequency dependence, FM 1-43 showed a strong inverse relationship
   between frequency and internal cell fluorescence, and YO-PRO-1 exhibited
   a ``threshold{''} point of around 50 KHz, after which the inverse trend
   observed in FM 1-43 was seen to reverse itself. Further, a very high PRR
   of 500 KHz only approximated the biological effects of a single 6 mu s
   pulse in cells stained with YO-PRO-1, suggesting that uptake of
   different dyes may proceed by different physical mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are emerging as promising agents for both
   cancer therapy and CT imaging. AuNPs are delivered to tumors via the
   enhanced permeability and retention effect and they preferentially
   accumulate in close proximity to the tumor blood vessels. AuNPs produce
   low-energy, short-range photoelectrons during external beam radiation
   therapy (RT), boosting dose. This work is focused on understanding how
   tumor vascular permeability is influenced by AuNP-augmented radiation
   therapy (RT), and how this knowledge can potentially improve the
   delivery of additional nanoparticle-based chemotherapeutics. We use dual
   energy (DE) CT to detect accumulation of AuNPs and increased vascular
   permeability to liposomal iodine (i.e. a surrogate for chemotherapeutics
   with liposome encapsulation) following RT. We used sarcoma tumors
   generated in LSL-Kras(G12D); p53(FL/FL) conditional mutant mice. A total
   of n=37 mice were used in this study. The treated mice were injected
   with 20 mg AuNP (0.1 ml/25 g mouse) 24 hours before delivery of 5 Gy RT
   (n=5), 10 Gy RT (n=3) or 20 Gy RT (n=6). The control mice received no
   AuNP injection and either no RT (n=6), 5 Gy RT (n=3), 10 Gy RT (n=3), 20
   Gy RT (n=11). Twenty four hours post-RT, the mice were injected with
   liposomal iodine (0.3 ml/25 mouse) and imaged with DE-CT three days
   later. The results suggest that independent of any AuNP usage, RT levels
   of 10 Gy and 20 Gy increase the permeability of tumor vasculature to
   liposomal iodine and that the increase in permeability is
   dose-dependent. We found that the effect of RT on vasculature may
   already be at its maximum response i.e. saturated at 20 Gy, and
   therefore the addition of AuNPs had almost no added benefit. Similarly,
   at 5 Gy RT, our data suggests that there was no effect of AuNP
   augmentation on tumor vascular permeability. However, by using AuNPs
   with 10 Gy RT, we observed an increase in the vascular permeability,
   however this is not yet statistically significant due to the small
   number of mice in these groups. Such an approach can be used together
   with a liposomal drug delivery system to increase specific tumor
   delivery of chemotherapeutics. Our method has the potential to
   significantly improve tumor therapy and reduce the side effects from
   both RT and chemotherapy.}},

   patient size and scan coverage. The conversion coefficients have been
   previously estimated for routine body protocol classes, grouped by scan
   coverage, across an adult population for fixed tube current modulated
   CT. The coefficients, however, do not include the widely utilized tube
   current (mA) modulation scheme, which significantly impacts organ dose.
   This study aims to extend the h factors and the corresponding dose
   length product (DLP) to create effective dose conversion coefficients
   (kfactor) database incorporating various tube current modulation
   strengths. Fifty-eight extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantoms were
   included in this study representing population anatomy variation in
   clinical practice. Four mA profiles, representing weak to strong mA
   dependency on body attenuation, were generated for each phantom and
   protocol class. A validated Monte Carlo program was used to simulate the
   organ dose. The organ dose and effective dose was further normalized by
   CTDIvol and DLP to derive the h factors and k factors, respectively. The
   h factors and k factors were summarized in an exponential regression
   model as a function of body size. Such a population-based mathematical
   model can provide a comprehensive organ dose estimation given body size
   and CTDIvol. The model was integrated into an iPhone app XCATdose
   version 2, enhancing the 1st version based upon fixed tube current
   modulation. With the organ dose calculator, physicists, physicians, and
   patients can conveniently estimate organ dose.}},

Abstract = {{In thoracic CT, organ-based tube current modulation (OTCM) reduces
   breast dose by lowering the tube current in the 120 anterior dose
   reduction zone of patients. However, in practice the breasts usually
   expand to an angle larger than the dose reduction zone. This work aims
   to simulate a breast positioning technique (BPT) to constrain the breast
   tissue to within the dose reduction zone for OTCM and to evaluate the
   corresponding potential reduction in breast dose. Thirteen female
   anthropomorphic computational phantoms were studied (age range: 27-65
   y.o., weight range: 52-105.8 kg). Each phantom was modeled in the supine
   position with and without application of the BPT. Attenuation-based tube
   current (ATCM, reference mA) was generated by a ray-tracing program,
   taking into account the patient attenuation change in the longitudinal
   and angular plane (CAREDose4D, Siemens Healthcare). OTCM was generated
   by reducing the mA to 20\% between 60 anterior of the patient and
   increasing the mA in the remaining projections correspondingly (X-CARE,
   Siemens Healthcare) to maintain the mean tube current. Breast tissue
   dose was estimated using a validated Monte Carlo program for a
   commercial scanner (SOMATOM Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare).
   Compared to standard tube current modulation, breast dose was
   significantly reduced using OTCM by 19.8 +/- 4.7\%. With the BPT, breast
   dose was reduced by an additional 20.4 +/- 6.5\% to 37.1 +/- 6.9\%,
   using the same CTDIvoi. BPT was more effective for phantoms simulating
   women with larger breasts with the average breast dose reduction of
   30.2\%, 39.2\%, and 49.2\% from OTCMBP to ATCM, using the same CTDIvol
   for phantoms with 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 kg breasts, respectively. This study
   shows that a specially designed BPT improves the effectiveness of OTCM.}},

Abstract = {{Reader studies are important in assessing breast imaging systems. The
   purpose of this work was to assess task-based perfounance of full field
   digital mammography (FFDM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and
   synthetic mammography (SM) using different phantom types, and to
   determine an accurate observer model for human readers.
   Images were acquired on a Hologic Selenia Dimensions system with a
   unifoun and anthropomorphic phantom. A contrast detail insert of small,
   low-contrast disks was created using an inkjet printer with iodine-doped
   ink and inserted in the phantoms. The disks varied in diameter from 210
   to 630 mu m, and in contrast from 1.1\% contrast to 2.2\% in regular
   increments. Human and model observers performed a 4-alternative forced
   choice experiment. The models were a non-prewhitening matched filter
   with eye model (NPWE) and a channelized Hotelling observer with either
   Gabor channels (Gabor-CHO) or Laguerre-Gauss channels (LG-CHO).
   With the given phantoms, reader scores were higher in FFDM and DBT than
   SM. The structure in the phantom background had a bigger impact on
   outcome for DBT than for FFDM or SM. All three model observers showed
   good correlation with humans in the unifoun background, with p between
   0.89 and 0.93. However, in the structured background, only the CHOs had
   high correlation, with p=0.92 for Gabor-CHO, 0.90 for LG-CHO, and 0.77
   for NPWE.
   Because results of any analysis can depend on the phantom structure,
   conclusions of modality perfounance may need to be taken in the context
   of an appropriate model observer and a realistic phantom.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that conventional x-ray imaging provides a maximum contrast
   between cancerous and healthy fibroglandular breast tissues of 3\% based
   on their linear x-ray attenuation coefficients at 17.5 keV, whereas
   coherent scatter signal provides a maximum contrast of 19\% based on
   their differential coherent scatter cross sections. Therefore in order
   to exploit this potential contrast, we seek to evaluate the performance
   of a coded aperture coherent scatter imaging system for breast cancer
   detection and investigate its accuracy using Monte Carlo simulations. In
   the simulations we modeled our experimental system, which consists of a
   raster-scanned pencil beam of x-rays, a bismuth-tin coded aperture mask
   comprised of a repeating slit pattern with 2-mm periodicity, and a
   linear-array of 128 detector pixels with 6.5-keV energy resolution. The
   breast tissue that was scanned comprised a 3-cm sample taken from a
   patient-based XCAT breast phantom containing a tomosynthesis-based
   realistic simulated lesion. The differential coherent scatter cross
   section was reconstructed at each pixel in the image using an iterative
   reconstruction algorithm. Each pixel in the reconstructed image was then
   classified as being either air or the type of breast tissue with which
   its normalized reconstructed differential coherent scatter cross section
   had the highest correlation coefficient.
   Comparison of the final tissue classification results with the ground
   truth image showed that the coded aperture imaging technique has a
   cancerous pixel detection sensitivity (correct identification of
   cancerous pixels), specificity (correctly ruling out healthy pixels as
   not being cancer) and accuracy of 92.4\%, 91.9\% and 92.0\%,
   respectively. Our Monte Carlo evaluation of our experimental coded
   aperture coherent scatter imaging system shows that it is able to
   exploit the greater contrast available from coherently scattered x-rays
   to increase the accuracy of detecting cancerous regions within the
   breast.}},

Abstract = {{Although digital mammography has reduced breast cancer mortality by
   approximately 30\%, sensitivity and specificity are still far from
   perfect. In particular, the performance of mammography is especially
   limited for women with dense breast tissue. Two out of every three
   biopsies performed in the U.S. are unnecessary, thereby resulting in
   increased patient anxiety, pain, and possible complications. One
   promising tomographic breast imaging method that has recently been
   approved by the FDA is dedicated breast computed tomography (BCT).
   However, visualizing lesions with BCT can still be challenging for women
   with dense breast tissue due to the minimal contrast for lesions
   surrounded by fibroglandular tissue. In recent years there has been
   renewed interest in improving lesion conspicuity in x-ray breast imaging
   by administration of an iodinated contrast agent. Due to the fully 3-D
   imaging nature of BCT, as well as sub-optimal contrast enhancement while
   the breast is under compression with mammography and breast
   tomosynthesis, dedicated BCT of the uncompressed breast is likely to
   offer the best solution for injected contrast-enhanced x-ray breast
   imaging. It is well known that use of statistically-based iterative
   reconstruction in CT results in improved image quality at lower
   radiation dose. Here we investigate possible improvements in image
   reconstruction for BCT, by optimizing free regularization parameter in
   method of maximum likelihood and comparing its performance with clinical
   cone-beam filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Coded aperture X-ray diffraction (coherent scatter spectral) imaging
   provides fast and dose-efficient measurements of the molecular structure
   of an object. The information provided is spatially-dependent and
   material specific, and can be utilized in medical applications requiring
   material discrimination, such as tumor imaging. However, current coded
   aperture coherent scatter spectral imaging system assume a uniformly or
   weakly attenuating object, and are plagued by image degradation due to
   non-uniform self-attenuation. We propose accounting for such
   non-uniformities in the self-attenuation by utilizing an X-ray computed
   tomography (CT) image (reconstructed attenuation map). In particular, we
   present an iterative algorithm for coherent scatter spectral image
   reconstruction, which incorporates the attenuation map, at different
   stages, resulting in more accurate coherent scatter spectral images in
   comparison to their uncorrected counterpart. The algorithm is based on a
   spectrally grouped edge-preserving regularizer, where the neighborhood
   edge weights are determined by spatial distances and attenuation values.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to develop and compare two methods of inserting
   computerized virtual lesions into CT datasets. 24 physical (synthetic)
   nodules of three sizes and four morphologies were inserted into an
   anthropomorphic chest phantom (LUNGMAN, KYOTO KAGAKU). The phantom was
   scanned (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare) with and without
   nodules present, and images were reconstructed with filtered back
   projection and iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) at 0.6 mm slice
   thickness using a standard thoracic CT protocol at multiple dose
   settings. Virtual 3D CAD models based on the physical nodules were
   virtually inserted (accounting for the system MTF) into the nodule-free
   CT data using two techniques. These techniques include projection-based
   and image-based insertion. Nodule volumes were estimated using a
   commercial segmentation tool (iNtuition, TeraRecon, Inc.). Differences
   were tested using paired t-tests and R-2 goodness of fit between the
   virtually and physically inserted nodules. Both insertion techniques
   resulted in nodule volumes very similar to the real nodules (<3\%
   difference) and in most cases the differences were not statistically
   significant. Also, R-2 values were all >0.97 for both insertion
   techniques. These data imply that these techniques can confidently be
   used as a means of inserting virtual nodules in CT datasets. These
   techniques can be instrumental in building hybrid CT datasets composed
   of patient images with virtually inserted nodules.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop a 3D quantification technique
   to assess the impact of imaging system on depiction of lesion
   morphology. Regional Hausdorff Distance (RHD) was computed from two 3D
   volumes: virtual mesh models of synthetic nodules or ``virtual
   nodules{''} and CT images of physical nodules or ``physical nodules{''}.
   The method can be described in following steps. First, the synthetic
   nodule was inserted into anthropomorphic Kyoto thorax phantom and
   scanned in a Siemens scanner (Flash). Then, nodule was segmented from
   the image. Second, in order to match the orientation of the nodule, the
   digital models of the ``virtual{''} and ``physical{''} nodules were both
   geometrically translated to the origin. Then, the ``physical{''} was
   gradually rotated at incremental 10 degrees. Third, the Hausdorff
   Distance was calculated from each pair of ``virtual{''} and
   ``physical{''} nodules. The minimum HD value represented the most
   matching pair. Finally, the 3D RHD map and the distribution of RHD were
   computed for the matched pair. The technique was scalarized using the
   FWHM of the RHD distribution. The analysis was conducted for various
   shapes (spherical, lobular, elliptical, and speculated) of nodules. The
   calculated FWHM values of RHD distribution for the 8-mm spherical,
   lobular, elliptical, and speculated ``virtual{''} and ``physical{''}
   nodules were 0.23, 0.42, 0.33, and 0.49, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to substantiate the interdependency of
   image quality, radiation dose, and contrast material dose in CT towards
   the patient-specific optimization of the imaging protocols. The study
   deployed two phantom platfouns. First, a variable sized phantom
   containing an iodinated insert was imaged on a representative CT scanner
   at multiple CTDI values. The contrast and noise were measured from the
   reconstructed images for each phantom diameter. Linearly related to
   iodine-concentration, contrast to noise ratio (CNR), was calculated for
   different iodine-concentration levels. Second, the analysis was extended
   to a recently developed suit of 58 virtual human models (5D-XCAT) with
   added contrast dynamics. Emulating a contrast-enhanced abdominal image
   procedure and targeting a peak-enhancement in aorta, each XCAT phantom
   was ``imaged{''} using a CT simulation platfoun. 3D surfaces for each
   patient/size established the relationship between iodine-concentration,
   dose, and CNR. The Sensitivity of Ratio (SR), defined as ratio of change
   in iodine-concentration versus dose to yield a constant change in CNR
   was calculated and compared at high and low radiation dose for both
   phantom platfouns. The results show that sensitivity of CNR to iodine
   concentration is larger at high radiation dose (up to 73\%). The SR
   results were highly affected by radiation dose metric; CTDI or organ
   dose. Furthermore, results showed that the presence of contrast material
   could have a profound impact on optimization results (up to 45\%).}},

Abstract = {{Currently computed tomography (CT) dosimetry relies on CT dose index
   (CTDI) and size specific dose estimates (SSDE). Organ dose is a better
   metric of radiation burden. However, organ dose estimation requires
   precise knowledge of organ locations. Regional imparted energy and dose
   can also be used to quantify radiation burden. Estimating the imparted
   energy from CT exams is beneficial in that it does not require precise
   estimates of the organ size or location. This work investigated an
   automated technique for retrospectively estimating the imparted energy
   from chest and abdominopelvic tube current modulated (TCM) CT exams
   Monte Carlo simulations of chest and abdominopelvic TCM CT examinations
   across various tube potentials and TCM strengths were performed on 58
   adult computational extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantoms to develop
   relationships between scanned mass and imparted energy normalized by
   dose length product (DLP). An automated algorithm for calculating the
   scanned patient volume was further developed using an open source mesh
   generation toolbox. The scanned patient volume was then used to estimate
   the scanned mass accounting for diverse density within the scan region.
   The scanned mass and DLP from the exam were used to estimate the
   imparted energy to the patient using the knowledgebase developed from
   the Monte Carlo simulations. Patient-specific imparted energy estimates
   were made from 20 chest and 20 abdominopelvic clinical CT exams The
   average imparted energy was 274 +/- 141 mJ and 681 +/- 376 mJ for the
   chest and abdominopelvic exams, respectively. This method can be used to
   estimate the regional imparted energy and/or regional dose in chest and
   abdominopelvic TCM CT exams across clinical operations.}},

Abstract = {{Physical phantoms are needed for the evaluation and optimization of new
   digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) systems. Previously, we developed an
   anthropomorphic phantom based on human subject breast CT data and
   fabricated using commercial 3D printing. We now present three key
   advancements: voxelized 3D printing, photopolymer material doping, and
   2D inkjet printing of lesion inserts. First, we bypassed the printer's
   control software in order to print in voxelized form instead of
   conventional STL surfaces, thus improving resolution and allowing
   dithering to mix the two photopolymer materials into arbitrary
   proportions. We demonstrated ability to print details as small as 150 mu
   m, and dithering to combine VeroWhitePlus and TangoPlus in 10\%
   increments. Second, to address the limited attenuation difference among
   commercial photopolymers, we evaluated a beta sample from Stratasys with
   increased TiO2 doping concentration up to 2.5\%, which corresponded to
   98\% breast density. By spanning 36\% to 98\% breast density, this
   doubles our previous contrast. Third, using inkjet printers modified to
   print with iopamidol, we created 2D lesion patterns on paper that can be
   sandwiched into the phantom. Inkjet printing has advantages of being
   inexpensive and easy, and more contrast can be delivered through
   overprinting. Printing resolution was maintained at 210 lam horizontally
   and 330 lam vertically even after 10 overprints. Contrast increased
   linearly with overprinting at 0.7\% per overprint. Together, these three
   new features provide the basis for creating a new anthropomorphic
   physical breast phantom with improved resolution and contrast, as well
   as the ability to insert 2D lesions for task-based assessment of
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{In x-ray computed tomography (CT), task-based image quality studies are
   typically performed using uniform background phantoms with low-contrast
   signals. Such studies may have limited clinical relevancy for modern
   non-linear CT systems due to possible influence of background texture on
   image quality. The purpose of this study was to design and implement
   anatomically informed textured phantoms for task-based assessment of
   low-contrast detection. Liver volumes were segmented from 23 abdominal
   CT cases. The volumes were characterized in terns of texture features
   from gray-level co-occurrence and run-length matrices. Using a 3D
   clustered lumpy background (CLB) model, a fitting technique based on a
   genetic optimization algorithm was used to find the CLB parameters that
   were most reflective of the liver textures, accounting for CT system
   factors of spatial blurring and noise. With the modeled background
   texture as a guide, a cylinder phantom (165 mm in diameter and 30 mm
   height) was designed, containing 20 low-contrast spherical signals (6 mm
   in diameter at targeted contrast levels of similar to 3.2, 5.2, 7.2, 10,
   and 14 HU, 4 repeats per signal). The phantom was voxelized and input
   into a commercial multi-material 3D printer (Object Connex 350), with
   custom software for voxel-based printing. Using principles of digital
   half-toning and dithering, the 3D printer was programmed to distribute
   two base materials (VeroWhite and TangoPlus, nominal voxel size of
   42x84x30 microns) to achieve the targeted spatial distribution of x-ray
   attenuation properties. The phantom was used for task-based image
   quality assessment of a clinically available iterative reconstruction
   algorithm (Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction, SAFIRE) using a
   channelized Hotelling observer paradigm. Images of the textured phantom
   and a corresponding uniform phantom were acquired at six dose levels and
   observer model performance was estimated for each condition (5 contrasts
   x 6 doses x 2 reconstructions x 2 backgrounds = 120 total conditions).
   Based on the observer model results, the dose reduction potential of
   SAFIRE was computed and compared between the uniform and textured
   phantom. The dose reduction potential of SAFIRE was found to be 23\%
   based on the uniform phantom and 17\% based on the textured phantom.
   This discrepancy demonstrates the need to consider background texture
   when assessing non-linear reconstruction algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The use of multiphoton interactions in biological tissue for imaging
   contrast requires highly sensitive optical measurements. These often
   involve signal processing and filtering steps between the photodetector
   and the data acquisition device, such as photon counting and lock-in
   amplification. These steps can be implemented as real-time digital
   signal processing (DSP) elements on field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
   devices, an approach that affords much greater flexibility than
   commercial photon counting or lock-in devices. We will present progress
   toward developing two new FPGA-based DSP devices for multiphoton and
   time-resolved microscopy applications. The first is a high-speed
   multi-harmonic lock-in amplifier for transient absorption microscopy,
   which is being developed for real-time analysis of the
   intensity-dependence of melanin, with applications in vivo and ex vivo
   (noninvasive histopathology of melanoma and pigmented lesions). The
   second device is a kHz lock-in amplifier running on a low cost
   (\$50--\$200) development platform. It is our hope that these FPGA-based
   DSP devices will enable new, high-speed, low-cost applications in
   multiphoton and time-resolved microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Ophthalmic surgeons manipulate micron-scale tissues using stereopsis
   through an operating microscope and instrument shadowing for depth
   perception. While ophthalmic microsurgery has benefitted from rapid
   advances in instrumentation and techniques, the basic principles of the
   stereo operating microscope have not changed since the 1930's. Optical
   Coherence Tomography (OCT) has revolutionized ophthalmic imaging and is
   now the gold standard for preoperative and postoperative evaluation of
   most retinal and many corneal procedures. We and others have developed
   initial microscope-integrated OCT (MIOCT) systems for concurrent OCT and
   operating microscope imaging, but these are limited to 2D real-time
   imaging and require offline post-processing for 3D rendering and
   visualization. Our previously presented 4D MIOCT system can record and
   display the 3D surgical field stereoscopically through the microscope
   oculars using a dual-channel heads-up display (HUD) at up to 10
   micron-scale volumes per second. In this work, we show that 4D MIOCT
   guidance improves the accuracy of depth-based microsurgical maneuvers
   (with statistical significance) in mock surgery trials in a wet lab
   environment. Additionally, 4D MIOCT was successfully performed in 38/45
   (84\%) posterior and 14/14 (100\%) anterior eye human surgeries, and
   revealed previously unrecognized lesions that were invisible through the
   operating microscope. These lesions, such as residual and potentially
   damaging retinal deformation during pathologic membrane peeling, were
   visualized in real-time by the surgeon. Our integrated system provides
   an enhanced 4D surgical visualization platform that can improve current
   ophthalmic surgical practice and may help develop and refine future
   microsurgical techniques.}},

Title = {{Bifurcation Observation of Combining Spiral Gear Transmission Based on
   Parameter Domain Structure Analysis}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{This study considers the bifurcation evolutions for a combining spiral
   gear transmission through parameter domain structure analysis. The
   system nonlinear vibration equations are created with piecewise backlash
   and general errors. Gill's numerical integration algorithm is
   implemented in calculating the vibration equation sets. Based on
   cell-mapping method (CMM), two-dimensional dynamic domain planes have
   been developed and primarily focused on the parameters of backlash,
   transmission error, mesh frequency and damping ratio, and so forth.
   Solution demonstrates that Period-doubling bifurcation happens as the
   mesh frequency increases; moreover nonlinear discontinuous jump breaks
   the periodic orbit and also turns the periodic state into chaos
   suddenly. In transmission error planes, three cell groups which are
   Period-1, Period-4, and Chaos have been observed, and the boundary cells
   are the sensitive areas to dynamic response. Considering the parameter
   planes which consist of damping ratio associated with backlash,
   transmission error, mesh stiffness, and external load, the solution
   domain structure reveals that the system step into chaos undergoes
   Period-doubling cascade with Period-2(m) (m: integer) periodic regions.
   Direct simulations to obtain the bifurcation diagram and largest
   Lyapunov exponent (LE) match satisfactorily with the parameter domain
   solutions.}},

Title = {{A GENERAL APPROACH TO ENHANCE SLOPE LIMITERS IN MUSCL SCHEMES ON
   NONUNIFORM RECTILINEAR GRIDS}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{A789-A813}},
Abstract = {{Most slope limiter functions in high-resolution finite volume methods to
   solve hyperbolic conservation laws are designed assuming one-dimensional
   uniform grids, and they are also used to compute slope limiters in
   computations on nonuniform rectilinear grids. However, this strategy may
   lead to either loss of the total variation diminishing (TVD) stability
   for one-dimensional linear problems or loss of formal second-order
   accuracy if the grid is highly nonuniform. This is especially true when
   the limiter function is not piecewise linear. Numerical evidence is
   provided to support this argument for two popular finite volume
   strategies: monotonic upstream-centered scheme for conservation laws in
   space and method of lines in time (MUSCL-MOL) and capacity-form
   differencing. In order to deal with this issue, this paper presents a
   general approach to study and enhance the slope limiter functions for
   highly nonuniform grids in the MUSCL-MOL framework. This approach
   extends the classical reconstruct-evolve-project procedure to general
   grids, and it gives sufficient conditions for a slope limiter function
   leading to a TVD stable, formal second-order accuracy in space, and
   symmetry-preserving numerical scheme on arbitrary grids. Several widely
   used limiter functions, including the smooth ones by van Leer and van
   Albada, are enhanced to satisfy these conditions. These properties are
   confirmed by solving various one-dimensional and two-dimensional
   benchmark problems using the enhanced limiters on highly nonuniform
   rectilinear grids.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic biology has grown tremendously over the past fifteen years. It
   represents a new strategy to develop biological understanding and holds
   great promise for diverse practical applications. Engineering of a gene
   circuit typically involves computational design of the circuit,
   selection of circuit components, and test and optimization of circuit
   functions. A fundamental challenge in this process is the predictable
   control of circuit function due to multiple layers of biological
   uncertainties. These uncertainties can arise from different sources. We

Title = {{Design and implementation of coded aperture coherent scatter spectral
   imaging of cancerous and healthy breast tissue samples}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{A scatter imaging technique for the differentiation of cancerous and
   healthy breast tissue in a heterogeneous sample is introduced in this
   work. Such a technique has potential utility in intraoperative margin
   assessment during lumpectomy procedures. In this work, we investigate
   the feasibility of the imaging method for tumor classification using
   Monte Carlo simulations and physical experiments. The coded aperture
   coherent scatter spectral imaging technique was used to reconstruct
   three-dimensional (3-D) images of breast tissue samples acquired through
   a single-position snapshot acquisition, without rotation as is required
   in coherent scatter computed tomography. We perform a quantitative
   assessment of the accuracy of the cancerous voxel classification using
   Monte Carlo simulations of the imaging system; describe our experimental
   implementation of coded aperture scatter imaging; show the reconstructed
   images of the breast tissue samples; and present segmentations of the
   3-D images in order to identify the cancerous and healthy tissue in the
   samples. From the Monte Carlo simulations, we find that coded aperture
   scatter imaging is able to reconstruct images of the samples and
   identify the distribution of cancerous and healthy tissues (i.e.,
   fibroglandular, adipose, or a mix of the two) inside them with a
   cancerous voxel identification sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of
   92.4\%, 91.9\%, and 92.0\%, respectively. From the experimental results,
   we find that the technique is able to identify cancerous and healthy
   tissue samples and reconstruct differential coherent scatter cross
   sections that are highly correlated with those measured by other groups
   using x-ray diffraction. Coded aperture scatter imaging has the
   potential to provide scatter images that automatically differentiate
   cancerous and healthy tissue inside samples within a time on the order
   of a minute per slice. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{We describe the development of a highly tunable, physiologically stable,
   and ultra-bright Raman probe, named as TARGET (Tunable and Amplified
   Raman Gold Nanoprobes for Effective Tracking), for in vitro and in vivo
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) applications. The TARGET
   structure consists of a gold core inside a larger gold shell with a
   tunable interstitial gap similar to a ``nanorattle{''} structure. The
   combination of galvanic replacement and the seed mediated growth method
   was employed to load Raman reporter molecules and subsequently close the
   pores to prevent leaking and degradation of reporters under
   physiologically extreme conditions. Precise tuning of the core-shell gap
   width, core size, and shell thickness allows us to modulate the
   plasmonic effect and achieve a maximum electric-field (E-field)
   intensity. The interstitial gap of TARGET nanoprobes can be designed to
   exhibit a plasmon absorption band at 785 nm, which is in resonance with
   the dye absorption maximum and lies in the ``tissue optical window{''},
   resulting in ultra-bright SERS signals for in vivo studies. The results
   of in vivo measurements of TARGETs in laboratory mice illustrated the
   usefulness of these nanoprobes for medical sensing and imaging.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of Sparse or Thinned Linear and Planar Arrays Generating
   Reconfigurable Multiple Real Patterns by Iterative Linear Programming}},
Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},

Abstract = {{It is shown in this paper that the problem of reducing the number of
   elements for multiple-pattern arrays can be solved by a sequence of
   reweighted l(1) optimizations under multiple linear constraints. To do
   so, conjugate symmetric excitations are assumed so that the upper and
   lower bounds for each pattern can be formulated as linear inequality
   constraints. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary variable for each
   element to define the common upper bound of both the real and imaginary
   parts of multiple excitations for different patterns, so that only
   linear inequality constraints are required. The objective function
   minimizes the reweighted l(1)-norm of these auxiliary variables for all
   elements. Thus, the proposed method can be efficiently implemented by
   the iterative linear programming. For multiple desired patterns, the
   proposed method can select the common elements with multiple set of
   optimized amplitudes and phases, consequently reducing the number of
   elements. The radiation characteristics for each pattern, such as the
   mainlobe shape, response ripple, sidelobe level and nulling region, can
   be accurately controlled. Several synthesis examples for linear array,
   rectangular/triangular-grid and randomly spaced planar arrays are
   presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the
   reduction of the number of elements.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Diabetic Retinopathy and Pan-Retinal Photocoagulation on
   Photoreceptor Cell Function as Assessed by Dark Adaptometry}},
Journal = {{INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY \& VISUAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The pathophysiology of vision loss in persons with diabetic
   retinopathy (DR) is complex and incompletely defined. We hypothesized
   that retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and rod and cone photoreceptor
   dysfunction, as measured by dark adaptometry, would increase with
   severity of DR, and that pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) would
   exacerbate this dysfunction.
   METHODS. Dark adaptation (DA) was measured in subjects with diabetes
   mellitus and healthy controls. Dark adaptation was measured at 58
   superior to the fovea following a flash bleach, and the data were
   analyzed to yield cone and rod sensitivity curves. Retinal layer
   thicknesses were quantified using spectral-domain optical coherence
   tomography (OCT).
   RESULTS. The sample consisted of 23 controls and 73 diabetic subjects.
   Subjects with moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)
   exhibited significant impairment of rod recovery rate compared with
   control subjects (P = 0.04). Cone sensitivity was impaired in subjects
   with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (type 1 diabetes mellitus
   {[}T1DM]: P = 0.0047; type 2 diabetes mellitus {[}T2DM]: P < 0.001).
   Subjects with untreated PDR compared with subjects treated with PRP
   exhibited similar rod recovery rates and cone sensitivities. Thinner RPE
   as assessed by OCT was associated with slower rod recovery and lower
   cone sensitivity, and thinner photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment
   layer was associated with lower cone sensitivity.
   CONCLUSIONS. The results suggest that RPE and photoreceptor cell
   dysfunction, as assessed by cone sensitivity level and rod-and
   RPE-mediated dark adaptation, progresses with worsening DR, and rod
   recovery dysfunction occurs earlier than cone dysfunction. Function was
   preserved following PRP. The findings suggest multiple defects in
   retinoid function and provide potential points to improve visual
   function in persons with PDR.}},

   Systems}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{This article focuses on the design of safe and attack-resilient
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) equipped with multiple sensors measuring
   the same physical variable. A malicious attacker may be able to disrupt
   system performance through compromising a subset of these sensors.
   Consequently, we develop a precise and resilient sensor fusion algorithm
   that combines the data received from all sensors by taking into account
   their specified precisions. In particular, we note that in the presence
   of a shared bus, in which messages are broadcast to all nodes in the
   network, the attacker's impact depends on what sensors he has seen
   before sending the corrupted measurements. Therefore, we explore the
   effects of communication schedules on the performance of sensor fusion
   and provide theoretical and experimental results advocating for the use
   of the Ascending schedule, which orders sensor transmissions according
   to their precision starting from the most precise. In addition, to
   improve the accuracy of the sensor fusion algorithm, we consider the
   dynamics of the system in order to incorporate past measurements at the
   current time. Possible ways of mapping sensor measurement history are
   investigated in the article and are compared in terms of the confidence
   in the final output of the sensor fusion. We show that the precision of
   the algorithm using history is never worse than the no-history one,
   while the benefits may be significant. Furthermore, we utilize the
   complementary properties of the two methods and show that their
   combination results in a more precise and resilient algorithm. Finally,
   we validate our approach in simulation and experiments on a real
   unmanned ground robot.}},

Abstract = {{We present the design of a tunable metamaterial element that can serve
   as the building block for a dynamically reconfigurable aperture. The
   element-a complimentary electric-LC (cELC) resonator-is patterned into
   the upper conductor of a microstrip transmission line, providing both a
   means of exciting the radiating metamaterial element as well as
   independent access for biasing circuitry. PIN diodes are connected
   across the capacitive gaps of the cELC, and a dc bias current is used to
   switch the junction between conducting and insulating states. The
   leakage of RF signal through the bias line is mitigated by integration
   of a radial decoupling stub. The proposed design and operation of the
   element are demonstrated through full-wave electromagnetic simulations.
   We discuss the potential application of the cELC element as a building
   block for metamaterial apertures capable of dynamic beamforming,
   imaging, or security screening applications.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT MOLECULAR MEDICINE}},

Pages = {{83-90}},
Abstract = {{Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most potent and
   perilous diseases known, with a median survival rate of 3-5 months due
   to the combination of only advanced stage diagnosis and ineffective
   therapeutic options. Metformin (1,1-Dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride),
   the leading drug used for type 2 diabetes mellitus, emerges as a
   potential therapy for PDAC and other human cancers. Metformin exerts its
   anticancer action via a variety of adenosine monophosphate
   (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)dependent and/or AMPK-independent
   mechanisms. We present data here showing that metformin down-regulated
   pancreatic transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1),
   suggesting a potential novel mechanism by which metformin exerts its
   anticancer action. Metformin inhibited PDX-1 expression at both protein
   and mRNA levels and PDX-1 transactivity as well in PDAC cells.
   Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was identified as a
   PDX-1-interacting protein by antibody array screening in GFP-PDX-1
   stable HEK293 cells. Co-transfection of ERK1 with PDX-1 resulted in an
   enhanced PDX-1 expression in HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
   Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting analysis confirmed the ERK-PDX-1
   interaction in PANC-1 cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF).
   EGF induced an enhanced PDX-1 expression in PANC-1 cells and this
   stimulation was inhibited by MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Metformin
   inhibited EGF-stimulated PDX-1 expression with an accompanied inhibition
   of ERK kinase activation in PANC-1 cells. Taken together, our studies
   show that PDX-1 is a potential novel target for metformin in PDAC cells
   and that metformin may exert its anticancer action in PDAC by
   down-regulating PDX-1 via a mechanism involving inhibition of ERK
   signaling.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) generally involves tumor
   excision with a wide margin. Although advances in fluorescence imaging
   make real-time detection of cancer possible, removal is limited by the
   precision of the human eye and hand. Here, we describe a novel pulsed
   Nd:YAG laser ablation system that, when used in conjunction with a
   previously described molecular imaging system, can identify and ablate
   cancer in vivo. Mice with primary STS were injected with the
   protease-activatable probe LUM015 to label tumors. Resected tissues from
   the mice were then imaged and treated with the laser using the paired
   fluorescence-imaging/laser ablation device, generating ablation clefts
   with sub-millimeter precision and minimal underlying tissue damage.
   Laser ablation was guided by fluorescence to target tumor tissues,
   avoiding normal structures. The selective ablation of tumor implants in
   vivo improved recurrence-free survival after tumor resection in a cohort
   of 14 mice compared to 12 mice that received no ablative therapy. This
   prototype system has the potential to be modified so that it can be used
   during surgery to improve recurrence-free survival in patients with
   cancer.}},

Title = {{Optimization of 3D Digital Microfluidic Biochips for the Multiplexed
   Polymerase Chain Reaction}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology
   platform for revolutionizing immunoassays, clinical diagnostics, drug
   discovery, DNA sequencing, and other laboratory procedures in
   biochemistry. In most of these applications, real-time polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) is an indispensable step for amplifying specific DNA
   segments. To reduce the reaction time to meet the requirement of
   ``real-time{''} applications, multiplexed PCR is widely utilized. In
   recent years, three-dimensional (3D) DMFBs that integrate photodetectors
   (i.e., cyberphysical DMFBs) have been developed, which offer the
   benefits of smaller size, higher sensitivity, and faster result
   generations. However, current DMFB design methods target optimization in
   only two dimensions, thus ignoring the 3D two-layer structure of a DMFB.
   Furthermore, these techniques ignore practical constraints related to
   the interference between on-chip device pairs, the performance-critical
   PCR thermal loop, and the physical size of devices. Moreover, some
   practical issues in real scenarios are not stressed (e.g., the avoidance
   of the cross-contamination for multiplexed PCR). In this article, we
   describe an optimization solution for a 3D DMFB and present a
   three-stage algorithm to realize a compact 3D PCR chip layout, which
   includes: (i) PCR thermal-loop optimization, (ii) 3D global placement
   based on Strong-Push-Weak-Pull (SPWP) model, and (iii) constraint-aware
   legalization. To avoid cross-contamination between different DNA
   samples, we also propose a Minimum-Cost-Maximum-Flow-based (MCMF-based)
   method for reservoir assignment. Simulation results for four laboratory
   protocols demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for the
   design and optimization of a 3D chip for multiplexed real-time PCR.}},

Title = {{Population of 224 realistic human subject-based computational breast
   phantoms}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To create a database of highly realistic and anatomically
   variable 3D virtual breast phantoms based on dedicated breast computed
   tomography (bCT) data.
   Methods: A tissue classification and segmentation algorithm was used to
   create realistic and detailed 3D computational breast phantoms based on
   230+ dedicated bCT datasets from normal human subjects. The breast
   volume was identified using a coarse three-class fuzzy C-means
   segmentation algorithm which accounted for and removed motion blur at
   the breast periphery. Noise in the bCT data was reduced through
   application of a postreconstruction 3D bilateral filter. A 3D adipose
   nonuniformity (bias field) correction was then applied followed by
   glandular segmentation using a 3D bias-corrected fuzzy C-means
   algorithm. Multiple tissue classes were defined including skin, adipose,
   and several fractional glandular densities. Following segmentation, a
   skin mask was produced which preserved the interdigitated skin, adipose,
   and glandular boundaries of the skin interior. Finally, surface modeling
   was used to produce digital phantoms with methods complementary to the
   XCAT suite of digital human phantoms.
   Results: After rejecting some datasets due to artifacts, 224 virtual
   breast phantoms were created which emulate the complex breast parenchyma
   of actual human subjects. The volume breast density (with skin) ranged
   from 5.5\% to 66.3\% with a mean value of 25.3\% +/- 13.2\%. Breast
   volumes ranged from 25.0 to 2099.6 ml with a mean value of 716.3 +/-
   386.5 ml. Three breast phantoms were selected for imaging with digital
   compression (using finite element modeling) and simple ray-tracing, and
   the results show promise in their potential to produce realistic
   simulated mammograms.
   Conclusions: This work provides a new population of 224 breast phantoms
   based on in vivo bCT data for imaging research. Compared to previous
   studies based on only a few prototype cases, this dataset provides a
   rich source of new cases spanning a wide range of breast types, volumes,
   densities, and parenchymal patterns. (C) 2016 American Association of

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The objectives of this study were (a) to devise a technique for
   measuring quantum noise in clinical body computed tomography (CT) images
   and (b) to develop a model for predicting that noise with high accuracy.
   Methods: The study included 83 clinical image sets at two dose levels
   (clinical and 50\% reduced dose levels). The quantum noise in clinical
   images was measured by subtracting sequential slices and filtering out
   edges. Noise was then measured in the resultant uniform area. The noise
   measurement technique was validated using 17 clinical image cases and a
   turkey phantom. With a validated method to measure noise in clinical
   images, this noise was predicted by establishing the correlation between
   water-equivalent diameter (Dw) and noise in a variable-sized phantom and
   ascribing a noise level to the patient based on Dw estimated from CT
   image. The accuracy of this prediction model was validated using 66
   clinical image sets.
   Results: The error in noise measurement was within 1.5 HU across two
   reconstruction algorithms. In terms of noise prediction, across the 83
   clinical image sets, the average discrepancies between predicted and
   measured noise were 6.9\% and 6.6\% for adaptive statistical iterative
   reconstruction and filtered back projection reconstruction,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: This study proposed a practically applicable method to
   assess quantum noise in clinical images. The image-based measurement
   technique enables automatic quality control monitoring of image noise in
   clinical practice. Further, a phantom-based model can accurately predict
   quantum noise level in patient images. The prediction model can be used
   to quantitatively optimize individual protocol to achieve targeted noise
   level in clinical images. (C) 2016 American Association of Physicists in

   implemented by using the complex multiplication, the fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) and the nonuniform FFT (NUFFT). The implementation, the
   cross-term, the computational cost, and the antinoise performance are
   analyzed for the GDT-based ISAR imaging algorithm. With the synthetic
   data and the real radar data, comparisons with other three
   representative ISAR imaging algorithms demonstrate that the GDT-based
   ISAR imaging algorithm can acquire a higher antinoise performance and a
   better cross-term suppression with a moderate computational cost. In
   addition, with discussions of the characteristics, the generalities and
   the implementation methods for the SPIAF and the GDT, we indicate that
   these two new techniques may be applied in more realistic applications.}},

Abstract = {{A number of atmospheric surface layer (ASL) experiments reported a k(-1)
   scaling in air temperature spectra E-TT(k) at low wavenumber k but other
   experiments did not. Occurrence of this scaling law in E-TT(k) in an
   idealized ASL flow across a wide range of atmospheric stability regimes
   is investigated theoretically and experimentally using measurements
   collected above a lake and a grass surface. Experiments reveal a k(-1)
   scaling persisted across different atmospheric stability parameter
   values () ranging from mildly unstable to mildly stable conditions (-0.1
   < < 0.2). As instability increases, the k(-1) scaling vanishes. Based on
   simplified spectral and co-spectral budgets and using a Heisenberg eddy
   viscosity as a closure to the spectral flux transfer term, conditions
   promoting a k(-1) scaling in E-TT(k) are identified. Existence of a
   k(-1) scaling is shown to be primarily linked to an imbalance between
   the production and dissipation rates of half the temperature variance.
   When -0.1 < < 0.2, such imbalance exhibits weak dependence on and hence
   z, which is shown to be the main cause for a -1 scaling at low k. As the
   atmosphere becomes more unstable, the imbalance determined from
   experiments here are not significantly affected by , thereby negating
   conditions promoting a -1 scaling in E-TT(k). The role of the imbalance
   between the production and dissipation rates of half the temperature
   variance in controlling the existence of a -1 scaling suggests that the
   -1 scaling in E-TT(k) does not necessarily concur with the -1 scaling in
   the spectra of longitudinal velocity E-uu(k). This finding explains why
   some ASL experiments reported k(-1) in E-uu(k) but not in E-TT(k).}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{717-728}},
Abstract = {{The precise arrangement of microscopic objects is critical to the
   development of functional materials and ornately patterned surfaces.
   Here, we present an acoustics-based method for the rapid arrangement of
   microscopic particles into organized and programmable architectures,
   which are periodically spaced within a square assembly chamber. This
   macroscale device employs two-dimensional bulk acoustic standing waves
   to propel particles along the base of the chamber toward pressure nodes
   or antinodes, depending on the acoustic contrast factor of the particle,
   and is capable of simultaneously creating thousands of size-limited,
   isotropic and anisotropic assemblies within minutes. We pair experiments
   with Brownian dynamics simulations to model the migration kinetics and
   assembly patterns of spherical microparticles. We use these insights to
   predict and subsequently validate the onset of buckling of the
   assemblies into three-dimensional clusters by experiments upon
   increasing the acoustic pressure amplitude and the particle
   concentration. The simulations are also used to inform our experiments
   for the assembly of non-spherical particles, which are then recovered
   via fluid evaporation and directly inspected by electron microscopy.
   This method for assembly of particles offers several notable advantages
   over other approaches (e.g., magnetics, electrokinetics and optical
   tweezing) including simplicity, speed and scalability and can also be
   used in concert with other such approaches for enhancing the types of
   assemblies achievable.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of limit-cycles plays an important role in
   characterizing complex dynamical systems, such as unsteady fluid flows.
   In practice, dynamical systems are described by models equations
   involving parameters which are seldom exactly known, leading to
   parametric uncertainties. These parameters can be suitably modeled as
   random variables, so if the system possesses almost surely a stable time
   periodic solution, limit-cycles become stochastic, too. This paper
   introduces a novel numerical method for the computation of stable
   stochastic limit-cycles based on the spectral stochastic finite element
   method with polynomial chaos (PC) expansions. The method is designed to
   overcome the limitation of PC expansions related to convergence
   breakdown for long term integration. First, a stochastic time scaling of
   the model equations is determined to control the phase-drift of the
   stochastic trajectories and allowing for accurate low order PC
   expansions. Second, using the rescaled governing equations, we aim at
   determining a stochastic initial condition and period such that the
   stochastic trajectories close after the completion of one cycle. The
   proposed method is implemented and demonstrated on a complex flow
   problem, modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
   consisting in the periodic vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder
   with stochastic inflow conditions. Numerical results are verified by
   comparison to deterministic reference simulations and demonstrate high
   accuracy in capturing the stochastic variability of the limit-cycle with
   respect to the inflow parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Traces derived from real-world traffic show that significant redundancy
   exists at the packet level in mobile network traffic. This has inspired
   new solutions to suppress the redundancy present in the packet data to
   manage the explosive traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
   to performing redundancy elimination by employing universal compression
   using memory-enabled overhearing helpers without backhaul connectivity,
   referred to as wireless network compression. The helpers overhear the
   data packets previously sent by the wireless gateway to various mobile
   clients within their coverage and use them as side information to reduce
   the overall communication cost. We study wireless network compression
   via overhearing helpers from an information-theoretic point of view and
   conclude that this approach potentially offers a threefold benefit: 1)
   offloading the wireless gateway and hence increasing the maximum number
   of mobile nodes the gateway can reliably serve; 2) reducing the average
   packet delay; and 3) improving the overall throughput in the network.}},

Abstract = {{Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) occur with strikingly different
   frequencies in infratentorial and supratentorial regions. Although
   histologically these malignancies appear similar, they represent
   distinct diseases. Recent genomic studies have identified histone K27M
   H3.3/H3.1 mutations in the majority of brainstem pHGGs; these mutations
   are rarely encountered in pHGGs that arise in the cerebral cortex.
   Previous research in brainstem pHGGs suggests a restricted permeability
   of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). In this work, we use dynamic
   contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to evaluate BBB permeability in a genetic
   mouse model of pHGG as a function of location (cortex vs. brainstem, n =
   8 mice/group) and histone mutation (mutant H3.3K27M vs. wild-type H3.3,
   n = 8 mice/group). The pHGG models are induced either in the brainstem
   or the cerebral cortex and are driven by PDGF signaling and p53 loss
   with either H3.3K27M or wild-type H3.3. T2-weighted MRI was used to
   determine tumor location/extent followed by 4D DCE-MRI for estimating
   the rate constant (K (trans) ) for tracer exchange across the barrier.
   BBB permeability was 67 \% higher in cortical pHGGs relative to
   brainstem pHGGs (t test, p = 0.012) but was not significantly affected
   by the expression of mutant H3.3K27M versus wild-type H3.3 (t-test, p =
   0.78). Although mice became symptomatic at approximately the same time,
   the mean volume of cortical tumors was 3.6 times higher than the mean
   volume of brainstem tumors. The difference between the mean volume of
   gliomas with wild-type and mutant H3.3 was insignificant. Mean K (trans)
   was significantly correlated to glioma volume. These results present a
   possible explanation for the poor response of brainstem pHGGs to
   systemic therapy. Our findings illustrate a potential role played by the
   microenvironment in shaping tumor growth and BBB permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Experiment and simulations are used to investigate the structural and

   materials, Li4P2S6 is quite stable, maintaining its crystal structure up
   to temperatures as high as 950 degrees C in vacuum and up to 280 degrees
   C in air. While its ionic conductivity is small, 2.38 x 10(-7) S/cm at
   25 degrees C and 2.33 x 10(-6)S/cm at 100 degrees C, its Arrhenius
   activation energy of 0.29 eV is similar to technologically viable
   electrolytes. Computer simulations provide insight into the causes and
   effects of disorder in this material and also indicate that the
   mechanism of the ion conduction is dominated by interstitial sites. (C)

Title = {{Reliability and performance of general two-dimensional broadcast
   wireless network}},
Journal = {{PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{41-59}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytic model is built to study the medium access
   control (MAC) performance and reliability of general two-dimensional
   (2-D) IEEE 802.11 based wireless networks for one-hop broadcast
   communications. First, a semi-Markov process (SMP) model is introduced
   to capture the medium contention and backoff behavior and the impact of
   hidden terminal problem in IEEE 802.11 broadcast wireless networks in a
   more precise way. An MiG/1/1( queue is used to model arrival and service
   of messages in an individual mobile terminal. To the contention for the
   shared medium, the SMP model interacts with the M/G/1/K queue through
   fixed-point iteration. Furthermore, based on the fixed-point solution,
   performance metrics including packet delivery probability (PDP),
   MAC-level and Application-level transmission delay, and MAC-level and
   Application-level packet reception ratio (PRR) are derived. The 2-D PDPs
   are derived through a coverage area computation for the impact of hidden
   terminal problem and concurrent transmissions to evaluate pointto-point
   reception probability, and then through integration of the reception
   probabilities over the circular intended range of the sending node. The
   analytical model takes into account IEEE 802.11 backoff counter process,
   hidden terminal problem, message inter-arrival interval, distinct
   transmission range, carrier sensing and interference ranges, and
   Nakagami fading channel with distance dependent path loss. Finally, as
   an example, the proposed analytic model is applied to a 2-D ad hoc
   network. The new model is validated through extensive simulations and
   new observations about the effects of network parameters on the
   performance and reliability are obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Enhancement of Neuromodulation with Novel Pulse Shapes Generated by
   Controllable Pulse Parameter Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-47}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
   devices generate bidirectional biphasic sinusoidal pulses that are
   energy efficient, but may be less effective than monophasic pulses that
   induce a more unidirectional electric field. To enable pulse shape
   optimization, we developed a controllable pulse parameter TMS (cTMS)
   device.
   Objective: We quantified changes in cortical excitability produced by
   conventional sinusoidal bidirectional pulses and by three
   rectangular-shaped cTMS pulses, one bidirectional and two unidirectional
   (in opposite directions), and compared their efficacy in modulating
   motor evoked potentials (MEPs) produced by stimulation of motor cortex.
   Methods: Thirteen healthy subjects completed four sessions of 1 Hz rTMS
   of the left motor cortex. In each session, the rTMS electric field pulse
   had one of the four shapes. Excitability changes due to rTMS were
   measured by applying probe TMS pulses before and after rTMS, and
   comparing resultant MEP amplitudes. Separately, we measured the latency
   of the MEPs evoked by each of the four pulses.
   Results: While the three cTMS pulses generated significant mean
   inhibitory effects in the subject group, the conventional biphasic
   cosine pulses did not. The strongest inhibition resulted from a
   rectangular unidirectional pulse with dominant induced current in the
   posterior-anterior direction. The MEP latency depended significantly on
   the pulse shape.
   Conclusions: The pulse shape is an important factor in rTMS-induced
   neuromodulation. The standard cosine biphasic pulse showed the smallest
   effect on cortical excitability, while the greatest inhibition was
   observed for an asymmetric, unidirectional, rectangular pulse.
   Differences in MEP latency across the various rTMS pulse shapes suggest
   activation of distinct subsets of cortical microcircuitry. c 2015

Abstract = {{Amoxicillin (AMOX), clavulanic acid (CLAV) and prednisolone (PSL) are
   widely used in combination for the treatment of mastitis in lactating
   dairy cows. However, no method has been reported to detect these three
   chemicals in milk in a single assay. In the present work, a reliable and
   sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for simultaneous
   determination of AMOX, CLAV and PSL in cow's milk. The analytes were
   determined by a positive and negative ionization electrospray mass
   spectrometer via multiple reaction monitoring. The linear ranges of
   AMOX, CLAV and PSL were from 2 to 1000 ng/mL, 20-1000 ng/mL and 1-1000
   ng/mL, respectively, with the correlation coefficients greater than
   0.999. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were 2 ng/mL (AMOX), 20 ng/mL
   (CLAV) and 1 ng/mL (PSL). Recoveries of the analytes of interest in milk
   samples were in the ranges of 84.2-101.4\%. The intra-day and inter-day
   precisions ranged from 1.8\% to 11.9\%. This method was successfully
   applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics of AMOX, CLAV and PSL in
   milk from healthy and mastitic cows. The elimination times of AMOX and
   PSL in mastitic cows were longer than that in healthy cows, but the
   elimination times of CLAV did not show significant difference. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Efficient and bright single photon sources at room temperature are
   critical components for quantum information systems such as quantum key
   distribution, quantum state teleportation, and quantum computation.
   However, the intrinsic radiative lifetime of quantum emitters is
   typically similar to 10 ns, which severely limits the maximum single
   photon emission rate and thus entanglement rates. Here, we demonstrate
   the regime of ultrafast spontaneous emission (similar to 10 ps) from a
   single quantum emitter coupled to a plasmonic nanocavity at room
   temperature. The nanocavity integrated with a single colloidal
   semiconductor quantum dot produces a 540-fold decrease in the emission
   lifetime and a simultaneous 1900-fold increase in the total emission
   intensity. At the same time, the nanocavity acts as a highly efficient
   optical antenna directing the emission into a single lobe normal to the
   surface. This plasmonic platform is a versatile geometry into which a
   variety of other quantum emitters, such as crystal color centers, can be
   integrated for directional, room-temperature single photon emission
   rates exceeding 80 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the strength-duration (S-D) time constants of
   motor cortex structures activated by current pulses oriented
   posterior-anterior (PA) or anterior-posterior (AP) across the central
   sulcus.
   Methods: Motor threshold and input-output curve, along with motor evoked
   potential (MEP) latencies, of first dorsal interosseus were determined
   at pulse widths of 30, 60, and 120 mu s using a controllable pulse
   parameter (cTMS) device, with the coil oriented PA or AP. These were
   used to estimate the S-D time constant and we compared with data for
   responses evoked by cTMS of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.
   Results: The S-D time constant with PA was shorter than for AP
   stimulation (230.9 +/- 97.2 vs. 294.2 +/- 90.9 mu s; p < 0.001). These
   values were similar to those calculated after stimulation of ulnar nerve
   (197 +/- 47 mu s). MEP latencies to AP, but not PA stimulation were
   affected by pulse width, showing longer latencies following short
   duration stimuli.
   Conclusion: PA and AP stimuli appear to activate the axons of neurons
   with different time constants. Short duration AP pulses are more
   selective than longer pulses in recruiting longer latency corticospinal
   output.
   Significance: More selective stimulation of neural elements may be
   achieved by manipulating pulse width and orientation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In (x) Al(1-x)N (InAlN) thin films, lattice-matched to GaN with an In

   However, InAlN thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy exhibit a
   characteristic lateral composition modulation, or nanocolumnar
   microstructure, with an Al-rich center region and an In-rich boundary.
   The mechanism driving the formation of this microstructure remains
   unknown. To date, the structural characterization of the nanocolumn
   domain size and its associated compositional variation is challenging,
   requiring either transmission electron microscopy or atomic probe
   microscopy. We show that the nanocolumnar microstructure can be
   characterized using x-ray diffraction and is associated with increased
   diffuse scattering. Using this technique, we show that the development
   of the microstructure is dependent on growth temperature.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{209-220}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to propose a distributed control scheme to
   maximize area coverage by a mobile robot network while ensuring reliable
   communication between the members of the team. The information that is
   generated at the sensors depends on the sensing capabilities of the
   sensors as well as on the frequency at which events occur in their
   vicinity, captured by appropriate probability density functions. This
   information is then routed to a fixed set of access points via a
   multi-hop network whose links model the probability that information
   packets are correctly decoded at their intended destinations. The
   proposed distributed control scheme simultaneously optimizes coverage
   and routing of information by sequentially alternating between
   optimization of the two objectives. Specifically, optimization of the
   communication variables is performed periodically in the dual domain.
   Then, between communication rounds, the robots move to optimize
   coverage. Motion control is due to the solution of a distributed
   sequential concave program that handles efficiently the introduced
   nonlinearities in the mobility space. Our method is illustrated in
   computer simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Urinary catheter capable of repeated on-demand removal of infectious
   biofilms via active deformation}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{77-86}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biofilm removal from biomaterials is of fundamental importance, and is
   especially relevant when considering the problematic and deleterious
   impact of biofilm infections on the inner surfaces of urinary catheters.
   Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common cause
   of hospital-acquired infections and there are over 30 million Foley
   urinary catheters used annually in the USA. In this paper, we present
   the design and optimization of urinary catheter prototypes capable of
   on-demand removal of biofilms from the inner luminal surface of
   catheters. The urinary catheters utilize 4 intra-wall inflation lumens
   that are pressure-actuated to generate region-selective strains in the
   elastomeric urine lumen, and thereby remove overlying biofilms. A
   combination of finite-element modeling and prototype fabrication was
   used to optimize the catheter design to generate greater than 30\%
   strain in the majority of the luminal surface when subjected to
   pressure. The catheter prototypes are able to remove greater than 80\%
   of a mixed community biofilm of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli
   on-demand, and furthermore are able to remove the biofilm repeatedly.
   Additionally, experiments with the prototypes demonstrate that biofilm
   debonding can be achieved upon application of both tensile and
   compressive strains in the inner surface of the catheter. The
   fouling-release catheter offers the potential for a non-biologic,
   non-antibiotic method to remove biofilms and thereby for impacting the
   thus far intractable problem of catheter-associated infections. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are responsible for metastases in distant
   organs via hematogenous dissemination. Fundamental studies in the past
   decade have suggested that neutralization of CTCs in circulation could
   represent an effective strategy to prevent metastasis. Current paradigms
   of targeted drug delivery into a solid tumor largely fall into two main
   categories: unique cancer markers (e.g. overexpression of surface
   receptors) and tumor-specific microenvironment (e.g. low pH, hypoxia,
   etc.). While relying on a surface receptor to target CTCs can be greatly
   challenged by cancer heterogeneity, targeting of tumor microenvironments
   has the advantage of recognizing a broader spectrum of cancer cells
   regardless of genetic differences or tumor types. The blood circulation,
   however, where CTCs transit through, lacks the same tumor
   microenvironment as that found in a solid tumor. In this study, a unique
   ``microenvironment{''} was confirmed upon introduction of cancer cells
   of different types into circulation where activated platelets and fibrin
   were physically associated with blood-borne cancer cells. Inspired by
   this observation, synthetic silica particles were ftinctionalized with
   activated platelet membrane along with surface conjugation of
   tumor-specific apoptosis-inducing ligand cytokine, TRAIL Biomimetic
   synthetic particles incorporated into CTC-associated micro-thrombi in
   lung vasculature and dramatically decreased lung metastases in a mouse
   breast cancer metastasis model. Our results demonstrate a ``Trojan
   Horse{''} strategy of neutralizing CFCs to attenuate metastasis. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper addresses model dimensionality reduction for Bayesian
   inference based on prior Gaussian fields with uncertainty in the
   covariance function hyper-parameters. The dimensionality reduction is
   traditionally achieved using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion of a prior
   Gaussian process assuming covariance function with fixed
   hyper-parameters, despite the fact that these are uncertain in nature.
   The posterior distribution of the Karhunen-Loeve coordinates is then
   inferred using available observations. The resulting inferred field is
   therefore dependent on the assumed hyper-parameters. Here, we seek to
   efficiently estimate both the field and covariance hyper-parameters
   using Bayesian inference. To this end, a generalized Karhunen-Loeve
   expansion is derived using a coordinate transformation to account for
   the dependence with respect to the covariance hyper-parameters.
   Polynomial Chaos expansions are employed for the acceleration of the
   Bayesian inference using similar coordinate transformations, enabling us
   to avoid expanding explicitly the solution dependence on the uncertain
   hyper-parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method
   on a transient diffusion equation by inferring spatially-varying
   log-diffusivity fields from noisy data. The inferred profiles were found
   closer to the true profiles when including the hyper-parameters'
   uncertainty in the inference formulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{A spectral budget model is developed to describe the scaling behavior of
   the longitudinal turbulent velocity variance sigma(2)(u) with the
   stability parameter zeta = z/L and the normalized height z/delta in an
   idealized stably stratified atmospheric surface layer (ASL), where z is
   the height from the surface, L is the Obukhov length, and delta is the
   boundary layer height. The proposed framework employs Kolmogorov's
   hypothesis for describing the shape of the longitudinal velocity spectra
   in the inertial subrange, Heisenberg's eddy viscosity as a closure for
   the pressure redistribution and turbulent transfer terms, and the
   Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) scaling for linking the mean
   longitudinal velocity and temperature profiles to zeta. At a given
   friction velocity u({*}), sigma(u) reduces with increasing zeta as
   expected. The model is consistent with the disputed z-less
   stratification when the stability correction function for momentum
   increases with increasing zeta linearly or as a power law with the
   exponent exceeding unity. For the Businger-Dyer stability correction
   function for momentum, which varies linearly with zeta, the limit of the
   z-less onset is zeta approximate to 2. The proposed framework explains
   why sigma(u) does not follow MOST scaling even when the mean velocity
   and temperature profiles may follow MOST in the ASL. It also explains
   how delta ceases to be a scaling variable in more strongly stable
   (although well-developed turbulent) ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To analyze the value of novel measures of retinal pigment
   epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC) volume to predict 2-year disease
   progression of intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
   Design: Prospective, observational study.
   Participants: Three hundred forty-five AMD and 122 non-AMD participants
   enrolled in the Age Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary
   Spectral-Domain (SD) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) study.
   Methods: High-density SD OCT macular volumes were obtained at yearly
   study visits. The RPEDC abnormal thickening (henceforth, OCT drusen) and
   RPEDC abnormal thinning (RAT) volumes were generated by semi-automated
   segmentation of total RPEDC within a 5-mm-diameter macular field.
   Main Outcome Measures: Volume change and odds ratio (OR) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) for progression to advanced AMD with choroidal
   neovascularization (CNV) or central geographic atrophy (GA).
   Results: Complete volumes were obtained in 265 and 266 AMD eyes and in
   115 and 97 control eyes at baseline and at year 2, respectively. In AMD
   eyes, mean (standard deviation) OCT drusen volume increased from 0.08
   mm(3) (0.16 mm(3)) to 0.10 mm(3) (0.23 mm(3); P < 0.001), and RAT volume
   increased from 8.3 x 10(-4) mm(3) (20.8 x 10(-4) mm(3)) to 18.4 x 10(-4)
   mm(3) (46.6 x 10(-4) mm(3); P < 0.001). Greater baseline OCT drusen
   volume was associated with 2-year progression to CNV (P = 0.002). Odds
   of developing CNV increased by 31\% for every 0.1-mm(3) increase in
   baseline OCT drusen volume (OR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.63; P = 0.013).
   Greater baseline RAT volume was associated with significant 2-year
   increase in RAT volume (P < 0.001), noncentral GA (P < 0.001), and
   progression to central GA (P < 0.001). Odds of developing central GA
   increased by 32\% for every 0.001-mm(3) increase in baseline RAT volume
   (OR, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.14-1.53; P < 0.001). In non-AMD eyes, all volumes
   were significantly lower than AMD eyes and showed no significant 2-year
   change.
   Conclusions: Macular OCT drusen and RAT volumes increased significantly
   in AMD eyes over 2 years. These quantitative SD OCT biomarkers predict
   2-year AMD progression and may serve as useful biomarkers for future
   clinical trials. (C) 2016 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.}},

Abstract = {{Many signal and image processing applications have benefited remarkably
   from the fact that the underlying signals reside in a low dimensional
   subspace. One of the main models for such a low dimensionality is the
   sparsity one. Within this framework there are two main options for the
   sparse modeling: the synthesis and the analysis ones, where the first is
   considered the standard paradigm for which much more research has been
   dedicated. In it the signals are assumed to have a sparse representation
   under a given dictionary. On the other hand, in the analysis approach
   the sparsity is measured in the coefficients of the signal after
   applying a certain transformation, the analysis dictionary, on it.
   Though several algorithms with some theory have been developed for this
   framework, they are outnumbered by the ones proposed for the synthesis
   methodology.
   Given that the analysis dictionary is either a frame or the two
   dimensional finite difference operator, we propose a new sampling scheme
   for signals from the analysis model that allows recovering them from
   their samples using any existing algorithm from the synthesis model. The
   advantage of this new sampling strategy is that it makes the existing
   synthesis methods with their theory also available for signals from the
   analysis framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vortex-induced vibration is a fluid instability where vortices due to
   secondary flows exert a periodic unsteady force on the elastic
   structure. Under certain circumstances, the shedding frequency can lock
   into the structure natural frequency and lead to limit cycle
   oscillations. These vibrations may cause material fatigue and are a
   common source of structural failure. This work uses a frequency domain,
   harmonic balance (HB) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict
   the natural shedding frequency and lock-in region of an airfoil at very
   high angles of attack. The numerical results are then successfully
   compared to experimental data from wind tunnel testings.}},

Title = {{Wake control with permeable multilayer structures: The spherical
   symmetry case}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{We explore the possibility of controlling the wake and drag of a
   spherical object independently of each other, using radial distributions
   of permeability in the Brinkman-Stokes formalism. By discretizing a
   graded-permeability shell into discrete, macroscopically homogeneous
   layers, we are able to sample the entire functional space of
   spherically-symmetric permeabilities and observe quick convergence to a
   certain manifold in the wake-drag coordinates. Monte Carlo samplings
   with 10(4)-10(5) points have become possible thanks to our new
   algorithm, which is based on exact analytical solutions for the Stokes
   flow through an arbitrary multilayer porous sphere. The algorithm is not
   restricted to the Brinkman-Stokes equation and can be modified to
   account for other types of scattering problems for spherically-symmetric
   systems with arbitrary radial complexity. Our main practical finding for
   Stokes flow is that it is possible to reduce a certain measure of wake
   of a spherical object without any energy penalty and without active
   (power-consuming) force generation.}},

Abstract = {{The elevation and extent of coastal marshes are dictated by the
   interplay between the rate of relative sea-level rise (RRSLR), surface
   accretion by inorganic sediment deposition, and organic soil production
   by plants. These accretion processes respond to changes in local and
   global forcings, such as sediment delivery to the coast, nutrient
   concentrations, and atmospheric CO2, but their relative importance for
   marsh resilience to increasing RRSLR remains unclear. In particular,
   marshes up-take atmospheric CO2 at high rates, thereby playing a major
   role in the global carbon cycle, but the morphologic expression of
   increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, an imminent aspect of climate
   change, has not yet been isolated and quantified. Using the available
   observational literature and a spatially explicit ecomorphodynamic
   model, we explore marsh responses to increased atmospheric CO2, relative
   to changes in inorganic sediment availability and elevated nitrogen
   levels. We find that marsh vegetation response to foreseen elevated
   atmospheric CO2 is similar in magnitude to the response induced by a
   varying inorganic sediment concentration, and that it increases the
   threshold RRSLR initiating marsh submergence by up to 60\% in the range
   of forcings explored. Furthermore, we find that marsh responses are
   inherently spatially dependent, and cannot be adequately captured
   through 0-dimensional representations of marsh dynamics. Our results
   imply that coastal marshes, and the major carbon sink they represent,
   are significantly more resilient to foreseen climatic changes than
   previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Cavitation with bubble-bubble interaction is a fundamental feature in
   therapeutic ultrasound. However, the causal relationships between bubble
   dynamics, associated flow motion, cell deformation, and resultant
   bioeffects are not well elucidated. Here, we report an experimental
   system for tandem bubble (TB; maximum diameter = 50 +/- 2 mu m)
   generation, jet formation, and subsequent interaction with single HeLa
   cells patterned on fibronectin-coated islands (32 x 32 mu m) in a
   microfluidic chip. We have demonstrated that pinpoint membrane poration
   can be produced at the leading edge of the HeLa cell in standoff
   distance S-d <= 30 mu m, driven by the transient shear stress associated
   with TB-induced jetting flow. The cell membrane deformation associated
   with a maximum strain rate on the order of 10(4) s(-1) was
   heterogeneous. The maximum area strain (epsilon(A,M)) decreased
   exponentially with S-d (also influenced by adhesion pattern), a feature
   that allows us to create distinctly different treatment outcome (i.e.,
   necrosis, repairable poration, or nonporation) in individual cells. More
   importantly, our results suggest that membrane poration and cell
   survival are better correlated with area strain integral (integral
   epsilon(2)(A)dt) instead of epsilon(A,M), which is characteristic of the
   response of materials under high strain-rate loadings. For 50\% cell
   survival the corresponding area strain integral was found to vary in the
   range of 56 similar to 123 mu s with epsilon(A,M) in the range of 57
   similar to 87\%. Finally, significant variations in individual cell's
   response were observed at the same S-d, indicating the potential for
   using this method to probe mechanotransduction at the single cell level.}},

   are capable of identifying only TGFs that exceed a lower brightness
   threshold. Observationally, dim TGFs that fall below this threshold are
   consequently difficult to find using photon-only search algorithms. Such
   TGFs are a potentially important part of the overall global TGF rate,
   and information on their occurrence rate would give important insight
   into TGF generation mechanisms. We describe and implement a
   lightning-based search for TGFs that uses the location and time of
   National Lightning Detection Network reported positive polarity,
   in-cloud (+IC) discharges of the type known to be directly associated
   with TGFs. These events identify a 200 mu s search window when any
   associated TGF photons would have been detected. We show that this
   approach can detect TGFs without requiring a lower threshold on the
   detected photon brightness of the event, and thus is capable, in
   principle, of finding a population of weak TGFs. We find that TGFs occur
   at a rate between 1 in 40 and 1 in 500 of in-cloud lightning events that
   meet our study's criteria. The distribution of gamma ray counts in the
   search windows exhibits a statistically significant lack of nearby dim
   TGFs below the GBM search threshold. The data favor a brightness
   distribution in which nearby observationally dim TGFs are rare.}},

Abstract = {{Modulating spatial near-infrared light for ultra-compact electrooptic
   devices is a critical issue in optical communication and imaging
   applications. To date, spatial near-infrared modulators based on
   graphene have been reported, but they showed limited modulation effects
   due to the relatively weak light-graphene interaction. In combination
   with graphene and metallic nanoslits, we design a kind of ultrathin
   near-infrared perfect absorber with enhanced spatial modulation effects
   and independence on a wide range of incident angles. The modulated
   spectral shift of central wavelength is up to 258.2 nm in the
   near-infrared range, which is more promising in applications than
   state-of-the-art devices. The modulation enhancement is attributed to
   the plasmonic nanoslit mode, in which the optical electric field is
   highly concentrated in the deep subwavelength scale and the
   light-graphene interaction is significantly strengthened. The physical
   insight is deeply revealed by a combination of equivalent circuit and
   electromagnetic field analysis. The design principles are not only
   crucial for spatial near-infrared modulators, but also provide a key
   guide for developing active near-infrared patch nanoantennas based on
   graphene. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are a promising
   technology for fluorescence readout of millisecond-scale neuronal
   dynamics. Previous GEVIs had insufficient signaling speed and dynamic
   range to resolve action potentials in live animals. We coupled fast
   voltage-sensing domains from a rhodopsin protein to bright fluorophores
   through resonance energy transfer. The resulting GEVIs are sufficiently
   bright and fast to report neuronal action potentials and membrane
   voltage dynamics in awake mice and flies, resolving fast spike trains
   with 0.2-millisecond timing precision at spike detection error rates
   orders of magnitude better than previous GEVIs. In vivo imaging revealed
   sensory-evoked responses, including somatic spiking, dendritic dynamics,
   and intracellular voltage propagation. These results empower in vivo
   optical studies of neuronal electrophysiology and coding and motivate

Abstract = {{To design three-dimensional (3D) conformal conical arrays with desired
   3D co-polarisation and cross-polarisation radiation patterns, a pattern
   synthesis method based on equivalent principle and trust region method
   is presented. Dynamic range ratio (DRR) of element excitations is taken
   into consideration. An analytical function is utilised to constrain DRR
   and avoid discontinuity of objective function. Owing to the optimisation
   is based on very good initial currents distribution, the optimisation
   procedure is very fast. The analytical gradient and Hessian matrix
   expressions of the objective function are derived. This also improves
   the optimisation efficiency compared with using the finite difference
   methods to solve gradient and Hessian matrix. To demonstrate the
   effectiveness of this proposed method, a conformal conical array with
   454 elements has been designed. The amplitude and phase excitations were
   optimised by using the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Models of cardiac mechanics are increasingly used to investigate cardiac
   physiology. These models are characterized by a high level of
   complexity, including the particular anisotropic material properties of
   biological tissue and the actively contracting material. A large number
   of independent simulation codes have been developed, but a consistent
   way of verifying the accuracy and replicability of simulations is
   lacking. To aid in the verification of current and future cardiac
   mechanics solvers, this study provides three benchmark problems for
   cardiac mechanics. These benchmark problems test the ability to
   accurately simulate pressure-type forces that depend on the deformed
   objects geometry, anisotropic and spatially varying material properties
   similar to those seen in the left ventricle and active contractile
   forces. The benchmark was solved by 11 different groups to generate
   consensus solutions, with typical differences in higher-resolution
   solutions at approximately 0.5\%, and consistent results between linear,
   quadratic and cubic finite elements as well as different approaches to
   simulating incompressible materials. Online tools and solutions are made
   available to allow these tests to be effectively used in verification of
   future cardiac mechanics software.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, implementation of active circuit elements within
   metamaterials is an effective way to make them electrically tunable. We
   combine varactors with split copper loops in a metamaterial absorber in
   order to obtain an electrically tunable microwave response. This
   absorber has a compact planar structure and a simplified back feeding
   network. Flexible frequency tunability of the microwave reflection in
   the range of 5-6 GHz is experimentally achieved. The design, simulation,
   and experimental results are systematically presented. The proposed
   method is scalable for developing active metamaterial absorbers based on
   metal loops, and shows a promising potential of active metamaterial

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{10047-10064}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Surface flow redistribution on flat ground from crusted bare soil to
   vegetated patches following intense rainfall events elevates plant
   available water above that provided by rainfall. The significance of
   this surface water redistribution to sustaining vegetation in arid and
   semiarid regions is undisputed. What is disputed is the quantity and
   spatial distribution of the redistributed water. In ecohydrological
   models, such nonuniform flows are described using the Saint-Venant
   equation (SVE) subject to a Manning roughness coefficient closure. To
   explore these assumptions in the most idealized setting, flume
   experiments were conducted using rigid cylinders representing rigid
   vegetation with varying density. Flow was induced along the streamwise x
   direction by adjusting the free water surface height H(x) between the
   upstream and downstream boundaries mimicking the nonuniformity
   encountered in nature. In natural settings, such H(x) variations arise
   due to contrasts in infiltration capacity and ponded depths during
   storms. The measured H(x) values in the flume were interpreted using the
   SVE augmented with progressively elaborate approximations to the
   roughness representation. The simplest approximation employs a friction
   factor derived from a drag coefficient (C-d) for isolated cylinders in a
   locally (but not globally) uniform flow and upscaled using the rod
   density that was varied across experiments. Comparison between measured
   and modeled H(x) suggested that such a ``naive'' approach overpredicts
   H(x). Blockage was then incorporated into the SVE model calculations but
   resulted in underestimation of H(x). Biases in modeled H(x) suggest that
   C-d must be varying in x beyond what a local or bulk Reynolds number
   predicts. Inferred C-d(x) from the flume experiments exhibited a
   near-parabolic shape most peaked in the densest canopy cases. The
   outcome of such C-d(x) variations is then summarized in a bulk
   resistance formulation that may be beneficial to modeling runon-runoff
   processes on shallow slopes using SVE.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first FFT-based fast volume integral equation
   solver for inhomogeneous anisotropic magnetodielectric objects. The
   volume integral equations are formulated by employing mixed-order basis
   functions that expand the flux densities and vector potentials in the
   coupled field integral equations in terms of different sets of basis
   functions with different orders. Volumetric roof-top basis functions are
   used for flux densities whereas second-order curl conforming basis
   functions are used for vector potentials. A fast volume integral
   equations solver namely the BCGS-FFT method is then applied to
   accelerate the solution of this mixed-order weak-form formulation.
   Examples show that the mixed-order BCGS-FFT method has high accuracy
   compared to both analytical and numerical solutions. Examples also show
   the mixed-order BCGS-FFT method has high computational efficiency
   compared to commercial software.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown in this communication that the problem of synthesizing a
   frequency-invariant (FI) beam pattern with as few elements as possible
   can be transformed into a sequence of weighted l(1) optimizations under
   multiple convex constraints. The objective of the weighted l(1)
   optimization is to minimize the number of radiating elements. For the
   filter-and-sum beamforming structure, this is equivalent to minimizing
   the number of filters, each with a set of optimized coefficients. The
   multiple constraints are adopted to individually control the mainlobe
   and sidelobe pattern characteristics, so as to preserve the FI property
   in the mainlobe region while satisfying a given upper bound in the
   sidelobe region. The WNG constraint can also be incorporated into the
   proposed method to enhance the synthesis robustness. This method can be
   easily implemented by iterative second-order cone programming (SOCP),
   and only few iterations are required to reach the convergence. A set of
   examples for the synthesis of FI patterns with uniform sidelobe level
   (SLL) or multiple nulls, scannable FI patterns, and the synthesis of FI
   pattern for an arc array with directive elements, is presented to
   validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The
   element saving is about 23.3\%-50\% for the test cases.}},

   nanofocusing for efficient solar vapour generation}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Solar steam generation has been achieved by surface plasmon heating with
   metallic nanoshells or nanoparticles, which have inherently narrow
   absorption bandwidth. For efficient light-to-heat conversion from a
   wider solar spectrum, we employ adiabatic plasmonic nanofocusing to
   attain both polarization-independent ultrabroadband light absorption and
   high plasmon dissipation loss. Here we demonstrate large area, flexible
   thin-film black gold membranes, which have multiscale structures of
   varying metallic nanoscale gaps (0-200 nm) as well as microscale funnel
   structures. The adiabatic nanofocusing of self-aggregated metallic
   nanowire bundle arrays produces average absorption of 91\% at 400-2,500
   nm and the microscale funnel structures lead to average reflection of
   7\% at 2.5-17 mu m. This membrane allows heat localization within the
   few micrometre-thick layer and continuous water provision through
   micropores. We efficiently generate water vapour with solar thermal
   conversion efficiency up to 57\% at 20 k Wm(-2). This new structure has
   a variety of applications in solar energy harvesting, thermoplasmonics
   and related technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Modern authentication and communication protocols increasingly use
   physical keys in lieu of conventional software-based keys for security.
   This shift is primarily driven by the ability to derive a unique,
   unforgeable signature from a physical key. The sole demonstration of an
   unforgeable key, thus far, has been through quantum key distribution,
   which suffers from limited communication distances and expensive
   infrastructure requirements. Here, we show a method for creating
   unclonable keys by molecular self-assembly of resonance energy transfer
   (RED devices. It is infeasible to clone the RET-key due to the inability
   to characterize the key using current technology, the large number of
   input output combinations per key, and the variation of the key's
   response with time. However, the manufacturer can produce multiple
   identical devices, which enables inexpensive, secure authentication and
   communication over classical channels, and thus any distance. Through a
   detailed experimental survey of the nanoscale keys, we demonstrate that
   legitimate users are successfully authenticated 99.48\% of the time and
   the false-positives are only 0.39\%, over two attempts. We estimate that
   a legitimate user would have a computational advantage of more than
   10(340) years over an attacker. Our method enables the discovery of
   physical key based multiparty authentication and communication schemes
   that are both practical and possess unprecedented security.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the dynamics of a model dinoflagellate predator-prey
   system and uses simulations to validate theoretical and experimental
   studies. A simple model for predator-prey interactions is derived by
   drawing upon analogies from chemical kinetics. This model is then
   modified to account for inefficiencies in predation. Simulation results
   are shown to closely match the model predictions. Additional simulations
   are then run which are based on experimental observations of predatory
   dinoflagellate behavior, and this study specifically investigates how
   the predatory dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum uses toxins to
   immobilize its prey and increase its feeding rate. These simulations
   account for complex dynamics that were not included in the basic models,
   and the results from these computational simulations closely match the
   experimentally observed predatory behavior of K. veneficum and reinforce
   the notion that predatory dinoflagellates utilize toxins to increase
   their feeding rate.}},

Abstract = {{Neuronal receptive fields (RFs) provide the foundation for understanding
   systems-level sensory processing. In early visual areas, investigators
   have mapped RFs in detail using stochastic stimuli and sophisticated
   analytical approaches. Much less is known about RFs in prefrontal
   cortex. Visual stimuli used for mapping RFs in prefrontal cortex tend to
   cover a small range of spatial and temporal parameters, making it
   difficult to understand their role in visual processing. To address
   these shortcomings, we implemented a generalized linear model to measure
   the RFs of neurons in the macaque frontal eye field (FEF) in response to
   sparse, full-field stimuli. Our high-resolution, probabilistic approach
   tracked the evolution of RFs during passive fixation, and we validated
   our results against conventional measures. We found that FEF neurons
   exhibited a surprising level of sensitivity to stimuli presented as
   briefly as 10 ms or to multiple dots presented simultaneously,
   suggesting that FEF visual responses are more precise than previously
   appreciated. FEF RF spatial structures were largely maintained over time
   and between stimulus conditions. Our results demonstrate that the
   application of probabilistic RF mapping to FEF and similar association
   areas is an important tool for clarifying the neuronal mechanisms of
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions are a primary determinant of tissue
   structure. For several decades, it had been thought that the primary
   function of these ubiquitous structures was to resist external
   mechanical loads. Here we review recent evidence that cadherins also
   couple together the force-generating actomyosin cytoskeletons of
   neighbouring cells, serve as potent regulators of the actomyosin
   cytoskeleton, and activate diverse signalling pathways in response to
   applied load. In considering the force sensitivity of the
   molecular-scale processes that mediate these events, we propose a
   dynamic picture of the force-sensitive processes in cell-cell contacts.
   This quantitative and physical understanding of the mechanobiology of
   cadherin cell-cell junctions will aid endeavours to study the
   fundamental processes mediating the development and maintenance of

Title = {{Modeling Soil-Plant Dynamics: Assessing Simulation Accuracy by
   Comparison with Spatially Distributed Crop Yield Measurements}},
Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Coupling hydrological models with plant physiology is crucial to capture
   the feedback mechanisms occurring within the soil-plant-atmosphere
   continuum. However, the ability of such models to describe the spatial
   variability of plant responses to different environmental factors
   remains to be proven, especially at large scales (field or watershed).
   We used an innovative three-dimensional soil-plant model to quantify
   temporal and spatial variability of crop productivity at the field
   scale, and we assessed simulation accuracy by comparison with spatially
   distributed crop yield measurements. A 25-ha field located in the Venice
   coastland, Italy, cultivated with a maize (Zea mays L.) crop and
   characterized by a highly heterogeneous soil subject to salt
   contamination, has been extensively studied by soil sampling,
   geophysical surveys, and hydrological monitoring. Based on these
   observations, field-scale simulations of soil moisture dynamics coupled
   with plant transpiration, photosynthesis, and growth were run and
   compared with crop yield maps of different growing seasons. The model
   captured the observed crop productivity (grain yield varying between 2
   and 15 Mg ha(-1)), but the accuracy of the predicted spatial patterns
   was limited by the available information on soil heterogeneities.
   Further model uncertainties are related to the characterization of the
   rooting systems and their responses to environmental factors (soil
   characteristics, precipitation) that were shown to be crucial to
   describe the effect of drought conditions on growth processes. These
   results demonstrate that large-scale mechanistic simulations of
   soil-plant systems require a trade-off between site characterization,
   model processes, and computational efficiency, offering an open
   challenge for future ecohydrological research.}},

Abstract = {{The discontinuous Galerkin finite-element time-domain (DG-FETD) method
   with implicit time integration has an advantage in modeling electrically
   fine-scale electromagnetic problems. Based on domain decomposition
   methods, it avoids the direct inversion of a large system matrix as in
   the conventional FETD method; by employing implicit time integration, it
   obviates an extremely small time-step interval to maintain stability as
   in explicit schemes. Based on curl-conforming basis functions for the
   electric field intensity E field and divergence-conforming basis
   functions for the magnetic flux density B field, a new noniterative
   implicit time-stepping scheme is proposed to efficiently solve
   sequentially ordered systems for electrically fine-scale problems.
   Compared with the previous EH-based scheme, the new scheme introduces
   fewer unknowns and, thereby, results in a smaller matrix system. Based
   on the Crank-Nicholson algorithm for time integration, the matrix system
   is in a block tridiagonal form. Then, through separating the surface
   unknowns from the volume unknowns, a block lower-diagonal-upper (LDU)
   decomposition is implemented, reducing the computational complexity of
   the original system. The adaptivity of parallel computing in subdomain
   level during preprocessing further helps shorten the computation time.
   Numerical results confirm that the proposed LDU scheme presents improved
   efficiency in terms of memory and CPU time while retaining the same
   accuracy, compared with the previous implicit block-Thomas method. With
   respect to the explicit Runge-Kutta method and the standard FDTD, it
   also shows an advantage in CPU time. The proposed scheme will help
   improve the performance of DG-FETD in modeling electrically fine-scale
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Ionospheric reflection heights estimated using the zero-to-zero and
   peak-to-peak methods to measure skywave delay relative to the ground
   wave were compared for 108 first and 124 subsequent strokes at distances
   greater than 100 km. For either metric there was a considerable decrease
   in average reflection height for subsequent strokes relative to first
   strokes. We showed that the observed difference cannot be explained by
   the difference in frequency content of first and subsequent
   return-stroke currents. Apparent changes in reflection height (estimated
   using the peak-to-peak method) within individual flashes for 54 daytime
   and 11 nighttime events at distances ranging from 50 km to 330 km were
   compared, and significant differences were found. For daytime
   conditions, the majority of the flashes showed either decrease (57\%) or
   non-monotonic variation (39\%) in reflection height with respect to the
   immediately preceding stroke. With respect to the first stroke, 91\% of
   the flashes showed monotonic decrease in height. For nighttime flashes,
   patterns in reflection height changes with respect to the immediately
   preceding stroke were as follows: 46\% no change, 27\% monotonic
   decrease, and 27\% non-monotonic variation. When changes were measured
   with respect to the first stroke, 54\% of nighttime flashes showed
   monotonic decrease and 46\% no change. Ionospheric reflection height
   tends to increase with return-stroke peak current. The observed daytime
   effects can be explained by (a) the dependence of EMP penetration depth
   on source intensity, which decreases with stroke order, (b) additional
   ionization associated with elves, or (c) combination of (a) and (b)
   above. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to
   simulate two warm season events representative of reverse orographic
   enhancement of warm season precipitation in the Southern Appalachians
   under weak (9-12 July, 2012) and strong (12-16 May, 2014) synoptic
   forcing conditions. Reverse orographic enhancement refers to significant
   enhancement of rainfall intensity (up to one order of magnitude) at low
   elevations in the inner mountain valleys, but not in the ridges. This is
   manifest in significant increases of radar reflectivity observations and
   associated integral quantities (rain rate) at low levels (within 500 m
   of the surface), as well as changes in the observed microphysical
   properties of rainfall (raindrop size distribution). Analysis of
   high-resolution (1.25 km x 1.25 km) WRF simulations shows that the model
   captures the march of observed rainfall, though not the timing in the
   case of strong synoptic forcing. For each event, the results show that
   the space-time variability of rainfall in the inner region is strongly
   coupled to the development and persistence of organized within-valley
   low-level moisture convergence that is a necessary precursor to valley
   fog and low level cloud formation. Microphysical interactions among
   precipitation from propagating storm systems, and local low-level clouds
   and fog promote coalescence efficiency through the seederfeeder
   mechanism leading to significant enhancement of rainfall intensity near
   the ground as shown by Wilson and Barros (2014). The simulations support
   the hypothesis that ridge-valley precipitation gradients, and in
   particular the reverse orographic enhancement effects in inner mountain
   valleys, are linked to horizontal heterogeneity in the vertical
   structure of low level clouds and precipitation promoted through
   landform controls on moisture convergence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We propose a novel, graph-theoretic framework for distinguishing

   vessel topology to better classify small and midsized vessels. We extend
   our previously proposed tree topology estimation framework by
   incorporating expert, domain-specific features to construct a simple,
   yet powerful global likelihood model. We efficiently maximize this model
   by iteratively exploring the space of possible solutions consistent with
   the projected vessels. We tested our method on four retinal datasets and
   achieved classification accuracies of 91.0\%, 93.5\%, 91.7\%, and
   90.9\%, outperforming existing methods. Our results show the
   effectiveness of our approach, which is capable of analyzing the entire
   vasculature, including peripheral vessels, in wide field-of-view fundus
   photographs. This topology-based method is a potentially important tool
   for diagnosing diseases with retinal vascular manifestation.}},

Abstract = {{Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) represents a
   principle quality control mechanism to clear misfolded proteins in the
   ER; however, its physiological significance and the nature of endogenous
   ERAD substrates remain largely unexplored. Here we discover that IRE1
   alpha, the sensor of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a bona fide
   substrate of the Sel1L-Hrdl ERAD complex. ERAD-mediated IRE1 alpha
   degradation occurs under basal conditions in a BiP-dependent manner,
   requires both the intramembrane hydrophilic residues of IRE1 alpha and
   the lectin protein OS9, and is attenuated by ER stress. ERAD deficiency
   causes IRE1 alpha protein stabilization, accumulation and mild
   activation both in vitro and in vivo. Although enterocyte-specific
   Sel1L-knockout mice (Se/1L(Delta IEC)) are viable and seem normal, they
   are highly susceptible to experimental colitis and
   inflammation-associated dysbiosis, in an IRE1 alpha-dependent but
   CHOP-independent manner. Hence, Sel1L-Hrdl ERAD serves a distinct,
   essential function in restraint of IRE1 alpha signalling in vivo by
   managing its protein turnover.}},

Abstract = {{Metasurfaces comprising arrays of film-coupled, nanopatch antennas are a
   promising platform for low-energy, all-optical switches. The large field
   enhancements that can be achieved in the dielectric spacer region
   between the nanopatch and the metallic substrate can substantially
   enhance optical nonlinear processes. Here we consider a dielectric
   material that exhibits an optical Kerr effect as the spacer layer and
   numerically calculate the optical bistability of a metasurface using the
   finite element method (FEM). We expect the proposed method to be highly
   accurate compared with other numerical approaches, such as those based
   on graphical post-processing techniques, because it self-consistently
   solves for both the spatial field distribution and the
   intensity-dependent refractive index distribution of the spacer layer.
   This method offers an alternative approach to finite-difference
   time-domain (FDTD) modeling. We use this numerical tool to design a
   metasurface optical switch and our optimized design exhibits
   exceptionally low switching intensity of 33 kW/cm(2), corresponding to
   switching energy on the order of tens of attojoules per resonator, a
   value much smaller than those found for most devices reported in the
   literature. We propose our method as a tool for designing all-optical
   switches and modulators. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{240-255}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{While the significance of leaf transpiration (f(e)) on carbon and water
   cycling is rarely disputed, conflicting evidence has been reported on
   how increasing mean wind speed (U) impacts f(e) from leaves. Here,
   conditions promoting enhancement or suppression of f(e) with increasing
   U for a wide range of environmental conditions are explored numerically
   using leaf-level gas exchange theories that combine a stomatal
   conductance model based on optimal water use strategies (maximizing the
   `net' carbon gain at a given f(e)), energy balance considerations, and
   biochemical demand for CO2. The analysis showed monotonic increases in
   f(e) with increasing U at low light levels. However, a decline in
   modeled f(e) with increasing U were predicted at high light levels but
   only in certain instances. The dominant mechanism explaining this
   decline in modeled f(e) with increasing U is a shift from evaporative
   cooling to surface heating at high light levels. New and published sap
   flow measurements for potted Pachira macrocarpo and Messerschmidia
   argemea plants conducted in a wind tunnel across a wide range of U (2 -
   8 m s(-1)) and two different soil moisture conditions were also employed
   to assess how f(e) varies with increasing U. The radiative forcing
   imposed in the wind tunnel was only restricted to the lower end of
   expected field conditions. At this low light regime, the findings from
   the wind tunnel experiments were consistent with the predicted trends.

Abstract = {{Chemical processes influence the mechanical properties of geomaterials,
   resulting in either strengthening or weakening effects, the latter being
   particularly critical for long-term safety assessment in civil and
   energy engineering. Coupling of chemical and mechanical processes in
   cemented soils and rocks is investigated starting form a
   micro-structural chemo-mechanical model. The model consists of an
   assembly of grains and bonds undergoing dissolution or precipitation of
   mineral mass, affecting geometrical characteristics of the assembly. The
   principal such characteristics are the evolution of specific surface
   area and of bond cross-sectional area at the micro-scale, and of
   porosity at the macro-scale, which become key variables linking the
   micro-scale and macro-scale mechanisms. This framework has the advantage
   of avoiding unphysical situations, such as the occurrence of mineral
   precipitation with no pore space available or the occurrence of
   dissolution with no cementing material left. The evolution of important
   micromechanical quantities, such as the number of active bonds and their
   cross section is tracked. At the macro-scale, a reactive
   chemo-plasticity model is combined with a model for bonded geomaterials.
   The resulting micro- to macro-scale transition, schematically applicable
   to both materials with reactive grains and bonds and materials with only
   reacting bonds, is validated against the available experimental
   evidence, concerning calcarenite with both reactive bonds and grains
   made of the same mineral. The model is thus shown to provide a flexible
   framework for a consistent interpretation of experimental loading paths,
   and can be readily extended to more complex circumstances. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates an integrated device combining both EWD droplet
   actuation and intra-droplet magnetic bead manipulation. Magnetic bead
   manipulation is achieved by using current-carrying wires acting as
   microelectromagnets. The current wire structure is capable of
   segregating and separating magnetic beads within a droplet. By adjusting
   the amount of current in the wire structure, high segregation efficiency
   within the droplet is shown and the separation of two kinds of beads is
   realized within a distance of 65 A mu m. The EWD droplet actuation
   function and the magnetic bead separation function can be operated
   independently, which provides flexibility when designing operation
   protocols. The current wire structure is embedded in an EWD electrode
   without affecting droplet actuation. The vertical structure of the
   device and its fabrication process are also the same as a normal EWD
   device. Magnetic bead segregation efficiency of 96.8 \% was achieved for
   2.8-A mu m beads that were collected over a distance of 65 A mu m during
   a 20-s current pulse. Droplet splitting is shown to allow complete
   separation of beads into one of the two daughter droplets. And,
   intra-droplet separation of 1- and 2.8-A mu m beads was demonstrated
   over an average distance of 65 A mu m. This experiment shows the
   feasibility of performing separation in droplets with a complex mixture
   of multiple beads, each having different magnetic contents.}},

Pages = {{1223-1228}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Filled skutterudites RxCo4Sb12 are excellent n-type thermoelectric
   materials owing to their high electronic mobility and high effective
   mass, combined with low thermal conductivity associated with the
   addition of filler atoms into the void site. The favourable electronic
   band structure in n-type CoSb3 is typically attributed to threefold
   degeneracy at the conduction band minimum accompanied by linear band
   behaviour at higher carrier concentrations, which is thought to be
   related to the increase in effective mass as the doping level increases.
   Using combined experimental and computational studies, we show instead
   that a secondary conduction band with 12 conducting carrier pockets
   (which converges with the primary band at high temperatures) is
   responsible for the extraordinary thermoelectric performance of n-type
   CoSb3 skutterudites. A theoretical explanation is also provided as to
   why the linear (or Kane-type) band feature is not beneficial for
   thermoelectrics.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenome editing with the CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced,
   short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 platform is a promising technology for
   modulating gene expression to direct cell phenotype and to dissect the
   causal epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. Fusions of
   nuclease-inactive dCas9 to the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor
   (dCas9-KRAB) can silence target gene expression, but the genome-wide
   specificity and the extent of heterochromatin formation catalyzed by
   dCas9-KRAB are not known. We targeted dCas9-KRAB to the HS2 enhancer, a
   distal regulatory element that orchestrates the expression of multiple
   globin genes, and observed highly specific induction of H3K9
   trimethylation (H3K9me3) at the enhancer and decreased chromatin
   accessibility of both the enhancer and its promoter targets. Targeted
   epigenetic modification of HS2 silenced the expression of multiple
   globin genes, with minimal off-target changes in global gene expression.
   These results demonstrate that repression mediated by dCas9-KRAB is
   sufficiently specific to disrupt the activity of individual enhancers
   via local modification of the epigenome.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes some typical behavior encountered in the response
   of a harmonically-excited mechanical system in which a severe
   nonlinearity occurs due to an impact. Although such systems have
   received considerable recent attention (most of it from a theoretical
   viewpoint), the system scrutinized in this paper also involves a
   discrete input of energy at the impact condition. That is, it is kicked
   when contact is made. One of the motivations for this work is related to
   a classic pinball machine in which a ball striking a bumper experiences
   a sudden impulse, introducing additional unpredictability to the motion
   of the ball. A one-dimensional analog of a pinball machine was the
   subject of a detailed mathematical study in Pring and Budd (2011), and
   the current paper details behavior obtained from a mechanical experiment
   and describes dynamics not observed in a conventional (passive) impact
   oscillator. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To assess retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness at
   term-equivalent age in very preterm (< 32 weeks gestational age) vs
   term-born infant cohorts, and compare very preterm infant RNFL thickness
   with brain anatomy and neurodevelopment.
   DESIGN: Cohort study.
   METHODS: RNR, was semi-automatically segmented (1 eye per infant) in 57
   very preterm and 50 term infants with adequate images from bedside
   portable, handheld spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging
   at 37-42 weeks postmenstrual age. Mean RNFL thickness was calculated for
   the papillomacular bundle (-15 degrees to + 15 degrees) and temporal
   quadrant (-45 degrees to + 45 degrees) relative to the fovea-optic nerve
   axis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans clinically obtained
   in 26 very preterm infants were scored for global structural
   abnormalities by an expert masked to data except for age. Cognitive,
   language, and motor skills were assessed in 33 of the very preterm
   infants at 18-24 months corrected age.
   RESULTS: RNFL. was thinner for very preterm vs term infants at the
   papillomacular bundle ({[}mean +/- standard deviation] 61 +/- 17 vs 72
   +/- 13 mu m, P < .001) and temporal quadrant (72 +/- 21 vs 82 +/- 16 mu
   m, P = .005). In very preterm infants, thinner papillomacular bundle
   RNFL correlated with higher global brain MRI lesion burden index (R-2 =
   0.35, P = .001) and lower cognitive (R-2 = 0.18, P = .01) and motor (R-2
   = 0.17, P = .02) scores. Relationships were similar for temporal
   quadrant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Thinner RNFL in very preterm infants relative to term-born
   infants may relate to brain structure and neurodevelopment. (C) 2015 by

Abstract = {{Belief propagation (BP) is an efficient algorithm for calculating
   approximate marginal probability density function (PDF) in large-scale
   Gaussian graphical models. It is known that when BP converges, the mean
   calculated by BP is the exact mean of the marginal PDF, while the
   accuracy of the variance calculated by BP is in general poor and
   unpredictable. In this paper, an explicit error expression of the
   variance calculated by BP is derived. By novel representation of this
   error expression, a distributed message-passing algorithm is proposed to
   improve the accuracy of the variance calculated by BP. It is proved that
   the upper bound of the residual error in the improved variance
   monotonically decreases as the number of selected nodes in a particular
   set increases, and eventually vanishes to zero as the remaining graph
   becomes loop-free after removal of the selected nodes. Numerical
   examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:To report the intraoperative use of microscope-integrated
   optical coherence tomography (MIOCT) to enable visualization for
   Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) in 2
   patients with advanced bullous keratopathy.Methods:Patient 1 was an
   83-year-old female and patient 2 was a 28-year-old male both with
   limited vision and significant pain from bullous keratopathy who
   underwent palliative DSAEK. Because of the severity and chronicity of
   the corneal decompensation in both patients, the view past the anterior
   cornea was negligible using standard microscope illumination techniques.
   We used spectral-domain (Patient 1) and swept-source (Patient 2) MIOCT,
   both of which rely on infrared illumination, to visualize key parts of
   the DSAEK procedure.Results:Graft insertion, unfolding, tamponade, and
   attachment could be dynamically visualized intraoperatively despite the
   nearly opaque nature of the host corneas. Postoperatively, the grafts
   remained attached with significant corneal clearing, and there was
   improvement in visual acuity, and pain relief for both
   patients.Conclusions:MIOCT is a valuable tool for the corneal surgeon,
   allowing for DSAEK to be successfully performed even when the surgical
   microscope view is limited from severe corneal edema, as is often the
   case in patients with advanced bullous keratopathy. By using MIOCT,
   these patients can benefit from the advantages of DSAEK despite a
   clinically opaque cornea, which would otherwise be treated with a
   penetrating keratoplasty.}},

Abstract = {{Videos captured with hand-held cameras often suffer from a significant
   amount of blur, mainly caused by the inevitable natural tremor of the
   photographer's hand. In this work, we present an algorithm that removes
   blur due to camera shake by combining information in the Fourier domain
   from nearby frames in a video. The dynamic nature of typical videos with
   the presence of multiplemoving objects and occlusions makes this problem
   of camera shake removal extremely challenging, in particular when low
   complexity is needed. Given an input video frame, we first create a
   consistent registered version of temporally adjacent frames. Then, the
   set of consistently registered frames is blockwise fused in the Fourier
   domain with weights depending on the Fourier spectrum magnitude. The
   method is motivated from the physiological fact that camera shake blur
   has a random nature; therefore, nearby video frames are generally
   blurred differently. Experiments with numerous videos recorded in the
   wild, along with extensive comparisons, show that the proposed algorithm
   achieves state-of-the-art results while at the same time being much
   faster than its competitors.}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the corner-free truncation (CFT) strategy is proposed to
   terminate the circular boundary out of finite-difference time-domain
   (FDTD) region. Using the principle of reflection-free optimal thin film,
   the permittivity 8 and the permeability mu have been extended to the
   complex field. The electric conductivity sigma(e) and the equivalent
   magnetic loss sigma(m) relate to the complex value and are suitable for
   the impedance-matched condition (IMC). The propagation wave can be
   absorbed well at the circular boundary. Moreover, computational
   efficiency has been much enhanced when those useless square-corners have
   been eliminated by using the proposed method. In TMz wave, the
   sinusoidal wave is set near the circular boundary. Applying the CFT
   strategy, the E-z amplitudes and phases show the concentric circles in
   the different timesteps. Compared with the square PML, numerical
   experiments in near- and far-field have come to the fulfillment. At the
   same numerical example, the CFT strategy has higher accuracy than the
   conformal PML. These results have fully verified the effectiveness of
   the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous supercritical water oxidation reactor was designed and
   constructed to investigate the conversion of a feces simulant without
   the use of a co-fuel. The maximum reactor temperature and waste
   conversion was determined as a function of stoichiometric excess of

   48\% oxygen excess showed the highest temperature with full conversion.
   Factorial analysis was then used to determine the effects of feed
   Concentration, oxygen excess, inlet temperature, and operating pressure
   on the increase in the temperature of the reacting fluid as well as a
   newly defined non-dimensional number, N-ja representing heat transfer
   efficiency. Operating pressure and stoichiometric excess oxygen were
   found to have the most significant impacts on N-ja. Feed concentration
   had a significant impact on fluid temperature increase showing an
   average difference of 46.4 degrees C between the factorial levels. (C)

Title = {{The Spatio-temporal Statistical Structure and Ergodic Behaviour of
   Scalar Turbulence Within a Rod Canopy}},
Journal = {{BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{447-460}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Connections between the spatial and temporal statistics of turbulent
   flow, and their possible convergence to ensemble statistics as assumed
   by the ergodic hypothesis, are explored for passive scalars within a rod
   canopy. While complete ergodicity is not expected to apply over all the
   spatial domain within such heterogeneous flows, the fact that canopy
   turbulence exhibits self-similar characteristics at a given depth within
   the canopy encourages a discussion on necessary conditions for an
   `operational' ergodicity framework. Flows between roughness elements
   such as within canopies exhibit features that distinguish them from
   their well-studied classical boundary-layer counterparts. These
   differences are commonly attributed to short-circuiting of the energy
   cascade and the prevalence of intermittent von Karman vortex streets in
   the deeper layers of the canopy. Using laser-induced fluorescence
   measurements at two different depths within a rod canopy situated in a
   large flume, the spatio-temporal statistical properties and concomitant
   necessary conditions for ergodicity of passive scalar turbulence
   statistics are evaluated. First, the integral time and length scales are
   analyzed and their corresponding maximum values are used to guide the
   construction of an ensemble of independent realizations from repeated
   spatio-temporal concentration measurements. As a statistical analysis
   for an operational ergodicity check, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the
   distributions of temporal and spatial concentration series against the
   ensemble was conducted. The outcome of this test reveals that ergodicity
   is reasonably valid over the entire domain except close to the rod
   elements where wake-induced inhomogeneities and damped turbulence
   prevail. The spatial concentration statistics within a grid-cell (square
   domain formed by four corner rods) appear to be less ergodic than their
   temporal counterparts, which is not surprising given the periodicity and
   persistence of von Karman vortices in the flow field. Also, a local
   advection velocity of dominant eddies is inferred using lagged
   cross-correlations of scalar concentration time series at different
   spatial locations. The computed probability density function of this
   advection velocity agrees well with the laser Doppler anemometry
   measurements for the same rod canopy.}},

Pages = {{5152-5165}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We present a dictionary learning approach to compensate for the
   transformation of faces due to the changes in view point, illumination,
   resolution, and so on. The key idea of our approach is to force
   domain-invariant sparse coding, i. e., designing a consistent sparse
   representation of the same face in different domains. In this way, the
   classifiers trained on the sparse codes in the source domain consisting
   of frontal faces can be applied to the target domain (consisting of
   faces in different poses, illumination conditions, and so on) without
   much loss in recognition accuracy. The approach is to first learn a
   domain base dictionary, and then describe each domain shift (identity,
   pose, and illumination) using a sparse representation over the base
   dictionary. The dictionary adapted to each domain is expressed as the
   sparse linear combinations of the base dictionary. In the context of
   face recognition, with the proposed compositional dictionary approach, a
   face image can be decomposed into sparse representations for a given
   subject, pose, and illumination. This approach has three advantages.
   First, the extracted sparse representation for a subject is consistent
   across domains, and enables pose and illumination insensitive face
   recognition. Second, sparse representations for pose and illumination
   can be subsequently used to estimate the pose and illumination condition
   of a face image. Last, by composing sparse representations for the
   subject and the different domains, we can also perform pose alignment
   and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments using two public
   face data sets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach for face recognition.}},

   temperature throughout the winding volume. We show that the cooling
   passages can be sized such that the volumetric cooling is most
   effective. From this finding follows the number of passages and their
   distribution through the heat generating volume. The principle is
   developed analytically, and it is then validated based on numerical
   simulations of the cooling architecture. The paper also reports the
   thermodynamics basis of the self-pumping effect, and its natural
   occurrence as free convection in general, which includes atmospheric

Title = {{A functional assay-based strategy for nanomaterial risk forecasting}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{536}},
Pages = {{1029-1037}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{The study of nanomaterial impacts on environment, health and safety
   (nanoEHS) has been largely predicated on the assumption that exposure
   and hazard can be predicted from physical-chemical properties of
   nanomaterials. This approach is rooted in the view that nanoobjects
   essentially resemble chemicals with additional particle-based attributes
   that must be included among their intrinsic physical-chemical
   descriptors. With the exception of the trivial case of nanomaterials
   made from toxic or highly reactive materials, this approach has yielded
   few actionable guidelines for predicting nanomaterial risk. This article
   addresses inherent problems in structuring a nanoEHS research strategy
   based on the goal of predicting outcomes directly from nanomaterial
   properties, and proposes a framework for organizing data and designing
   integrated experiments based on functional assays (FAs). FAs are
   intermediary, semi-empirical measures of processes or functions within a
   specified system that bridge the gap between nanomaterial properties and
   potential outcomes in complex systems. The three components of a
   functional assay are standardized protocols for parameter determination
   and reporting, a theoretical context for parameter application and
   reference systems. We propose the identification and adoption of
   reference systems where FAs may be applied to provide parameter
   estimates for environmental fate and effects models, as well as
   benchmarks for comparing the results of FAs and experiments conducted in
   more complex and varied systems. Surface affinity and dissolution rate
   are identified as two critical FAs for characterizing nanomaterial
   behavior in a variety of important systems. The use of these FAs to
   predict bioaccumulation and toxicity for initial and aged nanomaterials
   is illustrated for the case of silver nanoparticles and Caenorhabditis
   elegans. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The core-shell Ag@C nanoparticles were prepared by hydrothermal method
   and the Ag@C/PVDF-TrFE composites were prepared by solution cast method.
   TEM showed that the silver cores with diameters in the range of 100-120
   nm are each covered with a carbon shell about 60-80 nm thick. SEM
   displayed that the Ag@C nanoparticles are homogenously dispersed in the
   PVDF-TrFE matrix. The DSC results indicated that the crystallinity of
   the composites decreased with the increasing content of the Ag@C
   nanoparticles. The dielectric tests showed that the permittivity of the
   composites increased obviously over the PVDF-TrFE with increasing
   content of Ag@C nanoparticles, owing to the interfacial polarization.
   The tan delta of the composites remained at a low level (similar to 0.03
   at 1000 Hz) because the carbon layer provides a barrier layer between
   the conductive fillers. Furthermore, the permittivity and the tan delta
   of the composites increased with increase of temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Electrode microstructure and processing can strongly influence
   lithium-ion battery performance such as capacity retention, power, and
   rate. Battery electrodes are multi-phase composite structures wherein
   conductive diluents and binder bond active material to a current
   collector. The structure and response of this composite network during
   repeated electrochemical cycling directly affects battery performance
   characteristics. We propose the fabric tensor formalism for describing
   the structure and evolution of the electrode microstructure. Fabric
   tensors are directional measures of particulate assemblies based on
   inter-particle connectivity, relating to the structural and transport
   properties of the electrode. Fabric tensor analysis is applied to
   experimental data-sets for positive electrode made of lithium nickel
   manganese cobalt oxide, captured by X-ray tomography for several
   compositions and consolidation pressures. We show that fabric tensors
   capture the evolution of inter-particle contact distribution and are
   therefore good measures for the internal state of and electronic
   transport within the electrode. The fabric tensor analysis is also
   applied to Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of electrode
   microstructures using spherical particles with size distributions from
   the tomography. These results do not follow the experimental trends,
   which indicates that the particle size distribution alone is not a
   sufficient measure for the electrode microstructures in DEM simulations.

Abstract = {{We investigate the non-linear dynamics of superparamagnetic beads moving
   around the periphery of patterned magnetic disks in the presence of an
   in-plane rotating magnetic field. Three different dynamical regimes are
   observed in experiments, including (1) phase-locked motion at low
   driving frequencies, (2) phase-slipping motion above the first critical
   frequency f(c1), and (3) phase-insulated motion above the second
   critical frequency f(c2). Experiments with Janus particles were used to
   confirm that the beads move by sliding rather than rolling. The rest of
   the experiments were conducted on spherical, isotropic magnetic beads,
   in which automated particle position tracking algorithms were used to
   analyze the bead dynamics. Experimental results in the phase-locked and
   phase-slipping regimes correlate well with numerical simulations.
   Additional assumptions are required to predict the onset of the
   phase-insulated regime, in which the beads are trapped in closed orbits;
   however, the origin of the phase-insulated state appears to result from
   local magnetization defects. These results indicate that these three
   dynamical states are universal properties of bead motion in non-uniform
   oscillators. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{94-113}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of RNAi in the late 1990s unlocked a new realm of
   therapeutic possibilities by enabling potent and specific silencing of
   theoretically any desired genetic target. Better elucidation of the
   mechanism of action, the impact of chemical modifications that stabilize
   and reduce nonspecific effects of siRNA molecules, and the key design
   considerations for effective delivery systems has spurred progress
   toward developing clinically-successful siRNA therapies. A logical aim
   for initial siRNA translation is local therapies, as delivering siRNA
   directly to its site of action helps to ensure that a sufficient dose
   reaches the target tissue, lessens the potential for off-target side
   effects, and circumvents the substantial systemic delivery barriers.
   While locally injected or topically applied siRNA has progressed into
   numerous clinical trials, an enormous opportunity exists to develop
   sustained-release, local delivery systems that enable both spatial and
   temporal control of gene silencing. This review focuses on material
   platforms that establish both localized and controlled gene silencing,
   with emphasis on the systems that show most promise for clinical
   translation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{4173-4177}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{An updated technique to develop biofidelity response corridors (BRCs) is
   presented. BRCs provide a representative range of time-dependent
   responses from multiple experimental tests of a parameter from multiple
   biological surrogates (often cadaveric). The study describes an approach
   for BRC development based on previous research, but that includes two
   key modifications for application to impact and accelerative loading.
   First, signal alignment conducted prior to calculation of the BRC
   considers only the loading portion of the signal, as opposed to the full
   time history. Second, a point-wise normalization (PWN) technique is
   introduced to calculate correlation coefficients between signals. The
   PWN equally weighs all time points within the loading portion of the
   signals and as such, bypasses aspects of the response that are not
   controlled by the experimentalist such as internal dynamics of the
   specimen, and interaction with surrounding structures. An application of
   the method is presented using previously-published thoracic loading data
   from 8 lateral sled PMHS tests conducted at 8.9 m/s. Using this method,
   the mean signals showed a peak lateral load of 8.48 kN and peak chest
   acceleration of 86.0 g which were similar to previously-published
   research (8.93 kN and 100.0 g respectively). The peaks occurred at
   similar times in the current and previous studies, but were delayed an
   average of 2.1 ms in the updated method. The mean time shifts calculated
   with the method ranged from 7.5\% to 9.5\%. of the event. The method may
   be of use in traditional injury biomechanics studies and emerging work
   on non-horizontal accelerative loading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{beta 2-adrenoceptor signaling regulates invadopodia formation to enhance
   tumor cell invasion}},
Journal = {{BREAST CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: For efficient metastatic dissemination, tumor cells form
   invadopodia to degrade and move through three-dimensional extracellular
   matrix. However, little is known about the conditions that favor
   invadopodia formation. Here, we investigated the effect of
   beta-adrenoceptor signaling - which allows cells to respond to stress
   neurotransmitters - on the formation of invadopodia and examined the
   effect on tumor cell invasion.
   Methods: To characterize the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
   beta-adrenergic signaling on the invasive properties of breast cancer
   cells, we used functional cellular assays to quantify invadopodia
   formation and to evaluate cell invasion in two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional environments. The functional significance of
   beta-adrenergic regulation of invadopodia was investigated in an
   orthotopic mouse model of spontaneous breast cancer metastasis.
   Results: beta-adrenoceptor activation increased the frequency of
   invadopodia-positive tumor cells and the number of invadopodia per cell.
   The effects were selectively mediated by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor
   subtype, which signaled through the canonical Src pathway to regulate
   invadopodia formation. Increased invadopodia occurred at the expense of
   focal adhesion formation, resulting in a switch to increased tumor cell
   invasion through three-dimensional extracellular matrix.
   beta(2)-adrenoceptor signaling increased invasion of tumor cells from
   explanted primary tumors through surrounding extracellular matrix,
   suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed increased spontaneous
   tumor cell dissemination in vivo. Selective antagonism of
   beta(2)-adrenoceptors blocked invadopodia formation, suggesting a
   pharmacological strategy to prevent tumor cell dissemination.
   Conclusion: These findings provide insight into conditions that control
   tumor cell invasion by identifying signaling through
   beta(2)-adrenoceptors as a regulator of invadopodia formation. These
   findings suggest novel pharmacological strategies for intervention, by
   using beta-blockers to target beta(2)-adrenoceptors to limit tumor cell
   dissemination and metastasis.}},

Title = {{Human Injury Criteria for Underwater Blasts}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Underwater blasts propagate further and injure more readily than
   equivalent air blasts. Development of effective personal protection and
   countermeasures, however, requires knowledge of the currently unknown
   human tolerance to underwater blast. Current guidelines for prevention
   of underwater blast injury are not based on any organized injury risk
   assessment, human data or experimental data. The goal of this study was
   to derive injury risk assessments for underwater blast using
   well-characterized human underwater blast exposures in the open
   literature. The human injury dataset was compiled using 34 case reports
   on underwater blast exposure to 475 personnel, dating as early as 1916.
   Using severity ratings, computational reconstructions of the blasts, and
   survival information from a final set of 262 human exposures, injury
   risk models were developed for both injury severity and risk of fatality
   as functions of blast impulse and blast peak overpressure. Based on
   these human data, we found that the 50\% risk of fatality from
   underwater blast occurred at 302 +/- 16 kPa-ms impulse. Conservatively,
   there is a 20\% risk of pulmonary injury at a kilometer from a 20 kg
   charge. From a clinical point of view, this new injury risk model
   emphasizes the large distances possible for potential pulmonary and gut
   injuries in water compared with air. This risk value is the first
   impulse-based fatality risk calculated from human data. The large-scale
   inconsistency between the blast exposures in the case reports and the
   guidelines available in the literature prior to this study further
   underscored the need for this new guideline derived from the unique
   dataset of actual injuries in this study.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for dual-mode-management of biofouling by modifying
   surface of silicone elastomers with zwitterionic polymeric grafts.
   Poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) was grafted from
   poly(vinylmethylsiloxane) elastomer substrates using thiol-ene click
   chemistry and surface-initiated, controlled radical polymerization.
   These surfaces exhibited both fouling resistance and triggered
   fouling-release functionality. The zwitterionic polymers exhibited
   fouling resistance over short-term (similar to hours) exposure to
   bacteria and barnacle cyprids. The biofilms that eventually accumulated
   over prolonged-exposure (similar to days) were easily detached by
   applying mechanical strain to the elastomer substrate. Such
   dual-functional surfaces may be useful in developing environmentally and
   biologically friendly coatings for biofouling management on marine,
   industrial, and biomedical equipment because they can obviate the use of
   toxic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Many proteins suffer from suboptimal pharmacokinetics (PK) that limit
   their utility as drugs. The efficient synthesis of polymer conjugates of
   protein drugs with tunable PK to optimize their in vivo efficacy is
   hence critical. We report here the first study of the in vivo behavior
   of a site-specific conjugate of a zwitterionic polymer and a protein. To
   synthesize the conjugate, we first installed an initiator for
   atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) at the N terminus of
   myoglobin (Mb-N-Br). Subsequently, in situ ATRP was carried out in
   aqueous buffer to grow an amine-functionalized polymer from Mb-N-Br. The
   cationic polymer was further derivatized to two zwitterionic polymers by
   treating the amine groups of the cationic polymer with iodoacetic acid
   to obtain poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) with a one-carbon spacer
   (PCBMA; C-1), and sequentially with 3-iodopropionic acid and iodoacetic
   acid to obtain PCBMA(mix) with a mixture of C-1 and C-2 spacers. The
   Mb-N-PCBMA polymer conjugates had a longer in vivo plasma halflife than
   a PEG-like comb polymer conjugate of similar molecular weights (MW). The
   structure of the zwitterion plays a role in controlling the in vivo
   behavior of the conjugate, as the PCBMA conjugate with a C-1 spacer had
   significantly longer plasma circulation than the conjugate with a
   mixture of C-1 and C-2 spacers.}},

Abstract = {{Due to their nanoscale dimensions, nanomaterials{''} possess a very high
   specific surface area, which directly informs their properties in energy
   conversion and storage and catalytic chemical transformation, among
   other applications. However, common laboratory scale samples of
   nanostructured films have a total surface area that is too small to
   measure by conventional techniques such as the Brunauer-Emmett Teller
   method, although they may have high gravimetric surface area. The
   methodology presented here allows for accurate measurement of the
   surface area of nanostructured films of a variety of materials, and
   involves two steps: uniformly and conformally functionalizing the
   surface of the nanostructured film under study by an ultrathin titanium
   oxide adhesion layer through atomic layer deposition, and quantifying
   the amount of adsorbed dye molecules on the TiO2 coated nanostructure
   film. Carbon nanostructures, especially nanomaterials making use of the
   exciting properties of graphene, are under investigation by numerous
   laboratories around the world, and were therefore chosen as ideal
   materials for the demonstration of this procedure. In this research, two
   nanomaterials of high aspect ratio were chosen for this purpose:
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes and a covalently bonded graphene-carbon
   nanotube material termed graphenated carbon nanotubes. This method has
   been successful in studying films with total surface area as low as 20
   cm(2) and was additionally used to probe the underlying mechanisms of
   highly effective charge storage in high graphene edge density carbon
   nanomaterials.}},

   Internally consistent DFT/GW approach}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{We follow the evolution of the ionization potential (IP) for the
   paradigmatic quasi-one-dimensional transacetylene family of conjugated
   molecules, from short to long oligomers and to the infinite polymer
   transpolyacetylene (TPA). Our results for short oligomers are very close
   to experimental available data. We find that the IP varies with oligomer
   length and converges to the given value for TPA with a smooth, coupled
   inverse-length-exponential behavior. Our prediction is based on an
   ``internally consistent{''} scheme to adjust the exchange mixing
   parameter alpha of the PBEh hybrid density functional, so as to obtain a
   description of the electronic structure consistent with the
   quasiparticle approximation for the IP. This is achieved by demanding
   that the corresponding quasiparticle correction, in the GW@PBEh
   approximation, vanishes for the IP when evaluated at PBEh(alpha(ic)). We
   find that alpha(ic) is also system-dependent and converges with
   increasing oligomer length, enabling the dependence of the IP and other
   electronic properties to be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing observations suggest Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) albedo
   has declined since 2001, even in the dry snow zone. We seek to explain
   the apparent dry snow albedo decline. We analyze samples representing
   2012-2014 snowfall across NW Greenland for black carbon and dust
   light-absorbing impurities (LAI) and model their impacts on snow albedo.
   Albedo reductions due to LAI are small, averaging 0.003, with episodic
   enhancements resulting in reductions of 0.01-0.02. No significant
   increase in black carbon or dust concentrations relative to recent
   decades is found. Enhanced deposition of LAI is not, therefore, causing
   significant dry snow albedo reduction or driving melt events. Analysis
   of Collection 5 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   surface reflectance data indicates that the decline and spectral shift
   in dry snow albedo contains important contributions from uncorrected
   Terra sensor degradation. Though discrepancies are mostly below the
   stated accuracy of MODIS products, they will require revisiting some
   prior conclusions with C6 data.}},

Title = {{Dynamic metamaterial aperture for microwave imaging}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{We present a dynamic metamaterial aperture for use in computational
   imaging schemes at microwave frequencies. The aperture consists of an
   array of complementary, resonant metamaterial elements patterned into
   the upper conductor of a microstrip line. Each metamaterial element
   contains two diodes connected to an external control circuit such that
   the resonance of the metamaterial element can be damped by application
   of a bias voltage. Through applying different voltages to the control
   circuit, select subsets of the elements can be switched on to create
   unique radiation patterns that illuminate the scene. Spatial information
   of an imaging domain can thus be encoded onto this set of radiation
   patterns, or measurements, which can be processed to reconstruct the
   targets in the scene using compressive sensing algorithms. We discuss
   the design and operation of a metamaterial imaging system and
   demonstrate reconstructed images with a 10:1 compression ratio. Dynamic
   metamaterial apertures can potentially be of benefit in microwave or
   millimeter wave systems such as those used in security screening and
   through-wall imaging. In addition, feature-specific or adaptive imaging
   can be facilitated through the use of the dynamic aperture. (c) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{The extended finite element method (X-FEM) has proven to be an accurate,
   robust method for solving embedded interface problems. With a few
   exceptions, the X-FEM has mostly been used in conjunction with
   piecewise-linear shape functions and an associated piecewise-linear
   geometrical representation of interfaces. In the current work, the use
   of spline-based finite elements is examined along with a Nitsche
   technique for enforcing constraints on an embedded interface. To obtain
   optimal rates of convergence, we employ a hierarchical local refinement
   approach to improve the geometrical representation of curved interfaces.
   We further propose a novel weighting for the interfacial consistency
   terms arising in the Nitsche variational form with B-splines. A
   qualitative dependence between the weights and the stabilization
   parameters is established with additional element level eigenvalue
   calculations. An important consequence of this weighting is that the
   bulk as well as the interfacial fields remain well behaved in the
   presence of large heterogeneities as well as elements with arbitrarily
   small volume fractions. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of
   the proposed method through several numerical examples. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Lignite is considered as a competitive energy raw material with high
   security of supply viewed from a global angle. However, lignite-fired
   power plants have many shortcomings, including high investment, low
   energy efficiency and high water use. To address these issues, the
   drying and water recovery technologies are integrated within
   lignite-fired power plants. Both air-cooling and wet-cooling units with
   three kinds of lignite as feeding fuel were analyzed quantitatively.
   Results showed that energy conservation and water conservation are
   obtained simultaneously. The power plant firing high moisture lignite
   becomes more environmental friendly with higher power generation
   efficiency and a lower water makeup rate than the one firing low
   moisture lignite. And further calculation revealed that the air-cooling
   unit needs no makeup water and even produces some water as it generates
   power, when the water carrying coefficient is higher than 40 g/MJ. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose: To test the effects of a novel Mn porphyrin oxidative stress
   modifier, Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)
   porphyrin (MnBuOE), for its radioprotective and radiosensitizing
   properties in normal tissue versus tumor, respectively.
   Methods and Materials: Murine oral mucosa and salivary glands were
   treated with a range of radiation doses with or without MnBuOE to
   establish the dose-effect curves for mucositis and xerostomia. Radiation
   injury was quantified by intravital near-infrared imaging of cathepsin
   activity, assessment of salivation, and histologic analysis. To evaluate
   effects of MnBuOE on the tumor radiation response, we administered the
   drug as an adjuvant to fractionated radiation of FaDu xenografts. Again,
   a range of radiation therapy (RT) doses was administered to establish
   the radiation dose-effect curve. The 50\% tumor control dose values with
   or without MnBuOE and dose-modifying factor were determined.
   Results: MnBuOE protected normal tissue by reducing RT-mediated
   mucositis, xerostomia, and fibrosis. The dose-modifying factor for
   protection against xerostomia was 0.77. In contrast, MnBuOE increased
   tumor local control rates compared with controls. The dose-modifying
   factor, based on the ratio of 50\% tumor control dose values, was 1.3.
   Immunohistochemistry showed that MnBuOE-treated tumors exhibited a
   significant influx of M1 tumor-associated macrophages, which provides
   mechanistic insight into its radiosensitizing effects in tumors.
   Conclusions: MnBuOE widens the therapeutic margin by decreasing the dose
   of radiation required to control tumor, while increasing normal tissue
   resistance to RT-mediated injury. This is the first study to
   quantitatively demonstrate the magnitude of a single drug's ability to
   radioprotect normal tissue while radiosensitizing tumor. (C) 2015

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{262-271}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The maintenance of anxiety disorders is thought to depend, in part, on
   deficits in extinction memory, possibly due to reduced contextual
   control of extinction that leads to fear renewal. Animal studies suggest
   that the neural circuitry responsible fear renewal includes the
   hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsomedial (dmPFC) and ventromedial (vmPFC)
   prefrontal cortex. However, the neural mechanisms of context-dependent
   fear renewal in humans remain poorly understood. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), combined with psychophysiology and
   immersive virtual reality, to elucidate how the hippocampus, amygdala,
   and dmPFC and vmPFC interact to drive the context-dependent renewal of
   extinguished fear. Healthy human participants encountered dynamic
   fear-relevant conditioned stimuli (CSs) while navigating through 3-D
   virtual reality environments in the MRI scanner. Conditioning and
   extinction were performed in two different virtual contexts. Twenty-four
   hours later, participants were exposed to the CSs without reinforcement
   while navigating through both contexts in the MRI scanner. Participants
   showed enhanced skin conductance responses (SCRs) to the
   previously-reinforced CS + in the acquisition context on Day 2,
   consistent with fear renewal, and sustained responses in the dmPFC. In
   contrast, participants showed low SCRs to the CSs in the extinction
   context on Day 2, consistent with extinction recall, and enhanced vmPFC
   activation to the non-reinforced CS -. Structural equation modeling
   revealed that the dmPFC fully mediated the effect of the hippocampus on
   right amygdala activity during fear renewal, whereas the vmPFC partially
   mediated the effect of the hippocampus on right amygdala activity during
   extinction recall. These results indicate dissociable contextual
   influences of the hippocampus on prefrontal pathways, which, in turn,
   determine the level of reactivation of fear associations. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The goal of resection of soft tissue sarcomas located in the extremity
   is to preserve limb function while completely excising the tumor with a
   margin of normal tissue. With surgery alone, one-third of patients with
   soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity will have local recurrence due to
   microscopic residual disease in the tumor bed. Currently, a limited
   number of intraoperative pathology-based techniques are used to assess
   margin status; however, few have been widely adopted due to sampling
   error and time constraints. To aid in intraoperative diagnosis, we
   developed a quantitative optical microscopy toolbox, which includes
   acriflavine staining, fluorescence microscopy, and analytic techniques
   called sparse component analysis and circle transform to yield
   quantitative diagnosis of tumor margins. A series of variables were
   quantified from images of resected primary sarcomas and used to optimize
   a multivariate model. The sensitivity and specificity for
   differentiating positive from negative ex vivo resected tumor margins
   was 82 and 75\%. The utility of this approach was tested by imaging the
   in vivo tumor cavities from 34 mice after resection of a sarcoma with
   local recurrence as a bench mark. When applied prospectively to images
   from the tumor cavity, the sensitivity and specificity for
   differentiating local recurrence was 78 and 82\%. For comparison, if
   pathology was used to predict local recurrence in this data set, it
   would achieve a sensitivity of 29\% and a specificity of 71\%. These
   results indicate a robust approach for detecting microscopic residual
   disease, which is an effective predictor of local recurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Following a shift from computing as a purchasable product to computing
   as a deliverable service to consumers over the Internet, cloud computing
   has emerged as a novel paradigm with an unprecedented success in turning
   utility computing into a reality. Like any emerging technology, with its
   advent, it also brought new challenges to be addressed. This work
   studies network and traffic aware virtual machine (VM) placement in a
   special cloud computing scenario from a provider's perspective, where
   certain infrastructure components have a predisposition to be the
   endpoints of a large number of intensive flows whose other endpoints are
   VMs located in physical machines (PMs). In the scenarios of interest,
   the performance of any VM is strictly dependent on the infrastructure's
   ability to meet their intensive traffic demands. We first introduce and
   attempt to maximize the total value of a metric named ``satisfaction{''}
   that reflects the performance of a VM when placed on a particular PM.
   The problem of finding a perfect assignment for a set of given VMs is
   NP-hard and there is no polynomial time algorithm that can yield optimal
   solutions for large problems. Therefore, we introduce several off-line
   heuristic-based algorithms that yield nearly optimal solutions given the
   communication pattern and flow demand profiles of subject VMs. With
   extensive simulation experiments we evaluate and compare the
   effectiveness of our proposed algorithms against each other and also
   against naive approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stream runoff is perhaps the most poorly represented process in
   ecohydrological stochastic soil moisture models. Here we present a
   rainfall-runoff model with a new stochastic description of runoff linked
   to soil moisture dynamics. We describe the rainfall-runoff system as the
   joint probability density function (PDF) of rainfall, soil moisture and
   runoff forced by random, instantaneous jumps of rainfall. We develop a
   master equation for the soil moisture PDF that accounts explicitly for a
   general state-dependent rainfall-runoff transformation. This framework
   is then used to derive the joint rainfall-runoff and soil
   moisture-runoff PDFs. Runoff is initiated by a soil moisture threshold
   and a linear progressive partitioning of rainfall based on the soil
   moisture status. We explore the dependence of the PDFs on the rainfall
   occurrence PDF (homogeneous or state-dependent Poisson process) and the
   rainfall magnitude PDF (exponential or mixed-exponential distribution).
   We calibrate the model to 63 years of rainfall and runoff data from the
   Upper Little Tennessee watershed (USA) and show how the new model can
   reproduce the measured runoff PDF.}},

Abstract = {{Head injury is a persistent and costly problem for both children and
   adults. Globally, approximately 10 million people are hospitalized each
   year for head injuries. Knowing the structural properties of the head is
   important for modeling the response of the head in impact, and for
   providing insights into mechanisms of head injury. Hence, the goal of
   this study was to measure the sub-injurious structural stiffness of
   whole pediatric heads. 12 cadaveric pediatric (20-week-gestation to 16
   years old) heads were tested in a battery of viscoelastic compression
   tests. The heads were compressed in both the lateral and anterior
   posterior directions to 5\% of gauge length at normalized deformation
   rates of 0.0005/s, 0.01/s, 0.1/s, and 0.3/s. Because of the non-linear
   nature of the response, linear regression models were used to calculate
   toe region (<2.5\%) and elastic region (>2.5\%) stiffness separately so
   that meaningful comparisons could be made across rate, age, and
   direction. The results showed that age was the dominant factor in
   predicting the structural stiffness of the human head. A large and
   statistically significant increase in the stiffness of both the toe
   region and the elastic region was observed with increasing age (p <
   0.0001), but no significant difference was seen across direction or
   normalized deformation rate. The stiffness of the elastic region
   increased from as low as 5 N/mm in the neonate to >4500 N/mm in the 16
   year old. The changes in stiffness with age may be attributed to the
   disappearance of soft sutures and the thickening of skull bones with
   age. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{In vivo small animal micro-CT using nanoparticle contrast agents}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most valuable modalities for in
   vivo imaging because it is fast, high-resolution, cost-effective, and
   non-invasive. Moreover, CT is heavily used not only in the clinic (for
   both diagnostics and treatment planning) but also in preclinical
   research as micro-CT. Although CT is inherently effective for lung and
   bone imaging, soft tissue imaging requires the use of contrast agents.
   For small animal micro-CT, nanoparticle contrast agents are used in
   order to avoid rapid renal clearance. A variety of nanoparticles have
   been used for micro-CT imaging, but the majority of research has focused
   on the use of iodine-containing nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles.
   Both nanoparticle types can act as highly effective blood pool contrast
   agents or can be targeted using a wide variety of targeting mechanisms.
   CT imaging can be further enhanced by adding spectral capabilities to
   separate multiple co injected nanoparticles in vivo. Spectral CT, using
   both energy integrating and energy resolving detectors, has been used
   with multiple contrast agents to enable functional and molecular
   imaging. This review focuses on new developments for in vivo small
   animal micro-CT using novel nanoparticle probes applied in preclinical
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The BDNF receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, underlies nervous system
   function in both health and disease. Excessive activation of TrkB caused
   by status epilepticus promotes development of temporal lobe epilepsy
   (TLE), revealing TrkB as a therapeutic target for prevention of TLE. To
   circumvent undesirable consequences of global inhibition of TrkB
   signaling, we implemented a novel strategy aimed at selective inhibition
   of the TrkB-activated signaling pathway responsible for TLE. Our studies
   of a mouse model reveal that phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) is
   the dominant signaling effector by which excessive activation of TrkB
   promotes epilepsy. We designed a novel peptide (pY816) that uncouples
   TrkB from PLCg1. Treatment with pY816 following status epilepticus
   inhibited TLE and prevented anxiety-like disorder yet preserved
   neuroprotective effects of endogenous TrkB signaling. We provide
   proof-of-concept evidence for a novel strategy targeting receptor
   tyrosine signaling and identify a therapeutic with promise for
   prevention of TLE caused by status epilepticus in humans.}},

Title = {{Influence of Sulfide Nanoparticles on Dissolved Mercury and Zinc
   Quantification by Diffusive Gradient in Thin-Film Passive Samplers}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},

Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Diffusive gradient in thin-film (DGT) passive samplers are frequently
   used to monitor the concentrations of metals such as mercury and zinc in
   sediments and other aquatic environments. The application of these
   samplers generally presumes that they quantify only the dissolved
   fraction and not particle-bound metal species that are too large to
   migrate into the sampler. However, metals associated with very small
   nanopartides (smaller than the pore size of DGT samplers) can be
   abundant in certain environments, yet the implications of these
   nanopartides for DGT measurements are unclear. The objective of this
   study was to determine how the performance of the DGT sampler is
   affected by the presence of nanoparticulate species of Hg and Zn. DGT
   samplers were exposed to solutions containing known amounts of dissolved
   Hg(II) and nanoparticulate HgS (or dissolved Zn(II) and nanoparticulate
   ZnS). The amounts of Hg and Zn accumulated onto the DGT samplers were
   quantified over hours to days, and the rates of diffusion of the
   dissolved metal (i.e., the effective diffusion coefficient D) into the
   sampler's diffusion layer were calculated and compared for solutions
   containing varying concentrations of nanopartides. The results suggested
   that the nanopartides deposited on the surface of the samplers might
   have acted as sorbents, slowing the migration of the dissolved species
   into the samplers. The consequence was that the DGT sampler data
   underestimated the dissolved metal concentration in the solution. In
   addition, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was employed to determine the
   speciation of the Hg accumulated on the sampler binding layer, and the
   results indicated that HgS nanoparticles did not appear to directly
   contribute to the DGT measurement. Overall, our findings suggest that
   the deployment of DGT samplers in settings where nanopartides are
   relevant (e.g., sediments) may result in DGT data that incorrectly
   estimated the dissolved metal concentrations. Models for metal uptake
   into the sampler may need to be reconsidered.}},

Title = {{Offline Washing Schemes for Residue Removal in Digital Microfluidic
   Biochips}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A digital microfluidic biochip (DMB) is often deployed for multiplexing
   several assays in space and in time. The residue left by one assay may
   contaminate the droplets used for subsequent assays. Biochemical assays
   involving cell culture and those based on particle microfluidics also
   require sweeping of residual media from an active droplet on-chip. Thus,
   fluidic operations such as washing or residue removal need to be
   performed routinely either to clean contamination from the droplet
   pathways or to rinse off certain droplets on the chip. In this work,
   several graph-based techniques are presented for offline washing of
   biochips that may have either a regular geometry (e.g., a 2Darray of
   electrodes), or an irregular geometry (e.g., an application-specific
   layout). The schemes can be used for total washing, that is, for
   cleaning the entire biochip or for selective washing of sites or
   pathways located sparsely on the chip. The problem of reducing the path
   length and washing time of the droplets is investigated with or without
   capacity constraints. The proposed algorithms for offline washing make
   use of several techniques such as graph traversal, integer linear
   programming (ILP) modeling, and customized heuristics based on the
   nature of the geometric distribution of the contamination profile. The
   contaminated pathways are assumed to be Manhattan or curved, and hence
   the techniques are applicable to the conventional field-actuated DMBs as
   well as to the emerging classes of light-actuated and active-matrix
   DMBs. These techniques will be useful in enhancing the reliability of a
   wide class of emerging digital microfluidic healthcare devices.}},

Title = {{Introduction to a special section on ecohydrology of semiarid
   environments: Confronting mathematical models with ecosystem complexity}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Current literature provides large number of publications about
   ecohydrological processes and their effect on the biota in drylands.
   Given the limited laboratory and field experiments in such systems, many
   of these publications are based on mathematical models of varying
   complexity. The underlying implicit assumption is that the data set used
   to evaluate these models covers the parameter space of conditions that
   characterize drylands and that the models represent the actual processes
   with acceptable certainty. However, a question raised is to what extent
   these mathematical models are valid when confronted with observed
   ecosystem complexity? This Introduction reviews the 16 papers that
   comprise the Special Section on Eco-hydrology of Semiarid Environments:
   Confronting Mathematical Models with Ecosystem Complexity. The subjects
   studied in these papers include rainfall regime, infiltration and
   preferential flow, evaporation and evapotranspiration, annual net
   primary production, dispersal and invasion, and vegetation greening. The
   findings in the papers published in this Special Section show that
   innovative mathematical modeling approaches can represent actual field
   measurements. Hence, there are strong grounds for suggesting that
   mathematical models can contribute to greater understanding of ecosystem
   complexity through characterization of space-time dynamics of biomass
   and water storage as well as their multiscale interactions. However, the
   generality of the models and their low-dimensional representation of
   many processes may also be a ``curse'' that results in failures when
   particulars of an ecosystem are required. It is envisaged that the
   search for a unifying ``general'' model, while seductive, may remain
   elusive in the foreseeable future. It is for this reason that improving
   the merger between experiments and models of various degrees of
   complexity continues to shape the future research agenda.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the reversible micellar aggregation of a DNA-azobenzene

   disassembly of the aggregates. The molecular basis for this phenomena is
   a change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the conjugate as the
   more polar cis azobenzene isomer is formed upon exposure to 365 nm
   irradiation. The conjugates were prepared by copper-free Click chemistry
   between an azide-modified, 53-base ssDNA and a cyclooctyne derivative of
   azobenzene. The photocontrolled aggregation of the conjugate was studied
   by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. The reversible
   micellar aggregation for a DNA-azobenzene conjugate has not been
   previously reported and holds promise for photocontrolled drug delivery

Abstract = {{The transverse oscillation method enables lateral displacement tracking
   by generating an oscillation orthogonal to the conventional RF signal.
   The widely varying methods used in the field to create such oscillations
   and perform displacement estimation make it difficult to compare the
   expected performance of alternative techniques. We derive closed-form
   expressions for the oscillating pressure fields produced by two common
   apodization functions-the rectangular and bi-lobed Gaussian
   apodizations-after heterodyning demodulation is applied to separate the
   orthogonally-oscillating signals. With these fields and spectra we
   present a form of the Cramer-Rao lower bound for ultrasonic signals that
   contains a spectrum shape term, allowing theoretical prediction of
   relative performance across different techniques and parameter choices.
   Simulations show good agreement with the trends predicted by the
   theoretical results for the chosen class of aperture functions. The
   simulations demonstrate the importance of frequency-space analysis in
   devising a transverse oscillation scheme and suggest that the study of
   other classes of aperture functions and field formation techniques
   should be continued to further improve the accuracy of lateral
   displacement tracking.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the first handheld, swept source optical coherence
   tomography (SSOCT) system capable of imaging both the anterior and
   posterior segments of the eye in rapid succession. A single 2D
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) scanner was utilized for both
   imaging modes, and the optical paths for each imaging mode were
   optimized for their respective application using a combination of
   commercial and custom optics. The system has a working distance of 26.1
   mm and a measured axial resolution of 8 mu m (in air). In posterior
   segment mode, the design has a lateral resolution of 9 mu m, 7.4 mm
   imaging depth range (in air), 4.9 mm 6dB fall-off range (in air), and
   peak sensitivity of 103 dB over a 22 degrees field of view (FOV). In
   anterior segment mode, the design has a lateral resolution of 24 mu m,
   imaging depth range of 7.4 mm (in air), 6dB fall-off range of 4.5 mm (in
   air), depth-of-focus of 3.6 mm, and a peak sensitivity of 99 dB over a
   17.5 mm FOV. In addition, the probe includes a wide-field iris imaging
   system to simplify alignment. A fold mirror assembly actuated by a
   bi-stable rotary solenoid was used to switch between anterior and
   posterior segment imaging modes, and a miniature motorized translation
   stage was used to adjust the objective lens position to correct for
   patient refraction between -12.6 and + 9.9 D. The entire probe weighs
   less than 630 g with a form factor of 20.3 x 9.5 x 8.8 cm. Healthy

Journal = {{DNA REPAIR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{71-84}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In Escherichia coli, errors in newly-replicated DNA, such as the
   incorporation of a nucleotide with a mispaired base or an accidental
   insertion or deletion of nucleotides, are corrected by a methyl-directed
   mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. While the enzymology of MMR has long been
   established, many fundamental aspects of its mechanisms remain elusive,
   such as the structures, compositions, and orientations of complexes of
   MutS, MutL, and MutH as they initiate repair. Using atomic force
   microscopy, we for the first time record the structures and locations of
   individual complexes of MutS, MutL and MutH bound to DNA molecules
   during the initial stages of mismatch repair. This technique reveals a
   number of striking and unexpected structures, such as the growth and
   disassembly of large multimeric complexes at mismatched sites, complexes
   of MutS and MutL anchoring latent MutH onto hemi-methylated d(GATC)
   sites or bound themselves at nicks in the DNA, and complexes directly
   bridging mismatched and hemi-methylated d(GATC) sites by looping the
   DNA. The observations from these single-molecule studies provide new
   opportunities to resolve some of the long-standing controversies in the
   field and underscore the dynamic heterogeneity and versatility of MutSLH
   complexes in the repair process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Methods of stitching static panoramas are unsuitable for video-rate
   stitching from camera arrays, because these methods are too
   computationally intensive for real-time operation and do not take
   advantage of prior knowledge of camera positions or the coherence
   between successive frames of a video sequence. We propose feedback
   stitching, which embeds the stitching process in a feedback loop, so
   that as new frames are captured, any new stitching errors occurring in
   the video sequence are analyzed and corrected as the sequence
   progresses. These algorithms are suitable for multiscale cameras, a
   camera array technology proven to be capable of gigapixel snapshot and
   video imaging, to allow for real-time compensation of any registration
   or parallax errors. (C) 2015 SPIE and IS\&T}},

Title = {{PRELIMINARY RESULTS ON THE FEASIBILITY OF USING ARFI/SWEI TO ASSESS
   CUTANEOUS SCLEROTIC DISEASES}},

Abstract = {{In this study, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and shear wave
   elasticity imaging (SWEI) were applied to the skin to investigate the
   feasibility of their use in assessing sclerotic skin diseases. Our
   motivation was to develop a non-invasive imaging technology with
   real-time feedback of sclerotic skin disease diagnosis. This paper shows
   representative results from an ongoing study, recruiting patients with
   and without sclerosis. The stiffness of the imaged site was evaluated
   using two metrics: mean ARFI displacement magnitude and bulk shear wave
   speed inside the region of interest (ROI). In a subject with localized
   graft versus host disease (GVHD), the mean ARFI displacement inside
   sclerotic skin was 61\% lower (p < 0.01) and shear wave speed 128\%
   higher (p < 0.005) compared to those in normal skin-indicating stiffer
   mechanical properties in the sclerotic skin. This trend persisted
   through disease types. We conclude ARFI and SWEI can successfully
   differentiate sclerotic lesions from normal dermis. (E-mail:

Title = {{Observations and Assessment of Fly Ashes from High-Sulfur Bituminous
   Coals and Blends of High-Sulfur Bituminous and Subbituminous Coals:

Abstract = {{Fly ash was investigated with a variety of chemical, Mineralogical,
   petrographic, and microbeam:techniques from three coal-fired units, at
   two Kentucky power plants. Two units burn high sulfur Illinois Basin
   high volatile bituminous (hvb),coal) and the third unit burns a similar
   to 70:30 blend of high-sulfur Illinois Basin hvb Coal and law-sulfur,
   relatively high-CaO Powder Rivet Basin subbituminous coal. With high-S,
   high-Fe coals in all of the blends, spinel (Magnetite), is an important
   constituent in the fly ashes. Overall, the fly ashes are dominated by
   glass. Portlandite was noted in the high-Ca-coal-derived ash:
   Concentrations of Ba and Sr are highest in the latter fly ash,,a
   function of the Powder River Basin coal source for a portion of the
   blend. Rare earth elements do not have a high concentration in any of
   the fly ashes and do not show any significant partitioning between the
   electrostatic precipitator (ESP) Or baghouse rows in the individual
   generating units. In contrast to previously studied fly ashes from
   plants burning hvb,coals and to other fly ash specimens in this study,
   the fly ash from the unit burning the Illinois Basin/Powder River Basin
   coal blend did not have nanoscale carbon on the surface of the spherical
   inorganic fly ash particles. The absence of carbon may be a function of
   the nature of the feed coal, with 30\% derived from the non-caking
   sub-bituminous, component in the coal blend, although some contribution
   of carbon derived-from caking hvb coal would be,expected. The fly ash
   carbon content is very low, suggesting that the amount of carbon rather
   than or along with the tank of the coal May be a determining,factor in
   the absence of nanoscale carbon deposition on the surface of the fly ash
   particles.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Here we develop analytically the formulas for effective permeability in
   several configurations using the closed-form description of tree
   networks designed to provide flow access. The objective was to find the
   relation between the permeability and porosity of tree-shaped fissures.
   We found the effect of the fracture size on the permeability for fixed
   number of bifurcation and the results showed that the permeability of
   the fracture network increased rapidly with the size of the fracture.
   Next, we found a relation between the Reservoir Quality Index (RQI) and
   the porosity of the fracture. The results in this paper have been
   validated by comparison with experimental and numerical results. We show
   that the permeability formulas do not vary much from one tree design to
   the next, suggesting that similar formulas may apply to naturally
   fissured porous media with unknown precise details, which occur in
   natural reservoirs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},
