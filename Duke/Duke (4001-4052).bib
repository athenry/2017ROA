Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) from blast produces a number of conundrums.
   This review focuses on five fundamental questions including: (1) What
   are the physical correlates for blast TBI in humans? (2) Why is there
   limited evidence of traditional pulmonary injury from blast in current
   military field epidemiology? (3) What are the primary blast brain injury
   mechanisms in humans? (4) If TBI can present with clinical symptoms
   similar to those of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), how do we
   clinically differentiate blast TBI from PTSD and other psychiatric
   conditions? (5) How do we scale experimental animal models to human
   response? The preponderance of the evidence from a combination of
   clinical practice and experimental models suggests that blast TBI from
   direct blast exposure occurs on the modern battlefield. Progress has
   been made in establishing injury risk functions in terms of blast
   overpressure time histories, and there is strong experimental evidence
   in animal models that mild brain injuries occur at blast intensities
   that are similar to the pulmonary injury threshold. Enhanced thoracic
   protection from ballistic protective body armor likely plays a role in
   the occurrence of blast TBI by preventing lung injuries at blast
   intensities that could cause TBI. Principal areas of uncertainty include
   the need for a more comprehensive injury assessment for mild blast
   injuries in humans, an improved understanding of blast TBI
   pathophysiology of blast TBI in animal models and humans, the
   relationship between clinical manifestations of PTSD and mild TBI from
   blunt or blast trauma including possible synergistic effects, and
   scaling between animals models and human exposure to blasts in wartime
   and terrorist attacks. Experimental methodologies, including location of
   the animal model relative to the shock or blast source, should be
   carefully designed to provide a realistic blast experiment with
   conditions comparable to blasts on humans. If traditional blast scaling
   is appropriate between species, many reported rodent blast TBI
   experiments using air shock tubes have blast overpressure conditions
   that are similar to human long-duration nuclear blasts, not high
   explosive blasts.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{195}},

Pages = {{222-231}},
Abstract = {{The utility of decellularized native tissues for tissue engineering has
   been widely demonstrated. Here, we examine the production of
   decellularized lung scaffolds from native rodent lung using two
   different techniques, principally defined by use of either the detergent
   3-{[}(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) or
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). All viable cellular material is removed,
   including at least 99\% of DNA. Histochemical staining and mechanical
   testing indicate that collagen and elastin are retained in the
   decellularized matrices with CHAPS-based decellularization, while
   SDS-based decellularization leads to loss of collagen and decline in
   mechanical strength. Quantitative assays confirm that most collagen is
   retained with CHAPS treatment but that about 80\% of collagen is lost
   with SDS treatment. In contrast, for both detergent methods, at least
   60\% of elastin content is lost along with about 95\% of native
   proteoglycan content. Mechanical testing of the decellularized scaffolds
   indicates that they are mechanically similar to native lung using CHAPS
   decellularization, including retained tensile strength and elastic
   behavior, demonstrating the importance of collagen and elastin in lung
   mechanics. With SDS decellularization, the mechanical integrity of
   scaffolds is significantly diminished with some loss of elastic function
   as well. Finally, a simple theoretical model of peripheral lung matrix
   mechanics is consonant with our experimental findings. This work
   demonstrates the feasibility of producing a decellularized lung scaffold
   that can be used to study lung matrix biology and mechanics, independent
   of the effects of cellular components. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are a class of stimulus-responsive
   biopolymers whose physicochemical properties and biocompatibility are
   particularly suitable for in vivo applications, such as drug delivery
   and tissue engineering. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST)
   behavior of ELPs allows them to be utilized as soluble macromolecules
   below their LCST, or as self-assembled nanoscale particles such as
   micelles, micron-scale coacervates, or viscous gels above their LCST,
   depending on the ELP architecture. As each ELP sequence is specified at
   its genetic level, functionalization of an ELP with peptides and
   proteins is simple to accomplish by the fusion of a gene encoding an ELP
   with that of the peptide or protein of interest. Protein ELP fusions,
   where the appended protein serves a therapeutic or targeting function,
   are suitable for applications in which the ELP can improve the systemic
   pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the protein, or can be used as
   an injectable depot for sustained, local protein delivery. Here we
   describe considerations in the design of therapeutic protein ELP fusions
   and provide details of their gene design, expression, and purification.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A computational study of mass transport by large-amplitude, mode-2
   internal solitary waves propagating on a pycnocline between two layers
   of different densities was conducted. The numerical model is based on
   the simulation of a vorticity-based formulation of the two-dimensional
   Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq limit. Numerical experiments
   are conducted of the collapse of an initially mixed region, which leads
   to the generation of a train of internal solitary waves. The peak wave
   amplitude, a, is achieved by the leading wave, which encloses an
   intrusional bulge. The wave amplitude decays as it moves away from the
   collapsing mixing region. When the amplitude drops below a critical
   value, the wave is no longer able to transport mass and sharp-nosed
   intrusion is left behind. Mass transport by the leading wave, and by the
   trailing wave train and intrusion, is analyzed by tracking the motion of
   Lagrangian particles initially concentrated in the mixed region. Results
   indicate that for moderate wave amplitudes, a gradual decay in the wave
   amplitude occurs as the wave propagates, but the structure of the bulge
   is essentially maintained during this process. In contrast, for
   large-amplitude waves, the motion around the bulge is substantially more
   complex, exhibiting periodic shedding of vortex structures in the wake
   of the bulge and entrainment of external fluid into its core. It is
   shown that these motions have substantial impact on mass transport by
   the wave train, which is quantified through detailed analysis of the
   Lagrangian particle distributions. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{The past 10-15 years have seen important extensions of the mortar
   method, a technique for joining dissimilar grids popularized by the
   domain decomposition community, to the more general problem of contact
   and impact interactions in finite element analysis. This development has
   taken place largely in response to several long-standing problems in
   computational contact mechanics: lack of robustness in solution of the
   nonlinear and nonsmooth equations of evolution: degradation of spatial
   convergence rates in problems involving nonconforming meshes on
   interfaces; lack of a variationally consistent technique for stress
   recovery on interfaces; and so on. This survey paper summarizes some of
   the major steps in development of mortar contact formulations. It begins
   with a basic summary of the mortaring idea in the context of tied
   contact, it discusses key concepts required for the extension of these
   methods to large deformation, large sliding formulations of
   contact-impact, and it previews new results where lessons learned from
   mortar contact formulations can be extended to a much broader class of
   interface mechanics applications, considering in particular enriched
   interface formulations and embedded interface approaches to
   fluid-structure interaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{IEEE- and ASTM-adopted dedicated short-range communications (DSRC)
   standards are key enabling technologies for the next generation of
   vehicular safety communications. Vehicle-safety-related communication
   services, which require reliable and fast message delivery, usually
   demand broadcast communications in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).
   In this paper, we propose and justify a distributive cross-layer scheme
   for the design of the control channel in DSRC with three levels of
   broadcast services that are critical to most potential
   vehicle-safety-related applications. The new scheme for enhancing
   broadcast reliability includes preemptive priority in safety services,
   dynamic receiver-oriented packet repetitions for one-hop emergency
   warning message dissemination, a multifrequency busy tone and minislot
   within the distributed interframe space (DIFS) in IEEE 802.11, and
   robust distance-based relay selection for multihop broadcast of
   emergency notification messages. Compared with a current draft of IEEE
   802.11p and other schemes for DSRC safety-related services, the scheme
   proposed in this paper is more robust and scalable and easy to
   implement. Additionally, we investigate the reliability and performance
   of the proposed broadcast scheme for DSRC VANET safety-related services
   on the highway analytically and by simulations. The analytic model
   accounts for the impact of the hidden terminal problem, the fading
   channel conditions, varied message arrival intervals, and the backoff
   counter process on reliability and performance.}},

   hydroclimatic phases in Mediterranean areas: the well-watered conditions
   in which evapotranspiration and assimilation assume their maximum values
   and the real conditions where the limitations induced by soil moisture
   availability are taken into account. Annual olive yield is obtained by
   integrating the carbon assimilation during the growing season, including
   the effects of vegetation water stress on biomass allocation. This
   numerical model has been tested on an olive orchard located in Sicily
   (Italy) obtaining a satisfactory reproduction of historical olive yield

Abstract = {{Nonlinear piezoelectric effects in flexural energy harvesters have
   recently been demonstrated for drive amplitudes well within the scope of
   anticipated vibration environments for power generation. In addition to
   strong softening effects, steady-state oscillations are highly damped as
   well. Nonlinear fluid damping was previously employed to successfully
   model drive dependent decreases in frequency response due to the
   high-velocity oscillations, but this article instead harmonizes with a
   body of literature concerning weakly excited piezoelectric actuators by
   modeling nonlinear damping with nonconservative piezoelectric
   constitutive relations. Thus, material damping is presumed dominant over
   losses due to fluid-structure interactions. Cantilevers consisted of
   lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-5A and PZT-5H are studied, and the
   addition of successively larger proof masses is shown to precipitate
   nonlinear resonances at much lower base excitation thresholds while
   increasing the influence of higher-order nonlinearities. Parameter
   identification results using a multiple scales perturbation solution
   suggest that empirical trends are primarily due to higher-order elastic
   and dissipation nonlinearities and that modeling linear
   electromechanical coupling is sufficient. This article concludes with
   the guidelines for which utilization of a nonlinear model is preferred.}},

   with a tapered polymer (SU-8-2002) waveguide and overlap coupled
   SU-8-2002 microring resonator is achieved on an SiO2/Si platform. Two

   the front facet, were demonstrated, and this laser/waveguide structure
   was then integrated with a polymer microring resonator on SiO2/Si.
   Lasing operation for the integrated system was verified through
   power-current characteristics and spectra at the through and drop ports
   of the microring resonator. This integrated system forms an essential

Abstract = {{Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease associated with pain and
   loss of function in numerous diarthrodial joints of the body.
   Assessments of the severity and/or progression of OA are commonly based
   on radiographic stages and pain level, which aren't always correlated to
   severity of disease or joint dysfunction and may be confounded by other
   factors'. There has been recent interest in identifying a biochemical
   signature of OA(1) that may be detected in serum, urine, and/or synovial
   fluid that would represent repeatable and predictable biomarlcers of OA
   onset and/or progression. The objective of this study was to use global
   metabolic profiling to identify a distinct metabolic profile for
   cultured human synovial tissue from patients with end-stage OA compared
   to patients with little or no evidence of disease. While metabolic
   profiles from cultured tissues are not expected to reproduce in vivo
   profiles, it is expected that perturbations in metabolism caused by
   end-stage disease would result in differences in metabolic profiles in
   vitro compared to tissue with little or no evidence of disease. Because
   metabolomic perturbations often occur prior to alterations in the genome
   or proteome, metabolomic analysis possibly provides an earlier window to
   an altered biochemical profile for OA onset and/or progression, and may
   provide a unique set of potential drug targets. The synovium was
   targeted because it has been implicated in OA as a mediator of disease
   progression; osteoarthritic synovium has been demonstrated to express
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor -
   alpha(TNF-alpha.), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6(2),
   suggesting that a diseased synovial lining could produce an ideal set of
   biomarkers for diagnosing OA and/or monitoring disease progression.
   Media from the culture of synovial explants dissected from diseased
   human joints (early or end-stage OA) was subjected to global metabolic
   profiling with a liquid chromatography (LC)/and gas chromatography
   (GC)/mass spectrophotometry (MS)-based technology platform. Metabolites
   were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the
   experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries
   developed at Metabolon, Inc (Durham, NC). Global metabolic profiling
   resulted in the identification of 105 distinct compounds across all
   sample groups, with 11 compounds showing significantly different
   relative concentrations between end-stage and no/early disease groups.
   Metabolites specific to collagen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid
   metabolism, energy metabolism and tryptophan metabolism were amongst the
   most significant compounds, suggesting an altered metabolic state with
   disease progression. (C) 2011 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Abstract = {{Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) has promise as a means for
   delivering somatosensory feedback in neuroprosthetic systems. Various
   tactile sensations could be encoded by temporal, spatial, or
   spatiotemporal patterns of ICMS. However, the applicability of temporal
   patterns of ICMS to artificial tactile sensation during active
   exploration is unknown, as is the minimum discriminable difference
   between temporally modulated ICMS patterns. We trained rhesus monkeys in
   an active exploration task in which they discriminated periodic
   pulse-trains of ICMS (200 Hz bursts at a 10 Hz secondary frequency) from
   pulse trains with the same average pulse rate, but distorted periodicity
   (200 Hz bursts at a variable instantaneous secondary frequency). The
   statistics of the aperiodic pulse trains were drawn from a gamma
   distribution with mean inter-burst intervals equal to those of the
   periodic pulse trains. The monkeys distinguished periodic pulse trains
   from aperiodic pulse trains with coefficients of variation 0.25 or
   greater. Reconstruction of movement kinematics, extracted from the
   activity of neuronal populations recorded in the sensorimotor cortex
   concurrent with the delivery of ICMS feedback, improved when the
   recording intervals affected by ICMS artifacts were removed from
   analysis. These results add to the growing evidence that temporally
   patterned ICMS can be used to simulate a tactile sense for
   neuroprosthetic devices.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular bonding configuration of Fe(III) associated with organic
   matter (OM) in soils potentially affects its binding affinity,
   reducibility, mobility, and interactions with other cations and anions.
   Given that Fe(III) can be incorporated into soil OM either directly as
   Fe(III) or through oxidation of Fe(II), the coordination and reactivity
   of OM-associated Fe(III) may depend on soil redox conditions. Our
   objective was to determine if the molecular coordination environment and
   phosphate sorption characteristics of OM-associated Fe(III) depend on
   the pathway of Fe(III) incorporation. Pahokee peat soil material was
   reacted at pH 2.5 with either Fe(III) or Fe(II) at 300, 900, or 1200
   mmol Fe kg(-1) peat, equilibrated at pH 6.8 and oxidized. Extended x-ray
   absorption fine structure and wavelet transform analyses indicated the
   presence of mononuclear Fe(III) coordinated with organic ligands in all
   samples along with polynuclear Fe-hydroxide species at higher
   concentrations. The pathway of Fe incorporation did not significantly
   affect its local coordination environment or phosphate sorption
   isotherms. Our results suggest that OM-associated Fe(III) formed under
   oxidized or reduced soil conditions would have similar molecular-level
   coordination and be equally accessible for phosphate sorption.}},

Abstract = {{Late outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from the

   diameter) were denucleated and sodded either with native EPCs or with
   EPCs transfected with an adenoviral vector containing the gene for human
   thrombomodulin (EPC + AdTM). EPC + AdTM was shown to increase the in
   vitro rate of graft activated protein C (APC) production 4-fold over
   grafts sodded with untransfected EPCs (p<0.05). Unsodded control and
   EPC-sodded and EPC + AdTM-sodded grafts were implanted bilaterally into
   the femoral arteries of athymic rats for 7 or 28 days. Unsodded control
   grafts, both with and without denucleation treatment, each exhibited 7
   day patency rates of 25\%. Unsodded grafts showed extensive thrombosis
   and were not tested for patency over 28 days. In contrast, grafts sodded
   with untransfected EPCs or EPC + AdTM both had 7 day patency rates of
   88-89\% and 28 day patency rates of 75-88\%. Intimal hyperplasia was
   observed near both the proximal and distal anastomoses in all sodded
   graft conditions but did not appear to be the primary occlusive failure
   event. This in vivo study suggests autologous EPCs derived from the
   peripheral blood of patients with coronary artery disease may improve
   the performance of synthetic vascular grafts, although no differences
   were observed between untransfected EPCs and TM transfected EPCs. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper documents the time-dependent thermal interaction between a
   fluid stream configured as a plane tree of varying complexity embedded
   in a conducting solid with finite volume and insulated boundaries. The
   time scales of the convection-conduction phenomenon are identified.
   Two-dimensional and three-dimensional configurations are simulated
   numerically. The number of length scales of the tree architecture varies
   from one to four. The results show that the heat transfer density
   increases, and the time of approach to equilibrium decreases as the
   complexity of the tree designs increases. These results are then
   formulated in the classical notation of energy storage by sensible
   heating, which shows that the effective number of heat transfer units
   increases as the complexity of the tree design increases. The complexity
   of heat transfer designs in many applications is constrained by first
   cost and operating cost considerations. This work provides a fundamental
   basis for objective evaluation of cost and performance tradeoffs in
   thermal design of energy systems with complexity as an unconstrained
   parameter that can be actively varied over a broad range to determine
   the optimum system design. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Clean renewable energy sources (e. g., solar, wind, and hydro) offers
   the most promising solution to energy and environmental sustainability.
   On the other hand, owing to the spatial and temporal variations of
   renewable energy sources, and transportation and mobility needs, high
   density energy storage and efficient energy distribution to points of
   use is also critical. Moreover, it is challenging to scale up those
   processes in a cost-effective way. Electrochemical processes, including
   photoelectrochemical devices, batteries, fuel cells, super capacitors,
   and others, have shown promise for addressing many of the abovementioned
   challenges. Materials with designer properties, especially the
   interfacial properties, play critical role for the performance of those
   devices. Atomic layer deposition is capable of precise engineering
   material properties on atomic scale. In this review, we focus on the
   current state of knowledge of the applications, perspective and
   challenges of atomic layer deposition process on the electrochemical
   energy generation and storage devices and processes. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of
   electrode placement, geometry, and polarity during epidural cortical
   stimulation (ECS) on thresholds for direct activation of cortical
   neurons.
   Methods: We used a computational model of epidural electrical
   stimulation of the motor cortex coupled to compartmental models of
   cortical neurons.
   Results: Thresholds varied with stimulation polarity and neuron
   position, and neurons deep within the sulci had much larger thresholds
   than those on the crowns or lips of the gyri. Axons were more excitable
   than cell bodies or dendrites. Delivering stimulation with the lead
   placed above or perpendicular to the sulci resulted in substantial
   stimulation of the gyri adjacent to the target gyrus. Electrode diameter
   and inter-electrode spacing influenced thresholds and affected the
   spread of activation in the cortex.
   Conclusions: Electrode placement, geometry, and polarity during ECS
   influence excitation properties of cortical neurons substantially.
   Significance: Epidural leads have varying geometries, and in clinical
   studies of ECS the placement of the lead has been inconsistent. These
   results provide an improved understanding of the effects of electrode
   placement, geometry, and polarity on the outcome of ECS and can
   facilitate the rational implantation and programming of ECS systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Advances in the study of the environmental fate, transport, and
   ecotoxicological effects of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have been
   hampered by a lack of adequate techniques for the detection and
   quantification of ENMs at environmentally relevant concentrations in
   complex media. Analysis of ENMs differs from traditional chemical
   analysis because both chemical and physical forms must be considered.
   Because ENMs are present as colloidal systems, their physicochemical
   properties are dependent on their surroundings. Therefore, the simple
   act of trying to isolate, observe, and quantify ENMs may change their
   physicochemical properties, making analysis extremely susceptible to
   artifacts. Many analytical techniques applied in materials science and
   other chemical/biological/physical disciplines may be applied to ENM
   analysis as well; however, environmental and biological studies may
   require that methods be adapted to work at low concentrations in complex
   matrices. The most pressing research needs are the development of
   techniques for extraction, cleanup, separation, and sample storage that
   introduce minimal artifacts to increase the speed, sensitivity, and
   specificity of analytical techniques, as well as the development of
   techniques that can differentiate between abundant, naturally occurring
   particles, and manufactured nanoparticles. Environ. Toxicol. Chem.

   truncated beta-Bernoulli process is employed to infer an appropriate

   context of compressive sensing, significant improvements in image
   recovery are manifested using learned dictionaries, relative to using
   standard orthonormal image expansions. The compressive-measurement
   projections are also optimized for the learned dictionary. Additionally,
   we consider simpler (incomplete) measurements, defined by measuring a
   subset of image pixels, uniformly selected at random. Spatial
   interrelationships within imagery are exploited through use of the
   Dirichlet and probit stick-breaking processes. Several example results
   are presented, with comparisons to other methods in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Functional imaging with {[}F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
   emission tomography (FDG-PET) provides the opportunity to define the
   physiology of the major salivary glands before and after radiation
   therapy. The goal of this retrospective study was to identify the
   radiation dose-response relationship of parotid gland glucose metabolism
   in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
   Materials and Methods: Forty-nine adults with HNSCC were identified who
   had curative intent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and
   FDG-PET imaging before and after treatment. Using a graphical user
   interface, contours were delineated for the parotid glands on axial CT
   slices while all authors were blinded to paired PET slices. Average and
   maximal standard uptake values (SUV) were measured within these anatomic
   regions. Changes in SUV and volume after radiation therapy were
   correlated with parotid gland dose-volume histograms from IMRT plans.
   Results: The average parotid gland volume was 30.7 mL and contracted 3.9
   +/- 1.9\% with every increase of 10 Gy in mean dose (p = 0.04). However,
   within the first 3 months after treatment, there was a uniform reduction
   of 16.5\% +/- 7.3\% regardless of dose. The average SUV(mean) of the
   glands was 1.63 +/- 0.48 pretreatment and declined by 5.2\% +/- 2.5\%
   for every increase of 10 Gy in mean dose (p = 0.04). The average
   SUV(max) was 4.07 +/- 2.85 pretreatment and decreased in a sigmoid
   manner with mean dose. A threshold of 32 Gy for mean dose existed, after
   which SUV(max) declined rapidly.
   Conclusion: Radiation dose responses of the parotid glands can be
   measured by integrated CT/FDG-PET scans. Retrospective analysis showed
   sigmoidal declines in the maximum metabolism but linear declines in the
   average metabolism of the glands with dose. Future studies should
   correlate this decline in FDG uptake with saliva production to improve
   treatment planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.}},

   features underlying reduced tremor suppression with temporally patterned

   published October 12, 2011; doi:10.1152jn.00906.2010.-Deep brain
   stimulation (DBS) provides dramatic tremor relief when delivered at
   high-stimulation frequencies (more than similar to 100 Hz), but its
   mechanisms of action are not well-understood. Previous studies indicate
   that high-frequency stimulation is less effective when the stimulation
   train is temporally irregular. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the specific characteristics of temporally irregular stimulus
   trains that reduce their effectiveness: long pauses, bursts, or
   irregularity per se. We isolated these characteristics in stimulus
   trains and conducted intraoperative measurements of postural tremor in
   eight volunteers. Tremor varied significantly across stimulus conditions
   (P < 0.015), and stimulus trains with pauses were significantly less
   effective than stimulus trains without (P < 0.002). There were no
   significant differences in tremor between trains with or without bursts
   or between trains that were irregular or periodic. Thus the decreased
   effectiveness of temporally irregular DBS trains is due to long pauses
   in the stimulus trains, not the degree of temporal irregularity alone.
   We also conducted computer simulations of neuronal responses to the
   experimental stimulus trains using a biophysical model of the thalamic
   network. Trains that suppressed tremor in volunteers also suppressed
   fluctuations in thalamic transmembrane potential at the frequency
   associated with cerebellar burst-driver inputs. Clinical and
   computational findings indicate that DBS suppresses tremor by masking
   burst-driver inputs to the thalamus and that pauses in stimulation
   prevent such masking. Although stimulation of other anatomic targets may
   provide tremor suppression, we propose that the most relevant neuronal
   targets for effective tremor suppression are the afferent cerebellar
   fibers that terminate in the thalamus.}},

Abstract = {{We present a bottom-up synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and ab

   The ZnO nanostructures were synthesized by a low-temperature
   hydrothermal growth method. The cross-section of the ZnO nanowires
   transformed from a hexagon to a hexagram when sulfur dopants from
   thiourea {[}SC(NH(2))(2)] were added into the growth solution, but no
   transformation occurred when urea (OC(NH(2))(2)) was added. Comparison
   of the X-ray photoemission and photoluminescence spectra of undoped and
   sulfur-doped ZnO confirmed that sulfur is responsible for the novel
   morphology. Large-scale theoretical calculations were conducted to
   understand the role of sulfur doping in the growth process. The ab
   initio simulations demonstrated that the addition of sulfur causes a
   local change in charge distribution that is stronger at the vertices
   than at the edges, leading to the observed transformation from hexagon
   to hexagram nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{Case selection is a useful approach for increasing the efficiency and
   performance of case-based classifiers. Multiple techniques have been
   designed to perform case selection. This paper empirically investigates
   how class imbalance in the available set of training cases can impact
   the performance of the resulting classifier as well as properties of the
   selected set. In this study, the experiments are performed using a
   dataset for the problem of detecting breast masses in screening
   mammograms. The classification problem was binary and we used a
   k-nearest neighbor classifier. The classifier's performance was
   evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) area under
   the curve (AUC) measure. The experimental results indicate that although
   class imbalance reduces the performance of the derived classifier and
   the effectiveness of selection at improving overall classifier
   performance, case selection can still be beneficial, regardless of the
   level of class imbalance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Although Bornean tropical rainforests are among the moistest biomes in
   the world, they sporadically experience periods of water stress. The
   observations indicate that these ecosystems tend to have little
   regulation of water use, despite episodes of relatively severe drought.
   This water-use behaviour is often referred to as anisohydric behaviour,
   as opposed to isohydric plants that regulate stomatal movement to
   prevent hydraulic failure. Although it is generally thought that
   anisohydric behaviour is an adaptation to more drought-prone habitats,
   we show that anisohydric plants may also be more favoured than isohydric
   plants under very moist environments where there is little risk of
   hydraulic failure. To explore this subject, we examined the advantages
   of isohydric and anisohydric species as a function of the hydroclimatic
   environment using a stochastic model of soil moisture and carbon
   assimilation dynamics parameterized by field observations. The results
   showed that under very moist conditions, anisohydric species tend to
   have higher productivity than isohydric plants, despite the fact that
   the two plant types show almost the same drought-induced mortality. As
   precipitation decreases, the mortality of anisohydric plants drastically
   increases whereas that of isohydric plants remains relatively constant
   and low; in these conditions, isohydric plants surpass anisohydric
   plants in their productivity.}},

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{119-136}},
Abstract = {{A fast Inverse Polynomial Reconstruction Method (IPRM) is proposed to
   efficiently eliminate the Gibbs phenomenon in Fourier reconstruction of
   discontinuous functions. The framework of the fast IPRM is modified by
   reconstructing the function in discretized elements, then the Conformal
   Fourier Transform (CFT) and the Chirp Z-Transform (CZT) algorithms are
   applied to accelerate the evaluation of reconstruction coefficients. The
   memory cost of the fast IPRM is also significantly reduced, owing to the
   transformation matrix being discretized in the modified framework. The
   computation complexity and memory cost of the fast IPRM are O (MN log
   2L) and O (MN), respectively, where L is the number of the discretized
   elements, M is the degree of polynomials for the reconstruction of each
   element, and N is the number of the Fourier series. Numerical results
   demonstrate that the fast IPRM method not only inherits the robustness
   of the Generalized IPRM (G-IPRM) method, but also significantly reduces
   the computation time and the memory cost. Therefore, the fast IPRM
   method is useful for the pseudospectral time domain methods and for the
   volume integral equation of the discontinuous material distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaling multiple
   1-L volumes of undiluted hyperpolarized xenon 129 (Xe-129) followed by
   up to a 16-second breath hold and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
   Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the institutional
   review board and was HIPAA compliant. Written informed consent was
   obtained. Forty-four subjects (19 men, 25 women; mean age, 46.1 years
   +/- 18.8 {[}standard deviation]) were enrolled, consisting of 24 healthy
   volunteers, 10 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD), and 10 age-matched control subjects. All subjects received three
   or four 1-L volumes of undiluted hyperpolarized Xe-129, followed by
   breath-hold MR imaging. Oxygen saturation, heart rate and rhythm, and
   blood pressure were continuously monitored. These parameters, along with
   respiratory rate and subjective symptoms, were assessed after each dose.
   Subjects' serum biochemistry and hematology were recorded at screening
   and at 24-hour follow-up. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained
   at these times and also within 2 hours prior to and 1 hour after Xe-129
   MR imaging. Xenon-related symptoms were evaluated for relationship to
   subject group by using a x 2 test and to subject age by using logistic
   regression. Changes in vital signs were tested for significance across
   subject group and time by using a repeated-measures multivariate
   analysis of variance test.
   Results: The 44 subjects tolerated all xenon inhalations, no subjects
   withdrew, and no serious adverse events occurred. No significant changes
   in vital signs (P > .27) were observed, and no subjects exhibited
   changes in laboratory test or ECG results at follow-up that were deemed
   clinically important or required intervention. Most subjects (91\%) did
   experience transient xenon-related symptoms, most commonly dizziness
   (59\%), paresthesia (34\%), euphoria (30\%), and hypoesthesia (30\%).
   All symptoms resolved without clinical intervention in 1.6 minutes +/-
   0.9.
   Conclusion: Inhalation of hyperpolarized Xe-129 is well tolerated in
   healthy subjects and in those with mild or moderate COPD. Subjects do
   experience mild, transient, xenon-related symptoms, consistent with its
   known anesthetic properties. (C) RSNA, 2011}},

Abstract = {{Reliably detecting prostate cancer (PCa) has been a challenge for
   current imaging modalities. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI)
   imaging is an elasticity imaging method that uses remotely generated,
   focused acoustic beams to probe tissue stiffness. A previous study on
   excised human prostates demonstrated ARFI images portray various
   prostatic structures and has the potential to guide prostate needle
   biopsy with improved sampling accuracy. The goal of this study is to
   demonstrate the feasibility of ARFI imaging to portray internal
   structures and PCa in the human prostate in vivo. Custom ARFI imaging
   sequences were designed and implemented using a modified Siemens Antares
   (TM) scanner with a three-dimensional (3-D) wobbler, end-firing,
   trans-cavity transducer, EV9F4. Nineteen patients were consented and
   imaged immediately preceding surgical prostatectomy. Pathologies and
   anatomic structures were identified in histologic slides by a
   pathologist blinded to ARFI data and were then registered with
   structures found in ARFI images. The results demonstrated that when PCa
   is visible, it generally appears as bilaterally asymmetric stiff
   structures; benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) appears heterogeneous
   with a nodular texture; the verumontanum and ejaculatory ducts appears
   softer compared with surrounding tissue, which form a unique `V' shape;
   and the boundary of the transitional zone (TZ) forms a stiff rim
   separating the TZ from the peripheral zone (PZ). These characteristic
   appearances of prostatic structures are consistent with those found in
   our previous study of prostate ARFI imaging on excised human prostates.
   Compared with the matched B-mode images, ARFI images, in general,
   portray prostate structures with higher contrast. With the end-firing
   transducer used for this study, ARFI depth penetration was limited to 22
   mm. Image contrast and resolution were decreased as compared with the
   previous ex vivo study due to the small transducer aperture. Even with
   these limitations, this study suggests ARFI imaging holds promise for
   guidance of targeted prostate needle biopsy and focal therapy, as well
   as aiding assessment of changes during watchful waiting/active
   surveillance. (E-mail: liang.zhai@Siemens.com) (C) 2012 World Federation

Abstract = {{To increase datacenter energy efficiency, we need memory systems that
   keep pace with processor efficiency gains. Currently, servers use DDR3
   memory, which is designed for high bandwidth but not for energy
   proportionality. A system using 20\% of the peak DDR3 bandwidth consumes
   2.3x the energy per bit compared to the energy consumed by a system with
   fully utilized memory bandwidth. Nevertheless, many datacenter
   applications stress memory capacity and latency but not memory
   bandwidth. In response, we architect server memory systems using mobile
   DRAM devices, trading peak bandwidth for lower energy consumption per
   bit and more efficient idle modes. We demonstrate 3-5x lower memory
   power, better proportionality, and negligible performance penalties for
   datacenter workloads.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to extend the lifetime of Flash memory by
   reducing the frequency with which a given page of memory is erased. This
   is accomplished by increasing the number of writes that are possible
   before erasure is necessary. Redundancy is introduced into the write
   process to decrease the number of memory cells that are impacted by a
   given write, and to even out the impact of writing across an entire page
   of memory. Improvements are expressed in terms of write efficiency and
   lifetime gain. Write efficiency is the ratio of cells written to cells
   available, and lifetime gain is the ratio of coded writes to the
   baseline of uncoded writing.
   We use a physical model that allows multiple writes to a given region of
   memory. This can be realized with single level cells or with multi-level
   cells. Data is written to memory in the form of a coset of a
   convolutional code. The coset is represented by a binary vector that is
   selected by the Viterbi algorithm to minimize the number of cells
   impacted by the write (Hamming weight) and to even out the number of
   writes to each cell within a given page. Several different Viterbi
   metrics are evaluated. It is shown that page write efficiencies of over
   85\% and lifetime gains of over 500\% are possible with only modest
   encoding and decoding complexity.
   It is also straightforward to integrate lifetime extension with standard
   methods of error correction by requiring that the coset representative
   be drawn from an error correcting code. An example is provided where
   single error correction is provided using a Hamming code.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present coherence-based performance guarantees of
   Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for both support recovery and signal
   reconstruction of sparse signals when the measurements are corrupted by
   noise. In particular, two variants of OMP either with known sparsity
   level or with a stopping rule are analyzed. It is shown that if the
   measurement matrix X is an element of C-nxp satisfies the strong
   coherence property, then with n greater than or similar to O (k log p),
   OMP will recover a k-sparse signal with high probability. In particular,
   the performance guarantees obtained here separate the properties
   required of the measurement matrix from the properties required of the
   signal, which depends critically on the minimum signal to noise ratio
   rather than the power profiles of the signal. We also provide
   performance guarantees for partial support recovery. Comparisons are
   given with other performance guarantees for OMP using worst-case
   analysis and the sorted one step thresholding algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{TechXcite is an informal, project-based engineering program for middle
   school students. The program is a partnership between the Pratt School
   of Engineering at Duke University, the Department of 4-H Youth
   Development and Family \& Consumer Sciences at North Carolina State
   University, and the National 4-H Council. The TechXcite curriculum is
   centered on seven themes (Wireless Communication, Biomedical Technology,
   Digital Imaging, Solar Energy, Transportation, Heating and Cooling, and
   Photonics). Within each theme are modules containing four to six 45
   minute activities designed to engage kids in the engineering design
   process in an informal setting. Each module is intended to introduce a
   modern and exciting technology that children encounter in their everyday
   lives while encouraging meaningful exploration and use of math and
   science as problem solving tools. 4-H Afterschool staff, most of whom do
   not have any formal engineering education, teach the program. Prior to
   teaching a module, 4-H Afterschool staff participate in a one-day
   workshop held at a 4-H Extension Center. This paper examines the
   challenges of training after-school instructors, who often do not have a
   science or engineering background, to teach engineering modules. Survey
   data from instructors trained in California are utilized. In addition,
   the paper examines the impacts of the program on the students through
   focus group data collected from the same state. Focus groups, conducted
   by Compass Consulting Group who is responsible for the external
   evaluation of the project, have provided means for getting more detailed
   information on the engineering concepts students learn from the
   curriculum. Instructor surveys indicate an increased level of comfort
   with the material and that the material is of high quality for use in
   their after-school programs. In addition, challenges to introducing
   engineering in an after-school setting indicated by focus group data are
   discussed. TechXcite is an Informal Science Education program funded by
   the National Science Foundation (Grant 0638970).}},

   screening. Novel nanobiosensors and nanoprobes combining bio-recognition
   and nanotechnology have been developed for in-vitro molecular
   diagnostics and in-vivo monitoring of biological targets and biochemical
   processes in a single living cell. These studies demonstrate
   applications of plasmonics ``molecular sentinel{''} nanoprobes for
   diagnostics of diseases such as cancer and the use of nano-biosensors
   for measurements of molecular signaling pathways inside a single cell.
   Fiberoptics-based nanobiosensors are used to detect apoptotic processes
   in single cells following photodynamic cancer treatment or to monitor pH
   in cancer cells. These nanodevices open new possibilities to a wide
   range of applications in medical diagnostics at the point of care,
   global health, molecular imaging, biology research, ultra-high
   throughput screening, and investigations of the therapeutic action of
   pharmaceutical agents.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors have been shown
   to provide target signatures which enable discrimination of landmines
   from harmless clutter. In particular, frequency-domain EMI sensors are
   well-suited for target characterization by inverting a physics-based
   signal model. In many model-based signal processing paradigms, the
   target signatures can be decomposed into a weighted sum of parameterized
   basis functions, where the basis functions are intrinsic to the target
   under consideration and the associated weights are a function of the
   target sensor orientation. When spatial data is available, the diversity
   of the measured signals may provide more information for estimating the
   basis function parameters. After model inversion, the basis function
   parameters can be used as features for classifying the target as
   landmine or clutter. In this work, feature extraction from spatial
   frequency-domain EMI sensor data is investigated. Results for data
   measured with a prototype frequency-domain EMI sensor at a standardized
   test site are presented. Preliminary results indicate that Structured
   relevance vector machine (sRVM) regression model inversion using spatial
   data provides stable, and sparse, sets of target features.}},

Title = {{Modular nanotransporters: a versatile approach for enhancing nuclear
   delivery and cytotoxicity of Auger electron-emitting I-125}},
Journal = {{EJNMMI RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study evaluates the potential utility of a modular
   nanotransporter (MNT) for enhancing the nuclear delivery and
   cytotoxicity of the Auger electron emitter I-125 in cancer cells that
   overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
   Methods: MNTs are recombinant multifunctional polypeptides that we have
   developed for achieving selective delivery of short-range therapeutics
   into cancer cells. MNTs contain functional modules for receptor binding,
   internalization, endosomal escape and nuclear translocation, thereby
   facilitating the transport of drugs from the cell surface to the
   nucleus. The MNT described herein utilized EGF as the targeting ligand
   and was labeled with I-125 using
   N-succinimidyl-4-guanidinomethyl-3-{[}I-125]iodobenzoate (SGMIB).
   Membrane binding, intracellular and nuclear accumulation kinetics, and
   clonogenic survival assays were performed using the EGFR-expressing A431
   epidermoid carcinoma and D247 MG glioma cell lines.
   Results: {[}I-125]SGMIB-MNT bound to A431 and D247 MG cells with an
   affinity comparable to that of native EGF. More than 60\% of
   internalized {[}I-125]SGMIB-MNT radioactivity accumulated in the cell
   nuclei after a 1-h incubation. The cytotoxic effectiveness of
   {[}I-125]SGMIB-MNT compared with I-125-labeled bovine serum albumin
   control was enhanced by a factor of 60 for D247 MG cells and more than
   1,000-fold for A431 cells, which express higher levels of EGFR.
   Conclusions: MNT can be utilized to deliver I-125 into the nuclei of
   cancer cells overexpressing EGFR, significantly enhancing cytotoxicity.
   Further evaluation of {[}I-125]SGMIB-MNT as a targeted radiotherapeutic
   for EGFR-expressing cancer cells appears warranted.}},

Title = {{Parallel-plate Flow Chamber and Continuous Flow Circuit to Evaluate
   Endothelial Progenitor Cells under Laminar Flow Shear Stress}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{59}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The overall goal of this method is to describe a technique to subject
   adherent cells to laminar flow conditions and evaluate their response to
   well quantifiable fluid shear stresses(1).
   Our flow chamber design and flow circuit (Fig. 1) contains a transparent
   viewing region that enables testing of cell adhesion and imaging of cell
   morphology immediately before flow (Fig. 11A, B), at various time points
   during flow (Fig. 11C), and after flow (Fig. 11D). These experiments are
   illustrated with human umbilical cord blood-derived endothelial
   progenitor cells (EPCs) and porcine EPCs2,3.
   This method is also applicable to other adherent cell types, e. g.
   smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or fibroblasts.
   The chamber and all parts of the circuit are easily sterilized with
   steam autoclaving. In contrast to other chambers, e. g. microfluidic
   chambers, large numbers of cells (> 1 million depending on cell size)
   can be recovered after the flow experiment under sterile conditions for
   cell culture or other experiments, e. g. DNA or RNA extraction, or
   immunohistochemistry (Fig. 11E), or scanning electron microscopy(5). The
   shear stress can be adjusted by varying the flow rate of the perfusate,
   the fluid viscosity, or the channel height and width. The latter can
   reduce fluid volume or cell needs while ensuring that one-dimensional
   flow is maintained. It is not necessary to measure chamber height
   between experiments, since the chamber height does not depend on the use
   of gaskets, which greatly increases the ease of multiple experiments.
   Furthermore, the circuit design easily enables the collection of
   perfusate samples for analysis and/or quantification of metabolites
   secreted by cells under fluid shear stress exposure, e. g. nitric oxide
   (Fig. 12)(6).}},

Abstract = {{This chapter reviews our work and that of other groups in the use of
   individual plasmonic nanostructures that are presented by a substrate
   for the label-free detection of biomolecular binding events. This class
   of single particle nanosensors is based on the local surface plasmon
   resonance (LSPR) behavior of noble metal nanostructures that enables
   optical transduction of binding events at their surface into an optical
   signal {[}1-5]. The LSPR peak location and intensity are sensitive to
   the local refractive index surrounding the nanoparticle, which is
   altered by the binding of biomolecular targets to
   receptor-functionalized nanostructures, and forms the basis of their
   utility as label-free biosensors {[}6].}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel flow-based method is presented to place catalytic
   nanoparticles into a reactor by sol-gelation of of a porous ceramic
   consisting of copper-based nanoparticles, silica sand, ceramic binder,
   and a gelation agent. This method allows for the placement of a liquid
   precursor containing the catalyst into the final reactor geometry
   without the need of impregnating or coating of a substrate with the
   catalytic material. The so generated foam-like porous ceramic shows
   properties highly appropriate for use as catalytic reactor material,
   e.g., reasonable pressure drop due to its porosity, high thermal and
   catalytic stability, and excellent catalytic behavior.
   The catalytic activity of micro-reactors containing this foam-like
   ceramic is tested in terms of their ability to convert alcoholic biofuel
   (e.g. methanol) to a hydrogen-rich gas mixture with low concentrations
   of carbon monoxide (up to 75\% hydrogen content and less than 0.2\% CO,
   for the case of methanol). This gas mixture is subsequently used in a
   low-temperature fuel cell, converting the hydrogen directly to
   electricity. A low concentration of CO is crucial to avoid poisoning of
   the fuel cell catalyst. Since conventional Polymer Electrolyte Membrane
   (PEM) fuel cells require CO concentrations far below 100 ppm and since
   most methods to reduce the mole fraction of CO (such as Preferential
   Oxidation or PROX) have CO conversions of up to 99\%, the alcohol fuel
   reformer has to achieve initial CO mole fractions significantly below
   1\%. The catalyst and the porous ceramic reactor of the present study
   can successfully fulfill this requirement.
   The results of the present study confirm that product gas mixtures with
   up to 75\% hydrogen content and less than 0.2\% CO content can be
   achieved, which is an excellent result. The reactor temperature can be
   kept as low as 220 degrees C while obtaining a methanol conversion of up
   to 70\%. The used PROX catalyst showed selective CO conversion rates
   above 99.5\% for temperatures between 80 and 100 C in presence of large
   molar fractions of H2O and CO2.}},

Abstract = {{The aeroelastic stability of rectangular plates are well-documented in
   literature for certain sets of boundary conditions. Specifically, wing
   flutter, panel flutter, and divergence of a plate that is clamped on all
   sides are well-understood. However, the ongoing push for lighter
   structures and novel designs have led to a need to understand the
   aeroelastic behavior of elastic plates for other boundary conditions.
   One example is NASA's continuous mold-line link project for reducing the
   noise generated by commercial transport aircraft during landing; in
   order to reduce the noise generated by vortex shedding from the trailing
   edge flap during landing, the project proposes to connect the gap
   between the trailing edge flap and the rest of the wing with a flexible
   plate. This paper summarizes the aeroelastic theory, numerical results,
   and experimental results of a study on the flutter and/or divergence
   mechanisms of a rectangular plate for different sets of structural
   boundary conditions. The theory combines a three-dimensional vortex
   lattice aerodynamic model with a plate structural model to create a
   high-fidelity frequency domain aeroelastic model. A modular experimental
   test bed is designed for this study in order to test the different
   boundary conditions. The test bed is also designed to test different
   plate thicknesses and sizes with only a small number of modifications.
   The well-understood boundary conditions are used as test cases to
   validate the analysis results, and then results of additional
   configurations that have not been extensively explored are presented.
   The results of this paper can be used to support the design efforts of
   projects involving plates or plate-membranes. In addition, the paper
   adds to the fundamental understanding of plate aeroelasticity{''} and
   provides a wealth of experimental data for comparison and future
   validation.}},

Abstract = {{KBM averaging is a widely used technique in the analysis of nonlinear
   dynamical systems. The KBM method allows complex systems to be
   approximated as perturbations of simple harmonic oscillator. In many
   cases, such as in otherwise linear systems with various forms nonlinear
   damping, the KBM method performs exceptionally well, with error
   proportional to the size of the perturbations. However, when the largest
   perturbation in the system arises from nonlinearities in the restoring
   force, the KBM method falls short, and the interesting effects of other
   nonlinear terms are drowned out by the approximation errors generated by
   the KBM method. By generalizing the notion of KBM averaging and
   approximating systems as perturbations the isoenergy contours of their
   corresponding Hamiltonian, a greater degree of accuracy can be obtained.
   We extend the work of several authors to show that not only is this
   method more accurate, but it is also simple to implement and
   generalizable to a wide range of nonlinear systems. As an illustrative
   example, the motion of a pendulum on a tilted platform is studied.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately predicting formation and partitioning of ambient organic
   aerosols remains a challenge despite decades of sustained effort in this
   domain. A major source of uncertainty is the poorly characterized
   volatility of these aerosols. This uncertainty stems in large part from
   difficulty separating the overlapping effects of aerosol thermodynamic
   properties and evaporation coefficients in thermodenuder volatility
   studies. For lack of other information, it is commonly assumed that the
   evaporation coefficient is unity when interpreting thermodenuder data,
   leading to potentially large biases in inferred volatility of the
   sampled aerosol. In this paper, we present a novel thermodenuder-based
   approach for determining evaporation coefficients of pure compound and
   complex aerosols without knowledge of their thermodynamic properties.
   The method involves tracing the normalized dynamic response of an
   aerosol system to a step change in temperature as it flows through a
   heated tube. The approach is validated using pure compounds and a
   mixture of laboratory-generated dicarboxylic acids, and is applied to
   concentrated ambient aerosols sampled in Beirut, Lebanon. Three valid
   data sets were obtained frommore than 200 h of ambient air sampling
   during the month of August 2010, yielding values of 0.34, 0.46, and 0.28
   for an assumed binary gas diffusion coefficient of 7.8 x 10(-6) m(2)/s
   at 60 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{A method for obtaining analytic bounds for period doubling and cyclic
   fold instability regions in linear time-periodic systems with piecewise
   constant coefficients and time delay is suggested. The method is based
   on the use of transition matrices for Meissner's equation corresponding
   to the desired type of instability. Analytic expressions for the
   disconnected regions of fold and flip instability for two- and
   three-segment coefficients including both complex and real eigenvalues
   in Meissner's equation are obtained. The proposed method when applied to
   the example of two-segment interrupted turning with complex eigenvalues
   in each segment yields the same results as those obtained recently for
   the boundaries of the flip regions (Szalai and Stepan, 2006, ``Lobes and
   Lenses in the Stability Chart of Interrupted Turning,{''} J Comput.
   Nonlinear Dyn., 1, pp. 205-211). Next, the period-doubling instability
   regions for a particular delay differential equation related to the
   damped Meissner's equation and the fold instabilities for a model of
   delayed position feedback control are analytically obtained. Finally, we
   extend the method to a single degree-of-freedom milling model with a
   three-piecewise-constant-segment approximation to the true specific
   cutting force in which lower bounds for and horizontal locations of the
   regions of flip instability are obtained. The analytic results are
   verified through numerical stability charts obtained using the temporal
   finite element method. Conditions for the existence of islands of
   instability are also obtained. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4004468]}},
