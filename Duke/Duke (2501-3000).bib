Abstract = {{We propose a methodology for joint feature learning and clustering of
   multichannel extracellular electrophysiological data, across multiple
   recording periods for action potential detection and classification
   (sorting). Our methodology improves over the previous state of the art
   principally in four ways. First, via sharing information across
   channels, we can better distinguish between single-unit spikes and
   artifacts. Second, our proposed ``focused mixture model{''} (FMM) deals
   with units appearing, disappearing, or reappearing over multiple
   recording days, an important consideration for any chronic experiment.
   Third, by jointly learning features and clusters, we improve performance
   over previous attempts that proceeded via a two-stage learning process.
   Fourth, by directly modeling spike rate, we improve the detection of
   sparsely firing neurons. Moreover, our Bayesian methodology seamlessly
   handles missing data. We present the state-of-the-art performance
   without requiring manually tuning hyperparameters, considering both a
   public dataset with partial ground truth and a new experimental dataset.}},

Abstract = {{This protocol describes the techniques to synthesize and fabricate
   micropatterned poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate-based hydrogels that can
   be used as substrates in cellular studies and tissue engineering
   scaffolds. These materials provide an essentially bioinert background
   material due to the very low protein adsorption characteristics of
   poly(ethylene glycol), but the materials can be modified with covalently
   grafted peptides, proteins, or other biomolecules of interest to impart
   specific biofunctionality to the material. Further, it is possible to
   use micropatterning technologies to control the localization of such
   covalent grafting of biomolecules to the hydrogel materials, thus
   spatially controlling the cell material interactions. This protocol
   presents a relatively simple approach for mask-based photolithographic
   patterning, generally best suited for patterning the surface of hydrogel
   materials for 2D cell studies. A more sophisticated technique,
   two-photon laser scanning lithography, is also presented. This technique
   allows free-form, 3D micropatterning in hydrogels.}},

Title = {{Novel synthetic methodology for controlling the orientation of zinc
   oxide nanowires grown on silicon oxide substrates}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3861-3867}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a simple method to reproducibly obtain well-aligned
   vertical ZnO nanowire arrays on silicon oxide (SiOx) substrates using
   seed crystals made from a mixture of ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) and zinc
   acetate (Zn(O2CCH3)(2)) solution. In comparison, high levels of OH-
   concentration obtained using NaOH or KOH solutions lead to incorporation
   of Na or K atoms into the seed crystals, destroying the c-axis alignment
   of the seeds and resulting in the growth of misaligned nanowires. The
   use of NH4OH eliminates the metallic impurities and ensures aligned
   nanowire growth in a wide range of OH- concentrations in the seed
   solution. The difference of crystalline orientations between NH4OH- and
   NaOH-based seeds is directly observed by lattice-resolved images and
   electron diffraction patterns using a transmission electron microscope
   (TEM). This study obviously suggests that metallic impurities
   incorporated into the ZnO nanocrystal seeds are one of the factors that
   generates the misaligned ZnO nanowires. This method also enables the use
   of silicon oxide substrates for the growth of vertically aligned
   nanowires, making ZnO nanostructures compatible with widely used silicon
   fabrication technology.}},

Abstract = {{The need for high reliability, availability and performance has
   significantly increased in modern applications, that handle rapidly
   growing demands while providing uninterruptible services. Cloud
   computing systems fundamentally provide access to large pools of data
   and computational resources. Eucalyptus is a software framework largely
   used to implement private clouds and hybrid-style Infrastructure as a
   Service. It implements the Amazon Web Service (AWS) API, allowing
   interoperability with other AWS-based services. This article
   investigates the software aging effects in the Eucalyptus framework,
   considering workloads composed of intensive requests for remote storage
   attachment and virtual machine instantiations. We found problems that
   may be harmful to system dependability and performance, specifically
   regarding to RAM memory and swap space exhaustion, besides highly
   excessive CPU utilization by the virtual machines. We also present an
   approach that applies time series analysis to schedule rejuvenation, so
   as to reduce the downtime by predicting the proper moment to perform the
   rejuvenation. We experimentally evaluate our approach using an
   Eucalyptus test bed. The results show that our approach achieves higher
   availability, when compared to a threshold-triggered rejuvenation method
   based on continuous monitoring of resources utilization.}},

Journal = {{ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This article analyzes the completion time of a job running on a
   virtualized server subject to software aging and rejuvenation in a
   virtual machine monitor (VMM). A job running on the server may be
   interrupted by virtual machine (VM) failure, VMM failure or VMM
   rejuvenation. The job interruption is categorized as either
   preemptive-repeat (prt), in which case the interrupted job needs to
   restart from the beginning, or preemptive-resume (prs), in which case
   the job resumes execution from the point of interruption. Using a
   semi-Markov process (SMP) to model the server behavior, the steady-state
   server availability is computed and the theory developed in Kulkarni et
   al. {[}1987] is used to obtain the Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of
   the job completion time. In the numerical experiments, we introduce four
   types of aging behavior of VMM. The effectiveness of VMM rejuvenation on
   job completion time is discussed in association with the type of
   interruption it causes and the VMM aging type. With our parameter
   settings, VMM rejuvenation with prs job interruption improves the
   performance of job execution regardless of the aging type, with
   performance degradation is taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have reported the phenomenon of ``Software

   out an experimental study of software aging and rejuvenation for an

   clients are emulated. In order to reduce the time to application
   failures caused by memory leaks, we use the accelerated life testing
   (ALT) approach. We then select the Weibull time to failure distribution
   at normal level, to be used in a semi-Markov process, to compute the
   optimal software rejuvenation trigger interval. Since the validation of
   optimal rejuvenation trigger interval with emulated browsers will take
   an inordinate long time, we develop a simulation model to validate the
   ALT experimental results, and also estimate the steady-state
   availability to cross-validate the results of the semi-Markov

   perform manual measurements of a fixed lateral width (LW), central
   foveal thickness (CFT), and parafoveal thickness (PFT) 1 mm from foveal
   center. Inter-and intraplatform reproducibilities were assessed with
   analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer tests. The range of measurements
   between platforms was 5171 to 5290 mu m for mean LW (p < 0.001), 162 to
   196 mu m for mean CFT (p < 0.001), and 267 to 316 mu m for mean PFT (p <
   0.001). All SDOCT platforms had significant differences between each
   other for all measurements, except LW between Bioptigen SDOIS and Envisu
   (p = 0.27). Intraplatform differences were significantly smaller than
   interplatform differences for LW (p = 0.020), CFT (p = 0.045), and PFT
   (p = 0.004). Conversion factors were generated for lateral and axial
   scaling between SDOCT platforms. Lateral and axial manual measurements
   have greater variance across different SDOCT platforms than between
   instruments from the same platform. Conversion factors for measurements
   from different platforms can produce normalized values for patient care
   and clinical studies. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Background. Partial unweighted treadmill training is a potentially
   effective modality for improving fitness and function in frail elders.
   We tested the feasibility of partial unweighted treadmill training in
   older, mobility-impaired veterans. Methods. Eight mobility-impaired
   elders participated in partial unweighted treadmill training three
   times/week for twelve weeks. Outcome measures included gait speed,
   performance-oriented mobility assessment (POMA), eight foot up and go,
   and the SF-36 physical functioning short form. Results. There was
   significant improvement in treadmill walking time (+8.5 minutes;P <
   0.001), treadmill walking speed (+0.14 meters/second; P = 0.02), and
   percent of body weight support (-2.2\%;P = 0.02). Changes in physical
   performance included usual gait speed (+0.12meters/second; P = 0.001),
   rapid gait speed (+0.13meters/second;P = 0.01), POMA (+2.4 summary
   score; P < 0.001), and eight foot up and go (-1.2 seconds; P = 0.05).
   Conclusions. Partial unweighted treadmill training is feasible in
   mobility-impaired elders. Improvements in treadmill training capacity
   resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in fitness levels and
   improved mobility.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{The regular fast Fourier transform (FFT) requires a uniform Cartesian
   orthogonal grid which has considerable stair-casing errors when dealing
   with the function having an arbitrary shape boundary. The recently
   proposed two-dimensional discontinuous fast Fourier transform (2D-DFFT)
   can overcome this problem by using triangle mesh discretization and
   Gaussian numerical integration. However, the interpolation is used for
   the function data in the original 2D-DFFT, which reduces the accuracy
   performance especially for the case of oscillating functions. This work
   presents a useful modification of the original 2D-DFFT by removing the
   requirement of function interpolation to obtain significant accuracy
   improvement. In addition, the modified 2D nonuniform fast Fourier
   transform (NUFFT) with real-valued least-square interpolation
   coefficients are developed to speed up the computation of numerical
   Fourier transform over the triangle mesh. Numerical experiments are
   conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the
   proposed algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate a finite element method for frictional sliding along
   embedded interfaces within a weighted Nitsche framework. For such
   problems, the proposed Nitsche stabilized approach combines the
   attractive features of two traditionally used approaches: viz, penalty
   methods and augmented Lagrange multiplier methods. In contrast to an
   augmented Lagrange multiplier method, the proposed approach is primal;
   this allows us to eliminate an outer augmentation loop as well as
   additional degrees of freedom. At the same time, in contrast to the
   penalty method, the proposed method is variationally consistent; this
   results in a stronger enforcement of the non-interpenetrability
   constraint. The method parameter arising in the proposed stabilized
   formulation is defined analytically, for lower order elements, through
   numerical analysis. This provides the proposed approach with greater
   robustness over both traditional penalty and augmented Lagrangian
   frameworks. Through this analytical estimate, we also demonstrate that
   the proposed choice of weights, in the weighted Nitsche framework, is
   indeed the optimal one. We validate the proposed approach through
   several benchmark numerical experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Coupled prediction of flood response and debris flow initiation during
   warm- and cold-season events in the Southern Appalachians, USA}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{367-388}},
Abstract = {{Debris flows associated with rainstorms are a frequent and devastating
   hazard in the Southern Appalachians in the United States. Whereas
   warm-season events are clearly associated with heavy rainfall intensity,
   the same cannot be said for the cold-season events. Instead, there is a
   relationship between large (cumulative) rainfall events independently of
   season, and thus hydrometeorological regime, and debris flows. This
   suggests that the dynamics of subsurface hydrologic processes play an
   important role as a trigger mechanism, specifically through soil
   moisture redistribution by interflow. We further hypothesize that the
   transient mass fluxes associated with the temporal-spatial dynamics of
   interflow govern the timing of shallow landslide initiation, and
   subsequent debris flow mobilization. The first objective of this study
   is to investigate this relationship. The second objective is to assess
   the physical basis for a regional coupled flood prediction and debris
   flow warning system. For this purpose, uncalibrated model simulations of
   well-documented debris flows in headwater catchments of the Southern
   Appalachians using a 3-D surface-groundwater hydrologic model coupled
   with slope stability models are examined in detail. Specifically, we
   focus on two vulnerable headwater catchments that experience frequent
   debris flows, the Big Creek and the Jonathan Creek in the Upper Pigeon
   River Basin, North Carolina, and three distinct weather systems: an
   extremely heavy summertime convective storm in 2011; a persistent winter
   storm lasting several days; and a severe winter storm in 2009. These
   events were selected due to the optimal availability of rainfall
   observations; availability of detailed field surveys of the landslides
   shortly after they occurred, which can be used to evaluate model
   predictions; and because they are representative of events that cause
   major economic losses in the region. The model results substantiate that
   interflow is a useful prognostic of conditions necessary for the
   initiation of slope instability, and should therefore be considered
   explicitly in landslide hazard assessments. Moreover, the relationships
   between slope stability and interflow are strongly modulated by the
   topography and catchment-specific geomorphologic features that determine
   subsurface flow convergence zones. The three case studies demonstrate
   the value of coupled prediction of flood response and debris flow
   initiation potential in the context of developing a regional hazard
   warning system.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to present a frequency domain method for
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. By using two consecutive linear
   mappings along Doppler and frequency domains, an azimuth-dependent SAR
   transfer function has been discovered. Based on this new transfer
   function, the SAR image can be reconstructed by the proposed azimuth
   stacking algorithm. The new algorithm can form SAR image at each azimuth
   position without DFT wrap around errors. If Chirp z-transform (CZT) is
   applied to carry out the two consecutive mappings (since they are linear
   mappings), the proposed algorithm will not require interpolations and
   thus its reconstructed image would be free of truncation errors. The new
   algorithm has been validated using both simulated and experimental

Abstract = {{The imaging of targets embedded in a planar layered background media has
   been an important topic in subsurface and urban sensing. In this paper a
   fast and efficient tomographic algorithm for the imaging of targets
   embedded in a multilayered media is presented. The imaging algorithm is
   based on the first-order Born approximation and exploits the spectral
   multilayered media Green's function. The exploding reflection model is
   employed and then the Green's function is expanded in the spectral form
   to facilitate the easy implementation of the imaging algorithm with fast
   Fourier transform (FFT). The wave propagation effect due to the presence
   of the layered subsurface media is automatically taken into account in
   the imaging formulation through the multilayer media Green's function.
   The linearization of the inversion scheme and employment of FFT make the
   imaging algorithm suitable in several applications concerning the
   diagnostics of large probed domain and allow real-time processing.
   Representative examples are presented to show the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed algorithm for radar imaging through
   multilayered media.}},

Abstract = {{Drug delivery systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with the
   ability to target and penetrate specific tissues and release drugs based
   upon the local environment. While these advanced systems often offer
   advantages over their less sophisticated counterparts, the final product
   may be more complex and require additional manufacturing steps. In this
   article, we review a body of work based on genetically encoded
   elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) that offer a route to modular,
   multifunctional delivery systems that are simple to manufacture. ELPs
   are temperature-sensitive biopolymers that can be designed on the
   genetic level and expressed in cell-based protein production systems.
   The tools of molecular biology and versatility of proteins are used to
   engineer polymers with precise composition and molecular weight that
   self-assemble to form drug delivery systems with an impressive variety
   of features and functions. Due to their versatility and ease of
   production, ELPs are likely to contribute to the goal of designing
   simple and effective smart delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Successful intracellular delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics relies on
   multiaspect optimization, one of which is formulation. While there has
   been ample innovation on chemical design of polymeric gene carriers, the
   same cannot be said for physical processing of polymer-DNA nanocomplexes
   (polyplexes). Conventional synthesis of polyplexes by bulk mixing
   depends on the operators' experience. The poorly controlled bulk mixing
   process may also lead to batch-to-batch variation and consequent
   irreproducibility. Here, we synthesize polyplexes by using a
   three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing (3D-HF) technique in a
   single-layered, planar microfluidic device. Without any additional
   chemical treatment or postprocessing, the polyplexes prepared by the
   3D-HF method show smaller size, slower aggregation rate, and higher
   transfection efficiency, while exhibiting reduced cytotoxicity compared
   to the ones synthesized by conventional bulk mixing. In addition, by
   introducing external acoustic perturbation, mixing can be further
   enhanced, leading to even smaller nanocomplexes. The 3D-HF method
   provides a simple and reproducible process for synthesizing high-quality
   polyplexes, addressing a critical barrier in the eventual translation of
   nucleic acid therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel generative model for time series based on
   the Kalman filter algorithm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
   using the conditional embedding operator. The end result is a nonlinear
   model that quantifies the hidden state uncertainty and propagates its
   probability distribution forward as in the Kalman algorithm. The
   embedded dynamics can be described by the estimated conditional
   embedding operator constructed directly from the training measurement
   data. Using this operator as the counterpart of the state transition
   matrix, we reformulate the Kalman filter algorithm in RKHS. For the
   state model, the hidden states are the estimated embeddings of the
   measurement distribution, while the measurement model serves to connect
   the estimated measurement embeddings with the current mapped
   measurements in the RKHS. This novel algorithm is applied to noisy
   time-series estimation and prediction, and simulation results show that
   it outperforms other existing algorithms. In addition, improvements are
   proposed to reduce the size of the operator and reduce the computation
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Tomographic imaging of the molecular structure of an object is important
   for a variety of applications, ranging from medical and industrial
   radiography to security screening. X-ray diffraction imaging is the
   preeminent technique for performingmolecular analysis of large volumes.
   Here we propose and demonstrate a new measurement architecture to
   improve the source and detector efficiency for diffraction imaging. In
   comparison with previous techniques, our approach reduces the required
   overall scan time by 1-2 orders of magnitude, whichmakes possible
   real-time scanning of a broad range of materials over a large volume

Abstract = {{There are significant potential advantages for restoration of meniscal
   function using a bio-stable synthetic implant that combines long-term
   durability with a dependable biomechanical performance resembling that
   of the natural meniscus. A novel meniscus implant made of a compliant
   polycarbonate-urethane matrix reinforced with high modulus ultrahigh
   molecular weight polyethylene fibers was designed as a composite
   structure that mimics the structural elements of the natural medial
   meniscus. The overall success of such an implant is linked on its
   capability to replicate the stress distribution in the knee over the
   long-term. As this function of the device is directly dependent on its
   mechanical properties, changes to the material due to exposure to the
   joint environment and repeated loading could have non-trivial influences
   on the viscoelastic properties of the implant Thus, the goal of this
   study was to measure and characterize the strain-rate response, as well
   as the viscoelastic properties of the implant as measured by creep,
   stress relaxation, and hysteresis after simulated use, by subjecting the
   implant to realistic joint loads up to 2 million cycles in a joint-like
   setting. The meniscus implant behaved as a non-linear viscoelastic
   material. The implant underwent minimal plastic deformation after 2
   million fatigue loading cycles. Under low compressive loads, the implant
   was fairly flexible, and able to deform relatively easily (E=120-200
   kPa). However as the compressive load applied on the implant was
   increased, the implant became stiffer (E=3.8-5.2 MPa), to resist
   deformation. The meniscus implant appears well-matched to the
   viscoelastic properties of the natural meniscus, and importantly, these
   properties were found to remain stable and minimally affected by
   potentially degradative and loading conditions associated with long-term
   use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   dissemination in DSRC safety communication}},
Journal = {{PERFORMANCE EVALUATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{1-24}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an analytic model is proposed for both MAC and
   application-level performance evaluation of periodic beacon message
   dissemination in the dedicated short range communications (DSRC) system
   on highways. Each vehicle can periodically generate beacon messages,
   which contain the information including position, velocity, direction,
   etc.. Out-dated message is replaced by the newly generated message. In
   order to develop a tractable analytic approximation, we first develop a
   semi-Markov process (SMP) model for the tagged vehicle to capture the
   periodic message generation, out-dated message replacement, channel
   contention and backoff behavior in IEEE 802.11 broadcast ad hoc
   networks. Further, an SMP model with an absorbing state is constructed
   to derive the message service time distribution. The fixed-point
   iteration method is utilized to obtain the converged solutions to
   resolve interactions between the SMPs of different vehicles. Both
   MAC-level and application-level performance metrics are derived.
   MAC-level analytic-numeric results are verified through extensive
   simulations. Application-level analytic-numerical results are evaluated
   subsequently to provide insights on network parameter settings. To
   ensure the quality of service (QoS) for a VANET application, application
   requirements in terms of application-level metrics are specified. Three
   typical safety-applications are evaluated in order to assess whether
   their application requirements can be satisfied or not. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Buoyancy is an important consideration for diving marine animals,
   resulting in specific ecologically relevant adaptations. Marine mammals
   use blubber as an energy reserve, but because this tissue is also
   positively buoyant, nutritional demands have the potential to cause
   considerable variation in buoyancy. North Atlantic right whales
   Eubalaena glacialis are known to be positively buoyant as a result of
   their blubber, and the thickness of this layer varies considerably, but
   the effect of this variation on buoyancy has not been explored. This
   study compared the duration and rate of ascending and descending glides,
   recorded with an archival tag, with blubber thickness, measured with an
   ultrasound device, in free-swimming right whales. Ascending whales with
   thicker blubber had shorter portions of active propulsion and longer
   passive glides than whales with thinner blubber, suggesting that blubber
   thickness influences buoyancy because the buoyant force is acting in the
   same direction as the animal''s movement during this phase. Whales with
   thinner layers also used similar body angles and velocities when
   traveling to and from depth, while those with thicker layers used
   shallower ascent angles but achieved higher ascent velocities. Such
   alterations in body angle may help to reduce the cost of transport when
   swimming against the force of buoyancy in a state of augmented positive
   buoyancy, which represents a dynamic response to reduce the energetic
   consequences of physiological changes. These results have considerable
   implications for any diving marine animal during periods of nutritional
   stress, such as during seasonal migrations and annual variations in prey
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of any biomedical prevention technology relies on both
   biological efficacy and behavioral adherence. Microbicide trials have
   been hampered by low adherence, limiting the ability to draw meaningful
   conclusions about product effectiveness. Central to this problem may be
   an inadequate conceptualization of how product properties themselves
   impact user experience and adherence. Our goal is to expand the current
   microbicide development framework to include product perceptibility, the
   objective measurement of user sensory perceptions (i.e., sensations) and
   experiences of formulation performance during use. For vaginal gels, a
   set of biophysical properties, including rheological properties and
   measures of spreading and retention, may critically impact user
   experiences. Project LINK sought to characterize the user experience in
   this regard, and to validate measures of user sensory perceptions and
   experiences (USPEs) using four prototype topical vaginal gel
   formulations designed for pericoital use. Perceptibility scales captured
   a range of USPEs during the product application process (five scales),
   ambulation after product insertion (six scales), and during sexual
   activity (eight scales). Comparative statistical analyses provided
   empirical support for hypothesized relationships between gel properties,
   spreading performance, and the user experience. Project LINK provides
   preliminary evidence for the utility of evaluating USPEs, introducing a
   paradigm shift in the field of microbicide formulation design. We
   propose that these user sensory perceptions and experiences initiate
   cognitive processes in users resulting in product choice and
   willingness-to-use. By understanding the impact of USPEs on that
   process, formulation development can optimize both drug delivery and
   adherence.}},

   approximately 16.7\%. The proposed antenna presents an excellent
   end-fire radiation with a front-to-back ratio greater than 10 dB. Its

Abstract = {{Most of real systems are non-linear and they require damage detection.
   For such non-linear systems, non-linear damage detection methods are
   necessary for more accurate results. In this paper, a novel non-linear
   method is introduced using limit cycle oscillations that arise once the
   bifurcation (flutter) boundary is exceeded and shows greater sensitivity
   for damage detection versus linear damage detection techniques. Another
   advantage of this method is that it can be used for health monitoring of
   linear or non-linear systems. Here a non-linear aeroelastic panel is
   considered as a model to show the capabilities of the proposed damage
   detection technique. Also Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is used
   to find the number of independent damage locations in the panel.
   Rayleigh-Ritz method is used to discretizing spatial domain of the
   system. Damage is modeled as stiffness reduction in the certain region.
   By comparing Limit Cycle Oscillation of healthy and damaged panel damage
   level and its location could be obtained with good sensitivity. (C) 2013

Title = {{Sensitivity in the structural behavior of shallow arches}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{212-221}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that certain structural buckling problems are
   extremely sensitive to small changes in configuration: geometric
   imperfections, load application, symmetry, boundary conditions, etc.
   This paper considers the behavior of a very shallow arch under lateral
   point loading, and specifically under the influence of changes in the
   thermal environment. In some ways the system under study is especially
   sensitive since small changes influence whether the arch `snaps-through'
   or not. The experimental results provide insight into the challenges of
   understanding the behavior of these types of structural components in a
   practical, and thus necessarily imperfect, situation. The focus is on
   static loading or at least quasi-static loading, in which loading occurs
   on a slow time scale. This study also acts as a backdrop for studying
   the dynamic behavior of shallow arches, an area of concern in the
   context of aerospace structural components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Improved Nuclear Medicine Uniformity Assessment with Noise Texture
   Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Because g cameras are generally susceptible to environmental conditions
   and system vulnerabilities, they require routine evaluation of
   uniformity performance. The metrics for such evaluations are commonly
   pixel value-based. Although these metrics are typically successful at
   identifying regional nonuniformities, they often do not adequately
   reflect subtle periodic structures; therefore, additional visual
   inspections are required. The goal of this project was to develop, test,
   and validate a new uniformity analysis metric capable of accurately
   identifying structures and patterns present in nuclear medicine
   flood-field uniformity images. Methods: A new uniformity assessment
   metric, termed the structured noise index (SNI), was based on the
   2-dimensional noise power spectrum (NPS). The contribution of quantum
   noise was subtracted from the NPS of a flood-field uniformity image,
   resulting in an NPS representing image artifacts. A visual response
   filter function was then applied to both the original NPS and the
   artifact NPS. A single quantitative score was calculated on the basis of
   the magnitude of the artifact. To verify the validity of the SNI, an
   observer study was performed with 5 expert nuclear medicine physicists.
   The correlation between the SNI and the visual score was assessed with
   Spearman rank correlation analysis. The SNI was also compared with pixel
   value-based assessment metrics modeled on the National Electrical
   Manufacturers Association standard for integral uniformity in both the
   useful field of view (UFOV) and the central field of view (CFOV).
   Results: The SNI outperformed the pixel value-based metrics in terms of
   its correlation with the visual score (rho values for the SNI, integral
   UFOV, and integral CFOV were 0.86, 0.59, and 0.58, respectively). The
   SNI had 100\% sensitivity for identifying both structured and
   nonstructured nonuniformities; for the integral UFOV and CFOV metrics,
   the sensitivities were only 62\% and 54\%, respectively. The overall
   positive predictive value of the SNI was 87\%; for the integral UFOV and
   CFOV metrics, the positive predictive values were only 67\% and 50\%,
   respectively. Conclusion: The SNI accurately identified both structured
   and nonstructured flood-field nonuniformities and correlated closely
   with expert visual assessment. Compared with traditional pixel
   value-based analysis, the SNI showed superior performance in terms of
   its correlation with visual perception. The SNI method is effective for
   detecting and quantifying visually apparent nonuniformities and may
   reduce the need for more subjective visual analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe risk factors for geographic atrophy (GA) in the
   Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatments Trials (CATT).
   Design: Cohort within a randomized clinical trial.
   Participants: We analyzed 1024 CATT patients with no GA visible on color
   fundus photographs (CFPs) and/or fluorescein angiograms (FAs) at
   enrollment.
   Methods: Eyes were assigned to ranibizumab (0.5 mg) or bevacizumab (1.25
   mg) treatment and to a 2-year monthly or pro re nata (PRN) injection
   regimen, or monthly injections for 1 year and PRN for 1 year.
   Demographic, genetic, and baseline ocular characteristics and lesion
   features of CFP/FA and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were evaluated
   as risk factors for GA through 2 years of follow-up. Time-dependent Cox
   proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios
   (aHRs).
   Main Outcome Measures: Development of GA.
   Results: By 2 years, GA developed in 187 of 1024 patients (18.3\%).
   Baseline risk factors for GA development included baseline visual acuity
   (VA) <= 20/200 (aHR, 2.65; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.43-4.93),
   retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP; aHR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.47),
   GA in the fellow eye (aHR, 2.07; 95\% CI, 1.40-3.08), and intraretinal
   fluid at the foveal center (aHR, 2.10; 95\% CI, 1.34-3.31). Baseline
   factors associated with lower risk for GA development included blocked
   fluorescence (aHR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.82), OCT measurements of
   subretinal fluid thickness of >25 mu (aHR, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.78),
   subretinal tissue complex thickness of >275 compared with <= 75 mu (aHR,
   0.31; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.50), and vitreomacular attachment (aHR, 0.55; 95\%
   CI, 0.31-0.97). Ranibizumab compared with bevacizumab had a higher risk
   (aHR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.93), and monthly dosing had a higher risk
   (aHR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.17-2.16) than PRN dosing. There were no strong
   associations between development of GA and the presence of risk alleles
   for CFH, ARMS 2, HTRA1, C3, or TLR3.
   Conclusions: Approximately one fifth of CATT patients developed GA
   within 2 years of treatment. Independent baseline risk factors included
   poor VA, RAP, foveal intraretinal fluid, monthly dosing, and treatment
   with ranibizumab. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy may
   have a role in the development of GA. (C) 2014 by the American Academy

Abstract = {{Objective: To define quantitative indicators for the presence of
   intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) via spectral-domain
   optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging of older adults.
   Design: Evaluation of diagnostic test and technology.
   Participants and Controls: One eye from 115 elderly subjects without AMD
   and 269 subjects with intermediate AMD from the Age-Related Eye Disease
   Study 2 (AREDS2) Ancillary SD-OCT Study.
   Methods: We semiautomatically delineated the retinal pigment epithelium
   (RPE) and RPE drusen complex (RPEDC, the axial distance from the apex of
   the drusen and RPE layer to Bruch's membrane) and total retina (TR, the
   axial distance between the inner limiting and Bruch's membranes)
   boundaries. We registered and averaged the thickness maps from control
   subjects to generate a map of ``normal{''} non-AMD thickness. We
   considered RPEDC thicknesses larger or smaller than 3 standard
   deviations from the mean as abnormal, indicating drusen or geographic
   atrophy (GA), respectively. We measured TR volumes, RPEDC volumes, and
   abnormal RPEDC thickening and thinning volumes for each subject. By
   using different combinations of these 4 disease indicators, we designed
   5 automated classifiers for the presence of AMD on the basis of the
   generalized linear model regression framework. We trained and evaluated
   the performance of these classifiers using the leave-one-out method.
   Main Outcome Measures: The range and topographic distribution of the
   RPEDC and TR thicknesses in a 5-mm diameter cylinder centered at the
   fovea.
   Results: The most efficient method for separating AMD and control eyes
   required all 4 disease indicators. The area under the curve (AUC) of the
   receiver operating characteristic (ROC) for this classifier was >0.99.
   Overall neurosensory retinal thickening in eyes with AMD versus control
   eyes in our study contrasts with previous smaller studies.
   Conclusions: We identified and validated efficient biometrics to
   distinguish AMD from normal eyes by analyzing the topographic
   distribution of normal and abnormal RPEDC thicknesses across a large
   atlas of eyes. We created an online atlas to share the 38 400 SD-OCT
   images in this study, their corresponding segmentations, and
   quantitative measurements. (C) 2014 by the American Academy of

Abstract = {{We present the first correction of refraction in three-dimensional (3D)
   ultrasound imaging using an iterative approach that traces propagation
   paths through a two-layer planar tissue model, applying Snell's law in
   3D. This approach is applied to real-time 3D transcranial ultrasound
   imaging by precomputing delays offline for several skull thicknesses,
   allowing the user to switch between three sets of delays for phased
   array imaging at the push of a button. Simulations indicate that
   refraction correction may be expected to increase sensitivity, reduce
   beam steering errors, and partially restore lost spatial resolution,
   with the greatest improvements occurring at the largest steering angles.
   Distorted images of cylindrical lesions were created by imaging through
   an acrylic plate in a tissue-mimicking phantom. As a result of
   correcting for refraction, lesions were restored to 93.6\% of their
   original diameter in the lateral direction and 98.1\% of their original
   shape along the long axis of the cylinders. In imaging two healthy
   volunteers, the mean brightness increased by 8.3\% and showed no spatial

Title = {{The long-term effects of phage concentration on the inhibition of
   planktonic bacterial cultures}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-87}},
Abstract = {{Since the early 1920s there has been an interest in using bacteriophages
   (phages) for the control of bacterial pathogens. While there are many
   factors that have limited the success of phage bio-control, one
   particular problem is the variability of outcomes between phages and
   bacteria. Specifically, there is a significant need for a better
   understanding of how initial phage concentrations affect long-term
   bacterial inhibition. In work reported herein three phages were isolated
   for Escherichia coli K12, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, as well as
   Bacillus cereus and bio-control experiments were performed with phage
   concentrations ranging from 105 to 108 plaque forming units per mL over
   the course of 72 h. For four of the nine phages isolated there was a
   linear relationship between inhibition and phage concentration,
   suggesting the effect of phage concentration is important at longer time
   scales. For three of the isolated phages, phage concentrations had no
   effect on bacterial inhibition suggesting that even at the lowest
   concentration the method of action was saturated and lower
   concentrations might still be effective. Additionally, a cocktail was
   created and was compared to the previously isolated phages. There was no
   statistical difference between the cocktail and the best performing
   phage highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate phages
   for treatment. These results suggest that, for certain phages, there is
   a strong relationship between phage concentration and long-term
   bacterial growth inhibition and the initial phage concentration is an
   important indicator of the long-term outcome.}},

Title = {{Evaluating Passive Microwave Radiometry for the Dynamical Transition
   From Dry to Wet Snowpacks}},

Abstract = {{The microwave response of an idealized snowpack is evaluated for a
   change of the liquid water content (LWC) ranging from 0.0 m(3) m(-3) to
   0.1 m(3) m(-3), a realistic range for a dry to a wet snowpack
   transition. Next, the microwave radiometric behavior of a snowpack as a
   function of LWC is investigated using a coupled snow hydrology-microwave
   emission model that consists of a direct combination of multi-layer snow
   hydrology model and a forward model of microwave emission based on the
   simulated multi-layer snowpack. The microwave response during the
   transition is characterized by an initial increase of the brightness
   temperature (Tb) followed by a monotonic attenuation of Tb with a linear
   increase of LWC. Thus, the microwave response Tb to the increase in LWC
   exhibits a convex shape. The early amplification of Tb is caused by a
   sharp increase of the absorption coefficient attributed by a relatively
   small amount of LWC within the snowpack. This peak of Tb can be
   explained by the decrease in layer reflectivity and transmissivity in
   the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks. The decrease of snow
   layer transmissivity indicates that the snowpack operates as an opaque
   medium in the microwave spectrum for small values of LWC. However, when
   LWC continues to increase, the increase of interface reflectivity at the
   atmosphere-snowpack interface begins to suppress the increasing Tb
   trend. As a result, the Tb subsequently decreases because the interface
   transmissivity, a complement of reflectivity, decreases asymptotically.
   This arched (convex) behavior of the Tb signal with increasing LWC is
   also exhibited by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager and the
   ground-based microwave radiometer observations concurrent with the
   presence of LWC in the simulated snowpack. For the validation of the Tb
   response to the LWC, simulations using a coupled snow
   hydrology-microwave emission model are compared against both passive
   microwave satellite and ground-based radiometer observations during the
   2002-2003 Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX). Two Meso-cell Study
   Areas from CLPX are selected to evaluate the coupled model performances
   of Tb and snowpack physical properties in response to changes in LWC.}},

Abstract = {{Multithreshold CMOS is very effective for reducing standby leakage power
   during long periods of inactivity. Recently, a power-gating scheme was
   presented to support multiple power-off modes and reduce the leakage
   power during short periods of inactivity. However, this scheme can
   suffer from high sensitivity to process variations, which impedes
   manufacturability. We propose a new power-gating technique that is
   tolerant to process variations and scalable to more than two
   intermediate power-off modes. The proposed design requires less design
   effort and offers greater power reduction and smaller area cost than the
   previous method. In addition, it can be combined with existing
   techniques to offer further static power reduction benefits. Analysis
   and extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed design.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a microfluidic flow-control system capable of dynamically
   generating various flow patterns on demand. The flow-control system is
   based on novel magnetoactive sponges embedded in microfluidic flow
   channels. Applying a non-uniform magnetic field compresses the
   magnetoactive sponge, significantly reducing porosity and hydraulic
   conductivity. Tuning the applied magnetic field can dynamically vary the
   flow rate in the microfluidic channel. Pulsatile and physiological flow
   patterns with frequency between 1 and 3 Hz, flow rates between 0.5 and
   10 mu L min(-1) and duration over 3 weeks have been achieved. Smooth
   muscle cells in engineered blood vessels perfused for 7 days aligned
   perpendicular to the flow direction under pulsatile but not steady flow,
   similar to the in vivo orientation. Owing to its various advantages over
   traditional flow-control methods, the new system potentially has
   important applications in microfluidic-based microphysiological systems
   to simulate the physiological nature of blood flow.}},

Abstract = {{Diarthrodial joints are well suited to intra-articular injection, and
   the local delivery of therapeutics in this fashion brings several
   potential advantages to the treatment of a wide range of arthropathies.
   Possible benefits over systemic delivery include increased
   bioavailability, reduced systemic exposure, fewer adverse events, and
   lower total drug costs. Nevertheless, intra-articular therapy is
   challenging because of the rapid egress of injected materials from the
   joint space; this elimination is true of both small molecules, which
   exit via synovial capillaries, and of macromolecules, which are cleared
   by the lymphatic system. In general, soluble materials have an
   intra-articular dwell time measured only in hours. Corticosteroids and
   hyaluronate preparations constitute the mainstay of FDA-approved
   intra-articular therapeutics. Recombinant proteins, autologous blood
   products and analgesics have also found clinical use via intra-articular
   delivery. Several alternative approaches, such as local delivery of cell
   and gene therapy, as well as the use of microparticles, liposomes, and
   modified drugs, are in various stages of preclinical development.}},

Abstract = {{As swollen polymer networks in water, hydrogels are usually brittle.
   However, hydrogels with high toughness play critical roles in many plant
   and animal tissues as well as in diverse engineering applications. Here
   we review the intrinsic mechanisms of a wide variety of tough hydrogels
   developed over the past few decades. We show that tough hydrogels
   generally possess mechanisms to dissipate substantial mechanical energy
   but still maintain high elasticity under deformation. The integrations
   and interactions of different mechanisms for dissipating energy and
   maintaining elasticity are essential to the design of tough hydrogels. A
   matrix that combines various mechanisms is constructed for the first
   time to guide the design of next-generation tough hydrogels. We further
   highlight that a particularly promising strategy for the design is to
   implement multiple mechanisms across multiple length scales into nano-,
   micro-, meso-, and macro-structures of hydrogels.}},

Abstract = {{With appropriate geometry configurations, bistatic synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) can break through the limitations of monostatic SAR on
   forward-looking imaging. Thanks to such a capability, bistatic
   forward-looking SAR (BFSAR) has extensive potential applications, such
   as self-navigation and self-landing. In the mode of BFSAR with a
   stationary transmitter (ST-BFSAR), the two-dimensional spatial variation
   makes it difficult to use traditional data focusing algorithms. In this
   letter, an imaging algorithm based on keystone transform and nonlinear
   chirp scaling (NLCS) is proposed to deal with this problem. Keystone
   transform is used to remove the spatial variation of range cell
   migration. NLCS can eliminate the variation of azimuth reference
   function. Numerical simulations show that by combining first-order
   keystone transform and azimuth NLCS operation, the raw data of ST-BFSAR
   can be well imaged.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this work is calibration of the land-use module of an
   integrated land-use and transportation model (ILUTM). The calibration
   task involves estimating key parameters that dictate the output of the
   land-use module. Hence, an algorithm based on maximum-likelihood
   estimation (MLE) is developed for calibration. Furthermore, the observed
   values of the outputs from the land-use module are assumed to admit a
   Gaussian error. The ILUTM methodology used here is TRANUS which is used
   to model the city of Grenoble in France. The aforementioned algorithm is
   then applied to calibrate the land-use module of the Grenoble model. The
   covariance of the Gaussian error term is assumed to be unknown. It is
   represented as a function of the land-use module inputs and
   ``hyperparameters.{''} The resulting MLE optimization problem has 111
   parameters to be estimated, 90 of which are land use parameters and 21
   are hyperparameters of the Gaussian covariance kernel. The performance
   of the proposed calibration methodology is then compared to the
   traditional calibration techniques used for land use and transportation
   models, when applied to the Grenoble land-use model. It is observed that
   the proposed method outperforms the traditional technique when compared
   based upon a given quantity of interest.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of two common chemical extraction techniques on
   bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) skin tissues with the intent to
   develop a mathematical lipid correction for dolphin skin C-13. One
   method employs a hot solvent mixture (chloroform and methanol) while the
   other method requires washing the samples with cold solvent followed by
   water. The water wash method resulted in significant alteration of
   tissue N-15. We found no correlation between change in sample mass and
   C/N or between change in sample mass and the change in C-13 (C-13)
   following lipid extraction. Although C-13 was positive following lipid
   extraction (mean = 1.6 parts per thousand and 1.2 parts per thousand,
   for the two methods), there was no correlation between C/N and C-13 for
   either method. Cumulatively, these results prevented us from applying a
   mathematical lipid normalization. Based on our findings and
   consideration of previously reported results, we suggest that applying
   these extraction techniques to dolphin skin with C/N<4.5 introduces
   greater uncertainty than is warranted. We recommend against lipid
   correction for dolphin skins with C/N<4.5, but stress that the resulting
   uncertainty in C-13 needs to be accounted for when implementing isotope
   mixing models to assess diet or organic matter sources.}},

Abstract = {{The water-reactive tissue adhesive 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (OCA) was
   microencapsulated in polyurethane shells and incorporated into Palacos R
   bone cement. The tensile and compressive properties of the composite
   material were investigated in accordance with commercial standards, and
   fracture toughness of the capsule-embedded bone cement was measured
   using the tapered double-cantilever beam geometry. Viability and
   proliferation of MG63 human osteosarcoma cells after culture with
   extracts from Palacos R bone cement, capsule-embedded Palacos R bone
   cement, and OCA were also analyzed. Incorporating up to 5 wt \% capsules
   had little effect on the compressive and tensile properties of the
   composite, but greater than 5 wt \% capsules reduced these values below
   commercial standards. Fracture toughness was increased by 13\% through
   the incorporation of 3 wt \% capsules and eventually decreased below the
   toughness of the capsule-free controls at capsule contents of 15 wt \%
   and higher. The effect on cell proliferation and viability in response
   to extracts prepared from capsule-embedded and commercial bone cements
   were not significantly different from each other, whereas extracts from
   OCA were moderately toxic to cells. Overall, the addition of lower wt \%
   of OCA-containing microcapsules to commercial bone cement was found to
   moderately increase static mechanical properties without increasing the
   toxicity of the material. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed

Abstract = {{Disseminating effective practices for engineering education requires
   developing pedagogical communities that bring together faculty from many
   institutions. Through an NSF-funded ASEE effort aimed at facilitating
   faculty development in research-based instruction, we led an online
   Virtual Community of Practice (VCP) around the teaching of introductory
   Electric Circuits. The VCP comprised 20 faculty members who were broadly
   diverse in terms of geography, institutional characteristics, and
   teaching experience. Meetings were held using Adobe Connect, with
   materials shared and discussions held through an online portal built
   with Open Atrium. This platform carried many advantages - such as
   allowing a large group to interact and view a common presentation, while
   also facilitating smaller break-out groups - but it also posed logistic
   issues inherent into any use of technology for group interactions.
   Leaders of the circuits VCP along with VCPs on other topics in
   electrical engineering - were trained by a Leadership VCP in advance of
   its sessions.
   The Electric Circuits VCP consisted of 9 weekly 90-minute sessions
   during Spring 2013, each including learning objectives and an assignment
   for participants. There were also 5 sessions during Fall 2013. Breakout
   groups within each session promoted interactions among subsets of the
   participants; these were critical for encouraging broad participation,
   with each breakout group reporting back to the full VCP afterward.
   Pre-planned topics included (1) Introduction to the Circuits VCP, (2)
   Overview of Research-based Instructional Approaches, (3) Learning
   Objectives and Bloom's Taxonomy, (4) Student Motivation, (5) Teams, and
   (6) \& (7) Making the Classroom More Interactive. The topics for
   sessions (8) and (9) were developed by our VCP community during
   preceding weeks: (8) Simulation and Hands-On Learning, Assessing Impact;
   (9) Great Ideas that Flopped. In addition to the weekly meetings of the
   entire VCP, participants interacted via ad hoc small-group meetings,
   email and polling to collect opinions and ideas, and additional material
   provided after each session.
   Nearly all participants reported that they are making significant
   changes in their Circuits courses based on their VCP experience. Topics
   that elicited the most interest from the participants, based on their
   post-VCP feedback, were: (1) Flipped Classrooms; (2) Hands-On Learning
   based on Inexpensive Measurement Hardware; (3) Assessment. Participants
   are also developing topics for collaborative research and a workshop to
   share what they have learned with faculty from other institutions.
   Leaders in implementing flipped classrooms, MOOCs, and other new
   pedagogy have also been invited to work with the group both offline and
   during regular meetings.
   The VCP model proved to be effective at establishing a diverse
   pedagogical community, without the resource and time constraints of
   regular in-person meetings. There are still some limitations, however.
   Those faculty who are particularly dedicated to undergraduate
   instruction - and thus are the best candidates to participate in a VCP -
   often have limited time for activities that may not have immediate
   impact on their daily responsibilities. Also, interactions in large
   online groups may not suffice to promote a strong working relationship.
   Based on the personal experience of the authors, a substantive
   collaboration requires regular online face-to-face interaction followed
   by additional electronic exchanges as materials are finalized. Despite
   these limitations, our initial implementation of the VCP model provides
   a guide for other groups to create similar virtual communities for other
   aspects of engineering education.}},

Abstract = {{Student motivation - and associated educational outcomes - can be
   influenced by the degree to which course material connects to
   recognizable societal problems. The National Academy for Engineering has
   established the ``Engineering Grand Challenges{''}, a set of 14
   fundamental problems whose solutions will require integrated
   contributions from engineers, scientists, and policy-makers. The current
   work grafts the Engineering Grand Challenges (EGC) onto a pedagogical
   framework integrated into courses in several engineering disciplines,
   assessing whether this framework increased student motivation and, if
   so, what facets of learning benefit from this approach.
   The EGC framework, as implemented here, follows a series of six stages
   that progress from statement of the problem, through exercises that
   teach a foundational concept using an EGC example, to reflection on the
   role of engineering in addressing the problem. The framework was
   implemented in three diverse courses: a computational methods course
   taken by all first-year engineering students, an upper-level
   signal-processing elective in electrical engineering, and a design
   course for upper-level students in environmental engineering.
   Instructors for each of these courses implemented the EGC framework in a
   manner appropriate for their course. For example, students in the signal
   processing course investigated the EGC of ``Reverse-Engineering the
   Brain{''}, which included a lecture/discussion led by a neuroscientist
   who uses signal processing, followed by a project assignment that
   applied spectral analysis and filter design to publicly available data
   from a brain-computer interface contest. For all courses, baseline data
   were collected from the same classes taught by the same instructors in
   the previous year.
   Results from the first year of implementation indicated significant
   benefits for the EGC framework, as well as differences in effectiveness
   across settings. Each student provided data that included self-reported
   ratings of ABET criteria and standard psychological measures of
   motivation, and those measures were included in structural equation
   models that predicted interstudent differences in grades. The EGC
   framework was associated with significantly higher self-reported class
   effectiveness, as indexed by ABET criteria. Furthermore, in advanced
   classes the EGC framework enhanced a key measure of student motivation
   (i.e., situational interest), which in turn was a positive predictor of
   ABET criteria. This effect was not present in the introductory class
   examined. No differences between EGC and baseline groups were found in
   other measures of self-reported motivation (e.g., perceived competence).
   Collectively, these results provide strong initial evidence that framing
   course activities around large-scale, societally relevant challenges can
   have salutary effects upon students' motivation and skill development
   according to the ABET criteria. Ongoing work examines these effects
   across multiple semesters of the same courses, as well as across
   additional courses from throughout engineering curricula.}},

   emerged as the major sources of uncertainty and unpredictability in
   circuit operation. Static mitigation approaches do not consider the
   dependence of variations on workload and chip usage, while adaptive
   techniques do not incorporate detailed circuit-level information. We
   propose a fine-grained adaptive technique in which machine learning is
   exploited to perform circuit clustering and obtain a representative for
   each cluster. By monitoring the representative in each cluster at
   runtime, performance variations in the entire cluster can be tracked
   such that appropriate fine- grained adaptation can be applied to each
   cluster. Experimental results for ISCAS'89, IWLS'05, and ITC'99
   benchmarks as well as the LEON processor show that the proposed approach
   introduces negligible overhead significantly extends circuit lifetime,
   facilitates higher operating frequencies, and reduces the leakage power.}},

Abstract = {{A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive platform for
   immunoassays, point-of-care clinical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, and
   other laboratory procedures in biochemistry. Effective testing methods
   are required to ensure robust DMFB operation and high confidence in the
   outcome of biochemical experiments. Prior work on DMFB testing does not
   address the problem of designing the test to minimize reliability
   degradation during test application. It also ignores physical
   constraints arising from fluidic behavior and the physics of
   electrowetting-on-dielectric. We develop a practical and realistic
   testing method by first systematically analyzing the influence of
   actuation voltage and actuation frequency on the distribution of the
   electric field, and its resulting effect on dielectric degradation.
   Next, we use this analysis to choose appropriate parameter settings for
   testing, and proposes a new pipelined scan-like testing method. Both
   static and dynamic fluidic constraints are considered in the new testing
   method, and a diagnosis technique is presented to easily locate defects.
   Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed testing approach in minimizing
   test-completion time.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to propose a control scheme to maximize
   area coverage and at the same time ensure reliable communication in
   networks of mobile robot sensors. The information that is generated at
   the sensors depends on the sensing capabilities of the sensors as well
   as on the frequency at which events occur in their vicinity, captured by
   appropriate probability density functions. This information is then
   routed to a fixed set of access points via a multi-hop network whose
   links model the probability that information packets are correctly
   decoded at their intended destinations. The proposed hybrid controller
   simultaneously optimizes coverage and routing of information by
   decoupling control in the continuous and discrete domains. The robots'
   motion is performed in continuous time, along the negative gradient of a
   cost function that combines the coverage objective and a barrier
   potential used to ensure satisfaction of desired communication rates. On
   the other hand, the communication variables are updated periodically, in
   discrete time, by the solution of an optimization problem, and
   constitute the switching signal in the continuous motion control.
   Simulation studies are conducted verifying the efficiency of the
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{3D triangulated meshes are used ubiquitously in biomedicine to model
   tissue surfaces, owing to their geometric flexibility and non-parametric
   nature. One often needs to interpolate scalar functions over such
   meshes, either because the interpolant itself provides the solution to a
   problem, a visualization of the interpolant on top of the mesh is
   desired, or, quite commonly, both. A common example is the production of
   electroanatomical maps of the left atrium in the study, diagnosis, and
   treatment of atrial fibrillation. One appealing method that has been
   used is Laplacian interpolation because of its unique property of
   maximizing smoothness. However, the only documented method to date to
   adopt Laplacian interpolation to 3D triangulated meshes uses matrix
   formulations that may impose undesirable constraints. In this paper, we
   present a simple, novel numerical method for Laplacian interpolation on
   3D triangulated surfaces. It converges quickly, requires relatively few
   computations compared to a matrix solution, and can be easily
   implemented. The method was successfully used in clinical studies of
   atrial fibrillation, and can be adopted to many problem domains
   involving 3D meshes.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to propose a distributed control scheme to
   maximize area coverage by a mobile robot network while ensuring reliable
   communication between the members of the team. The information that is
   generated at the sensors depends on the sensing capabilities of the
   sensors as well as on the frequency at which events occur in their
   vicinity, captured by appropriate probability density functions. This
   information is then routed to a fixed set of access points via a
   multihop network whose links model the probability that information
   packets are correctly decoded at their intended destinations. The
   proposed distributed control scheme simultaneously optimizes coverage
   and routing of information by decoupling coverage and routing control.
   Specifically, optimization of the communication variables is performed
   periodically in the dual domain. Then, between communication rounds, the
   robots move according to the solution of a distributed sequential
   concave program that handles efficiently the introduced nonlinearities
   in the mobility space. Our method is illustrated in computer
   simulations.}},

   is at least (d - 2) / 2 log n+O(1) for the universal compression of a
   sequence of length n from a d-dimensional parametric source. Further,
   the type-size coding strategy is shown to be minimax optimal up to o(log
   n) for the class of memoryless sources, achieving the converse leading
   to characterization of the fundamental performance limit of universal
   compression for memoryless sources. Finally, through a numerical
   example, our results imply that the reduction on the codeword length due

Abstract = {{Different polarization incidences and/or inflections yield different
   polarization scattering powers. The problem of searching optimal
   polarization state for the maximal polarization receiving power (PRP) is
   of significantly meaningful. Usually, there are no analytic solutions to
   the problem and current numerical methods are time consuming. Aiming to
   reduce the computational time, fast optimization mechanism is studied in
   this paper. An improved Lagrange method (ILM) based on bisection
   strategy is proposed for monostatic condition. This method takes the
   advantage of monotonicity of a cost function constructed by Lagrange
   multiplier to accelerate searching speed. The performance of this method
   is validated by comparing with the Lagrange method proposed by Chen
   (LMC). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method in
   this paper is superior to the existing method.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of learning probabilistic models from relational
   data. One of the key issues with relational data is class imbalance
   where the number of negative examples far outnumbers the number of
   positive examples. The common approach for dealing with this problem is
   the use of sub-sampling of negative examples. We, on the other hand,
   consider a soft margin approach that explicitly trades off between the
   false positives and false negatives. We apply this approach to the
   recently successful formalism of relational functional gradient
   boosting. Specifically, we modify the objective function of the learning
   problem to explicitly include the trade-off between false positives and
   negatives. We show empirically that this approach is more successful in
   handling the class imbalance problem than the original framework that
   weighed all the examples equally.}},

   are estimated with the aid of generalized likelihood ratio (GLR)

Abstract = {{We present an end-to-end design of a built-in self-test (BIST)
   infrastructure for 3D-stacked ICs that facilitates the use of BIST at
   multiple stages of 3D integration. The proposed BIST design is
   distributed, reusable, and reconfigurable, hence it is attractive for
   both pre-bond and post-bond testing. We also provide support for
   translating a static BIST schedule into a set of BIST control
   instructions. The BIST design is validated using detailed simulations of
   the various operating modes. We present results on synthetic stacks
   created from ITC'99 and Open-Core benchmark circuits and assess the
   impact of inserting BIST in these designs in terms of area, timing, and
   power overhead. Results show that the overhead due to BIST is
   negligible. We also formulate a test-scheduling problem that aims at
   minimizing test time under BIST-resource and power constraints, and use
   two algorithms based on bin packing for solving the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon debug is a major challenge due to continuously increasing design
   complexity. Traditional debug methods using signal tracing suffer from
   the limited capacity of on-chip trace buffers that only allow for signal
   observation during a short time window. We propose a low-cost debug
   architecture for massive signal tracing in ICs that integrate fast DRAM,
   such as 2D-ICs with embedded DRAM or 3D-stacked ICs with wide-I/O DRAM
   dies. The key idea is to use available on-chip DRAM for trace-data
   storage, which results in a significant increase of the observation
   window compared to traditional methods that use trace buffers. During a
   debug session, the entire observation window is divided into intervals
   and a signature is calculated for each observed interval using a
   multiple-input signature register. At run time, intervals containing
   erroneous bits are identified by comparing their signature with
   pre-calculated ``golden{''} signatures that are stored in the DRAM a
   priori. Only failing intervals including their time stamp are stored
   into DRAM, which allows for a more efficient use of the memory,
   resulting in a larger observation window. The proposed method does not
   require multiple iterations or intermediate processing steps, hence it
   can be used during functional testing with minimum time overhead
   associated with the upload of golden signatures and the download of
   stored debug data to external equipment. We have created a Verilog RTL
   model for the proposed architecture, synthesized it using a 45 nm CMOS
   library, and verified its functionality by simulation. The results show
   that the observation window can be increased by orders of magnitude
   compared to prior work at comparable hardware cost.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnosis of functional failures at the board level is critical for
   improving product yield and reducing manufacturing cost. Reasoning
   techniques increase the accuracy of functional-fault diagnosis based on
   the history of successfully repaired boards. However, depending on the
   complexity of the product, it usually takes several months to accumulate
   an adequate database for training a reasoning-based diagnosis system.
   During the initial product ramp-up phase, reasoning-based diagnosis is
   not feasible for yield learning, since the required database is not
   available due to lack of volume. We propose a knowledge-discovery method
   and a knowledge-transfer method for facilitating board-level functional
   fault diagnosis. First, an analysis technique based on machine learning
   is used to discover knowledge from syndromes, which can be used for
   training a diagnosis engine. Second, knowledge from diagnosis engines
   used for earlier-generation products can be automatically transferred
   through root-cause mapping and syndrome mapping based on keywords and
   board-structure similarities. Two complex boards in volume production
   and with a mature diagnosis system, and three new boards in the ramp-up
   phase, are used to validate the proposed knowledge-discovery and
   knowledge-transfer approach in terms of the diagnosis accuracy obtained
   using the new diagnosis systems.}},

Abstract = {{On June 5, 2013, the SpriteCam network recorded a relatively weak sprite
   over a thunderstorm in Oklahoma. The broadband magnetic fields recorded
   at multiple stations consistently indicate that this event was produced
   by a negative cloud-to-ground (CG) event that probably contained two
   ground strokes separated by about 3 ms. Although neither stroke caused
   substantial impulse charge moment change that is sufficient to produce a
   negative sprite, the contributions of the two strokes are combined so
   that. The similar sprite-associated sferic waveform is also observed for
   a negative sprite recorded by ISUAL from space on August 15, 2012. In
   this case, the negative sprite appeared to be unusually bright due to
   the electric field enhancement cased by the second stroke. Therefore,
   the intrinsic complexity in the parent stroke is probably responsible
   for the observed variance in the morphology of negative sprites.}},

   transient lightning electric fields above thunderstorms. Recently,
   significant efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the
   inception mechanism of sprite streamers, the origin of different sprite

   In this paper, we present a combination of observational and modeling
   results explaining the physical parameters and processes that are
   important for the resolution of these outstanding issues. We first
   emphasize the presence of plasma inhomogeneities in the lower ionosphere
   as a necessary condition for the initiation of sprite streamers. Then we
   explain the relation between sprite morphology and the characteristics
   of the causative lightning discharges using plasma fluid modeling
   results in comparison with optical and radio observations. Finally, we
   discuss the critical factors that account for the lightning polarity
   asymmetry in producing sprites.}},

Abstract = {{Our knowledge regarding native heart development is relatively
   comprehensive; however, we remain largely dependent on empiricism in our
   approaches to recapitulate cardiomyogenesis in vitro. Toward clinical
   translation, it is critical that we understand how different
   biochemical, biophysical and biomaterial parameters of tissue culture
   govern the maturation and functional output of engineered myocardium,
   particularly when using pluripotent stem cell-based approaches. Here we
   review the processes of native myocardial maturation, compare them with
   those observed during the culture of engineered cardiac tissues, and
   discuss potential approaches toward promoting functional
   cardiomyogenesis in vitro. We conclude by offering our impressions on
   the important next steps.}},

Title = {{Assessing Intervention Timing in Computer-Based Education Using Machine
   Learning Algorithms}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{78-87}},
Abstract = {{The use of computer-based and online education systems has made new data
   available that can describe the temporal and process-level progression
   of learning. To date, machine learning research has not considered the
   impacts of these properties on the machine learning prediction task in
   educational settings. Machine learning algorithms may have applications
   in supporting targeted intervention approaches. The goals of this paper
   are to: 1) determine the impact of process-level information on machine
   learning prediction results and 2) establish the effect of type of
   machine learning algorithm used on prediction results. Data were
   collected from a university level course in human factors engineering (n
   = 35), which included both traditional classroom assessment and
   computer-based assessment methods. A set of common regression and
   classification algorithms were applied to the data to predict final
   course score. The overall prediction accuracy as well as the
   chronological progression of prediction accuracy was analyzed for each
   algorithm. Simple machine learning algorithms (linear regression,
   logistic regression) had comparable performance with more complex
   methods (support vector machines, artificial neural networks).
   Process-level information was not useful in post-hoc predictions, but
   contributed significantly to allowing for accurate predictions to be
   made earlier in the course. Process level information provides useful
   prediction features for development of targeted intervention techniques,
   as it allows more accurate predictions to be made earlier in the course.
   For small course data sets, the prediction accuracy and simplicity of
   linear regression and logistic regression make these methods preferable
   to more complex algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile phones are becoming the convergent platform for personal sensing,
   computing, and communication. This paper attempts to exploit this
   convergence toward the problem of automatic image tagging. We envision
   TagSense, a mobile phone-based collaborative system that senses the
   people, activity, and context in a picture, and merges them carefully to
   create tags on-the-fly. The main challenge pertains to discriminating
   phone users that are in the picture from those that are not. We deploy a
   prototype of TagSense on eight Android phones, and demonstrate its
   effectiveness through 200 pictures, taken in various social settings.
   While research in face recognition continues to improve image tagging,
   TagSense is an attempt to embrace additional dimensions of sensing
   toward this end goal. Performance comparison with Apple iPhoto and
   Google Picasa shows that such an out-of-band approach is valuable,
   especially with increasing device density and greater sophistication in
   sensing and learning algorithms.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR THERAPY-METHODS \& CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT}},

Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Electrotransfection is a technique utilized for gene delivery in both
   preclinical and clinical studies. However, its mechanisms are not fully
   understood. The goal of this study was to investigate specific pathways
   of endocytosis involved in electrotransfection. In the study, three
   different human cell lines (HEK293, HCT116, and HT29) were either
   treated with ice cold medium postelectrotransfection or endocytic
   inhibitors prior to electrotransfection. The inhibitors were
   pharmacological agents (chlorpromazine, genistein, and amiloride) or
   different small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules that could knockdown
   expression of clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), caveolin-1, and Rab34,
   respectively. The reduction in gene expressions was confirmed with
   western blot analysis at 48-72h post-siRNA treatment. It was observed
   that treatments with either ice cold medium, chlorpromazine, or
   genistein resulted in significant reductions in electrotransfection
   efficiency (eTE) in all three cell lines, compared to the matched
   controls, but amiloride treatment had insignificant effects on eTE. For
   cells treated with siRNA, only CLTC knockdown resulted in eTE reduction
   for all three cell lines. Together, these data demonstrated that the
   clathrin-mediated endocytosis played an important role in
   electrotransfection.}},

Abstract = {{Most current methods on polarization targets detection assume the target
   echoes to be ascertained in signal model during the detection period.
   But in fact, the target echo may obey a kind of distribution and the
   distribution relates with the polarizations. Aiming at improving the
   performance of polarization detection, an adaptive generalized
   likelihood ratio (AGLR) polarization detector is proposed. The detector
   assumes the target echo to be a non-zero mean Gaussian distribution with
   respect to the polarization states of transceiver. It adaptively adjusts
   the polarization states of transceiver according to the variation of the
   polarization characteristics of target and clutter to maximize signal to
   clutter and noise ratio (SCNR). The problem of maximizing the SCNR is
   converted to a problem of maximizing a generalized Rayleigh quotient
   (GRQ). Based on the GRQ, the AGLR detector is proposed. The performance
   of the AGLR de-tector is theoretically analyzed and numerically
   validated through some numerical experiments.Compared with two
   conventional GLR detectors, the AGLR detector achieves a 3dB to 10dB
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface imaging 3-D objects buried in layered medium with
   electromagnetic waves has recently attracted significant interests. Due
   to the uncertainty of dielectric parameters of layered background media
   in practice, most of existing electromagnetic inverse methods
   reconstruct the buried objects unfaithfully. In order to accurately
   reconstruct the objects buried in multilayered media with unknown
   dielectric parameters, we develop a new imaging method named
   electromagnetic inverse scattering series method (EISSM) for imaging 3-D
   objects in multilayered media. The 3-D EISSM combines the inverse
   scattering series (ISS) theory with a multi-array tomographic approach.
   It directly reconstructs the positions of the buried objects (not their
   dielectric properties) solely with the dielectric parameters of free
   space according to the discontinuities of dielectric parameters.
   Moreover, the effects of multilayered media to the position error
   predicted by EISSM are also analyzed and discussed. Aiming to validate
   the feasibility of the developed 3-D EISSM, some numerical simulations
   are given as well as the results reconstructed by commonly used time
   reversal mirror (TRM) technique. Through the simulations, the EISSM is
   capable of positioning 3-D targets buried in multilayered media with
   less error than traditional TRM.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and unsplit-field finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
   implementation of the complex frequency-shifted perfectly matched layer
   (CFS-PML), based on the digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and
   the material independence relations via applying the electric flux
   density (D) and the magnetic flux density (B), is proposed for
   truncating three dimensional FDTD computational domain entirely composed
   of dispersive material realized with a Drude model. The CFS-PML
   implementation is introduced based on the stretched coordinate PML
   (SC-PML) and the uniaxial anisotropic PML (UPML), respectively. The
   implementation of the proposed CFS-PML formulations is based on the
   SC-PML due to the fact that has advantage of simple implementation in
   the corners and the edges of the PML regions. Moreover, these proposed
   formulations are completely independent of the material properties of
   the FDTD computational domain and hence can be applied to truncate
   arbitrary media without any modification because of the D-B constitutive
   relations used in Maxwell's equations. Besides, the DSP techniques
   include the Bilinear Z-transform (BZT) method and the Matched
   Z-transform (MZT) method, respectively. However, from the point of view
   of the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy (CFL) condition, to the best of our
   knowledge, time step based on the BZT only needs to meet CFL condition,
   whereas time step based on the MZT method has to make it smaller for
   retaining stability and desirable accuracy. Consequently, the former one
   is introduced into the proposed formulations. A numerical example has
   been carried out in a three dimensional FDTD computational domain to
   validate the proposed formulations. It is clearly shown that the
   proposed formulations with CFS scheme are efficient in attenuating
   evanescent waves and reducing late-time reflections.}},

Abstract = {{A coaxial-fed patch antenna with a ferrite-ferroelectric bilayer above a
   regular alumina substrate has been designed and analyzed. The
   ferrite-ferroelectric bilayer, multiferroic heterostructure, consists of
   a near-single-crystal ferrite yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film layer and a
   ferroelectric ceramic barium strontium titanate (BST) film layer with
   thicknesses of 1 mu m and 0.5 mu m, respectively. When the electric
   field applied across the BST layer changes from 2.5 V/um to 15 V/um, its
   permittivity will be tuned, thus the operating frequency of the antenna
   will shift as well. We also analyze the influence of the static magnetic
   field variation to the operating frequency of the antenna.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of indirect microwave holographic together
   with inverse scattering techniques for the reconstruction of the
   dielectric properties of unknown objects. The use of indirect microwave
   holography enables the complex field scattered from the object under
   imaging to be recovered from intensity-only scalar microwave
   measurements and therefore removes the requirement of using expensive
   vector measurement equipment. This significantly reduces the cost of the
   imaging system and simplifies the hardware implementation. Following the
   successful implementation of indirect holography method for shape and
   position reconstruction, we have explored an algorithm which combines
   indirect holography method and CSI method to solve the phaseless data
   reconstruction problem. Results presented here indicate that the
   material properties of composite dielectric objects can be accurately
   reconstructed using scalar measurements from indirect holography.}},

   quickly on the spot before he or she completely disappears. A key idea
   lies in constructing the location history of a child via crowd
   participation, thereby leading parents to their child easily and

   natural frequency and stability of rocking semicircular and parabolic
   disks. Horace Lamb's method for deriving the natural frequency of an
   arbitrary rocking disk is applied to two shapes with semicircular and
   parabolic cross sections, respectively. For the case of the semicircular
   disk, the system's equation of motion is derived to verify Lamb's
   method. Additionally, the rocking semicircular disk is found to always
   have one stable equilibrium position. For the case of the parabolic
   disk, this investigation unveils a super-critical pitchfork bifurcation
   for changes in a single geometric parameter which reveals that the
   system can exhibit bistable behavior Rapid prototyping technology was
   used to manufacture sample disks across a wide range of parameters, and
   a laser tachometer was used to experimentally determine the natural
   frequency of each disk. Comparisons between experiment and theory show
   good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of stable limit-cycles plays an important role in
   quantifying the characteristics of dynamical systems. In practice, exact
   knowledge of model parameters is rarely available leading to parameter
   uncertainties, which can be modeled as an input of random variables.
   This has the effect that the limit-cycles become stochastic themselves,
   resulting in almost surely time-periodic solutions with a stochastic
   period. In this paper we introduce a novel numerical method for the
   computation of stable stochastic limit-cycles based on the spectral
   stochastic finite element method using polynomial chaos (PC). We are
   able to overcome the difficulties of PC regarding its well-known
   convergence breakdown for long term integration. To this end, we
   introduce a stochastic time scaling which treats the stochastic period
   as an additional random variable and controls the phase-drift of the
   stochastic trajectories, keeping the necessary PC order low. Based on
   the rescaled governing equations, we aim at determining an initial
   condition and a period such that the trajectories close after completion
   of one stochastic cycle. Furthermore, we verify the numerical method by
   computation of a vortex shedding of a flow around a circular domain with
   stochastic inflow boundary conditions as a benchmark problem. The
   results are verified by comparison to purely deterministic reference
   problems and demonstrate high accuracy up to machine precision in
   capturing the stochastic variations of the limit-cycle.}},

Abstract = {{With stroke currently the second-leading cause of death globally, and
   87\% of all strokes classified as ischemic, the development of a fast,
   accessible, cost-effective approach for imaging occlusive stroke could
   have a significant impact on health care outcomes and costs. Although
   clinical examination and standard computed tomography alone do not
   provide adequate information for understanding the complex temporal
   events that occur during an ischemic stroke, ultrasound imaging is well
   suited to the task of examining blood flow dynamics in real time and may
   allow for localization of a clot. A prototype bilateral 3-D ultrasound
   imaging system using two matrix array probes on either side of the head
   allows for correction of skull-induced aberration throughout two entire
   phased array imaging volumes. We investigated the feasibility of
   applying this custom correction technique in five healthy volunteers
   with Definity microbubble contrast enhancement. Subjects were scanned
   simultaneously via both temporal acoustic windows in 3-D color flow
   mode. The number of color flow voxels above a common threshold increased
   as a result of aberration correction in five of five subjects, with a
   mean increase of 33.9\%. The percentage of large arteries visualized by
   3-D color Doppler imaging increased from 46\% without aberration
   correction to 60\% with aberration correction. (C) 2014 World Federation

Abstract = {{Digital image correlation (DIC) technique has been increasingly employed
   to implement surface deformation measurements in many engineering
   fields. Practically, it has been demonstrated that the choice of subset
   sizes exerts a strong influence on measurement results of DIC,
   especially when there exists locally larger deformation over the subsets
   involved. This paper proposes a novel subpixel registration algorithm
   with Gaussian windows to implicitly optimize the subset sizes by

Abstract = {{We report a comprehensive study of the binary systems of the
   platinum-group metals with the transition metals, using high-throughput
   first-principles calculations. These computations predict stability of
   new compounds in 28 binary systems where no compounds have been reported
   in the literature experimentally and a few dozen of as-yet unreported
   compounds in additional systems. Our calculations also identify stable
   structures at compound compositions that have been previously reported
   without detailed structural data and indicate that some experimentally
   reported compounds may actually be unstable at low temperatures. With
   these results, we construct enhanced structure maps for the binary
   alloys of platinum-group metals. These maps are much more complete,
   systematic, and predictive than those based on empirical results alone.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Analysis of Microbicide Concentrations in Fluids, Gels and
   Tissues Using Confocal Raman Spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Topical vaginal anti-HIV microbicides are an important focus in
   female-based strategies to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV.
   Understanding microbicide pharmacokinetics is essential to development,
   characterization and implementation of efficacious microbicide drug
   delivery formulations. Current methods to measure drug concentrations in
   tissue (e. g., LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass
   spectrometry) are highly sensitive, but destructive and complex. This
   project explored the use of confocal Raman spectroscopy to detect
   microbicide drugs and to measure their local concentrations in fluids,
   drug delivery gels, and tissues. We evaluated three candidate
   microbicide drugs: tenofovir, Dapivirine and IQP-0528. Measurements were
   performed in freshly excised porcine buccal tissue specimens, gel
   vehicles and fluids using two Horiba Raman microscopes, one of which is
   confocal. Characteristic spectral peak calibrations for each drug were
   obtained using serial dilutions in the three matrices. These specific
   Raman bands demonstrated strong linear concentration dependences in the
   matrices and were characterized with respect to their unique vibrational
   signatures. At least one specific Raman feature was identified for each
   drug as a marker band for detection in tissue. Sensitivity of detection
   was evaluated in the three matrices. A specific peak was also identified
   for tenofovir diphosphate, the anti-HIV bioactive product of tenofovir
   after phosphorylation in host cells. Z-scans of drug concentrations vs.
   depth in excised tissue specimens, incubated under layers of tenofovir
   solution in a Transwell assay, showed decreasing concentration with
   depth from the surface into the tissue. Time-dependent concentration
   profiles were obtained from tissue samples incubated in the Transwell
   assay, for times ranging 30 minutes - 6 hours. Calibrations and
   measurements from tissue permeation studies for tenofovir showed good
   correlation with gold standard LC-MS/MS data. These results demonstrate
   that confocal Raman spectroscopy holds promise as a tool for practical,
   minimally invasive, label-free measurement of microbicide drug
   concentrations in fluids, gels and tissues.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{8755-8768}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown the feasibility of estimating patient dose
   from a CT exam using CTDIvol-normalized-organ dose (denoted as h),
   DLP-normalized-effective dose (denoted as k), and DLP-normalized-risk
   index (denoted as q). However, previous studies were limited to a small
   number of phantom models. The purpose of this work was to provide dose
   coefficients (h, k, and q) across a large number of computational models
   covering a broad range of patient anatomy, age, size percentile, and
   gender. The study consisted of 100 patient computer models (age range, 0
   to 78 y.o.; weight range, 2-180 kg) including 42 pediatric models (age
   range, 0 to 16 y.o.; weight range, 2-80 kg) and 58 adult models (age
   range, 18 to 78 y.o.; weight range, 57-180 kg). Multidetector array CT
   scanners from two commercial manufacturers (LightSpeed VCT, GE
   Healthcare; SOMATOM Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare) were included.
   A previously-validated Monte Carlo program was used to simulate organ
   dose for each patient model and each scanner, from which h, k, and q
   were derived. The relationships between h, k, and q and patient
   characteristics (size, age, and gender) were ascertained. The
   differences in conversion coefficients across the scanners were further
   characterized. CTDIvol-normalized-organ dose (h) sho wed an exponential
   decrease with increasing patient size. For organs within the image
   coverage, the average differences of h across scanners were less than
   15\%. That value increased to 29\% for organs on the periphery or
   outside the image coverage, and to 8\% for distributed organs,
   respectively. The DLP-normalized-effective dose (k) decreased
   exponentially with increasing patient size. For a given gender, the
   DLP-normalized-risk index (q) showed an exponential decrease with both
   increasing patient size and patient age. The average differences in k
   and q across scanners were 8\% and 10\%, respectively. This study
   demonstrated that the knowledge of patient information and CTDIvol/DLP
   values may be used to estimate organ dose, effective dose, and risk
   index in abdominopelvic CT based on the coefficients derived from a
   large population of pediatric and adult patients.}},

Abstract = {{Microphysiological systems provide a tool to simulate normal and

   system. The engineered human skeletal muscle tissue reproduces key
   mechanical behaviors of skeletal muscle in vivo. Pulsatile flow is
   produced using a novel computer-controlled magnetically activated
   ferrogel. The system is versatile and the muscle unit can be integrated
   with other organ systems. Periodic monitoring of biomechanical function
   provides a non-invasive assessment of the health of the tissue and a way

   consistency from H to Ar}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{We present a series of numerically tabulated atom-centered orbital (NAO)
   basis sets with valence-correlation consistency (VCC), termed
   NAO-VCC-nZ. Here the index `nZ' refers to the number of basis functions
   used for the valence shell with n = 2, 3, 4, 5. These basis sets are
   constructed analogous to Dunning's cc-pVnZ, but utilize the more
   flexible shape of NAOs. Moreover, an additional group of (sp) basis
   functions, called enhanced minimal basis, is established in NAO-VCC-nZ,
   increasing the contribution of the s and p functions to achieve the
   valence-correlation consistency. NAO-VCC-nZ basis sets are generated by
   minimizing frozen-core random-phase approximation (RPA) total energies
   of individual atoms from H to Ar. We demonstrate that NAO-VCC-nZ basis
   sets are suitable for converging electronic total-energy calculations
   based on valence-only (frozen-core) correlation methods which contain
   explicit sums over unoccupied states (e.g. the RPA or second-order
   Moller-Plesset perturbation theory). The basis set incompleteness error,
   including the basis set superposition error, can be gradually reduced
   with the increase of the index `n', and can be removed using two-point
   extrapolation schemes.}},

Title = {{A Role for Myocilin in Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Myocilin is a broadly expressed protein that when mutated uniquely
   causes glaucoma. While no function has been ascribed to explain focal
   disease, some properties of myocilin are known. Myocilin is a
   cytoplasmic protein that also localizes to vesicles specifically as part
   of a large membrane-associated complex with properties similar to the
   SNARE machinery that function in vesicle fusion. Its role in vesicle
   dynamics has not been detailed, however myocilin intersects with the
   endocytic compartment at the level of the multivesicular body. Since
   internalized GPCRs are sorted in the multivesicular body, we
   investigated whether myocilin functions in ligand-dependent GPR143
   endocytosis. Using recombinant systems we found that the kinetics of
   myocilin recruitment to biotinylated membrane proteins was similar to
   that of arrestin-3. We also co-localized myocilin with GPR143 and
   Arrestin-2 by confocal microscopy. However, wild-type myocilin differed
   significantly in its association kinetics and co-localization with
   internalized proteins from mutant myocilin (P370L or T377M). Moreover,
   we found that myocilin bound to the cytoplasmic tail of GPR143, an
   interaction mediated by its amino terminal helix-turn-helix domain.
   Hydrodynamic analyses show that the myocilin-GPR143 protein complex is
   >158 kD and stable in 500 mM KCl, but not 0.1\% SDS. Collectively, data
   indicate that myocilin is recruited to the membrane compartment,
   interacting with GPCR proteins during ligand-mediated endocytosis and
   that GPCR signaling underlies pathology in myocilin glaucoma.}},

Abstract = {{Selenium (Se) in coal ash spills poses a threat to adjacent ecosystems
   because of its potential to mobilize and bioaccumulate in aquatic
   organisms. Given that the mobility and bioavailability of Se is
   controlled by its valence states, we aimed to define Se speciation in
   coal ash solids and examine the relationships between Se speciation and
   the magnitude of its mobilization from coal ash. We used coal ash
   samples from the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)-Kingston fossil plant
   and the site of a coal ash spill that occurred in 2008 in Tennessee.
   Results of X-ray absorption spectroscopic analyses showed that Se in
   coal ash samples was a mixture of elemental Se-0 and Se oxyanions. The
   amount of leachable Se increased with an increase of pH from 3 to 13. At
   the natural pH of coal ash samples (from pH 7.6 to 9.5), the leachable
   Se was comprised of Se oxyanions, mainly selenite. This was observed by
   both direct quantification of Se oxyanions in the leachate and the
   corresponding loss of Se oxyanions in the solid phase. At pH 12,
   however, the Se release appeared to derive from both desorption of Se
   oxyanions and oxidative dissolution of elemental Se-0. Our results
   indicate that Se oxyanions are the most labile species; however, the
   magnitude of Se mobilization will increase if the waste material is
   subjected to alkaline conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The development of synthetic biomaterials that possess mechanical

   millions of cycles of joint loading over decades of wear. Here, a
   three-dimensionally woven fiber scaffold that is infiltrated with an
   interpenetrating network hydrogel can build a functional biomaterial
   that provides the load-bearing and tribological properties of native
   cartilage. An interpenetrating dual-network tough-gel consisting of

Abstract = {{Background: Sensory neuron diversity ensures optimal detection of the
   external world and is a hallmark of sensory systems. An extreme example
   is the olfactory system, as individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs)
   adopt unique sensory identities by typically expressing a single
   receptor gene from a large genomic repertoire. In Drosophila, about 50
   different ORN classes are generated from a field of precursor cells,
   giving rise to spatially restricted and distinct clusters of ORNs on the
   olfactory appendages. Developmental strategies spawning ORN diversity
   from an initially homogeneous population of precursors are largely
   unknown.
   Results: Here we unravel the nested and binary logic of the
   combinatorial code that patterns the decision landscape of precursor
   states underlying ORN diversity in the Drosophila olfactory system. The
   transcription factor Rotund (Rn) is a critical component of this code
   that is expressed in a subset of ORN precursors. Addition of Rn to
   preexisting transcription factors that assign zonal identities to
   precursors on the antenna subdivides each zone and almost exponentially
   increases ORN diversity by branching off novel precursor fates from
   default ones within each zone. In m mutants, m-positive ORN classes are
   converted to m-negative ones in a zone-specific manner.
   Conclusions: We provide a model describing how nested and binary changes
   in combinations of transcription factors could coordinate and pattern a
   large number of distinct precursor identities within a population to
   modulate the level of ORN diversity during development and evolution.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{A rapid heuristic ratiometric analysis for estimating tissue hemoglobin
   concentration and oxygen saturation from measured tissue diffuse
   reflectance spectra is presented. The analysis was validated in
   tissue-mimicking phantoms and applied to clinical measurements in head
   and neck, cervical and breast tissues. The analysis works in two steps.
   First, a linear equation that translates the ratio of the diffuse
   reflectance at 584 nm and 545 nm to estimate the tissue hemoglobin
   concentration using a Monte Carlo-based lookup table was developed. This
   equation is independent of tissue scattering and oxygen saturation.
   Second, the oxygen saturation was estimated using non-linear logistic
   equations that translate the ratio of the diffuse reflectance spectra at
   539 nm to 545 nm into the tissue oxygen saturation. Correlations
   coefficients of 0.89 (0.86), 0.77 (0.71) and 0.69 (0.43) were obtained
   for the tissue hemoglobin concentration (oxygen saturation) values
   extracted using the full spectral Monte Carlo and the ratiometric
   analysis, for clinical measurements in head and neck, breast and
   cervical tissues, respectively. The ratiometric analysis was more than
   4000 times faster than the inverse Monte Carlo analysis for estimating
   tissue hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation in simulated
   phantom experiments. In addition, the discriminatory power of the two
   analyses was similar. These results show the potential of such empirical
   tools to rapidly estimate tissue hemoglobin in real-time spectral
   imaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last century, afforestation in Ireland has increased from 1\%
   of the land area to 10\%, with most plantations on upland drained
   blanket peatlands. This land use change is considered to have altered
   the hydrological response and water balance of upland catchments with
   implications for water resources. Because of the difficulty of observing
   these long-term changes in the field, the aim of this study was to
   utilize a hydrological model to simulate the rainfall runoff processes
   of an existing pristine blanket peatland and then to simulate the
   hydrology of the peatland if it were drained and afforested. The
   hydrological rainfall runoff model (GEOtop) was calibrated and validated
   for an existing small (76ha) pristine blanket peatland in the southwest
   of Ireland for the 2-year period, 2007-2008. The current hydrological
   response of the pristine blanket peatland catchment with regard to
   streamflow and water table (WT) levels was captured well in the
   simulations. Two land use change scenarios of afforestation were also
   examined, (A) a young 10-year-old and (B) a semi-mature 15-year-old
   Sitka Spruce forest. Scenario A produced similar streamflow dynamics to
   the pristine peatland, whereas total annual streamflow from Scenario B
   was 20\% lower. For Scenarios A and B, on an annual average basis, the
   WT was drawn down by 16 and 20cm below that observed in the pristine
   peatland, respectively. The maximum WT draw down in Scenario B was 61cm
   and occurred in the summer months, resulting in a significant decrease
   in summer streamflow. Occasionally in the winter (following rainfall),
   the WT for Scenario B was just 2cm lower than the pristine peatland,
   which when coupled with the drainage networks associated with
   afforestation led to higher peak streamflows. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Abstract = {{To describe stomatal response to micro-environmental variations,
   optimization theories for canopy gas exchange are often used as
   alternatives to empirical or mechanistic but complex models of stomata!
   function. Solutions for optimal stomatal conductance have been proposed
   assuming leaf photosynthesis is limited by either Rubisco activity (and
   hence by CO2 at the photosynthetic site) or ribulose-1,5-biphosphate
   (RuBP) regeneration rate (and hence light availability). These
   contrasting assumptions result in different relations between the
   marginal water use efficiency lambda (the key optimization parameter)
   and atmospheric CO2 concentration (c(a)). Contrasting predictions of
   stomatal responses to elevated c(a) ensue, begging the question as to
   which approach is most suitable. Here, it is proposed that stomatal
   aperture is optimized for shifting limitations, motivating the
   development of a framework where Rubisco activity and electron transport
   co-limit photosynthesis. This approach attempts to reconcile the two
   previously proposed optimality solutions. Based on a minimalist model of
   photosynthesis that accounts for both limitations, optimal stomatal
   conductance is derived as a function of photosynthetic parameters,
   lambda, and leaf micro-environmental conditions. The optimal stomatal
   conductances resulting from the different formulations of photosynthesis
   and functional dependencies of lambda on c(a) are compared for varying
   environmental conditions, with reference to often observed patterns and
   scaling relationships. The results suggest that short-term (e.g.,
   sub-daily) fluctuations in c(a) trigger small adjustments in stomatal
   aperture at a constant lambda, while long-term (e.g., growing season or
   longer) elevated c(a), may elicit acclimation mechanisms, potentially
   resulting in changes in lambda. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The presence and continued existence of tidal morphologies, and in
   particular of salt marshes, is intimately connected with biological
   activity, especially with the presence of halophytic vegetation. Here,
   we review recent contributions to tidal biogeomorphology and identify
   the presence of multiple competing stable states arising from a two-way
   feedback between biomass productivity and topographic elevation. Hence,
   through the analysis of previous and new results on spatially extended
   biogeomorphological systems, we show that multiple stable states
   constitute a unifying framework explaining emerging patterns in tidal
   environments from the local to the system scale. Furthermore, in
   contrast with traditional views we propose that biota in tidal
   environments is not just passively adapting to morphological features
   prescribed by sediment transport, but rather it is `The Secret
   Gardener', fundamentally constructing the tidal landscape. The proposed
   framework allows to identify the observable signature of the
   biogeomorphic feedbacks underlying tidal landscapes and to explore the
   response and resilience of tidal biogeomorphic patterns to variations in
   the forcings, such as the rate of relative sealevel rise.}},

Title = {{Measuring Dilution of Microbicide Gels with Optical Imaging}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{We present a novel approach for measuring topical microbicide gel
   dilution using optical imaging. The approach compares gel thickness
   measurements from fluorimetry and multiplexed low coherence
   interferometry in order to calculate dilution of a gel. As a microbicide
   gel becomes diluted at fixed thickness, its mLCI thickness measurement
   remains constant, while the fluorimetry signal decreases in intensity.
   The difference between the two measurements is related to the extent of
   gel dilution. These two optical modalities are implemented in a single
   endoscopic instrument that enables simultaneous data collection. A
   preliminary validation study was performed with in vitro placebo gel
   measurements taken in a controlled test socket. It was found that change
   in slope of the regression line between fluorimetry and mLCI based
   measurements indicates dilution. A dilution calibration curve was then
   generated by repeating the test socket measurements with serial
   dilutions of placebo gel with vaginal fluid simulant. This methodology
   can provide valuable dilution information on candidate microbicide
   products, which could substantially enhance our understanding of their
   in vivo functioning.}},

Title = {{Rapid formation of multicellular spheroids in double-emulsion droplets
   with controllable microenvironment}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{An attractive option for tissue engineering is to use of multicellular
   spheroids as microtissues, particularly with stem cell spheroids.
   Conventional approaches of fabricating spheroids suffer from low
   throughput and polydispersity in size, and fail to supplement cues from
   extracellular matrix (ECM) for enhanced differentiation. In this study,
   we report the application of microfluidics-generated
   water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) double-emulsion (DE) droplets as
   pico-liter sized bioreactor for rapid cell assembly and well-controlled
   microenvironment for spheroid culture. Cells aggregated to form
   size-controllable (30-80 mu m) spheroids in DE droplets within 150 min
   and could be retrieved via a droplet-releasing agent. Moreover,
   precursor hydrogel solution can be adopted as the inner phase to produce
   spheroid-encapsulated microgels after spheroid formation. As an example,
   the encapsulation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) spheroids in
   alginate and alginate-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (-RGD) microgel was
   demonstrated, with enhanced osteogenic differentiation further exhibited
   in the latter case.}},

Title = {{Prospects for flash flood forecasting in mountainous regions - An
   investigation of Tropical Storm Fay in the Southern Appalachians}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{506}},
Pages = {{69-89}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of Quantitative flash-Flood Estimates (QFEs) and
   Quantitative flash-Flood Forecasts (QFFs) to Quantitative Precipitation
   Estimates (QPEs) and Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (QPFs) was
   investigated in three headwater catchments with different topographic
   and hydro-geomorphic characteristics during the passage of Tropical
   Storm Fay, 2008 over the Southern Appalachian Mountains in North
   Carolina, USA. QFEs and QFFs were generated by a high-resolution
   hydrologic model (250 x 250 m(2)) with coupled surface-subsurface
   physics and rainfall forcing from the Next Generation Multi-sensor QPE
   (Q2) spatial rainfall (1 x 1 km(2)) product, and from National Digital
   Forecast Database (NDFD) operational QPF product (5 x 5 km(2)). Optimal
   QPE products (Q2+) were derived by assimilating rainfall observations
   from a high density raingauge network through adaptive bias correction.
   Deterministic QFEs simulated by the hydrologic model agree well with
   streamgauge observations (15-min intervals) regarding total water volume
   and peak flow with Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficients 0.8-0.9, thus
   suggesting that the model without calibration captures well the dominant
   flash-flood physics. The propagation of uncertainty in storm rainfall to
   rainfall-runoff response was subsequently evaluated through model
   simulations forced by Monte Carlo replications of the QPEs to generate
   QFE distributions. Analysis of the joint QPE-QFE distributions shows
   that flood response at the catchment scale is highly non-linear, and
   exhibits strong dependence on basin physiography, initial soil moisture
   conditions (transient basin storage capacity), the space-time
   organization of runoff generation and conveyance mechanisms, and in
   particular inter-flow dynamics, with respect to the space-time structure
   of rainfall. QFFs for 6- to 1-h lead times using precipitation
   composites of Q2 QPE and NDFD QPF to drive the hydrology model in
   operational mode exhibited ubiquitous lack of skill yielding
   consistently negative NS scores. An experiment consisting of merging
   satellite-like observations into operational QPE/QPF showed significant
   improvement in QFF performance (e.g. 5-50\% relative NS increases),
   especially when the timing of satellite overpass is such that it
   captures transient episodes of heavy rainfall during the event. Future
   advances in QFF remain principally constrained by progress in QPE and
   QPF at the spatial resolution necessary to resolve rainfall-interflow
   dynamics in mountainous regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials are highly dynamic in biological and environmental media.
   A critical need for advancing environmental health and safety research
   for nanomaterials is to identify physical and chemical transformations
   that affect the nanomaterial properties and their toxicity. Silver
   nanoparticles, one of the most toxic and well-studied nanomaterials,
   readily react with sulfide to form Ag(0)/Ag2S core-shell particles.
   Here, we show that sulfidation decreased silver nanoparticle toxicity to
   four diverse types of aquatic and terrestrial eukaryotic organisms
   (Danio rerio (zebrafish), Fundulus heteroclitus (killifish),
   Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm), and the aquatic plant Lemna
   minuta (least duckweed)). Toxicity reduction, which was dramatic in
   killifish and duckweed even for low extents of sulfidation (about 2 mol
   \% S), is primarily associated with a decrease in Ag+ concentration
   after sulfidation due to the lower solubility of Ag2S relative to
   elemental Ag (Ag-0). These results suggest that even partial sulfidation
   of AgNP will decrease the toxicity of AgNPs relative to their pristine
   counterparts. We also show that, for a given organism, the presence of
   chloride in the exposure media strongly affects the toxicity results by
   affecting Ag speciation. These results highlight the need to consider
   environmental transformations of NPs in assessing their toxicity to
   accurately portray their potential environmental risks.}},

Abstract = {{A partial control surface is constructed near the midspan of a NACA 0012
   airfoil model with and without freeplay gaps. Static and dynamic control
   surface pitch motion measurements were performed in wind-tunnel tests at
   higher angles of attack including buffet or von Karman vortex street
   flows. Two typical angles of attack, alpha = 20 and 40 deg, and four
   freplay gaps in the pitch stiffness, delta = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0
   deg, are considered in the tests. This study has measured the static and
   dynamic responses of the flap pitch motion (with and without freeplay
   gaps) induced by the buffeting flow. Also, the buffeting frequency has
   been determined from the measured flap pitch responses. The buffet flow
   occurs at large angles of attack, and this leads to a larger preload
   from the aerodynamic forces and a larger static pitch equilibrium
   position. In this case, there is no limit cycle oscillations of the flap
   pitch motion induced by the freeplay gap to be found. Because the flap
   pitch motions are around the upper boundary of the freeplay gap, the
   dynamic pitch response has only a small change with different freeplay
   gaps. Buffeting flow excitation leads to a large dynamic response when
   the buffeting frequency is close to the flap natural frequency.}},

Title = {{Quantifying melanin spatial distribution using pump-probe microscopy and

   diagnosis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Pump-probe microscopy is an emerging molecular imaging technique that
   probes the excited state dynamics properties of pigmented samples. This
   method has been particularly intriguing for melanoma because, unlike
   other methods available, it can provide nondestructive, quantitative
   chemical information regarding different types of melanins, with high
   spatial resolution. In this Letter, we present a method based on
   mathematical morphology to quantify melanin structure (eumelanin,
   pheomelanin, and total melanin content, uniquely available with
   pumpprobe microscopy) to aid in melanoma diagnosis. The approach applies
   a two-dimensional autocorrelation function and utilizes statistical
   parameters of the corresponding autocorrelation images, specifically,
   the second moments and entropy, to parameterize image structure. Along
   with bulk melanin chemical information, we show that this method can
   differentiate invasive melanomas from noninvasive and benign lesions
   with high sensitivity and specificity (92.3\% and 97.5\%, respectively,
   with N = 53). The mathematical method and the statistical analysis are
   described in detail and results from cutaneous and ocular conjunctival
   melanocytic lesions are presented. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE

Title = {{Controlling Stimulation Strength and Focality in Electroconvulsive
   Therapy via Current Amplitude and Electrode Size and Spacing: Comparison
   With Magnetic Seizure Therapy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{321-331}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Understanding the relationship between the stimulus parameters of
   electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and the electric field characteristics
   could guide studies on improving risk/benefit ratio. We aimed to
   determine the effect of current amplitude and electrode size and spacing
   on the ECT electric field characteristics, compare ECT focality with
   magnetic seizure therapy (MST), and evaluate stimulus individualization
   by current amplitude adjustment.
   Methods
   Electroconvulsive therapy and double-cone-coil MST electric field was
   simulated in a 5-shell spherical human head model. A range of ECT
   electrode diameters (2-5 cm), spacing (1-25 cm), and current amplitudes
   (0-900 mA) was explored. The head model parameters were varied to
   examine the stimulus current adjustment required to compensate for
   interindividual anatomical differences.
   Results
   By reducing the electrode size, spacing, and current, the ECT electric
   field can be more focal and superficial without increasing scalp current
   density. By appropriately adjusting the electrode configuration and
   current, the ECT electric field characteristics can be made to
   approximate those of MST within 15\%. Most electric field
   characteristics in ECT are more sensitive to head anatomy variation than
   in MST, especially for close electrode spacing. Nevertheless, ECT
   current amplitude adjustment of less than 70\% can compensate for
   interindividual anatomical variability.
   Conclusions
   The strength and focality of ECT can be varied over a wide range by
   adjusting the electrode size, spacing, and current. If desirable, ECT
   can be made as focal as MST while using simpler stimulation equipment.
   Current amplitude individualization can compensate for interindividual
   anatomical variability.}},

   boundary. We propose a variational treatment of both the interfacial
   kinematics and the external Dirichlet constraints within Nitsche's
   framework. We modify the numerical analysis to account for these
   intersections and provide an explicit expression for the weights and the
   method parameters that arise in the Nitsche variational form in the
   presence of junctions. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the
   method for both perfectly-tied interfaces and perfectly-plastic sliding
   interfaces through several benchmark examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   density function on a 1-D line. Then, PDR on a 1-D line is derived from

Abstract = {{DC (direct current) electrical and shallow seismic methods are
   indispensable to the near surface geophysical exploration, but the near
   surface areas are very difficult environments for any geophysical
   exploration due to the random noise caused by near surface
   inhomogeneities. As a new algorithm based on higher-order statistics
   theory, the higher-order correlation stacking algorithm for seismic data
   smoothing in the wavelet domain has been developed and applied
   efficiently to filter some correlation noise that the conventional
   second-order correlation stacking could not inhibit. In this paper, this
   higher-order statistics correlation stacking technology is presented for
   DC electrical data in wavelet domain. Taking into account the single
   section and multiple section data, we present two new formulations of
   correlation stacking for DC electrical data. Synthetic examples with
   Gaussian noise are designed to analyze the overall efficiency of the new
   algorithm and to determine its efficacy. Meanwhile, comparison with the
   traditional least-squares optimization inversion method for field
   examples from electrical imaging surveys and time-domain IP measurement
   in China shows its significant advantages. The quality of the new
   algorithm also has been assessed by physical simulation experiments.
   This new technology in DC electrical exploration measurements provides a
   new application in engineering and mining investigation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Objective: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease
   characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage. While
   macroscale degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) has
   been extensively studied, microscale changes in the chondrocyte
   pericellular matrix (PCM) and immediate microenvironment with OA are not
   fully understood. The objective of this study was to quantify
   ostearthritic changes in the micromechanical properties of the ECM and
   PCM of human articular cartilage in situ using atomic force microscopy
   (AFM).
   Method: AFM elastic mapping was performed on cryosections of human
   cartilage harvested from both condyles of macroscopically normal and
   osteoarthritic knee joints. This method was used to test the hypotheses
   that both ECM and PCM regions exhibit a loss of mechanical properties
   with OA and that the size of the PCM is enlarged in OA cartilage as
   compared to normal tissue.
   Results: Significant decreases were observed in both ECM and PCM moduli
   of 45\% and 30\%, respectively, on the medial condyle of OA knee joints
   as compared to cartilage from macroscopically normal joints. Enlargement
   of the PCM, as measured biomechanically, was also observed in medial
   condyle OA cartilage, reflecting the underlying distribution of type VI
   collagen in the region. No significant differences were observed in
   elastic moduli or their spatial distribution on the lateral condyle
   between normal and OA joints.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence of significant
   site-specific degenerative changes in the chondrocyte micromechanical
   environment with OA. (C) 2013 Osteoarthritis Research Society

Title = {{An efficient matrix bi-factorization alternative optimization method for
   low-rank matrix recovery and completion}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, matrix rank minimization problems have aroused
   considerable interests from machine learning, data mining and computer
   vision communities. All of these problems can be solved via their convex
   relaxations which minimize the trace norm instead of the rank of the
   matrix, and have to be solved iteratively and involve singular value
   decomposition (SVD) at each iteration. Therefore, those algorithms for
   trace norm minimization problems suffer from high computation cost of
   multiple SVDs. In this paper, we propose an efficient Matrix
   Bi-Factorization (MBF) method to approximate the original trace norm
   minimization problem and mitigate the computation cost of performing
   SVDs. The proposed MBE method can be used to address a wide range of
   low-rank matrix recovery and completion problems such as low-rank and
   sparse matrix decomposition (LRSD), low-rank representation (LRR) and
   low-rank matrix completion (MC). We also present three small scale
   matrix trace norm models for LRSD, LRR and MC problems, respectively.
   Moreover, we develop two concrete linearized proximal alternative
   optimization algorithms for solving the above three problems.
   Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets
   validate the efficiency, robustness and effectiveness of our MBF method
   comparing with the state-of-the-art trace norm minimization algorithms.

Abstract = {{Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are currently utilized in the treatment
   of blood diseases, but widespread application of HSC therapeutics has
   been hindered by the limited availability of HSCs. With a better
   understanding of the HSC microenvironment and the ability to precisely
   recapitulate its components, we may be able to gain control of HSC
   behavior. In this work we developed a novel, biomimetic PEG hydrogel
   material as a substrate for this purpose and tested its potential with
   an anchorage-independent hematopoietic cell line, 32D clone 3 cells. We
   immobilized a fibronectin-derived adhesive peptide sequence, RGDS; a
   cytokine critical in HSC self-renewal, stem cell factor (SCF); and a
   chemokine important in HSC homing and lodging, stromal derived factor l
   alpha (SDF1 alpha), onto the surfaces of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
   hydrogels. To evaluate the system's capabilities, we observed the
   effects of the biomolecules on 32D cell adhesion and morphology. We
   demonstrated that the incorporation of RGDS onto the surfaces promotes
   32D cell adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion. We also observed an
   additive response in adhesion on surfaces with RGDS in combination with
   either SCF or SDFl alpha. In addition, the average cell area increased
   and circularity decreased on gel surfaces containing immobilized SCF or
   SDFl alpha, indicating enhanced cell spreading. By recapitulating
   aspects of the HSC microenvironment using a PEG hydrogel scaffold, we
   have shown the ability to control the adhesion and spreading of the 32D
   cells and demonstrated the potential of the system for the culture of
   primary hematopoietic cell populations. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{We have implemented multispectral multiple scattering low coherence
   interferometry (ms2/LCI) with Fourier domain data collection. The
   ms2/LCI system is designed to localize features with spectroscopic
   contrast with millimeter resolution up to 1 cm deep in scattering
   samples by using photons that have undergone multiple low-angle
   (forward) scattering events. Fourier domain detection both increases the
   data acquisition speed of the system and gives access to rich
   spectroscopic information, compared to the previous single channel,
   time-domain implementation. Separate delivery and detection angular
   apertures reduce collection of the diffuse background signal in order to
   isolate localized spectral features from deeper in scattering samples
   than would be possible with traditional spectroscopic optical coherence
   tomography. Light from a supercontinuum source is used to acquire
   absorption spectra of chromophores in the visible range within a
   tissue-like scattering phantom. An intensity modulation and digital lock
   in detection scheme is implemented to mitigate relative intensity and
   spectral noise inherent in supercontinuum sources. The technical
   parameters of the system and comparative analysis are presented. (C)

Abstract = {{Background Electrophysiological mismatch between host cardiomyocytes and
   donor cells can directly affect the electrical safety of cardiac cell
   therapies; however, the ability to study host-donor interactions at the
   microscopic scale in situ is severely limited. We systematically
   explored how action potential (AP) differences between cardiomyocytes
   and other excitable cells modulate vulnerability to conduction failure
   in vitro.
   Methods and Results AP propagation was optically mapped at 75 m
   resolution in micropatterned strands (n=152) in which host neonatal rat
   ventricular myocytes (AP duration=153.22.3 ms, conduction velocity=22.3
   +/- 0.3 cm/s) seamlessly interfaced with genetically engineered
   excitable donor cells expressing inward rectifier potassium (Kir2.1) and
   cardiac sodium (Na(v)1.5) channels with either weak (conduction
   velocity=3.1 +/- 0.1 cm/s) or strong (conduction velocity=22.1 +/- 0.4
   cm/s) electrical coupling. Selective prolongation of engineered donor
   cell AP duration (31.9-139.1 ms) by low-dose BaCl2 generated a wide
   range of host-donor repolarization time (RT) profiles with maximum
   gradients (delta RTmax) of 5.5 to 257 ms/mm. During programmed
   stimulation of donor cells, the vulnerable time window for conduction
   block across the host-donor interface most strongly correlated with
   delta RTmax. Compared with well-coupled donor cells, the interface
   composed of poorly coupled cells significantly shortened the RT profile
   width by 19.7\% and increased delta RTmax and vulnerable time window by
   22.2\% and 19\%, respectively. Flattening the RT profile by perfusion of
   50 mol/L BaCl2 eliminated coupling-induced differences in vulnerability
   to block.
   Conclusions Our results quantify how the degree of electrical mismatch
   across a cardiomyocyte-donor cell interface affects vulnerability to
   conduction block, with important implications for the design of safe
   cardiac cell and gene therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-reflection (AR) coatings designed for glass and other rigid,
   inorganic substrates are commercially available; however, these
   inorganic AR coatings tend to crack or delaminate on flexible
   substrates. A polymeric film with a gradient refractive index (GRIN)
   profile would make an ideal AR coating for flexible substrates, but such
   coatings are challenging to fabricate using traditional, solution-based
   techniques. Emulsion-based resonant infrared, matrix-assisted pulsed
   laser evaporation (RIR-MAPLE) offers a straightforward approach to
   enabling the desired GRIN profile in polymeric materials. Two
   homopolymers (polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) are
   deposited as a blend and one component (PMMA) is dissolved, leaving
   behind a porous PS film. The porosity and refractive index (RI) are
   controlled by the volume ratio of the two homopolymers in the film.
   Structural and optical characterizations, as well as comparison to
   modeled optical properties, confirm that porous films fabricated from
   polymer blends deposited by RIR-MAPLE behave as effective media over
   most of the visible spectrum. While evidence for the partial collapse of
   the porous polymer networks is observed, the RI of the porous films is
   reduced from that of the bulk material. Importantly, these studies
   demonstrate that RIR-MAPLE should enable broadband, omnidirectional,
   polymeric AR coatings appropriate for flexible substrates.}},

Abstract = {{A metallic nanoparticle positioned over a metal film offers great
   advantages as a highly controllable system relevant for probing
   field-enhancement and other plasmonic effects. Because the size and
   shape of the gap between the nanoparticle and film can be controlled to
   subnanometer precision using relatively simple, bottom-up fabrication
   approaches, the film-coupled nanoparticle geometry has recently been
   applied to enhancing optical fields, accessing the quantum regime of
   plasmonics, and the design of surfaces with controlled reflectance. In
   the present work, we examine the plasmon modes associated with a silver
   nanocube positioned above a silver or gold film, separated by an
   organic, dielectric spacer layer. The film-coupled nanocube is of
   particular interest due to the formation of waveguide cavity-like modes
   between the nanocube and film. These modes impart distinctive scattering
   characteristics to the system that can be used in the creation of
   controlled reflectance surfaces and other applications. We perform both
   experimental spectroscopy and numerical simulations of individual
   nanocubes positioned over a metal film, finding excellent agreement
   between experiment and simulation. The waveguide mode description serves
   as a starting point to explain the optical properties observed.}},

Abstract = {{Full-thickness rotator cuff tears are one of the most common causes of
   shoulder pain in people over the age of 65. High retear rates and poor
   functional outcomes are common after surgical repair, and currently
   available extracellular matrix scaffold patches have limited abilities
   to enhance new tendon formation. In this regard, tissue-engineered
   scaffolds may provide a means to improve repair of rotator cuff tears.
   Electrospinning provides a versatile method for creating nanofibrous
   scaffolds with controlled architectures, but several challenges remain
   in its application to tissue engineering, such as cell infiltration
   through the full thickness of the scaffold as well as control of cell
   growth and differentiation. Previous studies have shown that
   ligament-derived extracellular matrix may enhance differentiation toward
   a tendon or ligament phenotype by human adipose stem cells (hASCs). In
   this study, we investigated the use of tendon-derived extracellular
   matrix (TDM)-coated electrospun multilayered scaffolds compared to
   fibronectin (FN) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) coating for use in
   rotator cuff tendon tissue engineering. Multilayered poly(-caprolactone)
   scaffolds were prepared by sequentially collecting electrospun layers
   onto the surface of a grounded saline solution into a single scaffold.
   Scaffolds were then coated with TDM, FN, or PBS and seeded with hASCs.
   Scaffolds were maintained without exogenous growth factors for 28 days
   in culture and evaluated for protein content (by immunofluorescence and
   biochemical assay), markers of tendon differentiation, and tensile
   mechanical properties. The collagen content was greatest by day 28 in
   TDM-scaffolds. Gene expression of type I collagen, decorin, and tenascin
   C increased over time, with no effect of scaffold coating. Sulfated
   glycosaminoglycan and dsDNA contents increased over time in culture, but
   there was no effect of scaffold coating. The Young's modulus did not
   change over time, but yield strain increased with time in culture.
   Histology demonstrated cell infiltration through the full thickness of
   all scaffolds and immunofluorescence demonstrated greater expression of
   type I, but not type III collagen through the full thickness of the

   grids. The adaptive algorithm is tested using an existing simulation

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the opportunity to maximize the production of

   The interface consists of four heat exchangers, superheaters and
   reheaters, in parallel flow and counter flow. The search for better
   configurations is based on constructal design, and consists of searching
   for the distribution of heat exchanger surface (number of heat
   exchangers, types, sizes) such that the total power output of the
   turbines is maximum, subject to fixed total size for the heat transfer
   surface, and fixed maximum allowable steam heat exchanger wall
   temperature. The emergence of the more effective configurations is
   documented along with the migration of the spot of maximum temperature

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{365-370}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is a strong need for effective and sustainable treatment methods
   for remediating soils and waters contaminated by fossil fuel pollutants
   such as aromatic hydrocarbons. Remediation could be improved by genetic
   bioaugmentation that uses conjugation of catabolic plasmids between
   bacteria. Research on the conditions for success, effectiveness, and
   long-term impact of genetic bioaugmentation are therefore necessary.
   Here the effects of genetic bioaugmentation with Pseudomonas putida BBC
   443 was studied in continuous-flow soil columns with or without glucose
   amendment. Results show that the highest transconjugant occurrence of
   21.7 +/- A 2.1 \%, and development of microbial communities with the
   highest overall toluene degradation potential of 0.0790 +/- A 0.0055 mg
   toluene/g soil/h, were achieved in soil columns that received a
   continuous addition of 1 g/L glucose. Plasmid transfer and toluene
   biodegradation did not depend on the survival of donor P. putida BBC443,
   suggesting that genetic bioaugmentation was successful. Furthermore,
   bacterial community structure analysis revealed that genetic
   bioaugmentation had limited long-term impact on the soil bacterial
   community structures, regardless of the specific treatment. Our findings
   show that genetic bioaugmentation was successful and resulted in limited
   long-term ecological impact, thus demonstrating that genetic
   bioaugmentation can provide an effective and sustainable method for in
   situ bioremediation.}},

   dictionary in the limited memory available in the FPGA, we utilize and
   adapt two data compaction techniques from the literature. We use four

   methods, the proposed dictionary-based error-recovery method has low
   response time, and requires a simple experimental setup, and only a

Abstract = {{The ability to predict the geotechnical properties of subsurface soils
   using non-invasive geophysical measurements can be undeniably useful to
   the geotechnical engineer. Using laboratory data, we assess the
   potential of artificial neural networks to investigate the relations
   between geotechnical and electrical parameters characterizing a variety
   of soils. The geotechnical parameters are: fines content, mean grain
   size, mean pore size and the specific surface area. The electrical
   parameters obtained from low-frequency electrical measurements (4 Hz)
   include the resistivity amplitude, phase shift and the loss tangent.
   Relations that can be used to predict the geotechnical parameters of a
   soil given its electrical parameters are developed. The predictive
   capabilities of the neural networks are compared with traditional
   multivariate regression models. The performances of the neural network
   and regression models in predicting (a) the geotechnical parameter given
   the same electrical parameters as inputs and (b) the electrical
   parameters given the same geotechnical parameters as inputs are
   compared. In both cases, the neural network outperforms the multivariate
   regression as the neural network is able to capture and model the
   non-linear and complex relationships among the variables. The relative
   importance of the geotechnical parameters on the overall electrical
   conduction was examined using the neural networks. The results indicate
   that mean grain size and fines content are the two geotechnical
   parameters that influence phase-shift values the most; fines content and
   mean pore size influence the resistivity amplitude the most, whilst
   fines content and mean grain size influence the loss tangent the most.
   It was observed that of the four geotechnical parameters, the mean grain
   size influences the measured resistivity values the least.}},

Title = {{Optimization of stomatal conductance for maximum carbon gain under
   dynamic soil moisture}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{90-105}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Optimization theories explain a variety of forms and functions in
   plants. At the leaf scale, it is often hypothesized that carbon gain is
   maximized, thus providing a quantifiable objective for a mathematical
   definition of optimality conditions. Eco-physiological trade-offs and
   limited resource availability introduce natural bounds to this
   optimization process. In particular, carbon uptake from the atmosphere
   is inherently linked to water losses from the soil as water is taken up
   by roots and evaporated. Hence, water availability in soils constrains
   the amount of carbon that can be taken up and assimilated into new
   biomass. The problem of maximizing photosynthesis at a given water
   availability by modifying stomatal conductance, the plant-controlled
   variable to be optimized, has been traditionally formulated for short
   time intervals over which soil moisture changes can be neglected. This
   simplification led to a mathematically open solution, where the
   undefined Lagrange multiplier of the optimization (equivalent to the
   marginal water use efficiency, lambda) is then heuristically determined
   via data fitting. Here, a set of models based on different assumptions
   that account for soil moisture dynamics over an individual dry-down are
   proposed so as to provide closed analytical expressions for the carbon
   gain maximization problem. These novel solutions link the observed
   variability in lambda over time, across soil moisture changes, and at
   different atmospheric CO2 concentrations to water use strategies ranging
   from intensive, in which all soil water is consumed by the end of the
   dry-down period, to more conservative, in which water stress is avoided
   by reducing transpiration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The emission of greenhouse gasses (GHG) from soils is controlled by
   biogeochemical reactions and the physical constraints on gas diffusion
   to the soil surface. Here we present and discuss a mathematical model
   that couples oxygen and soil water dynamics to biochemical reactions and
   gas transport to explore the major drivers of trace gas emission at
   daily time scale in unsaturated soils. The model accounts for trace gas
   emissions (CO2, and N2O from nitrification and denitrification), as well
   as for the competition for nitrate by denitrification and dissimilatory
   reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA). Our results indicate that
   explicit modeling of oxygen dynamics is important when re-aeration is
   limited, such as under wet conditions, in particular for fine-textured
   soils. The balance of labile substrate, oxygen, and water availabilities
   explain the observed peaks in GHG emissions at moisture values around
   the soil field capacity. The timing of these peaks during a dry-down is
   delayed in fine-textured soils, due to the slower drying and limited gas
   exchange rates. In addition, N2O emissions may be limited by DNRA at
   high soil moisture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The role of coherent turbulent structures in explaining scalar
   dissimilarity within the canopy sublayer}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{571-599}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Scalar similarity is widely assumed in models and interpretation of
   micro-meteorological measurements. However, in the air space within and
   just above the canopy (the so-called canopy sublayer, CSL) scalar
   similarity is generally violated. The scalar dissimilarity has been
   mainly attributed to differences in the distribution of sources and
   sinks throughout the canopy. Since large-scale coherent structures in
   the CSL (e.g. double roller and sweep/ejection) arise from the
   instabilities generated by the interaction between the mean flow and the
   canopy, they may encode key dynamical features about the production term
   responsible for the source-sink dissimilarity of scalars. Therefore, it
   is reasonable to assume that the geometric attributes of coherent
   structures are tightly coupled to the onset and the vertical extent of
   scalar dissimilarity within the CSL. Large-eddy simulation (LES) runs
   were used to investigate the role of coherent structures in explaining
   scalar dissimilarity among three scalars (potential air temperature,
   water vapour and concentration) within the CSL under near-neutral
   conditions for horizontally uniform but vertically varying vegetation
   leaf area density. It was shown that coherent structures, when
   identified from the first mode of a novel proper orthogonal
   decomposition (POD) approach, were able to capture some features of the
   scalar dissimilarity in the original LES field. This skill was
   quantified by calculating scalar-scalar correlation coefficients and
   turbulent Schmidt numbers of the original field and the coherent
   structures, respectively. However, coherent structures tend to magnify
   the magnitude of scalar-scalar correlation, particularly in cases where
   this correlation is already strong. The ability of coherent structures
   to describe more complex features such as the scalar sweep-ejection
   cycle was also explored. It was shown that the first mode of the POD
   does not capture the relative importance of sweeps to ejections in the
   original LES field. However, the superposition of few secondary coherent
   structures, derived from higher order POD modes, largely diminish the
   discrepancies between the original field and the POD expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Disruption of the regulatory role of the kidneys leads to diverse renal
   pathologies; one major hallmark is inflammation and fibrosis.
   Conventional magnitude MRI has been used to study renal pathologies;
   however, the quantification or even detection of focal lesions caused by
   inflammation and fibrosis is challenging. We propose that quantitative
   susceptibility mapping (QSM) may be particularly sensitive for the
   identification of inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, we applied
   QSM in a mouse model deficient for angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT(1)).
   This model is known for graded pathologies, including focal interstitial
   fibrosis, cortical inflammation, glomerulocysts and inner medullary
   hypoplasia. We acquired high-resolution MRI on kidneys from
   AT(1)-deficient mice that were perfusion fixed with contrast agent. Two
   MR sequences were used (three-dimensional spin echo and gradient echo)
   to produce three image contrasts: T-1, T-2{*} (magnitude) and QSM. T-1
   and T-2{*} (magnitude) images were acquired to segment major renal
   structures and to provide landmarks for the focal lesions of
   inflammation and fibrosis in the three-dimensional space. The volumes of
   major renal structures were measured to determine the relationship of
   the volumes to the degree of renal abnormalities and magnetic
   susceptibility values. Focal lesions were segmented from QSM images and
   were found to be closely associated with the major vessels.
   Susceptibilities were relatively more paramagnetic in wild-type mice:
   1.46 +/- 0.36 in the cortex, 2.14 +/- 0.94 in the outer medulla and 2.10
   +/- 2.80 in the inner medulla (10(-2)ppm). Susceptibilities were more
   diamagnetic in knockout mice: -7.68 +/- 4.22 in the cortex, -11.46 +/-
   2.13 in the outer medulla and -7.57 +/- 5.58 in the inner medulla
   (10(-2)ppm). This result was consistent with the increase in diamagnetic
   content, e.g. proteins and lipids, associated with inflammation and
   fibrosis. Focal lesions were validated with conventional histology. QSM
   was very sensitive in detecting pathology caused by small focal
   inflammation and fibrosis. QSM offers a new MR contrast mechanism to
   study this common disease marker in the kidney. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Abstract = {{PurposeWe sought to further localize radioiodine activity in the mouth
   on post-thyroid cancer therapy imaging using single-photon emission
   computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT).Materials and
   methodsWe retrospectively reviewed all patients (58) who underwent
   thyroid cancer therapy with iodine-131 (I-131) at our institution from
   August 2009 to March 2011 whose post-therapy radioiodine imaging
   included neck SPECT/CT. A small group (six) of diagnostic I-123 scans
   including SPECT/CT was also reviewed. Separately, we performed in-vitro
   I-131 (sodium iodide) binding assays with amalgam and Argenco HP 77
   (77\% dental gold alloy) as proof of principle for these
   interactions.ResultsOf the 58 post-therapy patients, 45 (78\%) had
   undergone metallic dental restorations, and of them 41 (91\%)
   demonstrated oral I-131 activity localizing preferentially to those
   restorations. It was observed that radioiodine also localized to other
   dental restorations and to orthodontic hardware. Gum-line activity in
   edentulous patients suggests radioiodine interaction with denture
   adhesive.In vitro, dental amalgam and Argenco HP 77 bound I-131 in a
   time-dependent manner over 1-16 days of exposure. Despite subsequent
   washings with normal saline, significant I-131 activity (maximally 12\%
   for amalgam and 68\% for Argenco HP 77) was retained by these metals.
   Subsequent soaking in a saturated solution of potassium iodide partially
   displaced I-131 from amalgam, with near-total displacement of I-131 from
   Argenco HP 77.ConclusionSPECT/CT shows that radioiodine in the oral
   cavity localizes to metallic dental restorations. Furthermore, in-vitro
   studies demonstrate partially reversible binding of I-131 to common
   dental metals. (C) 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott

Abstract = {{Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of irreversible
   visual dysfunction in individuals over 65 in Western Society. Patients
   with AMD are classified as having early stage disease (early AMD), in
   which visual function is affected, or late AMD (generally characterized
   as either ``wet{''} neovascular AMD, ``dry{''} atrophic AMD or both), in
   which central vision is severely compromised or lost. Until recently,
   there have been no therapies available to treat the disorder(s). Now,
   the most common wet form of late-stage AMD, choroidal
   neovascularization, generally responds to treatment with anti-vascular
   endothelial growth factor therapies. Nevertheless, there are no current
   therapies to restore lost vision in eyes with advanced atrophic AMD.
   Oral supplementation with the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) or
   AREDS2 formulation (antioxidant vitamins C and E, lutein, zeaxanthin,
   and zinc) has been shown to reduce the risk of progression to advanced
   AMD, although the impact was in neovascular rather than atrophic AMD.
   Recent findings, however, have demonstrated several features of early
   AMD that are likely to be druggable targets for treatment. Studies have
   established that much of the genetic risk for AMD is associated with
   complement genes. Consequently, several complement-based therapeutic
   treatment approaches are being pursued. Potential treatment strategies
   against AMD deposit formation and protein and/or lipid deposition will
   be discussed, including anti-amyloid therapies. In addition, the role of

Abstract = {{Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWD) microfluidics is an emerging platform
   for practical applications such as water quality testing and medical
   diagnostics. Low power consumption, low sample and reagent volumes,
   small size, and rapid fluid transport are features of electrowetting
   microfluidic platforms that will enable the development of
   cost-effective, rapid time-to-result, and portable point-of-care
   diagnostic devices. Microresonator sensors are an excellent sensor
   technology for integration into these microfluidic systems, because they
   perform high sensitivity detection of proteins, DNA, and other
   biologically relevant molecules while tolerating a droplet oil
   encapsulation layer. This paper reports on a SU-8 polymer microresonator
   embedded in the top plate of the EWD system, which enables addressing of
   the sensor with a single droplet of < 100 nL in volume and enables
   droplets to be moved onto and off of the sensor. This system is the
   first to demonstrate actuation of droplets onto and off of an integrated
   microresonator sensor. Both photolithographically patterned and electron
   beam lithographically patterned microresonator sensors were tested, and
   the effect of a conventional filler medium, silicone oil, on the sensor
   sensitivity was investigated.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We consider modeling spatio-temporally indexed relational data,
   motivated by analysis of voting data for the United States House of
   Representatives over two decades. The data are characterized by
   incomplete binary matrices, representing votes of legislators on
   legislation over time. The spatial covariates correspond to the location
   of a legislator's district, and time corresponds to the year of a vote.
   We seek to infer latent features associated with legislators and
   legislation, incorporating spatio-temporal structure. A model of such
   data must impose a flexible representation of the space time structure,
   since the apportionment of House seats and the total number of
   legislators change over time. There are 435 congressional districts,
   with one legislator at a time for each district; however, the total
   number of legislators typically changes from year to year, for example
   due to deaths. A matrix kernel stick-breaking process (MKSBP) is
   proposed, with the model employed within a probit-regression
   construction. Theoretical properties of the model are discussed and
   posterior inference is developed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
   Advantages over benchmark models are shown in terms of vote prediction
   and treatment of missing data. Marked improvements in results are
   observed based on leveraging spatial (geographical) information. (C)

Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{814-822}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the influence of elastic stresses and surface
   patterns on electrodic reaction rates. There are several well known
   processes that affect electrodic reaction rates such as rupture of
   passive layers, repassivation, and hydrogen adsoption, among others. Our
   main goal in this paper is to isolate the direct influence of elastic
   stresses and surface patterns on reaction rates. To this end, we propose
   an extended Butler-Volmer equation that incorporates the effect of
   stress and surface curvature on the chemical potential. The proposed
   extension of the Butler-Volmer equation is sensitive to both the
   magnitude and the tensile or compressive nature of the stress field. Our
   numerical studies show that, depending on the electrodic material,
   stress and surface curvature can produce a significant shift of the
   chemical potential, and hence, amplify or reduce electrodic reaction
   rates. We verified the shift in reaction rates predicted by our proposed
   continuum model using ab-initio electronic structure calculations. As an
   application of our proposed model, we demonstrate how a stress field in
   an electrodic domain may significantly affect the evolution of an anodic
   dissolution front. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Peptide drugs are an exciting class of pharmaceuticals for the treatment
   of a variety of diseases; however, their short half-life dictates
   multiple and frequent injections causing undesirable side effects.
   Herein, we describe a novel peptide delivery system that seeks to
   combine the attractive features of prolonged circulation time with a
   prolonged release formulation. This system consists of glucagon-like
   peptide-1, a type-2 diabetes drug fused to a thermally responsive,
   elastin-like-polypeptide (ELP) that undergoes a soluble-insoluble phase
   transition between room temperature and body temperature, thereby
   forming an injectable depot. We synthesized a set of GLP-1-ELP fusions
   and verified their proteolytic stability and potency in vitro.
   Significantly, a single injection of depot forming GLP-1-ELP fusions
   reduced blood glucose levels in mice for up to 5 days, 120 times longer
   than an injection of the native peptide. These findings demonstrate the
   unique advantages of using ELPs to release peptide-ELP fusions from a
   depot combined with enhanced systemic circulation to create a tunable
   peptide delivery system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: During dynamic injury scenarios, such as motor vehicle
   crashes, neck biomechanics contribute to head excursion and
   acceleration, influencing head injuries. One important tool in
   understanding head and neck dynamics is computational modeling. However,
   realistic and stable muscle activations for major muscles are required
   to realize meaningful kinematic responses. The objective was to
   determine cervical muscle activation states for 6-year-old, 10-year-old,
   and adult 50th percentile male computational head and neck models.
   Currently, pediatric models including muscle activations are unable to
   maintain the head in an equilibrium position, forcing models to begin
   from nonphysiologic conditions. Recent work has realized a stationary
   initial geometry and cervical muscle activations by first optimizing
   responses against gravity. Accordingly, our goal was to apply these
   methods to Duke University's head-neck model validated using living
   muscle response and pediatric cadaveric data.
   Methods: Activation schemes maintaining an upright, stable head for 22
   muscle pairs were found using LS-OPT. Two optimization problems were
   investigated: a relaxed state, which minimized muscle fatigue, and a
   tensed activation state, which maximized total muscle force. The model's
   biofidelity was evaluated by the kinematic response to gravitational and
   frontal impact loading conditions. Model sensitivity and uncertainty
   analyses were performed to assess important parameters for pediatric
   muscle response. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using multiple
   activation time histories. These included constant activations and an
   optimal muscle activation time history, which varied the activation
   level of flexor and extensor groups, and activation initiation and
   termination times.
   Results: Relaxed muscle activations decreased with increasing age,
   maintaining upright posture primarily through extensor activation.
   Tensed musculature maintained upright posture through coactivation of
   flexors and extensors, producing up to 32times the force of the relaxed
   state. Without muscle activation, the models fell into flexion due to
   gravitational loading. Relaxed musculature produced 28.6-35.8N of force
   to the head, whereas tensed musculature produced 450-1023N. Pediatric
   model stiffnesses were most sensitive to muscle physiological
   cross-sectional area.
   Conclusions: Though muscular loads were not large enough to cause
   vertebral compressive failure, they would provide a prestressed state
   that could protect the vertebrae during tensile loading but might
   exacerbate risk during compressive loading. For example, in the
   10-year-old, a load of 602N was produced, though estimated compressive
   failure tolerance is only 2.8 kN. Including muscles and time-variant
   activation schemes is vital for producing biofidelic models because both
   vary by age. The pediatric activations developed represent
   physiologically appropriate sets of initial conditions and are based on
   validated adult cadaveric data. Supplemental materials are available for

Abstract = {{Elastic properties of materials can be measured by observing shear wave
   propagation following localized, impulsive excitations and relating the
   propagation velocity to a model of the material. However,
   characterization of anisotropic materials is difficult because of the
   number of elasticity constants in the material model and the complex
   dependence of propagation velocity relative to the excitation axis,
   material symmetries, and propagation directions. In this study, we
   develop a model of wave propagation following impulsive excitation in an
   incompressible, transversely isotropic (TI) material such as muscle.
   Wave motion is described in terms of three propagation modes identified
   by their polarization relative to the material symmetry axis and
   propagation direction. Phase velocities for these propagation modes are
   expressed in terms of five elasticity constants needed to describe a
   general TI material, and also in terms of three constants after the
   application of two constraints that hold in the limit of an
   incompressible material. Group propagation velocities are derived from
   the phase velocities to describe the propagation of wave packets away
   from the excitation region following localized excitation. The
   theoretical model is compared to the results of finite element (FE)
   simulations performed using a nearly incompressible material model with
   the five elasticity constants chosen to preserve the essential
   properties of the material in the incompressible limit. Propagation
   velocities calculated from the FE displacement data show complex
   structure that agrees quantitatively with the theoretical model and
   demonstrates the possibility of measuring all three elasticity constants
   needed to characterize an incompressible, TI material. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Current periodic structures are constrained to have fixed energy
   transmission behavior unless active control or component replacement is
   used to alter their wave propagation characteristics. The introduction
   of nonlinearity to generate multiple stable equilibria is an alternative
   strategy for realizing distinct energy propagation behaviors. We
   investigate the creation of a reconfigurable band-gap system by
   implementing passive switching between multiple stable states of
   equilibrium, to alter the level of energy attenuation in response to
   environmental stimuli. The ability to avoid potentially catastrophic
   loads is demonstrated by tailoring the bandpass and band-gap regions to
   coalesce for two stable equilibria and varying an external load
   parameter to trigger a bifurcation. The proposed phenomenon could be
   utilized in remote or autonomous applications where component
   modifications and active control are impractical.}},

Title = {{A Brain-Machine Interface Enables Bimanual Arm Movements in Monkeys}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{210}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are artificial systems that aim to
   restore sensation and movement to paralyzed patients. So far, BMIs have
   enabled only one arm to be moved at a time. Control of bimanual arm
   movements remains a major challenge. We have developed and tested a
   bimanual BMI that enables rhesus monkeys to control two avatar arms
   simultaneously. The bimanual BMI was based on the extracellular activity
   of 374 to 497 neurons recorded from several frontal and parietal
   cortical areas of both cerebral hemispheres. Cortical activity was
   transformed into movements of the two arms with a decoding algorithm
   called a fifth-order unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The UKF was trained
   either during a manual task performed with two joysticks or by having
   the monkeys passively observe the movements of avatar arms. Most
   cortical neurons changed their modulation patterns when both arms were
   engaged simultaneously. Representing the two arms jointly in a single
   UKF decoder resulted in improved decoding performance compared with
   using separate decoders for each arm. As the animals' performance in
   bimanual BMI control improved over time, we observed widespread
   plasticity in frontal and parietal cortical areas. Neuronal
   representation of the avatar and reach targets was enhanced with
   learning, whereas pairwise correlations between neurons initially
   increased and then decreased. These results suggest that cortical
   networks may assimilate the two avatar arms through BMI control. These
   findings should help in the design of more sophisticated BMIs capable of
   enabling bimanual motor control in human patients.}},

   Nonviral Gene Transfer}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{As the designs of polymer systems used to deliver nucleic acids continue
   to evolve, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the basic bulk
   manufacturing techniques of the past will be insufficient to produce
   polymer-nucleic acid nanocomplexes that possess the uniformity,
   stability, and potency required for their successful clinical
   translation and widespread commercialization. Traditional bulk-prepared
   products are often physicochemically heterogeneous and may vary
   significantly from one batch to the next. Here we show that preparation
   of bioreducible nanocomplexes with an emulsion-based droplet
   microfluidic system produces significantly improved nanoparticles that
   are up to fifty percent smaller, more uniform, and are less prone to
   aggregation. The intracellular integrity of nanocomplexes prepared with
   thismicrofluidicmethod is significantly prolonged, as detected using a
   high-throughput flow cytometric quantumdot Forster resonance energy
   transfer nanosensor system. These physical attributes conspire to
   consistently enhance the delivery of both plasmid DNA and messenger RNA
   payloads in stem cells, primary cells, and human cell lines. Innovation
   in processing is necessary to move the field toward the broader clinical
   implementation of safe and effective nonviral nucleic acid therapeutics,
   and preparation with droplet microfluidics represents a step forward in
   addressing the critical barrier of robust and reproducible nanocomplex
   production.}},

   accurately the dissolution of a pure liquid microdroplet into a second
   immiscible solvent, such as oil into water. Here, we present a series of
   new experiments and a modification to this equation to model the
   dissolution of a two-component oil-mixture microdroplet into a second
   immiscible solvent in which the two materials of the droplet have
   different solubilities. The model is based on a reduced surface area
   approximation and the assumption of ideal homogeneous mixing {[}mass
   flux d(m)/dt = A(frac,)D(i)(c(i) - c(s))\{(1/R) + (1/(pi D(i)t)(1/2)\}]
   where A(frac,) is the area fraction of component i, c(i), and c(s) are
   the initial and saturation concentrations of the droplet material in the
   surrounding medium, R is the radius of the droplet, t is time, and D-i
   is the coefficient of diffusion of component i in the surrounding
   medium. This new model has been tested by the use of a two-chamber
   micropipet-based method, which measured the dissolution of single
   individual microdroplets of mutually miscible liquid mixtures (ethyl
   acetate/butyl acetate and butyl acetate/amyl acetate) in water. We
   additionally measured the diffusion coefficient of the pure
   materials-ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and amyl acetate-in water at 22
   degrees C. Diffusion coefficients for the pure acetates in water were
   8.65 x 10(-6), 7.61 X 10(-6), and 9.14 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s, respectively.
   This model accurately predicts the dissolution of microdroplets for the
   ethyl acetate/butyl acetate and butyl acetate/amyl acetate systems given
   the solubility and diffusion coefficients of each of the individual
   components in water as well as the initial droplet radius. The average
   mean squared error was 8.96\%. The dissolution of a spherical ideally
   mixed multicomponent droplet closely follows the modified
   Epstein-Plesset model presented here.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an optical element capable of multiplexing two
   diffraction patterns for two orthogonal linear polarizations, based on
   the use of non-resonant metamaterial cross elements. The metamaterial
   cross elements provide unique building blocks for engineering arbitrary
   birefringence. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we present the
   design and experimental characterization of a polarization multiplexed
   blazed diffraction grating and a polarization multiplexed
   computer-generated hologram, for the telecommunication wavelength of
   lambda = 1.55 mu m. A quantitative study of the polarization multiplexed
   grating reveals that this approach yields a very large polarization
   contrast ratio. The results show that metamaterials can form the basis
   for a versatile and compact platform useful in the design of
   multi-functional photonic devices. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the properties of complementary metamaterials as effective
   inclusions patterned into the conducting walls of metal waveguide
   structures. We show that guided wave metamaterials can be homogenized
   using the same retrieval techniques used for volumetric metamaterials,
   leading to a description in which a given complementary element is
   conceptually replaced by a block of material within the waveguide whose
   effective permittivity and permeability result in equivalent scattering
   characteristics. The use of effective constitutive parameters for
   waveguide materials provides an alternative point-of-view for the design
   of waveguide and microstrip based components, including planar lenses
   and filters, as well as devices with derived from a bulk material
   response. In addition to imparting effective constitutive properties to
   the waveguide, complementary metamaterials also couple energy from
   waveguide modes into radiation. Thus, complementary waveguide
   metamaterials can be used to modify and optimize a variety of antenna
   structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lorentz Effect Imaging (LEI) is an MRI technique that has been proposed
   for direct imaging of neuronal activity. While promising results have
   been obtained in phantoms and in the human median nerve in vivo, its
   contrast mechanism is still not fully understood. In this paper,
   computational model simulations were used to investigate how
   electromagnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) may explain the LEI contrast.
   Three computational models of an electrolyte-filled phantom subject to
   an applied current dipole, synchronized to oscillating magnetic field
   gradients of an LEI protocol, were developed to determine the velocity
   and displacement of water molecules as well as the resulting signal loss
   in an MR image. The simulated images were compared to images from
   previous LEI phantom experiments with identical properties for different
   stimulus current amplitudes and polarities.
   The first model, which evaluated ion trajectories based on Stokes flow
   using different mobility values, did not generate an appreciable signal
   loss due to an insufficient number of water molecules associated with
   the ion hydration shells. The second model, which computed particle
   drift based on the Lorentz force of charged particles in free space, was
   able to approximate the magnitude, but not the distribution of signal
   loss observed in the experimental images. The third model, which
   computed EMHD based on the Lorentz force and Navier-Stokes equations for
   flow of a conducting fluid, provided results consistent with both the
   magnitude and distribution of signal loss seen in the LEI experiments.
   Our EMHD model further yields information on electrical potential,
   velocity, displacement, and pressure, which are not readily available in
   an experiment, thereby providing a robust means to study and optimize
   LEI for imaging neuronal activity in the human cortex. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We demonstrate temperature-controlled encapsulation and release of the
   enzyme horseradish peroxidase using a preassembled and covalently closed
   three-dimensional DNA cage structure as a controllable encapsulation
   device. The utilized cage structure was covalently closed and composed

   structure. The double stranded helices were interrupted by short
   single-stranded thymidine linkers constituting the cage corners except
   for one, which was composed by four 32 nucleotide long stretches of DNA
   with a sequence that allowed them to fold into hairpin structures. As
   demonstrated by gel-electrophoretic and fluorophore-quenching
   experiments this design imposed a temperature-controlled conformational
   transition capability to the structure, which allowed entrance or
   release of an enzyme cargo at 37 degrees C while ensuring retainment of
   the cargo in the central cavity of the cage at 4 degrees C. The
   entrapped enzyme was catalytically active inside the DNA cage and was
   able to convert substrate molecules penetrating the apertures in the DNA
   lattice that surrounded the central cavity of the cage.}},

Abstract = {{Electrodeposited nanorods serving as multivalent bridges were fabricated
   and surface-decorated with ligands for immune cells. Gold and nickel
   solutions were sequentially electrodeposited on nanoporous anodized disc
   templates and the template was dissolved to retrieve bisegmented
   nanorods with different lengths. Gold and nickel segmented nanorods were
   surface-immobilized with mannose and RGD peptides to prepare immune-cell
   recruiting nanorods. Surface-functionalization of nanorods were
   confirmed by fluorescence-labeling of each ligands and confocal
   microscopy. Dendritic cells and T cells were co-incubated with the
   surface-functionalized nanorods, and the proximity between the nanorods
   and the immune cells was visualized by variable pressure scanning
   electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. The long nanorods were
   associated with the immune cells, whereas the shorter nanorods were
   rather endocytosed by cells, suggesting a feasibility of the longer
   nanorods as bridging for the cells. Cytokine releases from the immune
   cells were monitored by cultivating lipopolysaccharide-activated
   dendritic cells with T cells. Interleukine-2 and interferon-gamma
   release profiles showed a strong correlation with the length of the
   nanorod, where the 4 mu m nanorods induced the highest levels of
   cytokine release compared to 1 or 2 mu m nanorods. Thus, we concluded
   that the proximity of the immune cells increased by bridging the immune
   cells with the nanobridging system, which subsequently increased
   cytokine release by facilitating the antigen presentation process.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregate structure of covalently functionalized chiral specific
   semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) was systematically
   studied employing static light scattering (SLS). Fractal dimensions
   (D-f) of two specific chirality SWNT5-SG65 and SG76 with (6, 5) and (7,
   6) chiral enrichments-were measured under four biological exposure media
   conditions, namely: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), Minimum
   Essential Medium (MEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640
   medium, and 0.9\% saline solution. The SWNTs exhibited chiral dependence
   on Dr with SG65 showing more fractal or loosely bound aggregate
   structures, i.e., lower Df values (range of 2.24 +/- 0.03 to 2.64 +/-
   0.05), compared to the SG76 sample (range of 2.58 +/- 0.13 to 2.90 +/-
   0.08). All the Df values reported are highly reproducible, measured from
   multiple SLS runs and estimated with `random block-effects' statistical
   analysis that yielded all p values to be <0.001. The key mechanism for
   such difference in D-f between the SWNT samples was identified as the
   difference in van der Waals (VDW) interaction energies of these samples,
   where higher VOW of SG76 resulted in tighter packing density. Effect of
   medium type showed lower sensitivity; however, presence of di-valent
   cations (Ca2+) in DMEM and MEM media resulted in relatively loose or
   more fractal aggregates. Moreover, presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS)
   and bovine serum albumin (BSA), used to mimic the in vitro cell culture
   condition, reduced the Dr values, i.e., created more fractal structures.
   Steric hindrance to aggregation was identified as the key mechanism for
   creating the fractal structures. Also, increase in FBS concentration
   from 1\% to 10\% resulted in increasingly lower Df values. Published by

Abstract = {{Decompression sickness (DCS) is a disease known to be related to inert
   gas bubble formation originating from gases dissolved in body tissues.
   Probabilistic DCS models, which employ survival and hazard functions,

   the work reported here, I develop methods to find the survival function
   gain parameter analytically, thus removing it from the fitting process.
   I show that the number of iterations required for model optimization is
   significantly reduced. The analytic gain method substantially improves
   the condition number of the Hessian matrix which reduces the model
   confidence intervals by more than an order of magnitude. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Ultrasound-based elasticity imaging methods rely upon accurate estimates
   of tissue deformation to characterize the mechanical properties of soft
   tissues. These methods are corrupted by clutter, which can bias and/or
   increase variance in displacement estimates. Harmonic imaging methods
   are routinely used for clutter suppression and improved image quality in
   conventional B-mode ultrasound, but have not been utilized in
   ultrasound-based elasticity imaging methods. We introduce a novel,
   fully-sampled pulse-inversion harmonic method for tracking tissue
   displacements that corrects the loss in temporal sampling frequency
   associated with conventional pulse-inversion techniques. The method is
   implemented with acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging to
   monitor the displacements induced by an impulsive acoustic radiation
   force excitation. Custom pulse sequences were implemented on a
   diagnostic ultrasound scanner to collect spatially-matched fundamental
   and harmonic information within a single acquisition. B-mode and ARFI
   images created from fundamental data collected at 4 MHz and 8 MHz are
   compared with 8-MHz harmonic images created using a band-pass filter
   approach and the fully sampled pulse-inversion method. In homogeneous,
   tissue-mimicking phantoms, where no visible clutter was observed, there
   was little difference in the axial displacements, estimated jitter, and
   normalized cross-correlation among the fundamental and harmonic tracking
   methods. The similarity of the lower-and higher-frequency methods
   suggests that any improvement resulting from the increased frequency of
   the harmonic components is negligible. The harmonic tracking methods
   demonstrated a marked improvement in B-mode and ARFI image quality of in
   vivo carotid arteries. Improved feature detection and decreased variance
   in estimated displacements were observed in the arterial walls of
   harmonic ARFI images, especially in the pulse-inversion harmonic ARFI
   images. Within the lumen, the harmonic tracking methods improved the
   discrimination of the blood-vessel interface, making it easier to
   visualize plaque boundaries. Improvements in harmonic ARFI images in
   vivo were consistent with suppressed clutter supported by improved
   contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the matched harmonic
   B-mode images compared with the fundamental B-mode images. These results
   suggest that harmonic tracking methods can improve the clinical utility
   and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound-based elasticity imaging methods.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To determine whether a novel automatic segmentation program,
   the Duke Optical Coherence Tomography Retinal Analysis Program
   (DOCTRAP), can be applied to spectral-domain optical coherence
   tomography (SD-OCT) images obtained from different commercially
   available SD-OCT in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME).
   METHODS. A novel segmentation framework was used to segment the retina,
   inner retinal pigment epithelium, and Bruch's membrane on images from
   eyes with DME acquired by one of two SD-OCT systems, Spectralis or
   Cirrus high definition (HD)-OCT. Thickness data obtained by the DOCTRAP
   software were compared with those produced by Spectralis and Cirrus.
   Measurement agreement and its dependence were assessed using intraclass
   correlation (ICC).
   RESULTS. A total of 40 SD-OCT scans from 20 subjects for each machine
   were included in the analysis. Spectralis: the mean thickness in the
   1-mm central area determined by DOCTRAP and Spectralis was 463.8 +/-
   107.5 mu m and 467.0 +/- 108.1 mu m, respectively (ICC, 0.999). There
   was also a high level agreement in surrounding areas (out to 3 mm).
   Cirrus: the mean thickness in the 1-mm central area was 440.8 +/- 183.4
   mu m and 442.7 +/- 182.4 mu m by DOCTRAP and Cirrus, respectively (ICC,
   0.999). The thickness agreement in surrounding areas (out to 3 mm) was
   more variable due to Cirrus segmentation errors in one subject (ICC,
   0.734-0.999). After manual correction of the errors, there was a high
   level of thickness agreement in surrounding areas (ICC, 0.997-1.000).
   CONCLUSIONS. The DOCTRAP may be useful to compare retinal thicknesses in
   eyes with DME across OCT platforms.}},

Title = {{Volumetric quantification of lung nodules in CT with iterative
   reconstruction (ASiR and MBIR)}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Volume quantifications of lung nodules with multidetector
   computed tomography (CT) images provide useful information for
   monitoring nodule developments. The accuracy and precision of the volume
   quantification, however, can be impacted by imaging and reconstruction
   parameters. This study aimed to investigate the impact of iterative
   reconstruction algorithms on the accuracy and precision of volume
   quantification with dose and slice thickness as additional variables.
   Methods: Repeated CT images were acquired from an anthropomorphic chest
   phantom with synthetic nodules (9.5 and 4.8 mm) at six dose levels, and
   reconstructed with three reconstruction algorithms {[}filtered
   backprojection (FBP), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction
   (ASiR), and model based iterative reconstruction (MBIR)] into three
   slice thicknesses. The nodule volumes were measured with two clinical
   software (A: Lung VCAR, B: iNtuition), and analyzed for accuracy and
   precision.
   Results: Precision was found to be generally comparable between FBP and
   iterative reconstruction with no statistically significant difference
   noted for different dose levels, slice thickness, and segmentation
   software. Accuracy was found to be more variable. For large nodules, the
   accuracy was significantly different between ASiR and FBP for all slice
   thicknesses with both software, and significantly different between MBIR
   and FBP for 0.625 mm slice thickness with Software A and for all slice
   thicknesses with Software B. For small nodules, the accuracy was more
   similar between FBP and iterative reconstruction, with the exception of
   ASIR vs FBP at 1.25 mm with Software A and MBIR vs FBP at 0.625 mm with
   Software A.
   Conclusions: The systematic difference between the accuracy of FBP and
   iterative reconstructions highlights the importance of extending current
   segmentation software to accommodate the image characteristics of
   iterative reconstructions. In addition, a calibration process may help
   reduce the dependency of accuracy on reconstruction algorithms, such
   that volumes quantified from scans of different reconstruction
   algorithms can be compared. The little difference found between the
   precision of FBP and iterative reconstructions could be a result of both
   iterative reconstruction's diminished noise reduction at the edge of the
   nodules as well as the loss of resolution at high noise levels with
   iterative reconstruction. The findings do not rule out potential
   advantage of IR that might be evident in a study that uses a larger
   number of nodules or repeated scans. (C) 2013 American Association of

Abstract = {{Effective treatment of patients with malignant brain tumors requires
   surgical resection of a high percentage of the bulk tumor. Surgeons
   require a method that enables delineation of tumor margins, which are
   not visually distinct by eye. In this study, the feasibility of using
   gold nanorods (GNRs) for this purpose is evaluated. Anti-Epidermal
   Growth Factor Receptor (anti-EGFR) conjugated GNRs are used to label
   human xenograft glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors embedded within
   slices of brain tissues from healthy nude mice. The anti-EGFR GNRs
   exhibit enhanced absorption at red to near-infrared wavelengths, often
   referred to as the tissue optical window, where absorption from blood is
   minimal. To enable definition of molecular specificity and spatial
   accuracy of the label, the GNR absorption is compared with GFP
   fluorescence which is expressed by the GBM cells used here. This work
   demonstrates a simple but highly translational technique to classify
   normal and malignant brain tissue regions in open surgery applications
   using immunolabeled GNR contrast agents. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) and optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) are widely used retinal imaging modalities that can assist in the
   diagnosis of retinal pathologies. The combination of SLO and OCT
   provides a more comprehensive imaging system and a method to register
   OCT images to produce motion corrected retinal volumes. While high
   quality, bench-top SLO-OCT systems have been discussed in the literature
   and are available commercially, there are currently no handheld designs.
   We describe the first design and fabrication of a handheld SLO/spectral
   domain OCT probe. SLO and OCT images were acquired simultaneously with a
   combined power under the ANSI limit. High signal-to-noise ratio SLO and
   OCT images were acquired simultaneously from a normal subject with
   visible motion artifacts. Fully automated motion estimation methods were
   performed in post-processing to correct for the inter-and intra-frame
   motion in SLO images and their concurrently acquired OCT volumes. The
   resulting set of reconstructed SLO images and the OCT volume were
   without visible motion artifacts. At a reduced field of view, the SLO
   resolved parafoveal cones without adaptive optics at a retinal
   eccentricity of 11 in subjects with good ocular optics. This system may
   be especially useful for imaging young children and subjects with less
   stable fixation. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel technique, based on compressive
   sensing principles, for reconstruction and enhancement of
   multi-dimensional image data. Our method is a major improvement and
   generalization of the multi-scale sparsity based tomographic denoising
   (MSBTD) algorithm we recently introduced for reducing speckle noise. Our
   new technique exhibits several advantages over MSBTD, including its
   capability to simultaneously reduce noise and interpolate missing data.
   Unlike MSBTD, our new method does not require an a priori high-quality
   image from the target imaging subject and thus offers the potential to
   shorten clinical imaging sessions. This novel image restoration method,
   which we termed sparsity based simultaneous denoising and interpolation
   (SBSDI), utilizes sparse representation dictionaries constructed from
   previously collected datasets. We tested the SBSDI algorithm on retinal
   spectral domain optical coherence tomography images captured in the
   clinic. Experiments showed that the SBSDI algorithm qualitatively and
   quantitatively outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Site-specific differences were found in consumer isotope values among
   ten sites examined in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Average delta C-13
   values among sites ranged -21.7 to -15.7 aEuro degrees, delta N-15
   ranged < 3 aEuro degrees: from 9.8 to 11.5 aEuro degrees, and delta S-34
   ranged from 5.9 to 18.3 aEuro degrees. Isotope variation among these
   sites provided insight into the ranging habits of bottlenose dolphins
   (Tursiops truncatus) sampled in St. George Sound (29.8N, 84.6W), a
   nearshore seagrass habitat, during May of 2005. Isotope comparisons
   suggest that the majority of dolphins sampled (average +/- A one
   standard deviation: delta C-13 = -17.5 +/- A 0.8, delta N-15 = 14.5 +/-
   A 0.9, and delta S-34 = 10.6 +/- A 1.5) did not forage significantly on
   offshore species which are significantly S-34-enriched, nor is it likely
   that they ranged either eastward or westward along the coast within the
   sampling region. Despite their capability for ranging, these dolphins
   occupied a restricted home range, during the spring before our sampling
   efforts. These results demonstrate significant fine-scale isotope
   variation among coastal habitats explained by differences in freshwater
   inputs, organic matter loading, and modes of primary production that may
   be used to constrain the foraging ranges of a highly mobile apex
   predator.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveHemodynamic properties of vascular beds are of great interest
   in a variety of clinical and laboratory settings. However, there
   presently exists no automated, accurate, technically simple method for
   generating blood velocity maps of complex microvessel networks.
   MethodsHere, we present a novel algorithm that addresses the problem of
   acquiring quantitative maps by applying pixel-by-pixel cross-correlation
   to video data. Temporal signals at every spatial coordinate are compared
   with signals at neighboring points, generating a series of correlation
   maps from which speed and direction are calculated. User-assisted
   definition of vessel geometries is not required, and sequential data are
   analyzed automatically, without user bias.
   ResultsVelocity measurements were validated against the dual-slit method
   and against in vitro capillary flow with known velocities. The algorithm
   was tested in three different biological models in order to demonstrate
   its versatility.
   ConclusionsThe hemodynamic maps presented here demonstrate an accurate,
   quantitative method of analyzing dynamic vascular systems.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing scanning time is significantly important for MRI. Compressed
   sensing has shown promising results by undersampling the k-space data to
   speed up imaging. Sparsity of an image plays an important role in
   compressed sensing MM to reduce the image artifacts. Recently, the
   method of patch-based directional wavelets (PBDW) which trains geometric
   directions from undersampled data has been proposed. It has better
   performance in preserving image edges than conventional sparsifying
   transforms. However, obvious artifacts are presented in the smooth
   region when the data are highly undersampled. In addition, the original
   PBDW-based method does not hold obvious improvement for radial and fully
   2D random sampling patterns. In this paper, the PBDW-based MM
   reconstruction is improved from two aspects: 1) An efficient non-convex
   minimization algorithm is modified to enhance image quality; 2) PBDW are
   extended into shift-invariant discrete wavelet domain to enhance the
   ability of transform on sparsifying piecewise smooth image features.
   Numerical simulation results on vivo magnetic resonance images
   demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the original PBDW in
   terms of removing artifacts and preserving edges. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Despite the therapeutic benefits of both mechanical circulatory assist
   devices and nitinol stents with titanium (Ti) outer surfaces, problems
   remain with thrombosis at the blood-contacting surface. Covering these
   surfaces with a layer of endothelium would mimic the native lining of
   the cardiovascular system, potentially decreasing thrombotic
   complications. Since surface topography is known to affect the phenotype
   of a seeded cell layer and since stents and ventricular assist devices
   exhibit surface protrusions, we tested the hypothesis that endothelial
   cells (ECs) have altered function on Ti surfaces with protrusions of
   1.25, 3, and 5 m height, compared with smooth Ti surfaces. ECs and
   nuclei were more aligned and ECs were more elongated on all patterned
   surfaces. Cell area was reduced on the 3 and 5 m features. Expression of
   eNOS and COX2 was not altered by patterned surfaces, but expression of
   KLF-2 was higher on 1.25 and 5 m features. Nitric oxide production
   following exposure to flow was higher on the 5 m features. These results
   show that some antithrombogenic functions of ECs are significantly
   enhanced for ECs cultured on surface protrusions, and no functions are
   diminished, informing the future design of implant surfaces for
   endothelialization. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

Abstract = {{Intracortical electrodes record neural signals directly from local
   populations of neurons in the brain, and conduct them to external
   electronics that control prosthetics. However, the relationship between
   electrode design, defined by shape, size and tethering; and long-term
   (chronic) stability of the neuron-electrode interface is poorly
   understood. Here, we studied the effects of various commercially
   available intracortical electrode designs that vary in shape
   (cylindrical, planar), size (15 mu m, 50 mu m and 75 mu m), and
   tethering {[}electrode connections to connector with (tethered) and
   without tethering cable (untethered)] using histological,
   transcriptomic, and electrophysiological analyses over acute (3 day) and
   chronic (12 week) timepoints. Quantitative analysis of histological
   sections indicated that Michigan 50 mu m (M50) and Michigan tethered
   (MT) electrodes induced significantly (p < 0.01) higher glial scarring,
   and lesser survival of neurons in regions of blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   breach when compared to microwire (MW) and Michigan 15 mu m (M15)
   electrodes acutely and chronically. Gene expression analysis of the
   neurotoxic cytokines interleukin (Il)1 (Il1 alpha, Il1 beta), Il6, Il17
   (Il17a, Il17b, Il17f), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf) indicated
   that MW electrodes induced significantly (p < 0.05) reduced expression
   of these transcripts when compared to M15, M50 and FMAA electrodes
   chronically. Finally, electrophysiological assessment of electrode
   function indicated that MW electrodes performed significantly (p < 0.05)
   better than all other electrodes over a period of 12 weeks. These
   studies reveal that intracortical electrodes with smaller size,
   cylindrical shape, and without tethering cables produce significantly
   diminished inflammatory responses when compared to large, planar and
   tethered electrodes. These studies provide a platform for the rational
   design and assessment of chronically functional intracortical electrode
   implants in the future. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach to the simulation of viscous fingering
   instabilities in incompressible, miscible displacement flows in porous
   media. In the past, high resolution computational simulations of viscous
   fingering instabilities have always been performed using high-order
   finite difference or Fourier-spectral methods which do not posses the
   flexibility to compute very complex subsurface geometries. Our approach,
   instead, by means of a fully-coupled nonlinear implementation of the
   discontinuous Galerkin method, possesses a fundamental differentiating
   feature, in that it maintains high-order accuracy on fully unstructured
   meshes. In addition, the proposed method shows very low sensitivity to
   mesh orientation, in contrast with classical finite volume approximation
   used in porous media flow simulations. The robustness and accuracy of
   the method are demonstrated in a number of challenging computational
   problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are appealing candidates for use in
   energy harvesting and concentrating because of their high chromophore
   density and structural tunability. The ability to engineer electronic
   excitation energy transport pathways is of particular interest for
   designing energy harvesting materials. In this study, theoretical
   analysis was performed on energy transfer in MOFs that contain light
   absorbing ruthenium complexes that serve as hopping intermediates for
   energy transfer kinetics and energy trapping osmium complexes. We find
   that the excitation transport kinetics is well described by a Dexter
   (exchange) triplet-to-triplet energy transfer mechanism with multistep
   incoherent exciton hopping. The modeling combines ab initio electronic
   structure theory with kinetic network analysis. The sensitivity of
   Dexter mechanism energy transfer to framework structure establishes
   different kinds of energy transport paths in the different structures.
   For example, the mixed Ru/Os MOF structures described here establish one
   or three-dimensional hopping networks. As such, Dexter mechanism energy
   harvesting materials may be amenable to designing structures that can
   spatially direct exciton energy along specific pathways for energy
   delivery to reaction centers.}},

Title = {{Origin of Overstretching Transitions in Single-Stranded Nucleic Acids}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{We combined single-molecule force spectroscopy with nuclear magnetic
   resonance measurements and molecular mechanics simulations to examine
   overstretching transitions in single-stranded nucleic acids. In
   single-stranded DNA and single-stranded RNA there is a low-force
   transition that involves unwinding of the helical structure, along with
   base unstacking. We determined that the high-force transition that
   occurs in polydeoxyadenylic acid single-stranded DNA is caused by the
   cooperative forced flipping of the dihedral angle formed between four
   atoms, O5'-C5'-C4'-C3' (gamma torsion), in the nucleic acid backbone
   within the canonical B-type helix. The gamma torsion also flips under
   force in A-type helices, where the helix is shorter and wider as
   compared to the B-type helix, but this transition is less cooperative
   than in the B type and does not generate a high-force plateau in the
   force spectrums of A-type helices. We find that a similar high-force
   transition can be induced in polyadenylic acid single-stranded RNA by
   urea, presumably due to disrupting the intramolecular hydrogen bonding
   in the backbone. We hypothesize that a pronounced high-force transition
   observed for B-type helices of double stranded DNA also involves a
   cooperative flip of the gamma torsion. These observations suggest new
   fundamental relationships between the canonical structures of single-and
   double-stranded DNA and the mechanism of their molecular elasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Rewiring and optimization of metabolic networks to enable the production
   of commercially valuable chemicals is a central goal of metabolic
   engineering. This prospect is challenged by the complexity of metabolic
   networks, lack of complete knowledge of gene function(s), and the vast
   combinatorial genotype space that is available for exploration and
   optimization. Various approaches have thus been developed to aid in the
   efficient identification of genes that contribute to a variety of
   different phenotypes, allowing more rapid design and engineering of
   traits desired for industrial applications. This review will highlight
   recent technologies that have enhanced capabilities to map
   genotype-phenotype relationships on a genome wide scale and emphasize
   how such approaches enable more efficient design and engineering of
   complex phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analytical treatment of the optical scattering from
   film-coupled nanocubes. Film-coupled nanoparticles are a convenient
   platform for the demonstration of a variety of fundamental plasmonic
   phenomena, including nonlocality and field enhancement, and can also
   serve as the basis for controlled reflectance surfaces. The nanocube
   geometry is particularly amenable to analysis, since the cubes behave in
   large part as plasmon resonant patch antennas, allowing the well-known
   patch antenna equations to be applied with some modifications. In
   particular, we make use of the plasmon dispersion relation to avoid
   direct calculation of the effective inductance per unit length-which
   would include kinetic inductance contributions-instead calculating the
   effective waveguide mode index to incorporate plasmonic contributions.
   We compare the analytically derived field enhancement and spectral
   characteristics of the film-coupled nanoparticles with those obtained
   from full-wave finite-element simulations. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The relativistically induced transparency acceleration (RITA) scheme of
   proton and ion acceleration using laser-plasma interactions is
   introduced, modeled, and compared to the existing schemes. Protons are
   accelerated with femtosecond relativistic pulses to produce
   quasimonoenergetic bunches with controllable peak energy. The RITA
   scheme works by a relativistic laser inducing transparency {[}Akhiezer

   (1971)] to densities higher than the cold-electron critical density,
   while the background heavy ions are stationary. The rising laser pulse
   creates a traveling acceleration structure at the relativistic critical
   density by ponderomotively {[}Lindl and Kaw, Phys. Fluids 14, 371
   (1971); Silva et al., Phys. Rev. E 59, 2273 (1999)] driving a local
   electron density inflation, creating an electron snowplow and a
   co-propagating electrostatic potential. The snowplow advances with a
   velocity determined by the rate of the rise of the laser's intensity
   envelope and the heavy-ion-plasma density gradient scale length. The
   rising laser is incrementally rendered transparent to higher densities
   such that the relativistic-electron plasma frequency is resonant with
   the laser frequency. In the snowplow frame, trace density protons
   reflect off the electrostatic potential and get snowplowed, while the
   heavier background ions are relatively unperturbed. Quasimonoenergetic
   bunches of velocity equal to twice the snowplow velocity can be obtained
   and tuned by controlling the snowplow velocity using laser-plasma
   parameters. An analytical model for the proton energy as a function of
   laser intensity, rise time, and plasma density gradient is developed and

Abstract = {{Slender curved structures can often be found as components of complex
   structures in civil, mechanical, and aerospace systems. Under extreme
   loadings, a curved structure might undergo snap-through buckling, i.e.,
   the structure is forced to its inverted configuration, inducing fatigue.
   Therefore, it is important to identify the stability boundaries of
   structures and to obtain an accurate description of their performance if
   the response moves beyond those boundaries. In this paper, a combined
   experimental-computational framework is used to analyze the transient
   behavior of clamped-clamped shallow arches. We examine, both
   experimentally and using Finite Element Analysis (FEA), the response of
   shallow arches under harmonic distributed loading. Various types of
   responses are identified and regions in the forcing parameter space that
   lead to snap-through and chaotic responses are determined. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an optical strategy using intravital microscopy of dorsal
   skin flap window chamber models to image glucose uptake and vascular
   oxygenation in vivo. Glucose uptake was imaged using a fluorescent
   glucose analog,
   2-{[}N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diaxol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose
   (2-NBDG). SO2 was imaged using the differential absorption properties of
   oxygenated {[}HbO(2)] and deoxygenated hemoglobin {[}dHb]. This study
   was carried out on two sibling murine mammary adenocarcinoma lines, 4T1
   and 4T07. 2-NBDG uptake in the 4T1 tumors was lowest when rates of
   delivery and clearance were lowest, indicating perfusion-limited uptake
   in poorly oxygenated tumor regions. For increasing rates of delivery
   that were still lower than the glucose consumption rate (as measured in
   vitro), both 2-NBDG uptake and the clearance rate from the tumor
   increased. When the rate of delivery of 2-NBDG exceeded the glucose
   consumption rate, 2-NBDG uptake decreased with any further increase in
   rate of delivery, but the clearance rate continued to increase. This
   inflection point was not observed in the 4T07 tumors due to an absence
   of low delivery rates close to the glucose consumption rate. In the 4T07
   tumors, 2-NBDG uptake increased with increasing rates of delivery at low
   rates of clearance. Our results demonstrate that 2-NBDG uptake in tumors
   is influenced by the rates of delivery and clearance of the tracer. The
   rates of delivery and clearance are, in turn, dependent on vascular
   oxygenation of the tumors. Knowledge of the kinetics of tracer uptake as
   well as vascular oxygenation is essential to make an informed assessment
   of glucose demand of a tumor.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{The Human Connectome Project (HCP) relies primarily on three
   complementary magnetic resonance (MR) methods. These are: 1) resting
   state functional MR imaging (rfMRI) which uses correlations in the
   temporal fluctuations in an fMRI time series to deduce `functional
   connectivity'; 2) diffusion imaging (dMRI), which provides the input for
   tractography algorithms used for the reconstruction of the complex
   axonal fiber architecture; and 3) task based fMRI (tfMRI), which is
   employed to identify functional parcellation in the human brain in order
   to assist analyses of data obtained with the first two methods. We
   describe technical improvements and optimization of these methods as
   well as instrumental choices that impact speed of acquisition of fMRI
   and dMRI images at 3 T, leading to whole brain coverage with 2 mm
   isotropic resolution in 0.7 s for fMRI, and 1.25 mm isotropic resolution
   dMRI data for tractography analysis with three-fold reduction in total
   dMRI data acquisition time. Ongoing technical developments and
   optimization for acquisition of similar data at 7 T magnetic field are
   also presented, targeting higher spatial resolution, enhanced
   specificity of functional imaging signals, mitigation of the
   inhomogeneous radio frequency (RF) fields, and reduced power deposition.
   Results demonstrate that overall, these approaches represent a
   significant advance in MR imaging of the human brain to investigate
   brain function and structure. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper a Bayesian regularized artificial neural network is
   proposed as a novel method to forecast financial market behavior. Daily
   market prices and financial technical indicators are utilized as inputs
   to predict the one day future closing price of individual stocks. The
   prediction of stock price movement is generally considered to be a
   challenging and important task for financial time series analysis. The
   accurate prediction of stock price movements could play an important
   role in helping investors improve stock returns. The complexity in
   predicting these trends lies in the inherent noise and volatility in
   daily stock price movement. The Bayesian regularized network assigns a
   probabilistic nature to the network weights, allowing the network to
   automatically and optimally penalize excessively complex models. The
   proposed technique reduces the potential for overfitting and
   overtraining, improving the prediction quality and generalization of the
   network. Experiments were performed with Microsoft Corp. and Goldman
   Sachs Group Inc. stock to determine the effectiveness of the model. The
   results indicate that the proposed model performs as well as the more
   advanced models without the need for preprocessing of data, seasonality
   testing, or cycle analysis. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Model surfaces with switchable functionality based on nanopatterned,
   thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) brushes were
   fabricated using interferometric lithography combined with
   surface-initiated polymerization. The temperature-triggered hydration
   and conformational changes of nanopatterned PNIPAAm brushes reversibly
   modulate the spatial concealment and exposure of molecules that are
   immobilized in the intervals between nanopatterned brushes. A biocidal
   quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) was used to demonstrate the utility of
   nanopatterned PNIPAAm brushes to control biointerfacial interactions
   with bacteria. QAS was integrated into polymer-free regions of the
   substrate between nanopatterned PNIPAAm brushes. The biocidal efficacy
   and release properties of these surfaces were tested against Escherichia
   coli K12. Above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of
   PNIPAAm, desolvated, collapsed polymer chains facilitate the attachment
   of bacteria and expose QAS moieties that kill attached bacteria. Upon a
   reduction of the temperature below the LCST, swollen PNIPAAm chains
   promote the release of dead bacteria. These results demonstrate that
   nanopatterned PNIPAAm/QAS hybrid surfaces are model systems that exhibit
   an ability to undergo noncovalent, dynamic, and reversible changes in
   structure that can be used to control the attachment, killing, and
   release of bacteria in response to changes in temperature.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Creasing and wrinkling are different types of instabilities on material
   surfaces characterized by localized singular folds and continuously
   smooth undulation, respectively. While it is known that electric fields
   can induce both types of instabilities in elastomer films bonded on
   substrates, the relation and transition between the field-induced
   instabilities have not been analyzed or understood. We show that the
   surface energy, modulus, and thickness of the elastomer determine the
   types, critical fields, and wavelengths of the instabilities. By
   independently varying these parameters of elastomers under electric
   fields, our experiments demonstrate transitions between creases with
   short wavelengths and wrinkles with long wavelengths. We further develop
   a unified theoretical model that accounts for both creasing and
   wrinkling instabilities induced by electric fields and predicts their
   transitions. The experimental data agree well with the theoretical
   model.}},

Title = {{Activation of peripheral nerve fibers by electrical stimulation in the
   sole of the foot}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human nociceptive withdrawal reflexes (NWR) can be evoked by
   electrical stimulation applied to the sole of the foot. However,
   elicitation of NWRs is highly site dependent, and NWRs are especially
   difficult to elicit at the heel. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate potential peripheral mechanisms for any site dependent
   differences in reflex thresholds.
   Results: The first part of the study investigated the neural innervation
   in different sites of the sole of the foot using two different staining
   techniques. 1) Staining for the Na(v)1.7 antigen (small nociceptive
   fibers) and 2) the Sihler whole nerve technique (myelinated part of the
   nerve). No differences in innervation densities were found across the
   sole of the foot using the two staining techniques: Na(v)1.7
   immunochemistry (small nociceptive fibers (1-way ANOVA, NS)) and the
   Sihler's method (myelinated nerve fibers (1-way ANOVA, NS)). However,
   the results indicate that there are no nociceptive intraepidermal nerve
   fibers (IENFs) innervating the heel.
   Secondly, mathematical modeling was used to investigate to what degree
   differences in skin thicknesses affect the activation thresholds of A
   delta and A beta fibers in the sole of the foot. The modeling comprised
   finite element analysis of the volume conduction combined with a passive
   model of the activation of branching cutaneous nerve fibers. The model
   included three different sites in the sole of the foot (forefoot, arch
   and heel) and three different electrode sizes (diameters: 9.1, 12.9, and
   18.3 mm). For each of the 9 combinations of site and electrode size, a
   total of 3000 A beta fibers and 300 A delta fibers was modeled. The
   computer simulation of the effects of skin thicknesses and innervation
   densities on thresholds of modeled A delta and A beta fibers did not
   reveal differences in pain and perception thresholds across the foot
   sole as have been observed experimentally. Instead a lack of IENFs at
   the heel decreased the electrical activation thresholds compared to
   models including IENFs.
   Conclusions: The nerve staining and modeling results do not explain
   differences in NWR thresholds across the sole of the foot which may
   suggest that central mechanisms contribute to variation in NWR
   excitability across the sole of the foot.}},

Title = {{Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells exhibit immature nucleus
   pulposus cell phenotype in a laminin-rich pseudo-three-dimensional
   culture system}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Cell supplementation to the herniated or degenerated
   intervertebral disc (IVD) is a potential strategy to promote tissue
   regeneration and slow disc pathology. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal
   stromal cells (HUCMSCs) - originating from the Wharton's jelly - remain
   an attractive candidate for such endeavors with their ability to
   differentiate into multiple lineages. Previously, mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) have been studied as a potential source for disc tissue
   regeneration. However, no studies have demonstrated that MSCs can
   regenerate matrix with unique characteristics matching that of immature
   nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues of the IVD. In our prior work, immature NP
   cells were found to express specific laminin isoforms and
   laminin-binding receptors that may serve as phenotypic markers for
   evaluating MSC differentiation to NP-like cells. The goal of this study
   is to evaluate these markers and matrix synthesis for HUCMSCs cultured
   in a laminin-rich pseudo-three-dimensional culture system.
   Methods: HUCMSCs were seeded on top of Transwell inserts pre-coated with
   Matrigel (TM), which contained mainly laminin-111. Cells were cultured
   under hypoxia environment with three differentiation conditions: NP
   differentiation media (containing 2.5\% Matrigel (TM) solution to
   provide for a pseudo-three-dimensional laminin culture system) with no
   serum, or the same media supplemented with either insulin-like growth
   factor-1 (IGF-1) or transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Cell
   clustering behavior, matrix production and the expression of NP-specific
   laminin and laminin-receptors were evaluated at days 1, 7, 13 and 21 of
   culture.
   Results: Data show that a pseudo-three-dimensional culture condition
   (laminin-1 rich) promoted HUCMSC differentiation under no serum
   conditions. Starting at day 1, HUCMSCs demonstrated a cell clustering
   morphology similar to that of immature NP cells in situ and that
   observed for primary immature NP cells within the similar laminin-rich
   culture system (prior study). Differentiated HUCMSCs under all
   conditions were found to contain glycosaminoglycan, expressed
   extracellular matrix proteins of collagen II and laminin alpha 5, and
   laminin receptors (integrin alpha 3 and beta 4 subunits). However,
   neither growth factor treatment generated distinct differences in
   NP-like phenotype for HUCMSC as compared with no-serum conditions.
   Conclusions: HUCMSCs have the potential to differentiate into cells
   sharing features with immature NP cells in a laminin-rich culture
   environment and may be useful for IVD cellular therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and unsplit-field higher-order PML formulations using the
   stretched coordinate perfectly matched layer (SC-PML) formulations and
   the bilinear Z-Transform (BZT) method are presented for truncating the

   independent of the material properties of the FDTD computational domain
   and hence can be applied to the modeling of arbitrary media without any
   modification because of the D-B constitutive relations used. The
   higher-order PML has the advantages of both the conventional PML and the
   complex frequency-shifted PML (CFS-PML) in terms of absorbing
   performances. Two 3D FDTD simulations of the metal plate buried in
   dispersive soil space FDTD domains have been carried out to validate
   these formulations. It is shown that the proposed PML formulations with
   the higher-order scheme are efficient in terms of attenuating both the

Title = {{CAPE: An R Package for Combined Analysis of Pleiotropy and Epistasis}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Contemporary genetic studies are revealing the genetic complexity of
   many traits in humans and model organisms. Two hallmarks of this
   complexity are epistasis, meaning gene-gene interaction, and pleiotropy,
   in which one gene affects multiple phenotypes. Understanding the genetic
   architecture of complex traits requires addressing these phenomena, but
   interpreting the biological significance of epistasis and pleiotropy is
   often difficult. While epistasis reveals dependencies between genetic
   variants, it is often unclear how the activity of one variant is
   specifically modifying the other. Epistasis found in one phenotypic
   context may disappear in another context, rendering the genetic
   interaction ambiguous. Pleiotropy can suggest either redundant phenotype
   measures or gene variants that affect multiple biological processes.
   Here we present an R package, R/cape, which addresses these
   interpretation ambiguities by implementing a novel method to generate
   predictive and interpretable genetic networks that influence
   quantitative phenotypes. R/cape integrates information from multiple
   related phenotypes to constrain models of epistasis, thereby enhancing
   the detection of interactions that simultaneously describe all
   phenotypes. The networks inferred by R/cape are readily interpretable in
   terms of directed influences that indicate suppressive and enhancing
   effects of individual genetic variants on other variants, which in turn
   account for the variance in quantitative traits. We demonstrate the
   utility of R/cape by analyzing a mouse backcross, thereby discovering
   novel epistatic interactions influencing phenotypes related to obesity
   and diabetes. R/cape is an easy-to-use, platform-independent R package
   and can be applied to data from both genetic screens and a variety of
   segregating populations including backcrosses, intercrosses, and natural
   populations. The package is freely available under the GPL-3 license at
   http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cape.}},

Abstract = {{The uterine cervix softens, shortens, and dilates throughout pregnancy
   in response to progressive disorganization of its layered collagen
   microstructure. This process is an essential part of normal pregnancy,
   but premature changes are associated with preterm birth. Clinically,
   there are no reliable noninvasive methods to objectively measure
   cervical softening or assess cervical microstructure. The goal of these
   preliminary studies was to evaluate the feasibility of using an
   intracavity ultrasound array to generate acoustic radiation force
   impulse (ARFI) excitations in the uterine cervix through simulation, and
   to optimize the acoustic radiation force (ARF) excitation for shear wave
   elasticity imaging (SWEI) of the tissue stiffness. The cervix is a
   unique soft tissue target for SWEI because it has significantly greater
   acoustic attenuation (alpha = 1.3 to 2.0 dB.cm(-1).MHz(-1)) than other
   soft tissues, and the pathology being studied tends to lead to an
   increase in tissue compliance, with healthy cervix being relatively
   stiff compared with other soft tissues (E approximate to 25 kPa).
   Additionally, the cervix can only be accessed in vivo using a
   transvaginal or catheter-based array, which places additional
   constraints on the excitation focal characteristics that can be used
   during SWEI. Finite element method (FEM) models of SWEI show that
   larger-aperture, catheter-based arrays can utilize excitation
   frequencies up to 7 MHz to generate adequate focal gain up to focal
   depths 10 to 15 mm deep, with higher frequencies suffering from
   excessive amounts of near-field acoustic attenuation. Using
   full-aperture excitations can yield similar to 40\% increases in
   ARFI-induced displacements, but also restricts the depth of field of the
   excitation to similar to 0.5 mm, compared with 2 to 6 mm, which limits
   the range that can be used for shear wave characterization of the
   tissue. The center-frequency content of the shear wave particle velocity
   profiles ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 kHz, depending on the focal
   configuration and the stiffness of the material being imaged. Overall,
   SWEI is possible using catheter-based imaging arrays to generate
   adequate displacements in cervical tissue for shear wave imaging,
   although specific considerations must be made when optimizing these
   arrays for this shear wave imaging application.}},

Abstract = {{Much is known about the immediate and predictive antecedents of smoking
   lapse, which include situations (e. g., presence of other smokers),
   activities (e. g., alcohol consumption), and contexts (e. g., outside).
   This commentary suggests smartphone-based systems could be used to infer
   these predictive antecedents in real time and provide the smoker with
   just-in-time intervention. The smartphone of today is equipped with an
   array of sensors, including GPS, cameras, light sensors, barometers,
   accelerometers, and so forth, that provide information regarding
   physical location, human movement, ambient sounds, and visual imagery.
   We propose that libraries of algorithms to infer these antecedents can
   be developed and then incorporated into diverse mobile research and
   personalized treatment applications. While a number of challenges to the
   development and implementation of such applications are recognized, our
   field benefits from a database of known antecedents to a problem
   behavior, and further research and development in this exciting area are
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Perchlorate (CIO4-) is a contaminant of concern in groundwater and
   drinking water. In the presence of a suitable electron donor,
   perchlorate can be reduced to non-toxic chloride via either biotic or
   abiotic mechanisms. The objective of this study was to evaluate a
   variety of amendments (Emulsified Oil Substrate (EOS (R) 598), EHC (R)
   and a compost/mulch mixture) and supplemental nutrients to stimulate
   in-situ perchlorate bioremediation. Both laboratory microcosm and column
   experiments were conducted with groundwater from a contaminated site
   that had an initial perchlorate concentration of about 500 mu g/L.
   Complete perchlorate removal was observed within 5-12 days in all the
   microcosms. The addition of 1 g/L (NH4)(2)HPO4 as nutrient increased the
   reduction rate of perchlorate in EOS and compost/mulch microcosms, but
   had no effect in the EHC amended microcosms. Two different flowthrough
   experiments were conducted. Phase 1 used two parallel columns packed
   with EOS-amended compost/mulch/gravel media and EHC-amended
   compost/mulch/gravel media, while in Phase 2, a series of varying length
   columns ranging from 0.15 m to 0.60 m were packed with EOS-amended soil
   and EHC-amended soil. No perchlorate was detected in the effluent of
   both EOS- and EHC-amended compost/mulch/gravel columns after 20 days. In
   Phase 2, no significant treatment difference was observed between the
   EOS- and EHC-amended soil columns. Complete perchlorate removal was
   observed after 6 to 11 days in all different length columns when they
   were operated at a hydraulic loading rate of 0.15 m(3)/m(2)-d.
   Perchlorate removal was completely lost in all the columns when the
   hydraulic loading rate was increased to 0.60 m(3)/m(2)-d. Nitrate
   competed with perchlorate for electrons, and was a preferred acceptor
   over perchlorate. Overall, based on the results of this study, the two
   commercial amendments can be considered as effective means for
   perchlorate bioremediation, although EHC had a shorter period of
   effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Imaging Microscopic Pigment Chemistry in Conjunctival Melanocytic

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To report the application of a novel imaging technique,
   pump-probe microscopy, to analyze patterns of pigment chemistry of
   conjunctival melanocytic lesion biopsies.
   METHODS. Histopathologic specimens of eight previously excised
   conjunctival melanocytic lesions were analyzed with pump-probe
   microscopy. The technique uses a laser scanning microscope with a
   two-color pulsed laser source to distinguish hemoglobin, eumelanin, and
   pheomelanin pigment based on differences in transient excited state and
   ground state photodynamics. The pump-probe signatures of conjunctival
   melanins were compared with cutaneous melanins. The distributions of
   hemoglobin, eumelanin, and pheomelanin were analyzed, and pump-probe
   images were correlated with adjacent hematoxylin and eosin
   (H\&E)-stained sections.
   RESULTS. The pump-probe signatures of conjunctival melanins are similar,
   but not identical to cutaneous melanins. In addition, there are
   qualitative and quantitative differences in the structure and pigment
   chemistry of conjunctival benign nevi, primary acquired melanosis of the
   conjunctiva (PAM), and conjunctival melanomas. The pump-probe images
   correlated well with histopathologic features observed in the adjacent
   H\&E-stained sections, and provided a label-free means of discerning
   conjunctival anatomic features and pathologic benign or malignant
   tissue.
   CONCLUSIONS. Pump-probe laser microscopy shows promise as an adjuvant
   diagnostic tool in evaluation of ocular melanocytic lesions based on
   morphologic correlation with the histopathology results and pigment
   chemistry. This initial study suggests systematic differences in
   pigmentation patterns among conjunctival benign nevi, primary acquired
   melanosis, and melanomas. In addition, pump-probe microscopy has the
   potential for use as a noninvasive ``in vivo{''} optical biopsy
   technique to aid clinical and surgical management of conjunctival
   melanocytic lesions.}},

   gradients in bacteria}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Diverse mechanisms have been proposed to explain biological pattern
   formation. Regardless of their specific molecular interactions, the
   majority of these mechanisms require morphogen gradients as the spatial
   cue, which are either predefined or generated as a part of the
   patterning process. However, using Escherichia coli programmed by a
   synthetic gene circuit, we demonstrate here the generation of robust,
   self- organized ring patterns of gene expression in the absence of an
   apparent morphogen gradient. Instead of being a spatial cue, the
   morphogen serves as a timing cue to trigger the formation and
   maintenance of the ring patterns. The timing mechanism enables the
   system to sense the domain size of the environment and generate patterns
   that scale accordingly. Our work defines a novel mechanism of pattern
   formation that has implications for understanding natural developmental
   processes.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Within the diabatic atmospheric surface layer (ASL) under
   quasi-stationary and horizontal homogeneous conditions, the mean
   velocity profile deviates from its conventional logarithmic shape by a
   height-dependent universal stability correction function phi(m)(zeta)
   that varies with the stability parameter zeta. The zeta parameter
   measures the relative importance of mechanical to buoyant production or
   destruction of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) within the ASL. A link
   between phi(m)(zeta) and the spectrum of turbulence in the ASL was
   recently proposed by Katul et al. {[}{''}Mean velocity profile in a
   sheared and thermally stratified atmospheric boundary layer,{''} Phys.
   Rev. Lett. 107, 268502 (2011)]. By accounting for the
   stability-dependence of TKE production, Katul et al. were able to
   recover scalings for phi(m) with the anticipated power-law exponents for
   free convective, slightly unstable, and stable conditions. To obtain
   coefficients for the phi(m)(zeta) curve in good agreement with empirical
   formulas, they introduced a correction for the variation of the integral
   lengthscale of vertical velocity with zeta estimated from the Kansas
   experiment. In the current work, the link between the coefficients in
   empirical curves for fm phi(m)(zeta) and stability-dependent properties
   of turbulence in the ASL, including the variation with zeta of the
   integral lengthscale and the anisotropy of momentum transporting eddies
   is investigated using data from the Advection Horizontal Array
   Turbulence Study. The theoretical framework presented by Katul et al. is
   revised to account explicitly for these effects. It is found that the
   coefficients in the phi(m)(zeta) curve for unstable and near-neutral
   conditions can be explained by accounting for the stability-dependence
   of the integral lengthscale and anisotropy of momentum-transporting
   eddies; however, an explanation for the observed phi(m)(zeta) curve for
   stable conditions remains elusive. The effect of buoyancy on the
   horizontal and vertical integral lengthscales is also analyzed in
   detail. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy skeletal muscle has a remarkable capacity for regeneration. Even
   at a mature age, muscle tissue can undergo a robust rebuilding process
   that involves the formation of new muscle cells and extracellular matrix
   and the re-establishment of vascular and neural networks. Understanding
   and reverse-engineering components of this process is essential for our
   ability to restore loss of muscle mass and function in cases where the
   natural ability of muscle for self-repair is exhausted or impaired. In
   this article, we will describe current approaches to restore the
   function of diseased or injured muscle through combined use of myogenic
   stem cells, biomaterials, and functional tissue-engineered muscle.
   Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for expanding the future use
   of human cell sources toward the development of cell-based clinical

Abstract = {{The horizontal and vertical motions of a nonlinear spherical buoy,
   excited by synthetic ocean waves within a wave flume, is numerically and
   experimentally investigated. First, fluid motion in the wave tank is
   described using Airy's theory, and the forces on the buoy are determined
   using a modified form of Morison's equation. The system is then studied
   statically in order to determine the effects of varying system
   parameters. Numerical simulations then use the governing equations to
   compare predicted motions with experimentally observed behavior.
   Additionally, a commonly used linear formulation is shown to be
   insufficient in predicting buoy motion, while the nonlinear formulation
   presented is shown to be accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding photosynthesis and plant water management as a coupled
   process remains an open scientific problem. Current eco-hydrologic
   models characteristically describe plant photosynthetic and hydraulic
   processes through ad hoc empirical parameterizations with no explicit
   accounting for the main pathways over which carbon and water uptake
   interact. Here, a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum model is proposed that
   mechanistically couples photosynthesis and transpiration rates,
   including the main leaf physiological controls exerted by stomata. The
   proposed approach links the soil-to-leaf hydraulic transport to stomatal
   regulation, and closes the coupled photosynthesis-transpiration problem
   by maximizing leaf carbon gain subject to a water loss constraint. The
   approach is evaluated against field data from a grass site and is shown
   to reproduce the main features of soil moisture dynamics and hydraulic
   redistribution. In particular, it is shown that the differential soil
   drying produced by diurnal root water uptake drives a significant upward
   redistribution of moisture both through a conventional Darcian flow and
   through the root system, consistent with observations. In a numerical
   soil drying experiment, it is demonstrated that more than 50\% of
   diurnal transpiration is supplied by nocturnal upward water
   redistribution, and some 12\% is provided directly through root
   hydraulic redistribution. For a prescribed leaf area density, the model
   is then used to diagnose how elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and
   increased air temperature jointly impact soil moisture, transpiration,
   photosynthesis, and whole-plant water use efficiency, along with
   compensatory mechanisms such as hydraulic lift using several canonical
   forms of root-density distribution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The incidence of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has
   increased substantially in recent military conflicts. However, the
   consequences of bTBI on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a specialized
   cerebrovascular structure essential for brain homeostasis, remain
   unknown. In this study, we utilized a shock tube driven by compressed
   gas to generate operationally relevant, ideal pressure profiles
   consistent with improvised explosive devices (IEDs). By multiple
   measures, the barrier function of an in vitro BBB model was disrupted
   following exposure to a range of controlled blast loading conditions.
   Trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) decreased acutely in a
   dose-dependent manner that was most strongly correlated with impulse, as
   opposed to peak overpressure or duration. Significantly increased
   hydraulic conductivity and solute permeability post-injury further
   confirmed acute alterations in barrier function. Compromised ZO-1
   immunostaining identified a structural basis for BBB breakdown. After
   blast exposure, TEER remained significantly depressed 2 days
   post-injury, followed by spontaneous recovery to pre-injury control
   levels at day 3. This study is the first to report immediate disruption
   of an in vitro BBB model following primary blast exposure, which may be
   important for the development of novel helmet designs to help mitigate
   the effects of blast on the BBB.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the optical scattering from a variety of axially symmetric
   plasmonic nanoparticle dimers separated by nanoscale gaps, quantifying
   the role of classical nonlocality on their optical properties. Due to
   the rotational symmetry of the analyzed structures, a high degree of
   accuracy is achieved using a computational approach termed 2.5D
   modeling, in which a small number of simulations on a two-dimensional
   domain can replace a memory-and time-intensive simulation on a
   three-dimensional domain. We find that scattered light from dimers
   consisting of nanoparticles with flat surfaces, such as nanodisks,
   exhibits pronounced spectral shifts due to the nonlocality of the
   electron fluid; these significant shifts persist even at relatively
   large (>1 nm) gap dimensions, where quantum tunneling effects are
   believed to be negligible. The 2.5D modeling technique accurately
   incorporates all responses due to any nonaxially symmetric eigenmodes of
   the system, such as dipolar and quadrupolar modes, thereby providing a
   complete characterization of the system for any excitation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Characterizing the spatial variability of topography is essential when
   modeling landscape processes such as surface energy and water balances,
   and landslide and avalanche risk, to name a few. A probabilistic
   representation of topographic features is a parsimonious alternative to
   the more detailed but computationally demanding descriptions. In this
   work, an analytical expression for the theoretical distribution of
   topographic aspect is obtained that is based on the statistical
   parameters of the topographic elevation gradients, that is, the mean,
   standard deviation, and correlation coefficient. For this expression, an
   elliptically symmetric distribution of elevation gradients is assumed,
   and this assumption is validated with the resulting theoretical
   distribution of aspect using the data of six case studies in the
   continental United States with different geology, elevation range,
   climate, and vegetation. The comparison shows that the theoretical
   distribution of aspect is a suitable description for the observed
   distribution of aspect on a regional scale. Consequently, the
   theoretical expression for the distribution of aspect could be a useful
   tool in models that rely on aspect for the accuracy of surface energy
   and water balances, and other relevant processes.}},

Abstract = {{During the spring of 2010, NASA Goddard's COMMIT ground-based mobile
   laboratory was stationed on Dongsha Island off the southwest coast of
   Taiwan, in preparation for the upcoming 2012 7-SEAS field campaign. The
   measurement period offered a unique opportunity for conducting detailed
   investigations of the optical properties of aerosols associated with
   different air mass regimes including background maritime and those
   contaminated by anthropogenic air pollution and mineral dust. What
   appears to be the first time for this region, a shortwave optical
   closure experiment (lambda = 550 nm) for both scattering and absorption
   was attempted over a 12-day period during which aerosols exhibited the
   most change. Constraints to the optical model included combined SMPS and
   APS number concentration data for a continuum of fine and coarse-mode
   particle sizes up to PM2.5. We also take advantage of an IMPROVE
   chemical sampler to help constrain aerosol composition and mass
   partitioning of key elemental species including sea-salt, particulate
   organic matter, soil, non sea-salt sulfate, nitrate, and elemental
   carbon. Achieving full optical closure is hampered by limitations in
   accounting for the role of water vapor in the system, uncertainties in
   the instruments and the need for further knowledge in the source
   apportionment of the model's major chemical components. Nonetheless, our
   results demonstrate that the observed aerosol scattering and absorption
   for these diverse air masses are reasonably captured by the model, where
   peak aerosol events and transitions between key aerosols types are
   evident. Signatures of heavy polluted aerosol composed mostly of
   ammonium and non sea-salt sulfate mixed with some dust with transitions
   to background sea-salt conditions are apparent in the absorption data,
   which is particularly reassuring owing to the large variability in the
   imaginary component of the refractive indices. Consistency between the
   measured and modeled optical parameters serves as an important link for
   advancing remote sensing and climate research studies in dynamic
   aerosol-rich environments like Dongsha. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The transcription factor E2F1 is a key regulator of proliferation and
   apoptosis but the molecular mechanisms that mediate these cell fate
   decisions remain unclear. Here, we identify FOXO transcription factors
   as E2F1 target genes that act in a feed-forward regulatory loop to
   reinforce gene induction of multiple apoptotic genes. We found that E2F1
   forms a complex with FOXO1 and FOXO3. RNAi-mediated silencing of FOXO
   impaired E2F1 binding to the promoters of cooperative target genes. A
   FOXO3 mutant insensitive to inactivation by survival kinases rescued the
   inhibitory effect of growth factor signaling on E2F1-mediated
   transcription and apoptosis. The E2F1/FOXO axis is frequently blocked in
   cancer, as evidenced by the specific downregulation of the
   FOXO-dependent E2F1 transcriptional program in multiple cancer types and
   by the association of a reduced E2F1/FOXO transcriptional program with
   poor prognosis. HDAC and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors
   were identified as specific activators of E2F1/FOXO transcription,
   acting to enhance E2F1-induced apoptosis in a FOXO3-dependent manner.
   Notably, combining the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat with a
   PI3K inhibitor led to enhanced FOXO-dependent apoptosis. Collectively,
   our results identify E2F1/FOXO cooperation as a regulatory mechanism
   that places E2F1 apoptotic activity under the control of survival
   signaling. Therapeutic reactivation of this tumor suppressive mechanism
   may offer a novel broad-acting therapy for cancer. (C) 2013 AACR.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A heat pump that is coupled thermally with the ground extracts heat from
   the soil in winter, and discharges heat in the summer. The coupling is
   made through a buried heat exchanger. In this paper we explore the idea
   of using a single heat exchanger that serves more than one heat pump.
   Each heat pump draws its mass flow rate from the heat exchanger and, in
   addition, a background flow rate circulates permanently through the heat
   exchanger. The places where the heat pumps are connected to the
   exchanger vary. The objective of the design is to select the
   configuration of the multi-component system such that the total enthalpy
   flow rate delivered to the heat pumps is larger and the total pumping
   power is smaller. The paper documents the effect of geometry (the
   connections) and the relative sizes (mass flow rates of heat pumps) on
   the total enthalpy flow rate. The paper shows the parametric domain in
   which the design with a single heat exchanger is superior in comparison
   with the classical design where each heat pump is connected to its own
   heat exchanger. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The inference, or `reverse-engineering', of gene regulatory
   networks from expression data and the description of the complex
   dependency structures among genes are open issues in modern molecular
   biology.
   Results: In this paper we compared three regularized methods of
   covariance selection for the inference of gene regulatory networks,
   developed to circumvent the problems raising when the number of
   observations n is smaller than the number of genes p. The examined
   approaches provided three alternative estimates of the inverse
   covariance matrix: (a) the `PINV' method is based on the Moore-Penrose
   pseudoinverse, (b) the `RCM' method performs correlation between
   regression residuals and (c) `l(2C)' method maximizes a properly
   regularized log-likelihood function. Our extensive simulation studies
   showed that l(2C) outperformed the other two methods having the most
   predictive partial correlation estimates and the highest values of
   sensitivity to infer conditional dependencies between genes even when a
   few number of observations was available. The application of this method
   for inferring gene networks of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways in
   Arabidopsis thaliana allowed to enlighten a negative partial correlation
   coefficient between the two hubs in the two isoprenoid pathways and,
   more importantly, provided an evidence of cross-talk between genes in
   the plastidial and the cytosolic pathways. When applied to gene
   expression data relative to a signature of HRAS oncogene in human cell
   cultures, the method revealed 9 genes (p-value < 0.0005) directly
   interacting with HRAS, sharing the same Ras-responsive binding site for
   the transcription factor RREB1. This result suggests that the
   transcriptional activation of these genes is mediated by a common
   transcription factor downstream of Ras signaling. Availability: Software

Abstract = {{Background. Because effective prediction of survival time can be highly
   beneficial for the treatment of glioblastoma patients, the relationship
   between survival time and multiple patient characteristics has been
   investigated. In this paper, we investigate whether the predictive power
   of a survival model based on clinical patient features improves when MRI
   features are also included in the model.
   Methods. The subjects in this study were 82 glioblastoma patients for
   whom clinical features as well as MR imaging exams were made available
   by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
   Twenty-six imaging features in the available MR scans were assessed by
   radiologists from the TCGA Glioma Phenotype Research Group. We used
   multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression to construct 2 survival
   models: one that used 3 clinical features (age, gender, and KPS) as the
   covariates and 1 that used both the imaging features and the clinical
   features as the covariates. Then, we used 2 measures to compare the
   predictive performance of these 2 models: area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve for the 1-year survival threshold and
   overall concordance index. To eliminate any positive performance
   estimation bias, we used leave-one-out cross-validation.
   Results. The performance of the model based on both clinical and imaging
   features was higher than the performance of the model based on only the
   clinical features, in terms of both area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (P < .01) and the overall concordance index (P <
   .01).
   Conclusions. Imaging features assessed using a controlled lexicon have
   additional predictive value compared with clinical features when
   predicting survival time in glioblastoma patients.}},

Abstract = {{A streamfunction-vorticity formulation is used to explore the extent to
   which turbulent and turbulently inviscid solutions to the mean momentum
   balance explain the mean flow across forest edges and within cavities
   situated inside dense forested canopies. The turbulent solution is based
   on the mean momentum balance where first-order closure principles are
   used to model turbulent stresses. The turbulently inviscid solution
   retains all the key terms in the mean momentum balance but for the
   turbulent stress gradients. Both exit and entry versions of the forest
   edge problem are explored. The turbulent solution is found to describe
   sufficiently the bulk spatial patterns of the mean flow near the edge
   including signatures of different length scales reported in canopy
   transition studies. Next, the `clearing inside canopy' or the so-called
   `cavity' problem is solved for the inviscid and turbulent solutions and
   then compared against flume experiments. The inviscid solution describes
   the bulk flow dynamics in much of the zones within the cavity. In
   particular, the solution can capture the correct position of the bulk
   recirculation zone within the cavity, although with a weaker magnitude.
   The inviscid solution cannot capture the large vertical heterogeneity in
   the mean velocity above the canopy, as expected. These features are
   better captured via the first-order closure representation of the
   turbulent solution. Given the ability of this vorticity formulation to
   capture the mean pressure variations and the mean advective acceleration
   terms, it is ideal for exploring the distributions of scalars and
   roughness-induced flow adjustments on complex topography.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Vesicle fusion has long provided an easy and reliable method to form
   supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) from simple, zwitterionic vesicles on
   siliceous substrates. However, for complex compositions, such as
   vesicles with high cholesterol content and multiple lipid types, the
   energy barrier for the vesicle-to-bilayer transition is increased or the
   required vesicle-vesicle and vesicle-substrate interactions are
   insufficient for vesicle fusion. Thus, for vesicle compositions that
   more accurately mimic native membranes, vesicle fusion often fails to
   form SLBs. In this paper, we review three approaches to overcome these
   barriers to form complex, biomimetic SLBs via vesicle fusion: (i)
   optimization of experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, buffer ionic
   strength, osmotic stress, cation valency, and buffer pH), (ii)
   alpha-helical (All) peptide-induced vesicle fusion, and (iii) bilayer
   edge-induced vesicle fusion. AH peptide-induced vesicle fusion can form
   complex SLBs on multiple substrate types without the use of additional
   equipment. Bilayer edge-induced vesicle fusion uses microfluidics to
   form SLBs from vesicles with complex composition, including vesicles
   derived from native cell membranes. Collectively, this review introduces
   vesicle fusion techniques that can be generalized for many biomimetic
   vesicle compositions and many substrate types, and thus will aid efforts
   to reliably create complex SLB platforms on a range of substrates. (C)

Abstract = {{Short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging is a novel beamforming
   technique that reduces acoustic clutter in ultrasound images. A clinical
   study was conducted to investigate clutter reduction and endocardial
   border detection in cardiac SLSC images. Individual channel echo data
   were acquired from the left ventricle of 14 volunteers, after informed
   consent and institutional review board approval. Paired B-mode and SLSC
   images were created from these data. Contrast, contrast-to-noise, and
   signal-to-noise ratios were measured in paired images, and these metrics
   were improved with SLSC imaging in most cases. Three cardiology fellows
   rated the visibility of endocardial segments in randomly ordered B-mode
   and SLSC cine loops. SLSC imaging offered 22\%-33\% improvement (p <
   0.05) in endocardial border visibility when B-mode image quality was
   poor (i.e., 80\% or more of the endocardial segments could not be
   visualized by the three reviewers). The percentage of volunteers with
   poor-quality images was decreased from 21\% to 7\% with the SLSC
   beamformer. Results suggest that SLSC imaging has the potential to
   improve clinical cardiac assessments that are challenged by clutter.

Abstract = {{Endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from endothelial progenitor cells in
   blood have great potential as a therapeutic tool to promote
   vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and treat cardiovascular diseases.
   However, current methods to isolate ECs are limited by a low yield with
   few colonies appearing during isolation. In order to utilize
   blood-derived ECs for therapeutic applications, a simple method is
   needed that can produce a high yield of ECs from small volumes of blood
   without the addition of animal-derived products. For the first time, we
   show that human ECs can be isolated without the prior separation of
   blood components through the technique of diluted whole blood incubation
   (DWBI) utilizing commercially available human serum. We isolated ECs
   from small volumes of blood (similar to 10 mL) via DWBI and
   characterized them with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and uptake
   of DiI-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein (DiI-Ac-LDL). These
   ECs are functional as demonstrated by their ability to form tubular
   networks in Matrigel, adhere and align with flow under physiological
   fluid shear stress, and produce increased nitric oxide under fluid flow.
   An average of 7.0 +/- A 2.5 EC colonies that passed all functional tests
   described above were obtained per 10 mL of blood as compared to only 0.3
   +/- A 0.1 colonies with the traditional method based on density
   centrifugation. The time until first colony appearance was 8.3 +/- A 1.2
   days for ECs isolated with the DWBI method and 12 +/- A 1.4 days for ECs
   isolated with the traditional isolation method. A simplified method,
   such as DWBI, in combination with advances in isolation yield could
   enable the use of blood-derived ECs in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the boundary element method (BEM) based on the elasticity
   theory is developed for two-dimensional (2-D) thin-structural problems
   with thickness-to-length ratio in the micro (10(-6)) or nano (10(-9))
   scales. An efficient non-linear co-ordinate transformation, based on the
   sinh function, is developed to deal with the troublesome nearly-singular
   integrals arising in the BEM formulation for thin structures. The
   proposed BEM formulation with thin-body capabilities is also extended to
   the multi-domain problems and applied to the stress analysis of
   multilayered coating systems. Promising BEM results with only a small
   number of elements are obtained for thin films and coatings with the
   thickness-to-length ratio is as small as 10(-9), which is sufficient for
   modeling most thin layered coating systems as used in smart materials
   and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The advantages, disadvantages and
   potential applications of the proposed method, as compared with the
   finite element method (FEM), are discussed in the last section. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the human intervertebral disc is rich
   in molecules that interact with cells through integrin-mediated
   attachments. Porcine nucleus pulposus (NP) cells have been shown to
   interact with laminin (LM) isoforms LM-111 and LM-511 through select
   integrins that regulate biosynthesis and cell attachment. Since human NP
   cells lose many phenotypic characteristics with age, attachment and
   interaction with the ECM may be altered. Expression of LM-binding
   integrins was quantified for human NP cells using flow cytometry. The
   cell-ECM attachment mechanism was determined by quantifying cell
   attachment to LM-111, LM-511, or type II collagen after functionally
   blocking specific integrin subunits. Human NP cells express integrins 1,
   3, and 5, with over 70\% of cells positive for each subunit. Blocking
   subunit 1 inhibited NP cell attachment to all substrates. Blocking
   subunits 1, 2, 3, and 5 simultaneously, but not individually, inhibits
   NP cell attachment to laminins. While integrin 61 mediated porcine NP
   cell attachment to LM-111, we found integrins 3, 5, and 1 instead
   contributed to human NP cell attachment. These findings identify
   integrin subunits that may mediate interactions with the ECM for human
   NP cells and could be used to promote cell attachment, survival, and
   biosynthesis in cell-based therapeutics. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{Cell delivery to the pathological intervertebral disc (IVD) has
   significant therapeutic potential for enhancing IVD regeneration. The
   development of injectable biomaterials that retain delivered cells,
   promote cell survival, and maintain or promote an NP cell phenotype in
   vivo remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have demonstrated
   NP cell - laminin interactions in the nucleus pulposus (NP) region of
   the IVD that promote cell attachment and biosynthesis. These findings
   suggest that incorporating laminin ligands into carriers for cell
   delivery may be beneficial for promoting NP cell survival and phenotype.
   Here, an injectable, laminin-111 functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)
   (PEG-LM111) hydrogel was developed as a biomaterial carrier for cell
   delivery to the IVD. We evaluated the mechanical properties of the
   PEG-LM111 hydrogel, and its ability to retain delivered cells in the IVD
   space. Gelation occurred in approximately 20 min without an initiator,
   with dynamic shear moduli in the range of 0.9-1.4 kPa. Primary NP cell
   retention in cultured IVD explants was significantly higher over 14 days
   when cells were delivered within a PEG-LM111 carrier, as compared to
   cells in liquid suspension. Together, these results suggest this
   injectable laminin-functionalized biomaterial may be an easy to use
   carrier for delivering cells to the IVD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Developments in the field of bispecific antibodies have progressed
   rapidly in recent years, particularly in their potential role for the
   treatment of malignant disease. However, manufacturing stable molecules
   has proven to be costly and time-consuming, which in turn has hampered
   certain aspects of preclinical evaluation including the unavailability
   of appropriate ``negative{''} controls. Bispecific molecules (e.g.,
   bispecific tandem scFv) exhibit two specificities, often against a tumor
   antigen as well as an immune-activation ligand such as CD3. While for
   IgG antibodies, isotype-matched controls are well accepted, when
   considering smaller antibody fragments it is not possible to adequately
   control for their biological activity through the use of archetypal
   isotypes, which differ dramatically in affinity, size, structure, and
   design. Here, we demonstrate a method for the rapid production of
   negative control tandem scFvs through complementarity determining region
   (CDR) mutagenesis, using a recently described bispecific T-cell engager
   (BiTE) targeting a tumor-specific mutation of the epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFRvIII) as an example. Four independent control
   constructs were developed by this method through alteration of residues
   spanning individual CDR domains. Importantly, while target antigen
   affinity was completely impaired, CD3 binding affinity was conserved in
   each molecule. These results have a potential to enhance the
   sophistication by which bispecific antibodies can be evaluated in the
   preclinical setting and may have broader applications for an array of
   alternative antibody-derived therapeutic platforms. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We perform optimization studies on the construction of acoustic
   rectifiers, which allow uni-directional propagation of acoustic waves,
   from a periodic array of masses and springs arranged in one- and two-
   dimensions. An acoustic rectifier is achieved by pairing a nonlinear
   material, which can up-convert an input excitation frequency to a higher
   harmonic, with a bandgap material whose dispersion relation has a
   bandgap region for the input frequency range but a bandpass region at
   the higher harmonic. First, we analyze the mass and stiffness parameters
   that lead to acoustic rectification in infinite mass-spring arrays with
   the largest possible range of working frequencies. A combination of
   analytical techniques, numerical simulations, and particle swarm
   optimization is used to identify the optimal acoustic rectifier. Next,
   we study the practical working range of acoustic rectifiers of finite
   size and examine how the rectification properties change as a function
   of the lattice size and damping. Finally, we perform numerical
   simulations of an acoustic rectification device in which a Duffing
   oscillator is attached to the end of a tri-atomic mass-spring chain. (C)

   substrates like sapphire, from which the potential of each metal for
   plasmonic applications may be ascertained. The ultraviolet plasmonic

   compared with the well-known behavior of gold and silver in the visible.
   After exploring this behavior for each metal as a function of
   nanoparticle shape and size, the deleterious effect caused by the
   metal's native oxide is considered, and the potential for applications

Title = {{Differentiation of Mouse Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) into
   Nucleus Pulposus-Like Cells In Vitro}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{A large percentage of the population may be expected to experience
   painful symptoms or disability associated with intervertebral disc (IVD)
   degeneration - a condition characterized by diminished integrity of
   tissue components. Great interest exists in the use of autologous or
   allogeneic cells delivered to the degenerated IVD to promote matrix
   regeneration. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from a
   patient's own somatic cells, have demonstrated their capacity to
   differentiate into various cell types although their potential to
   differentiate into an IVD cell has not yet been demonstrated. The
   overall objective of this study was to assess the possibility of
   generating iPSC-derived nucleus pulposus (NP) cells in a mouse model, a
   cell population that is entirely derived from notochord. This study
   employed magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) to isolate a CD24(+)
   iPSC subpopulation. Notochordal cell-related gene expression was
   analyzed in this CD24(+) cell fraction via real time RT-PCR. CD24(+)
   iPSCs were then cultured in a laminin-rich culture system for up to 28
   days, and the mouse NP phenotype was assessed by immunostaining. This
   study also focused on producing a more conducive environment for NP
   differentiation of mouse iPSCs with addition of low oxygen tension and
   notochordal cell conditioned medium (NCCM) to the culture platform.
   iPSCs were evaluated for an ability to adopt an NP-like phenotype
   through a combination of immunostaining and biochemical assays. Results
   demonstrated that a CD24(+) fraction of mouse iPSCs could be retrieved
   and differentiated into a population that could synthesize matrix
   components similar to that in native NP. Likewise, the addition of a
   hypoxic environment and NCCM induced a similar phenotypic result. In
   conclusion, this study suggests that mouse iPSCs have the potential to
   differentiate into NP-like cells and suggests the possibility that they
   may be used as a novel cell source for cellular therapy in the IVD.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitors of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) have demonstrated an unusual
   selectivity for tumor cells despite its ubiquitous expression. This
   phenomenon has remained unexplained, but could be influenced by
   ectopically expressed Hsp90 in tumors. In this work, we synthesized
   Hsp90 inhibitors that can carry optical or radioiodinated probes via a
   polyethylene-glycol tether. We show that these tethered inhibitors
   selectively recognize cells expressing ectopic Hsp90 and become
   internalized. The internalization process is blocked by Hsp90
   antibodies, suggesting that active cycling of the protein occurs at the
   plasma membrane. In mice, we observed exquisite accumulation of the
   fluor-tethered versions within breast tumors at very sensitive levels.
   Cell-based assays with the radiolabeled version showed picomolar
   detection in cells that express ectopic Hsp90. Our findings show that
   fluor-tethered or radiolabeled inhibitors that target ectopic Hsp90 can
   be used to detect breast cancer malignancies through noninvasive
   imaging.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Node-Inhomogeneity Effects on the Functional Brain Network
   Properties Using an Anatomy-Constrained Hierarchical Brain Parcellation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{To investigate functional brain networks, many graph-theoretical studies
   have defined nodes in a graph using an anatomical atlas with about a
   hundred partitions. Although use of anatomical node definition is
   popular due to its convenience, functional inhomogeneity within each
   node may lead to bias or systematic errors in the graph analysis. The
   current study was aimed to show functional inhomogeneity of a node
   defined by an anatomical atlas and to show its effects on the graph
   topology. For this purpose, we compared functional connectivity defined
   using 138 resting state fMRI data among 90 cerebral nodes from the
   automated anatomical labeling (AAL), which is an anatomical atlas, and
   among 372 cerebral nodes defined using a functional connectivity-based
   atlas as a ground truth, which was obtained using anatomy-constrained
   hierarchical modularity optimization algorithm (AHMO) that we proposed
   to evaluate the graph properties for anatomically defined nodes. We
   found that functional inhomogeneity in the anatomical parcellation
   induced significant biases in estimating both functional connectivity
   and graph-theoretical network properties. We also found very high
   linearity in major global network properties and nodal strength at all
   brain regions between anatomical atlas and functional atlas with
   reasonable network-forming thresholds for graph construction. However,
   some nodal properties such as betweenness centrality did not show
   significant linearity in some regions. The current study suggests that
   the use of anatomical atlas may be biased due to its inhomogeneity, but
   may generally be used in most neuroimaging studies when a single atlas
   is used for analysis.}},

Title = {{A Host-Based RT-PCR Gene Expression Signature to Identify Acute

Journal = {{SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{203}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Improved ways to diagnose acute respiratory viral infections could
   decrease inappropriate antibacterial use and serve as a vital triage
   mechanism in the event of a potential viral pandemic. Measurement of the
   host response to infection is an alternative to pathogen-based
   diagnostic testing and may improve diagnostic accuracy. We have
   developed a host-based assay with a reverse transcription polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR) TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) platform for
   classifying respiratory viral infection. We developed the assay using
   two cohorts experimentally infected with influenza A H3N2/Wisconsin or
   influenza A H1N1/Brisbane, and validated the assay in a sample of adults
   presenting to the emergency department with fever (n = 102) and in
   healthy volunteers (n = 41). Peripheral blood RNA samples were obtained
   from individuals who underwent experimental viral challenge or who
   presented to the emergency department and had microbiologically proven
   viral respiratory infection or systemic bacterial infection. The
   selected gene set on the RT-PCR TLDA assay classified participants with
   experimentally induced influenza H3N2 and H1N1 infection with 100 and
   87\% accuracy, respectively. We validated this host gene expression
   signature in a cohort of 102 individuals arriving at the emergency
   department. The sensitivity of the RT-PCR test was 89\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI), 72 to 98\%], and the specificity was 94\%
   (95\% CI, 86 to 99\%). These results show that RT-PCR-based detection of
   a host gene expression signature can classify individuals with
   respiratory viral infection and sets the stage for prospective
   evaluation of this diagnostic approach in a clinical setting.}},

Pages = {{11713-11723}},

Abstract = {{Amyloid-beta peptide (A beta)-membrane interactions have been implicated
   in the formation of toxic oligomers that permeabilize membranes,
   allowing an influx of calcium ions and triggering cell death in the
   pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Curcumin, a small dietary
   polyphenolic molecule, has been shown to reduce A beta-induced toxicity
   and AD pathology. We investigate here the effect of curcumin on A beta
   40-induced toxicity in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and
   test a novel neuroprotection mechanism in which curcumin reduces A
   beta-membrane interactions and attenuates A beta-induced membrane
   disruptions. Predominantly monomeric A beta 40 exerts toxicity toward
   SH-SY5Y cells and has been shown to insert spontaneously into anionic
   lipid monolayers at the air/water interface, resulting in the misfolding
   and assembly of A beta into beta-sheet-enriched oligomers.
   Concomitantly, membrane morphology and lipid packing are disrupted.
   Curcumin dose-dependently ameliorates A beta-induced neurotoxicity and
   reduces either the rate or extent of A beta insertion into anionic lipid
   monolayers. Moreover, curcumin reduces A beta-induced dye leakage from
   lipid-bilayer-covered, dye-loaded, porous silica microspheres. Because
   curcumin neither affects the inherent surface activity of A beta nor
   modifies the membrane properties, it reduces A beta insertion by
   directly attenuating A beta-membrane interactions and reducing A
   beta-induced membrane disruption. Although the exact molecular mechanism
   of curcumin's membrane protective effect remains unclear, this effect
   could in part contribute to curcumin's neuroprotective effect with
   respect to A beta-induced toxicity. Our work reveals a novel molecular
   mechanism by which curcumin reduces A beta-related pathology and
   toxicity and suggests a therapeutic strategy for preventing or treating
   AD by targeting the inhibition of A beta-induced membrane disruption.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse linear array has some advantages over uniform linear array in
   some applications. However, it is well known that sparse array always
   suffers from manifold ambiguity, which has significant influence on
   direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and resolution. In this study, a
   new method based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) for
   resolving manifold ambiguities of uncorrelated sources by using
   semi-circular substrate is proposed for DOA estimation of sparse array.
   Spurious MUSIC peak spectrums are generated because of a linear
   combination of the steering vectors of true DOAs. The main idea of the
   proposed method is to setup one or several semi-circular medium
   substrates at the front of some elements. The phases of these elements
   are changed through the refractive index and the radii of those
   semi-circular substrates. This treatment breaks down the previous
   linearity of the steering vectors for the array without adding the
   substrates. Thus, true DOA peaks can be discriminated according to this
   feature. Simulation results show good performance of the proposed
   method. Trivial and non-trivial ambiguities are efficiently resolved.}},

Abstract = {{The lightning current waveforms observed simultaneously with high-speed
   video records of a column and a carrot sprite event are incorporated in
   a plasma fluid model to provide quantitative explanation of these two
   distinct morphological classes of transient luminous events. We
   calculate the strength of the lightning-induced electric field at sprite
   altitudes using a time integral of the ionization frequency
   integral(t)(0)nu(i)(E/N)dt. For the studied two events, modeling results
   indicate that these integral values never exceed 18 in the lower
   ionosphere, which is the minimum value required for the initiation of
   streamers from single seed electrons according to the Raether-Meek
   criterion. It is therefore suggested that the presence of electron
   inhomogeneities is a necessary condition for the initiation of sprite
   streamers. It is further demonstrated using streamer modeling that a
   minimum value of the integral similar to 10 is necessary to initiate
   upward negative streamers from inhomogeneities, corresponding to a
   minimum charge moment change of similar to 500Ckm under typical
   nighttime conditions. If the integral values in the entire upper
   atmosphere are smaller than similar to 10, only column sprites can be
   produced, dominated by downward positive streamers.}},

Abstract = {{Planar plasmonic devices are becoming attractive for myriad
   applications, owing to their potential compatibility with standard
   microelectronics technology and the capability for densely integrating a
   large variety of plasmonic devices on a chip. Mitigating the challenges
   of using plasmonics in on-chip configurations requires precise control
   over the properties of plasmonic modes, in particular their shape and
   size. Here we achieve this goal by demonstrating a planar plasmonic
   graded-index lens focusing surface plasmons propagating along the
   device. The plasmonic mode is manipulated by carving subwavelength
   features into a dielectric layer positioned on top of a uniform metal
   film, allowing the local effective index of the plasmonic mode to be
   controlled using a single binary lithographic step. Focusing and
   divergence of surface plasmons is demonstrated experimentally. The
   demonstrated approach can be used for manipulating the propagation of
   surface plasmons, e. g., for beam steering, splitting, cloaking, mode
   matching, and beam shaping applications. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Title = {{A single-molecule stretching method for lateral and normal AFM lever
   calibration}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{A novel method for quantitative lateral force measurement (LFM)
   calibration has been developed. Using a single-molecule spectroscopy
   approach it is possible to calibrate the AFM levers for both lateral and
   normal spring constants with a single image scan. Moreover, our method
   does not involve tip modifications. Dextran molecules were chosen for
   testing our calibration procedure due to their characteristic plateau
   feature in the force-elongation curve which enables an easy
   identification of single-molecule stretching events. Using a
   non-standard (tilted) geometry of AFM scanning, it is possible to
   observe different components of the stretching force on both normal and
   lateral force signals. These signals can be further compared to the
   values obtained by standard (normal) spectroscopic measurements. The
   values of the normal spring constant obtained with our method are in
   good agreement with the results obtained from the method exploiting the
   energy equipartition theorem. The statistical analysis shows that the
   approach proposed in our paper gives reproducible results of the lateral
   sensitivity with a relative standard deviation less than 15\%.}},

Title = {{Multicompartmental Pharmacokinetic Model of Tenofovir Delivery by a
   Vaginal Gel}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Trials of a vaginal Tenofovir gel for pre-exposure
   prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV have given conflicting results. Knowledge of
   concentrations of Tenofovir and its active form Tenofovir diphosphate,
   at putative sites of anti-HIV functioning, is central to understanding
   trial outcomes and design of products and dosage regimens. Topical
   Tenofovir delivery to the vaginal environment is complex, multivariate
   and non-linear; determinants relate to drug, vehicle, dosage regimen,
   and environment. Experimental PK methods cannot yield mechanistic
   understanding of this process, and have uncontrolled variability in drug
   sampling. Mechanistic modeling of the process could help delineate its
   determinants, and be a tool in design and interpretation of products and
   trials.
   Methods and Findings: We created a four-compartment mass transport model
   for Tenofovir delivery by a gel: gel, epithelium, stroma, blood.
   Transport was diffusion-driven in vaginal compartments; blood
   concentration was time-varying but homogeneous. Parameters for the model
   derived from in vitro and in vivo PK data, to which model predictions
   gave good agreement. Steep concentration gradients occurred in stroma <=
   8 hours after gel release. Increasing epithelial thickness delayed
   initial TFV delivery to stroma and its decline: t(max) increased but AUC
   at 24 hours was not significantly altered. At 24 and 48 hours, stromal
   concentrations were 6.3\% and 0.2\% of C-max. Concentrations in
   simulated biopsies overestimated stromal concentrations, as much as
   similar to 5X, depending upon time of sampling, biopsy thickness and
   epithelial thickness.
   Conclusions: There was reasonably good agreement of model predictions
   with clinical PK data. Conversion of TFV to TFV-DP was not included, but
   PK data suggest a linear relationship between them. Thus contrasts
   predicted by this model can inform design of gels and dosage regimens in
   clinical trials, and interpretation of PK data. This mass transport
   based approach can be extended to TFV conversion to TFV-DP, and to other
   drugs and dosage forms.}},

Title = {{Residential Mercury Contamination in Adobe Brick Homes in Huancavelica,
   Peru}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{This is the first study of adobe brick contamination anywhere in the
   world. Huancavelica, Peru is the site of historic cinnabar refining and
   one of the most mercury (Hg) contaminated urban areas in the world. Over
   80\% of homes in Huancavelica are constructed with adobe bricks made
   from Hg contaminated soil. In this study we measured total Hg
   concentrations in adobe brick, dirt floor, surface dust, and air samples
   from the interior of 60 adobe brick houses located in four
   neighborhoods. Concentrations of total Hg in adobe bricks, dirt floors,
   and surface dust ranged from 8.00 to 1070 mu g/g, 3.06 to 926 mu g/g,
   and 0.02 to 9.69 mu g/wipe, respectively, with statistically significant
   differences between the four neighborhoods. Concentrations of Hg in
   adobe brick and dirt floor samples in Huancavelica were orders of
   magnitude higher than in Ayacucho, a non-mining town in Peru. A strong
   correlation exists between total Hg concentrations in adobe bricks and
   dirt floors which confirms that adobe bricks were being made on-site and
   not purchased from an off-site source. A strong correlation between
   surface dust and adobe bricks and dirt floors indicates that walls and
   floors serve as indoor sources of Hg contamination. Elemental Hg vapor
   concentrations were below detection (<0.5 mu g/m(3)) in most homes;
   however in homes with detectable levels, concentrations up to 5.1 mu
   g/m3 were observed. No statistically significant differences in Hg vapor
   measurements were observed between neighborhoods. This study
   demonstrates that building materials used widely in developing
   communities, such as adobe bricks, may be a substantial source of
   residential Hg exposure in silver or gold refining communities where Hg
   is produced or used for amalgamation in artisanal gold production.}},

Abstract = {{The brain representation of the body, called the body schema, is
   susceptible to plasticity. For instance, subjects experiencing a rubber
   hand illusion develop a sense of ownership of a mannequin hand when they
   view it being touched while tactile stimuli are simultaneously applied
   to their own hand. Here, the cortical basis of such an embodiment was
   investigated through concurrent recordings from primary somatosensory
   (i.e., S1) and motor (i.e., M1) cortical neuronal ensembles while two
   monkeys observed an avatar arm being touched by a virtual ball.
   Following a period when virtual touches occurred synchronously with
   physical brushes of the monkeys' arms, neurons in S1 and M1 started to
   respond to virtual touches applied alone. Responses to virtual touch
   occurred 50 to 70 ms later than to physical touch, consistent with the
   involvement of polysynaptic pathways linking the visual cortex to S1 and
   M1. We propose that S1 and M1 contribute to the rubber hand illusion and
   that, by taking advantage of plasticity in these areas, patients may
   assimilate neuroprosthetic limbs as parts of their body schema.}},

Title = {{3D element imaging using NSECT for the detection of renal cancer: a
   simulation study in MCNP}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},

Pages = {{5867-5883}},

Abstract = {{This work describes a simulation study investigating the application of
   neutron stimulated emission computed tomography (NSECT) for noninvasive
   3D imaging of renal cancer in vivo. Using MCNP5 simulations, we describe
   a method of diagnosing renal cancer in the body by mapping the 3D
   distribution of elements present in tumors using the NSECT technique. A
   human phantom containing the kidneys and other major organs was modeled
   in MCNP5. The element composition of each organ was based on values
   reported in literature. The two kidneys were modeled to contain elements
   reported in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and healthy kidney tissue.
   Simulated NSECT scans were executed to determine the 3D element
   distribution of the phantom body. Elements specific to RCC and healthy
   kidney tissue were then analyzed to identify the locations of the
   diseased and healthy kidneys and generate tomographic images of the
   tumor. The extent of the RCC lesion inside the kidney was determined
   using 3D volume rendering. A similar procedure was used to generate
   images of each individual organ in the body. Six isotopes were studied
   in this work-S-32, C-12, Na-23, N-14, P-31 and K-39. The results
   demonstrated that through a single NSECT scan performed in vivo, it is
   possible to identify the location of the kidneys and other organs within
   the body, determine the extent of the tumor within the organ, and to
   quantify the differences between cancer and healthy tissue-related
   isotopes with p <= 0.05. All of the images demonstrated appropriate
   concentration changes between the organs, with some discrepancy observed
   in P-31, K-39 and Na-23. The discrepancies were likely due to the low
   concentration of the elements in the tissue that were below the current
   detection sensitivity of the NSECT technique.}},

Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal models are frequently used to model the thermodynamics of
   bacterial attachment to surfaces. The most commonly used of such models
   is that proposed by van Oss, Chaudhury and Good, which includes both
   non-polar and polar (including hydrogen bonding) interactions between
   the attaching bacterium, the attachment substratum and the aqueous
   environment. We use this model to calculate the free energy of adhesion,
   Delta G(adh), for attachment of the marine bacterium Cobetia marina to
   well defined attachment substrata that systematically vary in their
   chemistry and their ability to attach bacteria, namely a series of
   oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) terminated self-assembled monolayers that
   vary in the number of OEG moieties. For this system, the values of Delta
   G(adh) calculated using VCG do not correlate with observed attachment
   profiles. We examine the validity of a number of assumptions inherent in
   VCG and other colloidal models of adhesion, with special attention paid
   to those regarding bacterial surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Chitin is a thermostable biopolymer found in various inorganic-organic
   skeletal structures of numerous invertebrates including sponges
   (Porifera). The occurrence of chitin within calcium-and silica-based
   biominerals in organisms living in extreme natural conditions has
   inspired development of new (extreme biomimetic) synthesis route of
   chitin-based hybrid materials in vitro. Here, we show for the first time
   that 3D-alpha-chitin scaffolds isolated from skeletons of the marine
   sponge Aplysina aerophoba can be effectively mineralized under
   hydrothermal conditions (150 degrees C) using ammonium zirconium(IV)
   carbonate as a precursor of zirconia. Obtained chitin-ZrO2 hybrid
   materials were characterized by FT-IR, SEM, HRTEM, as well as light and
   confocal laser microscopy. We suggest that formation of chitin-ZrO2
   hybrids occurs due to hydrogen bonds between chitin and ZrO2.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To enhance understanding of ethnically diverse
   normal newborn retinal morphology, the authors report spectral-domain
   optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) macular findings in healthy
   Hispanic newborns.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this IRB-approved prospective, observational
   case series, 20 full-term Hispanic newborns had dilated retinal
   examinations and imaging by hand-held SD-OCT without sedation at the
   Duke Birthing Center.
   RESULTS: Of 20 newborns imaged (35\% male; median gestational age: 39
   weeks; range: 36 to 40 weeks), two (10\%) had bilateral subfoveal fluid,
   including one case of bilateral double subretinal fluid pockets. Three
   eyes of two infants (10\%) had retinal macular cystoid structures (one
   enlarged at 1.5 months, with resolution by 3 months). These SD-OCT
   findings were not visible by indirect ophthalmoscopy.
   CONCLUSION: Some Hispanic newborns have subretinal fluid or macular
   cystoid structures on SD-OCT. This study expands our understanding of
   findings seen by SD-OCT in healthy full-term newborns of various races.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out a one year (2002) study of phosphorus (P) loss from soil
   to water in three nested grassland catchments with known P input in
   chemical fertilizer and animal liquid slurry applications. Chemical
   fertilizer was applied to the grasslands between March and September and
   animal slurry was applied over the twelve months. The annual chemical P
   fertilizer applications for the 17 and 211 ha catchments were 16.4 and
   23.7 kg P/ha respectively and the annual slurry applications were 10.7
   and 14.0 kg P/ha, respectively. The annual total phosphorus (TP) export
   in stream-flow was 2.61, 2.48 and 1.61 kg P/ha for the 17, 211 and 1524
   ha catchments, respectively, compared with a maximum permissible (by
   regulation) annual export of ca. 0.35 kg P/ha. The export rate (ratio of
   P export to Pin land applications) was 9.6\% and 6.6\% from the 17 and
   211 ha catchments, respectively. On average, 70\% of stream flow and
   85\% of the P export occurred during the five wet months (October to
   February) indicating that when precipitation is much greater than
   evaporation, the hydrological conditions are most favourable for P
   export. However the soil quality and land use history may vary the
   results. Particulate P made up 22\%, 43\% and 37\% of the TP export at
   the 17, 211 and 1524 ha catchment areas, respectively. As the chemical
   fertilizer was spread during the grass growth months (March to
   September), it has less immediate impact on stream water quality than
   the slurry applications. We also show that as the catchment scale
   increases, the P concentrations and P export decrease, confirming
   dilution due to increasing rural catchment size. In the longer term, the
   excess P from fertilizer maintains high soil P levels, an antecedent
   condition favourable to P loss from soil to water. This study confirms
   the significant negative water quality impact of excess P applications,
   particularly liquid animal slurry applications in wet winter months. The
   findings suggest that restricted P application in wet months can largely
   reduce the P losses from soil to water.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{811-815}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Climate change has altered not only the overall magnitude of rainfall
   but also its seasonal distribution and interannual variability
   worldwide(1-3). Such changes in the rainfall regimes will be most keenly
   felt in arid and semiarid regions(4), where water availability and
   timing are key factors controlling biogeochemical cycles(5), primary
   productivity(6,7), and the phenology of growth and reproduction(8-10),
   while also regulating agricultural production(11). Nevertheless, a
   comprehensive framework to understand the complex seasonal rainfall
   regimes across multiple timescales is still lacking. Here, we formulate
   a global measure of seasonality, which captures the effects of both
   magnitude and concentration of the rainy season, and use it to identify
   regions across the tropics with highly seasonal rainfall regimes. By
   further decomposing rainfall seasonality into its magnitude, timing and
   duration components, we find increases in the interannual variability of
   seasonality over many parts of the dry tropics, implying increasing
   uncertainty in the intensity, arrival and duration of seasonal rainfall
   over the past century. We show that such increases in rainfall
   variability were accompanied by shifts in its seasonal magnitude, timing
   and duration, thus underscoring the importance of analysing seasonal
   rainfall regimes in a context that is most relevant to local ecological
   and social processes.}},

Abstract = {{Connections are explored between spectral descriptions of turbulence and
   the mean velocity profile in the equilibrium layer of wall-bounded flows
   using a modeled budget for the co-spectral density. Using a standard
   model for the wall normal velocity variance and a Rotta-like
   return-to-isotropy closure for the pressure-strain effects, the

   von Karman (kappa), one-dimensional Kolmogorov (C-K'), and Rotta (A)
   constants, namely, kappa = (4A/7C(K)')(-3/4). Depending on the choices
   made about small-scale intermittency corrections, the logarithmic mean
   velocity profile or a power-law profile with an exponent that depends on
   the intermittency correction are derived thereby offering a new

Abstract = {{A novel electromechanical chaotic oscillator is described that admits an
   exact analytic solution. The oscillator is a hybrid dynamical system
   with governing equations that include a linear second order ordinary
   differential equation with negative damping and a discrete switching
   condition that controls the oscillatory fixed point. The system produces
   provably chaotic oscillations with a topological structure similar to
   either the Lorenz butterfly or Rossler's folded-band oscillator
   depending on the configuration. Exact solutions are written as a linear
   convolution of a fixed basis pulse and a sequence of discrete symbols.
   We find close agreement between the exact analytical solutions and the
   physical oscillations. Waveform return maps for both configurations show
   equivalence to either a shift map or tent map, proving the chaotic
   nature of the oscillations. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Local shear stress sensed by arterial endothelial cells is occasionally
   altered by changes in global hemodynamic parameters, e.g., heart rate
   and blood flow rate, as a result of normal physiological events, such as
   exercise. In a recently study (41), we demonstrated that during the
   adaptive response to increased shear magnitude, porcine endothelial
   cells exhibited an unique phenotype featuring a transient increase in
   permeability and the upregulation of a set of anti-inflammatory and
   antioxidative genes. In the present study, we characterize the adaptive
   response of these cells to an increase in shear frequency, another
   important hemodynamic parameter with implications in atherogenesis.
   Endothelial cells were preconditioned by a basal-level sinusoidal shear
   stress of 15 +/- 15 dyn/cm(2) at 1 Hz, and the frequency was then
   elevated to 2 Hz. Endothelial permeability increased slowly after the
   frequency step-up, but the increase was relatively small. Using
   microarrays, we identified 37 genes that are sensitive to the frequency
   step-up. The acute increase in shear frequency upregulates a set of
   cell-cycle regulation and angiogenesis-related genes. The overall
   adaptive response to the increased frequency is distinctly different
   from that to a magnitude step-up. However, consistent with the previous
   study, our data support the notion that endothelial function during an
   adaptive response is different than that of fully adapted endothelial
   cells. Our studies may also provide insights into the beneficial effects
   of exercise on vascular health: transient increases in frequency may
   facilitate endothelial repair, whereas similar increases in shear
   magnitude may keep excessive inflammation and oxidative stress at bay.}},

   linear systems}},
Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Localizing sources in physical systems represents a class of inverse
   problems with broad scientific and engineering applications. This paper
   is concerned with the development of a non-iterative source sensitivity
   approach for the localization of sources in linear systems under
   steady-state. We show that our proposed approach can be applied to a
   broad class of physical problems, ranging from source localization in
   elastodynamics and acoustics to source detection in heat/mass transport
   problems. The source sensitivity field introduced in this paper
   represents the change of a cost functional caused by the appearance of
   an infinitesimal (or point) source in a given domain (or its boundary).
   In order to extract macroscopic inferences, we apply a threshold to the
   source sensitivity field in a way that parallels the application of the
   topological derivative concept in shape identification. We establish
   precise formulas for the source sensitivity field using a direct
   approach and a Lagrangian formulation. We show that computing the source
   sensitivity field entails just obtaining the solution of a single
   adjoint problem. Hence, the computational expense of obtaining the
   source sensitivity is of the same order as that of solving one forward
   problem. We illustrate the performance of the method through numerical
   examples drawn from the areas of elastodynamics, acoustics, and
   heat/mass transport. Our results show that our proposed approach could
   be used on its own as a source detection tool or to obtain initial
   guesses for more quantitative iterative gradient-based minimization
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Although some central aspects of pulmonary function (ventilation and
   perfusion) are known to be heterogeneous, the distribution of diffusive
   gas exchange remains poorly characterized. A solution is offered by
   hyperpolarized Xe-129 magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, because this gas
   can be separately detected in the lung's air spaces and dissolved in its
   tissues. Early dissolved-phase Xe-129 images exhibited intensity
   gradients that favored the dependent lung. To quantitatively corroborate
   this finding, we developed an interleaved, three-dimensional radial
   sequence to image the gaseous and dissolved Xe-129 distributions in the
   same breath. These images were normalized and divided to calculate
   ``Xe-129 gas-transfer{''} maps. We hypothesized that, for healthy
   volunteers, Xe-129 gas-transfer maps would retain the previously
   observed posture-dependent gradients. This was tested in nine subjects:
   when the subjects were supine, Xe-129 gas transfer exhibited a
   posterior-anterior gradient of -2.00 +/- 0.74\%/cm; when the subjects
   were prone, the gradient reversed to 1.94 +/- 1.14\%/cm (P < 0.001). The
   Xe-129 gas-transfer maps also exhibited significant heterogeneity, as
   measured by the coefficient of variation, that correlated with subject
   total lung capacity (r = 0.77, P = 0.015). Gas-transfer intensity varied
   nonmonotonically with slice position and increased in slices proximal to
   the main pulmonary arteries. Despite substantial heterogeneity, the mean
   gas transfer for all subjects was 1.00 +/- 0.01 while supine and 1.01
   +/- 0.01 while prone (P = 0.25), indicating good ``matching{''} between
   gas-and dissolved-phase distributions. This study demonstrates that
   single-breath gas-and dissolved-phase Xe-129 MR imaging yields Xe-129
   gas-transfer maps that are sensitive to altered gas exchange caused by
   differences in lung inflation and posture.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of mortality in industrialized

   contribute to individual susceptibility to the development and

   have developed a high-speed (similar to 40 frames per second)
   microscope-based stereo-imaging system to quantify the motion of
   epicardial coronary arteries of mice. Using near-infrared nontargeted
   quantum dots as an imaging contrast agent, we synchronously acquired
   paired images of a surgically exposed murine heart, from which the
   three-dimensional geometry of the coronary arteries was reconstructed.
   The reconstructed geometry was tracked frame by frame through the
   cardiac cycle to quantify the in vivo motion of the vessel, from which
   displacements, curvature, and torsion parameters were derived.

   imaging systems with the incorporation of anatomical noise}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Stereoscopic chest biplane correlation imaging (stereo/BCI) has
   been proposed as an alternative modality to single view chest x-ray
   (CXR). The metrics effective modulation transfer function (eMTF),
   effective normalized noise power spectrum (eNNPS), and effective
   detective quantum efficiency (eDQE) have been proposed as clinically
   relevant metrics for assessing clinical system performance taking into
   consideration the magnification and scatter effects. This study compared
   the metrics eMTF, eNNPS, eDQE, and detectability index for stereo/BCI
   and single view CXR under isodose conditions at two magnifications for
   two anthropomorphic phantoms of differing sizes.
   Methods: Measurements for the eMTF were taken for two phantom sizes with
   an opaque edge test device using established techniques. The eNNPS was
   measured at two isodose conditions for two phantoms using established
   techniques. The scatter was measured for two phantoms using an
   established beam stop method. All measurements were also taken at two
   different magnifications with two phantoms. A geometrical phantom was
   used for comparison with prior results for CXR although the results for
   an anatomy free phantom are not expected to vary for BCI.
   Results: Stereo/BCI resulted in improved metrics compared to single view
   CXR. Results indicated that magnification can potentially improve the
   detection performance primarily due to the air gap which reduced scatter
   by similar to 20\%. For both phantoms, at isodose, eDQE(0) for
   stereo/BCI was similar to 100 times higher than that for CXR.
   Magnification at isodose improved eDQE(0) by similar to 10 times for
   stereo/BCI. Increasing the dose did not improve eDQE. The detectability
   index for stereo/BCI was similar to 100 times better than single view
   CXR for all conditions. The detectability index was also not improved
   with increased dose.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that stereo/BCI with magnification
   may improve detectability of subtle lung nodules compared to single view
   CXR. Results were improved with magnification for the smaller phantom
   but not for the larger phantom. The effective DQE and the detectability
   index did not improve with increasing dose. (C) 2013 American

Title = {{Frequency response and distortion properties of nonlinear image
   processing algorithms and the importance of imaging context}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The most common metrics for resolution analysis in medical
   imaging are valid only for (approximately) linear systems. While
   analogues to these metrics have been used in attempts to describe
   resolution performance in nonlinear systems, the analysis is incomplete
   since distortion effects are often ignored. The authors have developed a
   methodology to analyze the amplitude modulation and waveform distortion
   properties of nonlinear systems with specific application to medical
   image processing algorithms.
   Methods: Using sinusoidal basis functions, two metrics were derived
   which distinguish amplitude modulation from nonlinear waveform
   distortion: principle frequency response and distortion power spectrum,
   respectively. Additionally, two figures of merit were developed to
   describe the relative impact of nonlinear distortion as a result of
   image processing: distortion index (DI) and Sigma DI. Three nonlinear
   denoising algorithms, the median, bilateral, and wavelet denoising
   filters, were selected as example functions to demonstrate the utility
   of the metrics derived in this study.
   Results: Each filter showed very different resolution and waveform
   distortion properties. In particular, the amplitude and extent of
   nonlinear distortion depended strongly on image context and the type of
   nonlinear mechanism employed. Nonlinear waveform distortion constituted
   up to 30\% of the median filter output signal power in high
   contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) scenarios. Conversely, nonlinear
   distortion never exceeded 1\% of the bilateral filter output signal
   power. The wavelet denoising response contained between 1\% and 9\%
   distortion which varied weakly as a function of CNR.
   Conclusions: The analytical metrics described in the paper demonstrate
   the importance of considering both resolution-and distortion-related
   effects in characterizing the performance of nonlinear imaging systems
   with specific application to image processing algorithms. Findings with
   three common nonlinear algorithms demonstrate a range of CNR values over
   which it is important to consider the impact of the nonlinear nature of
   each algorithm. Background context is also shown to influence the degree
   to which the nonlinear nature of the algorithm influences resolution and
   distortion. While no single metric can yet anticipate observer
   performance in nonlinear systems, the approach described can demonstrate
   the range of imaging contexts over which such nonlinear effects are
   important to consider. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in

   canine muscle. From a single acquisition, both the shear wave phase and
   group velocity can be calculated to estimate the shear wave speed (SWS)
   along and across the fibers, as well as the fiber orientation in 3-D.
   The true fiber orientation found using the 3-D radon transform on B-mode
   volumes of the muscle was used to verify the fiber direction estimated
   from shear wave data. For the simplified imaging case when the ARFI push
   can be oriented perpendicular to the fibers, the error in estimating the
   fiber orientation using phase and group velocity measurements was 3.5
   +/- 2.6 degrees and 3.4 +/- 1.4 degrees (mean +/- standard deviation),
   respectively, over six acquisitions in different muscle samples. For the
   more general case when the push is oblique to the fibers, the angle
   between the push and the fibers is found using the dominant orientation
   of the shear wave displacement magnitude. In 30 acquisitions on six
   different muscle samples with oblique push angles up to 40, the error in
   the estimated fiber orientation using phase and group velocity
   measurements was 5.4 +/- 2.9 degrees and 5.3 +/- 3.2 degrees,
   respectively, after estimating and accounting for the additional unknown
   push angle. Either the phase or group velocity measurements can be used
   to estimate fiber orientation and SWS along and across the fibers.
   Although it is possible to perform these measurements when the push is
   not perpendicular to the fibers, highly oblique push angles induce lower
   shear wave amplitudes which can cause inaccurate SWS measurements.}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC)
   ultrasound imaging can provide improved speckle SNR and lesion CNR
   compared with conventional B-mode images, especially in the presence of
   noise and clutter. Application of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem
   predicts that coherence among the ultrasound echoes received across an
   array is reduced significantly away from the transmit focal depth,
   leading to a limited axial depth of field in SLSC images. Transmit focus
   throughout the field of view can be achieved using synthetic aperture
   methods to combine multiple transmit events into a single final image. A
   synthetic aperture can be formed with either focused or diverging
   transmit beams. We explore the application of these methods to form
   synthetically focused channel data to create SLSC images with an
   extended axial depth of field. An analytical expression of SLSC image
   brightness through depth is derived for the dynamic receive focus case.
   Experimental results in a phantom and in vivo are presented and compared
   with dynamic receive focused SLSC images, demonstrating improved SNR and
   CNR away from the transmit focus and an axial depth of field four to
   five times longer.}},

   Modulated Radiation Therapy Planning Quality Among Treatment Centers: An

Abstract = {{Purpose: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning
   can have wide variation among different treatment centers. We propose a
   system to leverage the IMRT planning experience of larger institutions
   to automatically create high-quality plans for outside clinics. We
   explore feasibility by generating plans for patient datasets from an
   outside institution by adapting plans from our institution.
   Methods and Materials: A knowledge database was created from 132 IMRT
   treatment plans for prostate cancer at our institution. The outside
   institution, a community hospital, provided the datasets for 55 prostate
   cancer cases, including their original treatment plans. For each
   ``query{''} case from the outside institution, a similar ``match{''}
   case was identified in the knowledge database, and the match case's plan
   parameters were then adapted and optimized to the query case by use of a
   semiautomated approach that required no expert planning knowledge. The
   plans generated with this knowledge-based approach were compared with
   the original treatment plans at several dose cutpoints.
   Results: Compared with the original plan, the knowledge-based plan had a
   significantly more homogeneous dose to the planning target volume and a
   significantly lower maximum dose. The volumes of the rectum, bladder,
   and femoral heads above all cutpoints were nominally lower for the
   knowledge-based plan; the reductions were significantly lower for the
   rectum. In 40\% of cases, the knowledge-based plan had overall superior
   (lower) dose-volume histograms for rectum and bladder; in 54\% of cases,
   the comparison was equivocal; in 6\% of cases, the knowledge-based plan
   was inferior for both bladder and rectum.
   Conclusions: Knowledge-based planning was superior or equivalent to the
   original plan in 95\% of cases. The knowledge-based approach shows
   promise for homogenizing plan quality by transferring planning expertise
   from more experienced to less experienced institutions. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Purpose: The acoustic lens of the Modularis electromagnetic shock wave
   lithotripter (Siemens, Malvern, Pennsylvania) was modified to produce a
   pressure waveform and focal zone more closely resembling that of the
   original HM3 device (Dornier Medtech, Wessling, Germany). We assessed
   the newly designed acoustic lens in vivo in an animal model.
   Materials and Methods: Stone fragmentation and tissue injury produced by
   the original and modified lenses of the Modularis lithotripter were
   evaluated in a swine model under equivalent acoustic pulse energy (about
   45 mJ) at 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency. Stone fragmentation was
   determined by the weight percent of stone fragments less than 2 mm. To
   assess tissue injury, shock wave treated kidneys were perfused,
   dehydrated, cast in paraffin wax and sectioned. Digital images were
   captured every 120 mu m and processed to determine functional renal
   volume damage.
   Results: After 500 shocks, the mean +/- SD stone fragmentation
   efficiency produced by the original and modified lenses was 48\% +/-
   12\% and 52\% +/- 17\%, respectively (p = 0.60). However, after 2,000
   shocks, the modified lens showed significantly improved stone
   fragmentation compared to the original lens (mean 86\% +/- 10\% vs 72\%
   +/- 12\%, p = 0.02). Tissue injury caused by the original and modified
   lenses was minimal at a mean of 0.57\% +/- 0.44\% and 0.25\% +/- 0.25\%,
   respectively (p = 0.27).
   Conclusions: With lens modification the Modularis lithotripter
   demonstrates significantly improved stone fragmentation with minimal
   tissue injury at a clinically relevant acoustic pulse energy. This new
   lens design could potentially be retrofitted to existing lithotripters,
   improving the effectiveness of electromagnetic lithotripters.}},

Abstract = {{Genome editing with engineered nucleases has recently emerged as an
   approach to correct genetic mutations by enhancing homologous
   recombination with a DNA repair template. However, many genetic
   diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), can be treated
   simply by correcting a disrupted reading frame. We show that genome
   editing with transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs),
   without a repair template, can efficiently correct the reading frame and
   restore the expression of a functional dystrophin protein that is
   mutated in DMD. TALENs were engineered to mediate highly efficient gene
   editing at exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. This led to restoration of
   dystrophin protein expression in cells from Duchenne patients, including
   skeletal myoblasts and dermal fibroblasts that were reprogrammed to the
   myogenic lineage by MyoD. Finally, exome sequencing of cells with
   targeted modifications of the dystrophin locus showed no TALEN-mediated
   off-target changes to the protein-coding regions of the genome, as
   predicted by in silico target site analysis. This strategy integrates
   the rapid and robust assembly of active TALENs with an efficient
   gene-editing method for the correction of genetic diseases caused by
   mutations in non-essential coding regions that cause frameshifts or
   premature stop codons.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed physically-based model describing coupled
   surface-subsurface flows is applied to an instrumented catchment to
   investigate the links between runoff generation processes and the
   dynamics of saturated areas. The spatial characterization of the system
   is obtained through geophysical measurements and in situ observations.
   The model is able to reproduce the dynamics of the system through the
   calibration of only few parameters with a clear physical interpretation,
   providing a solid basis for our numerical investigations. Such
   investigations demonstrate the important control exerted by surface
   topography on the time evolution of saturated area patterns, mainly
   mediated by topographic curvature, that dictates both the dominant
   streamflow generation process at the local scale and the
   connection-disconnection dynamics of saturated areas. The relation
   between hillslope water storage and streamflow, Q = f(V), is shown to be
   highly hysteretical and dependent on the mean saturation of the
   catchment: higher degrees of saturation tend to yield one-to-one
   relationships between streamflow and water storage. On the contrary,
   streamflow-water storage relations are importantly affected by the
   specific configuration of saturated areas connected to the outlet when
   the system is far from complete saturation. This observation contradicts
   common assumptions of a one-to-one relationship Q = f(V) often used to
   justify widely observed power-law Q vs. dQ/dt recession curves.
   Furthermore, even when Q = f(V) becomes unique at high degrees of
   saturation, no power-law form emerged in our runs, speculatively because
   of the small size of the catchment formed by a single incision and the
   corresponding hillslope. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new product has completed clinical trials in a distant, resource poor
   hospital using a few dozen prototypes. The data looks great. The novel
   medical device solves a widely felt problem. The next goal is to
   integrate the device into the country's healthcare system and spread the
   device to other countries. But how? In order to be widely used, the
   device must be manufactured and distributed. One option is to license
   the intellectual property (IP) to an interested third party, if one can
   be found. However, it is possible to manage the manufacturing and
   distribution without licensing. There are at least two common means for
   manufacturing a novel medical device targeted to resource poor settings:
   (a) formal (contract) manufacturing and (b) informal (local)
   manufacturing. There are three primary routes to diffusion of novel
   medical devices in the developing world: (1) local distributors (2)
   direct international sales and (3) international donations. Perhaps
   surprisingly, the least effective mechanism is direct importation
   through donation. The most successful mechanism, the method used by
   nearly all working medical devices in resource-poor settings, is the use
   of contract manufacturing and a local distributor. This article is
   written for the biomedical innovator and entrepreneur who wishes to make
   a novel healthcare technology or product available and accessible to
   healthcare providers and patients in the developing world. There are
   very few documented cases and little formal research in this area. To
   this end, this article describes and explores the manufacturing and
   distribution options in order to provide insights into when and how each
   can be applied to scale up a novel technology to make a difference in a
   resource poor setting.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidic biochips are being increasingly used for
   biotechnology applications. The number of control pins used to drive
   electrodes is a major contributor to the fabrication cost for disposable
   biochips in a highly cost-sensitive market. Most prior work on
   pin-constrained biochip design determines the mapping of a small number
   of control pins to a larger number of electrodes according to the
   specific schedule of fluid-handling operations and routing paths of
   droplets. Such designs are, therefore, specific to the bioassay
   application, hence sacrificing some of the flexibility associated with
   digital microfluidics. We propose a design method to generate an
   application-independent pin-assignment configuration with a minimum
   number of control pins. Layouts of commercial biochips and laboratory
   prototypes are used as case studies to evaluate the proposed design
   method for determining a suitable pin-assignment configuration. Compared
   with previous pin-assignment algorithms, the proposed method can reduce
   the number of control pins and facilitate the general-purpose use of
   digital microfluidic biochips for a wider range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Clock-domain crossing (CDC) faults require careful post-silicon testing
   for multiclock circuits. Even when robust design methods based on
   synchronizers and design verification techniques are used, process
   variations can introduce subtle timing problems that affect data
   transfer across clock-domain boundaries for fabricated chips. We
   integrate solutions for detecting and locating CDC faults, and ensuring
   post-silicon recovery from CDC failures. In the proposed method, CDC
   faults are located using a CDC-fault dictionary, and their impact is
   masked using post-silicon clock-path tuning. To quantify the impact of
   process variations in the transfer of data at clock domain boundaries of
   multiclock circuits and to validate the proposed error-recovery method,
   we conducted a series of HSpice simulations using a 45-nm technology.
   The results demonstrate high incidence of process variation-induced
   violation of setup and hold time at the boundary flip-flops, even when
   synchronizer flip-flops are employed. The results also confirm the
   effectiveness of the proposed error-recovery scheme in recovering from
   CDC failures.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Here we document and explain interactions between two thermodynamic
   trends that determine the optimum performance of refrigeration and heat
   pump systems. We show analytically why the performance of the system
   must increase with the size of the installation. The second law
   efficiency of heat pump systems must increase with their size. We also
   show that the power requirement for a specific ground-coupled heat pump
   system must decrease as the size of the ground heat exchanger increases.
   From these two trends emerges the tradeoff between the size of the heat
   pump and the size of the ground heat exchanger. The challenge is to find
   the optimum size of the ground-coupled heat pump. We show numerically
   the optimum heat pump size and the ground heat exchanger size that
   correspond to minimum total power requirement subject to a cost
   constraint. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During electrocutaneous stimulations, variation in skin properties
   across locations can lead to differences in neural activation. However,
   little focus has been given to the effect of different skin thicknesses
   on neural activation. Electrical stimulation was applied to six sites
   across the sole of the foot. The intensities used were two and four
   times perception threshold. The subjects (n = 8) rated the perception
   quality and intensity using the McGill Pain Questionnaire and a visual
   analog scale (VAS). A finite element model was developed and combined
   with the activation function (AF) to estimate neural activation.
   Electrical stimulation was perceived as significantly less sharp at the
   heel compared to all other sites, except one site in the forefoot
   (logistic regression, p < 0.05). The VAS scores were significantly
   higher in the arch than at the heel (RM ANOVA, p < 0.05). The model
   showed that the AF was between 91 and 231 \% higher at the five other
   sites than at the heel. The differences in perception across the sole of
   the foot indicated that the CNS received different inputs depending on
   the stimulus site. The lower AF at the heel indicated that the skin
   thicknesses could contribute to the perceived differences.}},

Abstract = {{A major mechanism by which human regulatory T cells (T-reg) have been
   shown to suppress and kill autologous immune cells is through the
   granzyme-perforin pathway. However, it is unknown whether T-regs also
   possess the capacity to kill tumor cells using similar mechanisms.
   Bispecific antibodies (bscAb) have emerged as a promising class of
   therapeutics that activate T cells against tumor antigens without the
   need for classical MHC-restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition.
   Here, we show that a bscAb targeting the tumor-specific mutation of the
   EGF receptor, EGFRvIII, redirects human CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T-regs to
   kill glioblastoma cells. This activity was significantly abrogated by
   inhibitors of the granzyme-perforin pathway. Notably, analyses of human
   primary glioblastoma also displayed diffused infiltration of
   granzyme-expressing FoxP3(+) T cells. Together, these data suggest that
   despite their known suppressive functions, tumor-infiltrating T-regs
   possess potent cytotoxic mechanisms that can be co-opted for efficient
   tumor cell lysis. (C) 2013 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need for low-cost and low-toxicity antimicrobial
   agents for water treatment and medical applications. Current approaches
   utilize relatively expensive and corrosive chemicals and disinfectants
   to reduce, prevent or remove biofilms in technological systems.
   Nanoparticle-based approaches are sought increasingly to develop
   disinfection systems and self-cleaning surfaces that could `seek and
   destroy' microorganisms. In this context, the authors have developed
   novel lipophilic bismuth dimercaptopropanol (BisBAL) nanoparticles using
   a simple aqueous reduction reaction with sodium borohydride at room
   temperature. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of
   BisBAL nanoparticles on growth, attachment and biofilm formation by
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Characterization of nanoparticles showed them to
   be very lipophilic, with a rhombohedral crystalline structure and
   crystallite size of approximately 18 nm. When introduced at or above the
   minimum inhibitory concentration MIC = 12.5 mu M), the growth of
   bacteria was completely inhibited for at least 30 d. The authors show
   that lipophilic BisBAL nanoparticles at the MIC inhibited bacterial
   attachment to track-etched polycarbonate membrane surfaces and lysed
   bacteria embedded in biofilms, within 1 h of exposure. The authors
   conclude that lipophilic bismuth nanoparticles are promising
   antimicrobial agents, that have the capability to inhibit growth,
   prevent bacterial attachment to surfaces or damage existing biofilms.}},

Abstract = {{A multiscale inference analysis is conducted in order to infer
   intermixing rates prevailing during different reaction regimes in Ni/AI
   nanolaminates. The analysis combines the results of molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations, used in conjunction with a mixing measure theory to
   characterize intermixing rates under adiabatic conditions. When
   incorporated into reduced reaction models, however, information
   extracted from MD computations leads to front propagation velocities
   that conflict with experimental observations, and the discrepancies
   indicate that our MD simulations over-estimate the atomic intermixing
   rates. Thus, using only insights gained from MD computations, a
   generalized diffusivity law is developed that exhibits a sharp rise near
   the melting temperature of Al. By calibrating the intermixing rates at
   high temperatures from experimental observations of self-propagating
   fronts, and inferring the intermixing rates at low and intermediate
   temperatures from ignition and nanocalorimetry experiments, the
   dependence of the diffusivity on temperature is inferred in a suitably
   wide temperature range. Using this generalized diffusivity law, one
   obtains a generalized reduced model that, for the first time, enables us
   to reproduce measurements of low-temperature ignition, homogeneous
   reactions at intermediate temperatures, as well as the dependence of the
   velocity of self-propagating reaction fronts on microstructural
   parameters. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier

   structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy to study the chemical integrity, purity,
   and possible internal alignment of single-strand (ss) adenine
   deoxynucleotide (poly-(A)) DNA brushes. The brushes were synthesized by
   surface-initiated enzymatic polymerization (SIEP) on a 25-mer of adenine
   self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on gold (A25-SH), wherein the terminal
   3'-OH of the A25-SH serve as the initiation sites for SIEP of poly(A).
   XPS and NEXAFS spectra of poly(A) brushes were found to be almost
   identical to those of A25-SH initiator, with no unambiguous traces of
   contamination. Apart from the well-defined chemical integrity and
   contamination-free character, the brushes were found to have a high
   degree of orientational order, with an upright orientation of individual
   strands, despite their large thickness up to similar to 55 nm, that
   corresponds to a chain length of at least several hundred nucleotides
   for individual ssDNA molecules. The orientational order exhibited by
   these poly(A) DNA brushes, mediated presumably by base stacking, was
   found to be independent of the brush thickness as long as the packing
   density was high enough. The well-defined character and orientational
   ordering of the ssDNA brushes make them a potentially promising system
   for different applications.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of macroscopic desiccation shrinkage experiments indicates that
   most, but not all of the shrinkage during drying occurs while soil is
   still saturated. Shrinkage practically ceases and air starts to
   penetrate the soil, when the water content is still quite high, for
   example, above 20\% for the tested soils. The remaining, unsaturated
   drying process occurs with a much-reduced shrinkage rate. In this
   context, we examine data of the pore system evolution as represented by
   the mercury porosimetry experimental results. The process is then
   modeled as a two-stage process of deformation and evacuation of a
   two-tube vessel system driven by the external evaporation flux. In the
   first stage, Poiseuille flow occurs through the vessels. The amount of
   water evaporated in this stage equals to the reduction of volume of the
   vessel through the deformation of its walls. This stage ends when a
   negative water pressure (suction) required to further deform the vessel
   reaches a critical value at which air enters the pore space. Two
   physical interpretation of such threshold are discussed. In the
   subsequent stage, evaporation proceeds with a receding liquid/vapor
   interface starting from the open end, incrementally emptying the vessel
   but with a marginal water flow and vessel deformation. The leading
   variables of the process are identified, and a quantifiable multiphysics
   meso-scale scenario of models is established. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Abstract = {{A mesoscale model of desiccation of soil based on the evolution of the
   pore system idealized as bimodal is numerically examined. A simplified
   evolution of the model reveals a series of characteristics that
   qualitatively agree with the observed macroscopic experimental findings.
   The principal mechanism is deemed to be driven by the surface
   evaporation and water outflow generating a pore pressure gradient
   resulting in the shrinkage mainly of the largest pores. The amount of
   shrinkage is a function of (negative) pore pressure and is controlled by
   the compressibility of the solid matrix. The numerical model includes
   also the ensuing partial saturation stage initiated by the air entry
   simulated as a scenario with a moving phase interface inside the pore.
   The proposed model can be extended beyond the two-mode porosity soils,
   to include the multi-modal porosity, or its statistical
   representation.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{At our body surface, the epidermis absorbs UV radiation. UV overexposure
   leads to sunburn with tissue injury and pain. To understand how, we
   focus on TRPV4, a nonselective cation channel highly expressed in
   epithelial skin cells and known to function in sensory transduction, a
   property shared with other transient receptor potential channels. We
   show that following UVB exposure mice with induced Trpv4 deletions,
   specifically in keratinocytes, are less sensitive to noxious thermal and
   mechanical stimuli than control animals. Exploring the mechanism, we
   find that epidermal TRPV4 orchestrates UVB-evoked skin tissue damage and
   increased expression of the proalgesic/algogenic mediator endothelin-1.
   In culture, UVB causes a direct, TRPV4-dependent Ca2+ response in
   keratinocytes. In mice, topical treatment with a TRPV4-selective
   inhibitor decreases UVB-evoked pain behavior, epidermal tissue damage,
   and endothelin-1 expression. In humans, sunburn enhances epidermal
   expression of TRPV4 and endothelin-1, underscoring the potential of
   keratinocyte-derived TRPV4 as a therapeutic target for UVB-induced
   sunburn, in particular pain.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach for high-fidelity compressible porous media
   simulations. Our method is based on a fully coupled, upwind, high-order
   discontinuous Galerkin formulation of the equations of miscible
   displacement transport. A key feature of the proposed method is the high
   level of flexibility to compute complex subsurface geometries,
   maintaining full order of accuracy. The present formulation solves
   pressure and transport equations in a fully coupled fashion and, as a
   result, can capture the strong interaction between pressure and
   concentrations of injected components in highly compressible media. The
   proposed method also shows very low sensitivity to mesh orientation, in
   contrast with classical finite volume approximations used in porous
   media flow simulations. The robustness and accuracy of the method are
   demonstrated in a number of challenging compressible and incompressible
   multiphase flow problems. Numerical simulations also reveal interesting
   phenomena associated with high pore compressibility, such as the
   reduction of the growth rate of viscous fingers and the alteration of
   flow patterns near impermeable obstacles. Additional computations
   performed with an anisotropic permeability tensor reveal that, somewhat
   against intuition, viscous fingers have a preferential growth along the
   direction of low permeability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are being used in many consumer
   products and devices. It is likely that as some of these products reach
   the end of their useful life, they will be discarded in municipal solid
   waste landfills. However, there has been little work evaluating the fate
   of nanomaterials in solid waste environments. The purpose of this study
   is to systematically evaluate the influence of organic matter type and
   concentration in landfill-relevant conditions on SWNT transport through
   a packed-bed of mixed municipal solid waste collectors. The influence of
   individual waste materials on SWNT deposition is also evaluated.
   Transport experiments were conducted through saturated waste-containing
   columns over a range of simulated leachate conditions representing both
   mature and young leachates. Results indicate that SWNT transport may be
   significant in mature waste environments, with mobility decreasing with
   decreasing humic acid concentration. SWNT mobility in the presence of
   acetic acid was inhibited, suggesting their mobility in young waste
   environments may be small. SWNTs also exhibited collector
   media-dependent transport, with greatest transport in glass and least in
   paper. These results represent the first study evaluating how leachate
   age and changes in waste composition influence potential SWNT mobility
   in landfills.}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state motions of a woman's ponytail during level, straight,
   walking and running are examined. Based on reported data, formulas have
   been developed for the relationship of the forward speed to the
   frequencies of vertical and sideways motion of the head, and of the form
   of that motion. The ponytail is modeled as a compound pendulum or a
   multi-bar pendulum with 2, 3, or 5 rigid bars. Motions in the vertical
   plane perpendicular to the direction of progression are analyzed.
   Rotational springs and dashpots are placed at the joints, and
   aerodynamic damping (air drag) is included. Attention is focused on the
   variation of the amplitudes of the bars as the woman's walking speed and
   then running speed increase. An example of three-dimensional motions of
   a spherical-pendulum model also is included. Experiments were conducted
   on a double pendulum with parabolic applied motion at the top. The
   damping is modeled by rotational friction (i.e., a constant resisting
   moment at the top and internal joints), and the numerical results agree
   well with the test data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We generalize the POD-based Galerkin method for post-transient flow data
   by incorporating Navier-Stokes equation constraints. In this method, the
   derived Galerkin expansion minimizes the residual like POD, but with the
   power balance equation for the resolved turbulent kinetic energy as an
   additional optimization constraint. Thus, the projection of the
   Navier-Stokes equation on to the expansion modes yields a Galerkin
   system that respects the power balance on the attractor. The resulting
   dynamical system requires no stabilizing eddy-viscosity term - contrary
   to other POD models of high-Reynolds-number flows. The proposed Galerkin
   method is illustrated with two test cases: two-dimensional flow inside a
   square lid-driven cavity and a two-dimensional mixing layer.
   Generalizations for more Navier-Stokes constraints, e.g. Reynolds
   equations, can be achieved in straightforward variation of the presented
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional methods for synthesizing protein/peptide-polymer
   conjugates, as a means to improve the pharmacological properties of
   therapeutic biomolecules, typically have drawbacks including low yield,
   non-trivial separation of conjugates from reactants, and lack of site-
   specificity, which results in heterogeneous products with significantly
   compromised bioactivity. To address these limitations, the use of
   sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus is demonstrated to
   site-specifically attach an initiator solely at the C-terminus of green
   fluorescent protein (GFP), followed by in situ growth of a stealth
   polymer, poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) by atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Sortase-catalyzed initiator
   attachment proceeds with high specificity and near-complete (approximate
   to 95\%) product conversion. Subsequent in situ ATRP in aqueous buffer
   produces 1:1 stoichiometric conjugates with >90\% yield, low dispersity,
   and no denaturation of the protein. This approach introduces a simple

Title = {{Optimal causal control of a wave energy converter in a random sea}},
Journal = {{APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper concerns the design of feedback control systems to maximize
   power generation of a wave energy converter (WEC) in a random sea. In
   the literature on WEC control, most of the proposed feedback controllers
   fall into three categories. Many are static; i.e., they extract power by
   imposing an equivalent damping or resistive load on the power take-off
   (PTO) devices. Others are dynamic and are designed to maximize power
   generation at all frequencies, which results in an anticausal feedback
   law. Other dynamic control design methods are causal, and are tuned to
   achieve the anticausal performance at only a single frequency. By
   contrast, this paper illustrates that the determination of the true
   optimal causal dynamic controller for a WEC can be found as the solution
   to a nonstandard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) optimal control
   problem. The theory assumes that the control system must make power
   generation decisions based only on present and past measurements of the
   generator voltages and/or velocities. It is shown that unlike optimal
   anticausal control, optimal causal control requires knowledge of the
   stationary spectral characteristics of the random sea state.
   Additionally, it is shown that the efficiency of the generator factors
   into the feedback synthesis. The theory is illustrated on a linear
   dynamical model for a buoy-type WEC with significant resonant modes in
   surge and pitch, and equipped with three spatially-distributed
   generators. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A heuristic model is presented to describe the overall progression of
   stone comminution in shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), accounting for the
   effects of shock wave dose and the average peak pressure, P+(avg),
   incident on the stone during the treatment. The model is developed
   through adaptation of the Weibull theory for brittle fracture,
   incorporating threshold values in dose and P+(avg) that are required to
   initiate fragmentation. The model is validated against experimental data
   of stone comminution from two stone types (hard and soft BegoStone)
   obtained at various positions in lithotripter fields produced by two
   shock wave sources of different beam width and pulse profile both in
   water and in 1,3-butanediol (which suppresses cavitation). Subsequently,
   the model is used to assess the performance of a newly developed
   acoustic lens for electromagnetic lithotripters in comparison with its
   original counterpart both under static and simulated respiratory motion.
   The results have demonstrated the predictive value of this heuristic
   model in elucidating the physical basis for improved performance of the
   new lens. The model also provides a rationale for the selection of SWL
   treatment protocols to achieve effective stone comminution without
   elevating the risk of tissue injury. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{A multiphysics computational model of the focusing of an acoustic pulse
   and subsequent shock wave formation that occurs during extracorporeal
   shock wave lithotripsy is presented. In the electromagnetic lithotripter
   modeled in this work the focusing is achieved via a polystyrene acoustic
   lens. The transition of the acoustic pulse through the solid lens is
   modeled by the linear elasticity equations and the subsequent shock wave
   formation in water is modeled by the Euler equations with a Tait
   equation of state. Both sets of equations are solved simultaneously in
   subsets of a single computational domain within the BEARCLAW framework
   which uses a finite-volume Riemann solver approach. This model is first
   validated against experimental measurements with a standard (or
   original) lens design. The model is then used to successfully predict
   the effects of a lens modification in the form of an annular ring cut. A
   second model which includes a kidney stone simulant in the domain is
   also presented. Within the stone the linear elasticity equations
   incorporate a simple damage model. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are stimulus-responsive peptide
   polymers that exhibit inverse temperature phase transition behavior,
   causing an ELP to aggregate above its inverse transition temperature
   (T-t). Although this property has been exploited in a variety of
   biotechnological applications, de novo design of ELPs that display a
   specific T-t is not trivial because the T-t of an ELP is a complex
   function of several variables, including its sequence, chain length,
   polypeptide concentration, and the type and concentration of cosolutes
   in solution. This paper provides a quantitative model that predicts the
   T-t of a family of ELPs (Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly, where Xaa = Ala and/or
   Val) from their composition, chain length, and concentration in
   phosphate buffered saline. This model will enable de novo prediction of
   the amino acid sequence and chain length of ELPs that will display a
   predetermined T-t in physiological buffer within a specified
   concentration regime, thereby greatly facilitating the design of new
   ELPs for applications in medicine and biotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To address the misrepresentation of the eye in retinal optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) images and to examine the effect of this
   misrepresentation on retinal thickness measurements.
   DESIGN: Prospective case series.
   METHODS: Five subjects with recent orbital magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) scans and normal eye examinations were consented from the clinics
   of the Duke Eye Center. Each subject had both eyes imaged using a
   retinal spectral-domain OCT system and ocular biometry measured. Two
   types of individualized optical models of the subject eyes-numerical and
   analytical-were used to determine the spatial paths of the OCT A-scans.
   These paths were Used to reorient the A-scans in the associated retinal
   OCT images and generate corrected images. Using curvature as a general
   measure of shape, the radii of curvature of the retinal pigment
   epithelium in the original and corrected OCT images were compared to the
   ocular radii of curvature in the MRI images. Differences between the
   retinal thickness maps derived from the original and corrected OCT
   images were then determined.
   RESULTS: The retinal curvatures were substantially flatter in the
   original OCT than in the MRI images (mean paired difference: 52.8 +/-
   41.8 mm, P < .001). Correcting the OCT images decreased the paired
   differences between OCT and MRI (numerical: 1.6 +/- 2.3 mm, P = .091;
   analytical: 1.9 +/- 4.3 mm, P = .278). Retinal thickness measurements
   between the corrected and uncorrected images differed, with a root mean
   square difference of 5.61 mu m over the entire 6-mm extent of the image;
   this difference was greater peripherally (6.02 mu m) than centrally
   (2.54 mu m).
   CONCLUSIONS: Optically based algorithms can be used to correct the shape
   of the retina as represented in OCT; this correction makes OCT more
   consistent with other clinical imaging techniques. Resultant retinal
   thickness maps were minimally affected by the change in shape. Ocular
   shape correction should be considered in future development of posterior
   segment OCT-based morphologic measurements. (C) 2013 by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Atmospheric moisture budget and its regulation of the summer
   (June-July-August) precipitation over the Southeastern United State (SE
   U.S.) were examined during 1948-2007 using PRECipitation REConstruction
   over Land and multiple reanalysis datasets. The analysis shows that the
   interannual variation of SE U.S. summer precipitation can be largely
   explained by the leading Empirical Orthogonal Function mode showing a
   spatially homogenous sub-continental scale pattern. Consequently,
   areal-averaged precipitation was investigated to focus on the
   large-scale rainfall changes over the SE U.S. The wavelet analysis
   identifies an increased 2-4 year power spectrum in recent 30 years
   (1978-2007), suggesting an intensification of the interannual
   variability. Analysis of the atmospheric moisture budget indicates that
   the increase in precipitation variability is mainly caused by moisture
   transport, which exhibits a similar increase in the 2-4 year power
   spectrum for the same period. Moisture transport, in turn, is largely
   controlled by the seasonal mean component rather than the
   subseasonal-scale eddies. Furthermore, our results indicate that dynamic
   processes (atmospheric circulation) are more important than
   thermodynamic processes (specific humidity) in regulating the
   interannual variation of moisture transport. Specifically, the North
   Atlantic Subtropical High western ridge position is found to be a
   primary regulator, with the ridge in the northwest (southwest)
   corresponding to anomalous moisture divergence (convergence) over the SE
   U.S. Changes in moisture transport consistent with the increased
   frequency of these two ridge types in recent 30 years favor the
   intensification of summer precipitation variability.}},

Abstract = {{Four pigs, three with focal infarctions in the apical intraventricular
   septum (IVS) and/or left ventricular free wall (LVFW), were imaged with
   an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) transducer. Custom beam sequences
   were used to excite the myocardium with focused acoustic radiation force
   (ARF) impulses and image the subsequent tissue response. Tissue
   displacement in response to the ARF excitation was calculated with a
   phase-based estimator, and transverse wave magnitude and velocity were
   each estimated at every depth. The excitation sequence was repeated
   rapidly, either in the same location to generate 40 Hz M-modes at a
   single steering angle, or with a modulated steering angle to synthesize
   2-D displacement magnitude and shear wave velocity images at 17 points
   in the cardiac cycle. Both types of images were acquired from various
   views in the right and left ventricles, in and out of infarcted regions.
   In all animals, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) and shear wave
   elasticity imaging (SWEI) estimates indicated diastolic relaxation and
   systolic contraction in noninfarcted tissues. The M-mode sequences
   showed high beat-to-beat spatio-temporal repeatability of the
   measurements for each imaging plane. In views of noninfarcted tissue in
   the diseased animals, no significant elastic remodeling was indicated
   when compared with the control. Where available, views of infarcted
   tissue were compared with similar views from the control animal. In
   views of the LVFW, the infarcted tissue presented as stiff and
   non-contractile compared with the control. In a view of the IVS, no
   significant difference was seen between infarcted and healthy tissue,
   whereas in another view, a heterogeneous infarction was seen to be
   presenting itself as non-contractile in systole.}},

Title = {{Diet-induced obesity alters the differentiation potential of stem cells
   isolated from bone marrow, adipose tissue and infrapatellar fat pad: the
   effects of free fatty acids}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a major risk factor for several musculoskeletal
   conditions that are characterized by an imbalance of tissue remodeling.
   Adult stem cells are closely associated with the remodeling and
   potential repair of several mesodermally derived tissues such as fat,
   bone and cartilage. We hypothesized that obesity would alter the
   frequency, proliferation, multipotency and immunophenotype of adult stem
   cells from a variety of tissues.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs), subcutaneous adipose-derived stem cells (sqASCs) and
   infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (IFP cells) were isolated from
   lean and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, and their cellular properties
   were examined. To test the hypothesis that changes in stem cell
   properties were due to the increased systemic levels of free fatty acids
   (FFAs), we further investigated the effects of FFAs on lean stem cells
   in vitro.
   RESULTS: Obese mice showed a trend toward increased prevalence of MSCs
   and sqASCs in the stromal tissues. While no significant differences in
   cell proliferation were observed in vitro, the differentiation potential
   of all types of stem cells was altered by obesity. MSCs from obese mice
   demonstrated decreased adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic
   potential. Obese sqASCs and IFP cells showed increased adipogenic and
   osteogenic differentiation, but decreased chondrogenic ability. Obese
   MSCs also showed decreased CD105 and increased platelet-derived growth
   factor receptor alpha expression, consistent with decreased chondrogenic
   potential. FFA treatment of lean stem cells significantly altered their
   multipotency but did not completely recapitulate the properties of obese
   stem cells.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that obesity alters

Abstract = {{Closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems could provide automatic
   adjustment of stimulation parameters and improve outcomes in the
   treatment of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. The evoked
   compound action potential (ECAP), generated by activated neurons near
   the DBS electrode, may provide a suitable feedback control signal for
   closed-loop DBS. The objectives of this work were to characterize the
   ECAP across stimulation parameters and determine the neural elements
   contributing to the signal. We recorded ECAPs during thalamic DBS in
   anesthetized cats and conducted computer simulations to calculate the
   ECAP of a population of thalamic neurons. The experimental and
   computational ECAPs were similar in shape and had characteristics that
   were correlated across stimulation parameters (R-2 = 0.80-0.95, P <
   0.002). The ECAP signal energy increased with larger DBS amplitudes (P <
   0.0001) and pulse widths (P < 0.002), and the signal energy of secondary
   ECAP phases was larger at 10-Hz than at 100-Hz DBS (P < 0.002). The
   computational model indicated that these changes resulted from a greater
   extent of neural activation and an increased synchronization of
   postsynaptic thalamocortical activity, respectively. Administration of
   tetrodotoxin, lidocaine, or isoflurane abolished or reduced the
   magnitude of the experimental and computational ECAPs, glutamate
   receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and
   D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) reduced secondary ECAP
   phases by decreasing postsynaptic excitation, and the GABA A receptor
   agonist muscimol increased the latency of the secondary phases by
   augmenting postsynaptic hyperpolarization. This study demonstrates that
   the ECAP provides information about the type and extent of neural
   activation generated during DBS, and the ECAP may serve as a feedback
   control signal for closed-loop DBS.}},

Abstract = {{Reverberation is especially detrimental for cochlear implant listeners;
   thus, mitigating its effects has the potential to provide significant
   improvements to cochlear implant communication. Efforts to model and
   correct for reverberation in acoustic listening scenarios can be quite
   complex, requiring estimation of the room transfer function and
   localization of the source and receiver. However, due to the limited
   resolution associated with cochlear implant stimulation, simpler
   processing for reverberation detection and mitigation may be possible
   for cochlear implants. This study models speech stimuli in a cochlear
   implant on a per-channel basis both in quiet and in reverberation, and
   assesses the efficacy of these models for detecting the presence of
   reverberation. This study was able to successfully detect reverberation
   in cochlear implant pulse trains, and the results appear to be robust to
   varying room conditions and cochlear implant stimulation parameters.
   Reverberant signals were detected 100\% of the time for a long
   reverberation time of 1.2 s and 86\% of the time for a shorter
   reverberation time of 0.5 s. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Title = {{DQE of wireless digital detectors: Comparative performance with
   differing filtration schemes}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Wireless flat panel detectors are gaining increased usage in
   portable medical imaging. Two such detectors were evaluated and compared
   with a conventional flat-panel detector using the formalism of the
   International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 62220-1) for measuring
   modulation transfer function (MTF), normalized noise power spectrum
   (NNPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) using two different
   filtration schemes.
   Methods: Raw images were acquired for three image receptors (DRX-1C and
   DRX-1, Carestream Health; Inc., Pixium 4600, Trixell) using a
   radiographic system with a well-characterized output (Philips Super80
   CP, Philips Healthcare). Free in-air exposures were measured using a
   calibrated radiation meter (Unfors Mult-O-Meter Type 407, Unfors
   Instruments AB). Additional aluminum filtration and a new alternative
   combined copper-aluminum filtration were used to conform the x ray
   output to IEC-specified beam quality definitions RQA5 and RQA9. Using
   the IEC 62220-1 formalism, each detector was evaluated at X-N/2, X-N,
   and 2X(N), where the normal exposure level to the detector surface (X-N)
   was set to 8.73 mu Gy (1.0 mR). The prescribed edge test device was used
   to evaluate the MTF, while the NNPS was measured using uniform images.
   The DQE was then calculated from the MTF and NNPS and compared across
   detectors, exposures, and filtration schemes.
   Results: The three DR systems had largely comparable MTFs with DRX-1
   demonstrating lower values above 1.0 cycles/mm. At each exposure, DRX-1C
   and Pixium detectors demonstrated better noise performance than that of
   DRX-1. Zero-frequency DQEs for DRX-1C, Pixium, and DRX-1 detectors were
   approximately 74\%, 63\%, and 38\% for RQA5 and 50\%, 42\%, and 28\% for
   RQA9, respectively.
   Conclusions: DRX-1C detector exhibited superior DQE performance compared
   to Pixium and DRX-1. In terms of filtration, the alternative filtration
   was found to provide comparable performance in terms of rank ordering of
   different detectors with the added convenience of being less bulky for
   in-the-field measurements. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{We introduce the concept of a metamaterial aperture, in which an
   underlying reference mode interacts with a designed metamaterial surface
   to produce a series of complex field patterns. The resonant frequencies
   of the metamaterial elements are randomly distributed over a large
   bandwidth (18-26 GHz), such that the aperture produces a rapidly varying
   sequence of field patterns as a function of the input frequency. As the
   frequency of operation is scanned, different subsets of metamaterial
   elements become active, in turn varying the field patterns at the scene.
   Scene information can thus be indexed by frequency, with the overall
   effectiveness of the imaging scheme tied to the diversity of the
   generated field patterns. As the quality (Q-) factor of the metamaterial
   resonators increases, the number of distinct field patterns that can be
   generated increases-improving scene estimation. In this work we provide
   the foundation for computational imaging with metamaterial apertures
   based on frequency diversity, and establish that for resonators with
   physically relevant Q-factors, there are potentially enough distinct
   measurements of a typical scene within a reasonable bandwidth to achieve
   diffraction-limited reconstructions of physical scenes. (C) 2013 Optical

Abstract = {{Engineered cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) are widely used in
   biomedical and engineering manufacturing industries. Previous research
   has shown the ability of CeO2 NPs to act as a redox catalyst, suggesting
   potential to both induce and alleviate oxidative stress in organisms. In
   this study, Caenorhabditis elegans and zebrafish (Danio rerio) were
   dosed with commercially available CeO2 NPs. Non-nano cerium oxide powder
   (CeO2) was used as a positive control for cerium toxicity. CeO2 NPs
   suspended in standard United States Environmental Protection Agency
   reconstituted moderately hard water, used to culture the C. elegans,
   quickly formed large polydisperse aggregates. Dosing solutions were
   renewed daily for 3 days. Exposure of wild-type nematodes resulted in
   dose-dependent growth inhibition detected for all 3 days (p < 0.0001).
   Non-nano CeO2 also caused significant growth inhibition (p < 0.0001),
   but the scale of inhibition was less at equivalent mass exposures
   compared with CeO2 NP exposure. Some metal and oxidative
   stress-sensitive mutant nematode strains showed mildly altered growth
   relative to the wild-type when dosed with 5 mg/L CeO2 NPs on days 2 and
   3, thus providing weak evidence for a role for oxidative stress or metal
   sensitivity in CeO2 NP toxicity. Zebrafish microinjected with CeO2 NPs
   or CeO2 did not exhibit increased gross developmental defects compared
   with controls. Hyperspectral imaging showed that CeO2 NPs were ingested
   but not detectable inside the cells of C. elegans. Growth inhibition
   observed in C. elegans may be explained at least in part by a
   non-specific inhibition of feeding caused by CeO2 NPs aggregating around
   bacterial food and/or inside the gut tract.}},

Abstract = {{Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-alginate composite beads were synthesized
   using three different approaches as filler materials of packed columns
   for simultaneous filtration-disinfection as an alternative portable
   water treatment process. The prepared composite beads were packed into a
   column through which Escherichia coli containing water was filtered to
   evaluate the disinfection efficacy. Excellent disinfection performance
   (no detectable viable colony) was achieved with a hydraulic retention
   time (HRT) as short as 1 min (the shortest tested) with the SGR
   (Simultaneous-Gelation-Reduction) and AR (Adsorption Reduction) beads
   that were prepared using in situ reduction of Ag+. Comparatively, the
   SGR beads released significantly less Ag+/AgNPs than the AR beads did
   within the same HRT. From the results of this study it was identified
   that SGR maybe the best choice among all three different synthesis
   approaches in that the SGR beads can achieve satisfactory bactericidal
   performance with a relatively low material consumption rate. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Isolation systems protect fragile objects from potentially-damaging
   shocks and shakes by mechanically decoupling motions of the object from
   motions of the surrounding environment. Shock and vibration isolation
   systems have been applied to systems ranging from the micron scale to
   the scale of entire buildings. Many isolation systems operate within a
   linear range, while others have strong nonlinearities. The focus of this
   paper is on the chaotic response of a rolling-pendulum vibration
   isolation system. An experimentally-calibrated model is reduced to a
   single-degree-of-freedom nonlinear system. The nonlinearities involve
   softening behavior at intermediate responses and stiff impacts at large
   amplitudes. This model is investigated numerically to explore and
   establish the influence of harmonic forcing parameters on the chaotic
   nature of responses. Rich chaotic behavior is exhibited in the case
   where the response includes impacts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Regional variations in the composition and architecture of the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) and pericellular matrix (PCM) of the knee
   meniscus play important roles in determining the local mechanical
   environment of meniscus cells. In this study, atomic force microscopy
   was used to spatially map the mechanical properties of matched ECM and
   perlecan-labeled PCM sites within the outer, middle, and inner porcine
   medial meniscus, and to evaluate the properties of the proximal surface
   of each region. The elastic modulus of the PCM was significantly higher
   in the outer region (151.4 +/- 38.2kPa) than the inner region (27.5 +/-
   8.8kPa), and ECM moduli were consistently higher than region-matched PCM
   sites in both the outer (320.8 +/- 92.5kPa) and inner (66.1 +/- 31.4kPa)
   regions. These differences were associated with a higher proportion of
   aligned collagen fibers and lower glycosaminoglycan content in the outer
   region. Regional variations in the elastic moduli and some viscoelastic
   properties were observed on the proximal surface of the meniscus, with
   the inner region exhibiting the highest moduli overall. These results
   indicate that matrix architecture and composition play an important role
   in the regional micromechanical properties of the meniscus, suggesting
   that the local stress-strain environment of meniscal cells may vary
   significantly among the different regions. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic Research

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{109-125}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Resiliency is becoming an important service attribute for large scale
   distributed systems and networks. Key problems in resiliency
   quantification are lack of consensus on the definition of resiliency and
   systematic approach to quantify system resiliency. In general,
   resiliency is defined as the ability of (system/person/organization) to
   recover/defy/resist from any shock, insult, or disturbance {[}1]. Many
   researchers interpret resiliency as a synonym for fault-tolerance and
   reliability/availability. However, effect of failure/repair on systems
   is already covered by reliability/availability measures and that of on
   individual jobs is well covered under the umbrella of performability
   {[}2] and task completion time analysis {[}3]. We use Laprie {[}4] and
   Simoncini {[}5]'s definition in which resiliency is the persistence of
   service delivery that can justifiably be trusted, when facing changes.
   The changes we are referring to here are beyond the envelope of system
   configurations already considered during system design, that is, beyond
   fault tolerance. In this paper, we outline a general approach for system
   resiliency quantification. Using examples of non-state-space and
   state-space stochastic models, we analytically-numerically quantify the
   resiliency of system performance, reliability, availability and
   performability measures w.r.t. structural and parametric changes. (C)

Abstract = {{Fuel recovery from sewage sludge is a promising energy production
   method, which can simultaneously address energy issue and environmental
   concerns associated with waste treatment. This study evaluates power
   productions from different types of sewage sludge in microbial fuel
   cells (MFCs) with energetic and microbiological perspectives. Results
   show that the recovered organic matter (ROM), a kind of anaerobic sewage
   sludge, is a good candidate for bioelectricity generation compared to
   conventional waste activated sludge (WAS), giving a maximum power output
   of 38.1 W m(-3). The lower internal resistance of the MFC fed with ROM
   is attributed to the higher concentration of soluble chemical oxygen
   demand (SCUD) in the anolyte. At a nominal solid retention time of 8
   day, 60.2 +/- 4.9\% of the total COD in the ROM is removed. The initial
   chemical composition and microbial consortium in ROM demonstrates the
   highest exoelectrogenesis potential compared with other WAS samples. The
   syntrophic communities formed on the surface of anode electrodes enable
   the successful conversion of the substrates into bioelectricity.
   Although the recovered energy cannot outweigh the operation costs of the
   bioelectrochemical systems, the total expenditure for ROM treatment
   herein is reduced by 30-50\% compared to those for WAS. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper describes a general spectral element approach to study the
   stability of multiple time delay systems (MTDS). We show, for the first
   time, how this approach can be applied to periodic MTDS where the delays
   and the period are incommensurate. In contrast to prior works on MTDS,
   the spectral element approach is applicable to both autonomous as well
   as non-autonomous MTDS. Both MTDS of first order or higher can be
   obtained and systems with or without damping can be investigated. Since
   the spectral element approach uses efficient interpolation and a set of
   well-distributed interpolation points, the size of the matrices
   necessary for convergence is kept small. Further, since the spectral
   element approach is a semi-analytical procedure, it avoids the need to
   use tedious time marching algorithms to explore the stability behavior
   of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that hydrophilic (backbone) and hydrophobic (side chain)
   hydration layers of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), a class of
   stimulus responsive peptide polymers that exhibit lower critical
   solution temperature (LCST) phase transition behavior, can exist in a
   coupled and decoupled state. The decoupled hydration state consists of
   hydrophobic and hydrophilic hydration layers that respond independently
   to temperature, while the coupled hydration state is characterized by a
   common, cooperative dehydration of both hydration layers. It is further
   shown that the primary sequence of an ELP can be tuned to exhibit either
   of the hydration layer coupling modes. Charged side chains lead to
   decoupling, while strongly hydrophobic side chains trigger stronger
   interaction between hydrophilic and hydrophobic hydration, leading to
   coupling of both layers. Further, for aprotic residues this coupling is
   fostered by decreasing bulkiness of hydrophobic side chains due to
   larger hydration numbers and water molecules mediating coupling between
   side chain and backbone hydration shells. For coupled hydration shells,
   the LCST phase transition characterized by spin probing continuous wave
   electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is reminiscent of a
   first-order process even on nanoscopic length scales. In contrast,
   analogous synthetic polymers exhibit nanoscale phase transitions over a
   broad temperature range, indicating that their nanoscale phase behavior
   is not of first order. Hence, our results indicate that ELPs are the
   first identified class of polymers that exhibit a first-order inverse
   phase transition on nanoscopic length scales. These results may also
   provide insights into the role of hydration layers in governing the
   structurefunction relationship of intrinsically disordered proteins.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the meteorological characteristics of precipitation
   systems that produced 38 sprite-class negative cloud-to-ground (CG)
   strokes (i.e., peak currents in excess of 100kA and charge moment
   changes in excess of 800Ckm) as well as those that produced three
   confirmed negative sprites on 23 different days during 2009-2011. Within
   15km of the negative sprite-parent/class stroke, the median
   characteristics for these systems were to produce negative CGs as 69.2\%
   of all CGs, and for the 30dBZ radar reflectivity contour to reach on
   average 14.2km above mean sea level (MSL), during a 25min period
   encompassing the occurrence of the stroke. The median contiguous area of
   30dBZ composite radar echo (i.e., maximum value in the vertical column)
   for these systems was 6.73x10(3)km(2). All but three of the discharges
   occurred in intense multicellular convection, with 30dBZ exceeding 10km
   MSL in altitude, while the others occurred in the stratiform regions of
   mesoscale convective systems. All but six of the systems produced
   greater than 50\% negative CG lightning, though flash rates tended to be
   low near the stroke (1-2min(-1) on average). The results suggest that
   negative sprite-parent/class lightning typically occurs in precipitation
   systems of similar size and intensity as those that produce positive
   sprites, but not necessarily the same systems, and the negative
   lightning normally strikes ground in the convection rather than the
   stratiform precipitation. However, upper-level positive charge in the
   convection may play an important role in sprite-class/parent lightning
   of either polarity.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated hepatic venous pressure is the primary source of complications
   in advancing liver disease. Ultrasound imaging is ideal for potential
   noninvasive hepatic pressure measurements as it is widely used for liver
   imaging. Specifically, ultrasound based stiffness measures may be useful
   for clinically monitoring pressure, but the mechanism by which liver
   stiffness increases with hepatic pressure has not been well
   characterized. This study is designed to elucidate the nonlinear
   properties of the liver during pressurization by measuring both hepatic
   shear wave speed (SWS) and strain with increasing pressure. Tissue
   deformation during hepatic pressurization was tracked in 8 canine livers
   using successively acquired 3-D B-mode volumes and compared with
   concurrently measured SWS. When portal venous pressure was increased
   from clinically normal (0-5 mmHg) to pressures representing highly
   diseased states at 20 mmHg, the liver was observed to expand with axial
   strain measures up to 10\%. At the same time, SWS estimates were
   observed to increase from 1.5-2 m/s at 0-5 mmHg (baseline) to 3.25-3.5
   m/s at 20 mmHg. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Optical Spectral Surveillance of Breast Tissue Landscapes for Detection
   of Residual Disease in Breast Tumor Margins}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate a strategy to ``sense{''} the micro-morphology of a
   breast tumor margin over a wide field of view by creating quantitative
   hyperspectral maps of the tissue optical properties (absorption and
   scattering), where each voxel can be deconstructed to provide
   information on the underlying histology. Information about the
   underlying tissue histology is encoded in the quantitative spectral
   information (in the visible wavelength range), and residual carcinoma is
   detected as a shift in the histological landscape to one with less fat
   and higher glandular content. To demonstrate this strategy, fully
   intact, fresh lumpectomy specimens (n = 88) from 70 patients were imaged
   intra-operatively. The ability of spectral imaging to sense changes in
   histology over large imaging areas was determined using inter-patient
   mammographic breast density (MBD) variation in cancer-free tissues as a
   model system. We discovered that increased MBD was associated with
   higher baseline beta-carotene concentrations (p = 0.066) and higher
   scattering coefficients (p = 0.007) as measured by spectral imaging, and
   a trend toward decreased adipocyte size and increased adipocyte density
   as measured by histological examination in BMI-matched patients. The
   ability of spectral imaging to detect cancer intra-operatively was
   demonstrated when MBD-specific breast characteristics were considered.
   Specifically, the ratio of beta-carotene concentration to the light
   scattering coefficient can report on the relative amount of fat to
   glandular density at the tissue surface to determine positive margin
   status, when baseline differences in these parameters between patients
   with low and high MBD are taken into account by the appropriate
   selection of threshold values. When MBD was included as a variable a
   priori, the device was estimated to have a sensitivity of 74\% and a
   specificity of 86\% in detecting close or positive margins, regardless
   of tumor type. Superior performance was demonstrated in high MBD tissue,
   a population that typically has a higher percentage of involved margins.}},

Abstract = {{Sepsis is a common cause of death, but outcomes in individual patients
   are difficult to predict. Elucidating the molecular processes that
   differ between sepsis patients who survive and those who die may permit
   more appropriate treatments to be deployed. We examined the clinical
   features and the plasma metabolome and proteome of patients with and
   without community-acquired sepsis, upon their arrival at hospital
   emergency departments and 24 hours later. The metabolomes and proteomes
   of patients at hospital admittance who would ultimately die differed
   markedly from those of patients who would survive. The different
   profiles of proteins and metabolites clustered into the following
   groups: fatty acid transport and beta-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and
   the citric acid cycle. They differed consistently among several sets of
   patients, and diverged more as death approached. In contrast, the
   metabolomes and proteomes of surviving patients with mild sepsis did not
   differ from survivors with severe sepsis or septic shock. An algorithm
   derived from clinical features together with measurements of five
   metabolites predicted patient survival. This algorithm may help to guide
   the treatment of individual patients with sepsis.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer is associated with specific cellular morphological changes, such
   as increased nuclear size and crowding from rapidly proliferating cells.
   In situ tissue imaging using fluorescent stains may be useful for
   intraoperative detection of residual cancer in surgical tumor margins.
   We developed a widefield fluorescence structured illumination microscope
   (SIM) system with a single-shot FOV of 2.1x1.6 mm (3.4 mm(2)) and
   sub-cellular resolution (4.4 mu m). The objectives of this work were to
   measure the relationship between illumination pattern frequency and
   optical sectioning strength and signal-to-noise ratio in turbid (i.e.
   thick) samples for selection of the optimum frequency, and to determine
   feasibility for detecting residual cancer on tumor resection margins,
   using a genetically engineered primary mouse model of sarcoma. The SIM
   system was tested in tissue mimicking solid phantoms with various
   scattering levels to determine impact of both turbidity and illumination
   frequency on two SIM metrics, optical section thickness and modulation
   depth. To demonstrate preclinical feasibility, ex vivo 50 mu m frozen
   sections and fresh intact thick tissue samples excised from a primary
   mouse model of sarcoma were stained with acridine orange, which stains
   cell nuclei, skeletal muscle, and collagenous stroma. The cell nuclei
   were segmented using a high-pass filter algorithm, which allowed
   quantification of nuclear density. The results showed that the optimal
   illumination frequency was 31.7 mu m(-1) used in conjunction with a
   4x0.1 NA objective ((nu) over tilde = 0.165). This yielded an optical
   section thickness of 128 mu m and an 8.9xcontrast enhancement over
   uniform illumination. We successfully demonstrated the ability to
   resolve cell nuclei in situ achieved via SIM, which allowed segmentation
   of nuclei from heterogeneous tissues in the presence of considerable
   background fluorescence. Specifically, we demonstrate that optical
   sectioning of fresh intact thick tissues performed equivalently in
   regards to nuclear density quantification, to physical frozen sectioning
   and standard microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Electrorheological elastomers have broad and important applications.
   While existing studies mostly focus on microstructures of
   electrorheological elastomers, their mesoscale structures have been
   rarely investigated. We present a theory on the design of mesostructures
   of electrorheological elastomers that consist of two phases with
   different permittivity. We show that the deformation of elastomers can
   reorient their mesostructures, which consequently results in variations
   of their effective permittivity, leading to stiffening, softening, or
   instability of the elastomer. Optimal design of the mesostructures can
   give giant tunable stiffness. Our theoretical model is further validated
   by results from numerical simulations. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the bioaccumulation dynamics, biotransformation
   processes, or subsequent toxicity to consumers of dissolved selenite
   (SeO3) versus selenate (SeO4) uptake into aquatic primary producer
   communities. To address these data gaps, we examined SeO3 and SeO4
   bioconcentration into complex freshwater periphyton communities under
   static and static-renewal conditions. Further, we explored periphyton
   biotransformation of Se species using X-ray absorption near edge
   structure (XANES) spectroscopy analysis and changes in the periphyton
   associated microbial consortium using denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE). Last, we fed differentially treated periphyton
   to the mayfly Centroptilum triangulifer in full life cycle exposures to
   assess toxicity. Selenite exposed periphyton readily bioconcentrated Se
   while, in contrast, initial periphyton uptake of SeO4 was negligible,
   but over time periphyton {[}Se] increased steadily in conjunction with
   the formation of dissolved SeO3. XANES analyses revealed that both SeO3
   and SeO4 treated periphyton biotransformed Se similarly with speciation
   dominated by organo-selenide (similar to 61\%). Mayfly survival,
   secondary production, and time to emergence were similar in both SeO3
   and SeO4 treated periphyton exposures with significant adverse effects
   at 12.8 mu g g(-1) ((d.w.) secondary production) and 36 mu g g(-1)
   ((d.w.) survival and development time). Overall, dissolved selenium
   speciation, residence time, and organisms at the base of aquatic food
   webs appear to be the principal determinants of Se bioaccumulation and
   toxicity.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{We describe and demonstrate an architecture for active acoustic
   metamaterials whose effective material parameters can be tuned
   independently over a wide range of values, including negative material
   parameters. The approach is demonstrated experimentally through the
   design and measurement of two types of unit cells that generate
   metamaterials in which either the effective density or bulk modulus can
   be tuned. We show that these unit cells achieve negative refraction,
   negative effective mass density, significantly nonunity bulk modulus,
   and are suitable for the design of negative refraction media and media
   with tunable gain and absorption. In this architecture, a transducer
   senses the pressure wave incident on the metamaterial and an electronic
   circuit manipulates the electric signal produced and drives a second
   transducer that creates the acoustic response consistent with the
   desired effective material parameters. The electronics between the two
   transducers allows easy dynamic tuning of these parameters. We show that
   this approach can be applied to both broadband and narrow band designs.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common and often devastating form of
   human epilepsy. The molecular mechanism underlying the development of
   temporal lobe epilepsy remains largely unknown. Emerging evidence
   suggests that activation of the BDNF receptor TrkB promotes
   epileptogenesis caused by status epilepticus. We investigated a mouse
   model in which a brief episode of status epilepticus results in chronic
   recurrent seizures, anxiety-like behavior, and destruction of
   hippocannpal neurons. We used a chemical-genetic approach to selectively
   inhibit activation of TrkB. We demonstrate that inhibition of TrkB
   commencing after status epilepticus and continued for 2 weeks prevents
   recurrent seizures, ameliorates anxiety-like behavior, and limits loss
   of hippocampal neurons when tested weeks to months later. That transient
   inhibition commencing after status epilepticus can prevent these
   long-lasting devastating consequences establishes TrkB signaling as an
   attractive target for developing preventive treatments of epilepsy in
   humans.}},

Pages = {{3535-3551}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling of a rolling isolation platform used to
   protect objects from the hazards of horizontal shaking. The platform is
   built from four pairs of recessed steel bowls: four concave-up, attached
   to a shaking floor via a steel frame, and four concave-down, attached to
   the isolated object via a steel frame. Four steel ball-bearings, located
   between these bowls, allow the bottom- and top-frames to roll with
   respect to one another. In order for the four ball-bearings to remain in
   contact with the bowls during times of large angular rotation, the
   top-frame is assumed to conform to a saddle shape. The kinematics of the
   rolling contact impose a set of eight nonholonomic constraints to the
   translational and rotational dynamics of the platform center. The
   nonholonomic equations of state are found from the fundamental form of
   Lagrange's equation, which incorporates velocity constraints via
   Lagrange multipliers. A viscous damping model calibrated to experimental
   free-responses depends upon the mass of the isolated object. Precise
   photogrammetric measurements of a sample of these steel bowls provide
   the data required to calibrate the potential energy function for this
   system. It is shown that for the non-quadratic potential energy function
   of this particular system, free response trajectories are strongly
   sensitive to slight perturbations in initial conditions, and that the
   system is, in fact, chaotic. Even in the absence of any mass or
   stiffness eccentricity, translational and rotational motions are
   nonlinearly coupled through the constraint of slip-free rolling.
   Uni-axial models cannot be used to predict responses of these systems.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS)-based detection approach, referred to as ``molecular sentinel{''}
   (MS) plasmonic nanoprobes, to detect an RNA target related to viral
   infection. The MS method is essentially a label-free technique
   incorporating the SERS effect modulation scheme associated with silver
   nanoparticles and Raman dye-labeled DNA hairpin probes. Hybridization
   with target sequences opens the hairpin and spatially separates the
   Raman label from the silver surface thus reducing the SERS signal of the
   label. Herein, we have developed a MS nanoprobe to detect the human
   radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) RNA target as
   a model system for method demonstration. The human RSAD2 gene has
   recently emerged as a novel host-response biomarker for diagnosis of
   respiratory infections. Our results showed that the RSAD2 MS nanoprobes
   exhibits high specificity and can detect as low as 1 nM target
   sequences. With the use of a portable Raman spectrometer and total RNA
   samples, we have also demonstrated for the first time the potential of
   the MS nanoprobe technology for detection of host-response RNA
   biomarkers for infectious disease diagnostics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Development of a rapid, cost-effective, label-free biosensor for DNA
   detection is important for many applications in clinical diagnosis,
   homeland defense, and environment monitoring. A unique label free DNA
   biosensor based on Molecular Sentinel (MS) immobilized on a plasmonic
   `Nanowave' chip, which is also referred to as a metal film over
   nanosphere (MFON), is presented. Its sensing mechanism is based upon the
   decrease of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) intensity when
   Raman label tagged at one end of MS is physically separated from the
   MFON's surface upon DNA hybridization. This method is label free as the
   target does not have to be labeled. The MFON fabrication is relatively
   simple and low-cost with high reproducibility based on depositing a thin
   shell of gold over close packed arrays of nanospheres. The sensing
   process involves a single hybridization step between the DNA target
   sequences and the complementary MS probes, on the Nanowave chip without
   requiring secondary hybridization or posthybridization washing, thus
   resulting in rapid assay time and low reagent usage. The usefulness and
   potential application of the biosensor for medical diagnostics is
   demonstrated by detecting the human radical S-adenosyl methionine domain
   containing 2 (RSAD2) gene, a common inflammation biomarker.}},

Abstract = {{The authors introduce a three-parameter characterization of the wind
   speed dependence of the drag coefficient and apply a Bayesian formalism
   to infer values for these parameters from airborne expendable
   bathythermograph (AXBT) temperature data obtained during Typhoon Fanapi.
   One parameter is a multiplicative factor that amplifies or attenuates
   the drag coefficient for all wind speeds, the second is the maximum wind
   speed at which drag coefficient saturation occurs, and the third is the
   drag coefficient's rate of change with increasing wind speed after
   saturation. Bayesian inference provides optimal estimates of the
   parameters as well as a non-Gaussian probability distribution
   characterizing the uncertainty of these estimates. The efficiency of
   this approach stems from the use of adaptive polynomial expansions to
   build an inexpensive surrogate for the high-resolution numerical model
   that couples simulated winds to the oceanic temperature data,
   dramatically reducing the computational burden of the Markov chain Monte
   Carlo sampling. These results indicate that the most likely values for
   the drag coefficient saturation and the corresponding wind speed are
   about 2.3 x 10(-3) and 34ms(-1), respectively; the data were not
   informative regarding the drag coefficient behavior at higher wind
   speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors have recently developed a high-resolution
   microscope-integrated spectral domain optical coherence tomography
   (MIOCT) device designed to enable OCT acquisition simultaneous with
   surgical maneuvers. The purpose of this report is to describe
   translation of this device from preclinical testing into human
   intraoperative imaging.
   Methods: Before human imaging, surgical conditions were fully simulated
   for extensive preclinical MIOCT evaluation in a custom model eye system.
   Microscope-integrated spectral domain OCT images were then acquired in
   normal human volunteers and during vitreoretinal surgery in patients who
   consented to participate in a prospective institutional review
   board-approved study. Microscope-integrated spectral domain OCT images
   were obtained before and at pauses in surgical maneuvers and were
   compared based on predetermined diagnostic criteria to images obtained
   with a high-resolution spectral domain research handheld OCT system
   (HHOCT; Bioptigen, Inc) at the same time point. Cohorts of five
   consecutive patients were imaged. Successful end points were predefined,
   including >= 80\% correlation in identification of pathology between
   MIOCT and HHOCT in >= 80\% of the patients.
   Results: Microscope-integrated spectral domain OCT was favorably
   evaluated by study surgeons and scrub nurses, all of whom responded that
   they would consider participating in human intraoperative imaging
   trials. The preclinical evaluation identified significant improvements
   that were made before MIOCT use during human surgery. The MIOCT
   transition into clinical human research was smooth.
   Microscope-integrated spectral domain OCT imaging in normal human
   volunteers demonstrated high resolution comparable to tabletop scanners.
   In the operating room, after an initial learning curve, surgeons
   successfully acquired human macular MIOCT images before and after
   surgical maneuvers. Microscope-integrated spectral domain OCT imaging
   confirmed preoperative diagnoses, such as full-thickness macular hole
   and vitreomacular traction, and demonstrated post-surgical changes in
   retinal morphology. Two cohorts of five patients were imaged. In the
   second cohort, the predefined end points were exceeded with >= 80\%
   correlation between microscope-mounted OCT and HHOCT imaging in 100\% of
   the patients.
   Conclusion: This report describes high-resolution MIOCT imaging using
   the prototype device in human eyes during vitreoretinal surgery, with
   successful achievement of predefined end points for imaging. Further
   refinements and investigations will be directed toward fully integrating
   MIOCT with vitreoretinal and other ocular surgery to image surgical
   maneuvers in real time.}},

Abstract = {{While seasonally dry conditions are typical of large areas of the
   tropics, their biogeochemical responses to seasonal rainfall and soil
   carbon (C) sequestration potential are not well characterized. Seasonal
   moisture availability positively affects both productivity and soil
   respiration, resulting in a delicate balance between C deposition as
   litterfall and C loss through heterotrophic respiration. To understand
   how rainfall seasonality (i.e., duration of the wet season and rainfall
   distribution) affects this balance and to provide estimates of long-term
   C sequestration, we develop a minimal model linking the seasonal
   behavior of the ensemble soil moisture, plant productivity, related C
   inputs through litterfall, and soil C dynamics. A drought-deciduous
   caatinga ecosystem in northeastern Brazil is used as a case study to
   parameterize the model. When extended to different patterns of rainfall
   seasonality, the results indicate that for fixed annual rainfall, both
   plant productivity and soil C sequestration potential are largely, and
   nonlinearly, dependent on wet season duration. Moreover, total annual
   rainfall is a critical driver of this relationship, leading at times to
   distinct optima in both production and C storage. These theoretical
   predictions are discussed in the context of parameter uncertainties and
   possible changes in rainfall regimes in tropical dry ecosystems.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) enables high-resolution
   and high-contrast imaging of the retina by employing spatial filtering
   for scattered light rejection. However, to obtain optimized image
   quality, one must design the cSLO around scanner technology limitations
   and minimize the effects of ocular aberrations and imaging artifacts. We
   describe a cSLO design methodology resulting in a simple, relatively
   inexpensive, and compact lens-based cSLO design optimized to balance
   resolution and throughput for a 20-deg field of view (FOV) with minimal
   imaging artifacts. We tested the imaging capabilities of our cSLO design
   with an experimental setup from which we obtained fast and high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) retinal images. At lower FOVs, we were able
   to visualize parafoveal cone photoreceptors and nerve fiber bundles even
   without the use of adaptive optics. Through an experiment comparing our
   optimized cSLO design to a commercial cSLO system, we show that our
   design demonstrates a significant improvement in both image quality and
   resolution. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons

Abstract = {{Testing for small-delay defects (SDDs) requires fault-effect propagation
   along the longest testable paths. However, identification of the longest
   testable paths requires high CPU time, and the sensitization of all such
   paths leads to large pattern counts. Dynamic test compaction for
   small-delay defects is therefore necessary to reduce test-data volume.
   We present a new technique for identifying the longest testable paths
   through each gate in order to accelerate test generation for SDDs. The
   resulting test patterns sensitize the longest testable paths that pass
   through each SDD site. An efficient dynamic test compaction method based
   on structural analysis is presented to reduce the pattern count
   substantially, while ensuring that all the longest paths for each SDD
   are sensitized. Simulation results for a set of ISCAS 89 and IWLS 05
   benchmark circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.}},

Abstract = {{Issues such as hand and tracker jitter negatively affect user
   performance with 3D selection techniques based on the ray-casting
   metaphor. This makes it difficult for users to select objects that have
   a small visible area, since small targets require high levels of
   precision. We introduce an approach to address this issue that uses
   progressive refinement of the set of selectable objects to reduce the
   required precision of the task. We present three exemplar techniques
   (sphere-casting refined by QUAD menu (SQUAD), discrete zoom, and
   continuous zoom) and derive a preliminary design space for progressive
   refinement from their characteristics. We explore the trade-offs between
   progressive refinement and immediate selection techniques in two
   studies: first comparing SQUAD to ray-casting; and second comparing the
   zooming techniques to ray-casting. In both studies, an analytical
   evaluation based on a distal pointing model and an empirical evaluation
   demonstrates that progressive refinement selection can provide
   significant benefits compared to immediate techniques. In the first
   study, SQUAD was much more accurate than ray-casting, and SQUAD was
   faster than ray-casting with small targets and less cluttered
   environments. The issue with SQUAD, however, is that it requires all
   selectable objects to be visually distinct. The zooming techniques
   address this issue by exploring other areas of the progressive
   refinement design space. They allow users to use the spatial
   relationships among objects as criteria for selection and to increase
   precision without requiring precision in pointing. The results of the
   second study show that while the zooming techniques were significantly
   slower than ray-casting, accuracy was much higher. Additionally,
   depending on the size of the target, users chose not to use zoom and,
   therefore, performed as fast as with ray-casting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Differential Effects of Prostaglandin E-2-Sensitive Receptors on
   Contractility of Human Ocular Cells That Regulate Conventional Outflow}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The goal of this study was to functionally compare
   prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2))-sensitive receptors in human primary cells
   involved in conventional outflow.
   METHODS. The expression profile of prostaglandin (PG) receptors in
   primary cultures of human trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal
   (SC) cells were determined by quantitative-PCR. The functional
   activities of endogenous PGE(2)-sensitive receptors were evaluated using
   subtype-selective agonists and antagonists with cell impedance
   technology.
   RESULTS. Agonist-sensitive EP1, EP2, and EP4 receptors were present in
   TM cells, all increasing cell stiffness (or contractility) in a
   dose-dependent manner. Rank order of efficacy (E-max) for agonists in TM
   cells were EP1 greater than EP2 greater than EP4 with EC50 1.1 mu M,
   0.56 mu M, and 0.1 mu M, respectively, and no functional EP3 receptors
   were found. Of the four EP receptor subtypes active in SC cells, EP1 and
   EP3 receptor activation increased cell stiffness, while EP2 and EP4
   agonists dose-dependently decreased cell stiffness 47\% and 23\% with
   EC50 values of 170 nM and 69 nM, respectively. Consistent with these
   observations, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 decreased cell impedance
   (stiffness) of TM and SC cells (similar to 60\%), while Rho GTPase
   activator thrombin caused cell impedance to increase in both cell types
   (168\%-190\%).
   CONCLUSIONS. Cell impedance positively correlates with cellular
   stiffness/contractility. Because EP2/4 receptors caused decreased cell
   stiffness in SC, but not in TM cells, both receptors appear to mediate
   IOP lowering via changes in SC cell stiffness in the conventional
   outflow pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium-sensitive elastin-like polypeptides (CELPs) were synthesized by
   periodically interspersing a calcium-binding peptide sequence from

   exhibit the exquisite selectivity for calcium over other divalent

   were further used as a building block for the synthesis of
   calcium-sensitive nanoparticles by fusing a hydrophilic,

   hydrophobic upon calcium binding. We show that addition of calcium at

Abstract = {{Objective: To demonstrate the use of a novel controllable pulse
   parameter TMS (cTMS) device to characterize human corticospinal tract
   physiology.
   Methods: Motor threshold and input-output (IO) curve of right first
   dorsal interosseus were determined in 26 and 12 healthy volunteers,
   respectively, at pulse widths of 30, 60, and 120 mu s using a
   custom-built cTMS device. Strength-duration curve rheobase and time
   constant were estimated from the motor thresholds. IO slope was
   estimated from sigmoid functions fitted to the IO data.
   Results: All procedures were well tolerated with no seizures or other
   serious adverse events. Increasing pulse width decreased the motor
   threshold and increased the pulse energy and IO slope. The average
   strength-duration curve time constant is estimated to be 196 mu s, 95\%
   CI {[}181 mu s, 210 mu s]. IO slope is inversely correlated with motor
   threshold both across and within pulse width. A simple quantitative
   model explains these dependencies.
   Conclusions: Our strength-duration time constant estimate compares well
   to published values and may be more accurate given increased sample size
   and enhanced methodology. Multiplying the IO slope by the motor
   threshold may provide a sensitive measure of individual differences in
   corticospinal tract physiology.
   Significance: Pulse parameter control offered by cTMS provides enhanced
   flexibility that can contribute novel insights in TMS studies. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Local pH environment has been considered to be a potential biomarker for
   tumor diagnosis because solid tumors contain highly acidic environments.
   A pH-sensing nanoprobe based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
   using nanostars under near-infrared excitation has been developed for
   potential biomedical applications. To theoretically investigate the
   effect of protonation state on SERS spectra of p-mercaptobenzoic acid
   (pMBA), we used the density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP
   functional to calculate Raman vibrational spectra of pMBA-Au/Ag complex
   in both protonated and deprotonated states. Vibrational spectral bands
   were assigned with DFT calculation and used to investigate SERS spectral
   changes observed from experiment when varying pH value between five and
   nine. The SERS peak position of pMBA at similar to 1580cm(-1) was
   identified to be a novel pH-sensing index, which has small but
   noticeable downshift with pH increase. This phenomenon is confirmed and
   well-explained with theoretical simulation. The study demonstrates that
   SERS is a sensitive tool to monitor minor structural changes due to
   local pH environment, and DFT calculations can be used to investigate
   Raman spectra changes associated with minor differences in molecular
   structure. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{G1.9+0.3 is the youngest known Galactic supernova remnant (SNR), with an
   estimated supernova (SN) explosion date of similar to 1900, and most
   likely located near the Galactic center. Only the outermost ejecta
   layers with freeexpansion velocities greater than or similar to 18,000
   km s(-1) have been shocked so far in this dynamically young, likely Type
   Ia SNR. A long (980 ks) Chandra observation in 2011 allowed spatially
   resolved spectroscopy of heavy-element ejecta. We denoised Chandra data
   with the spatio-spectral method of Krishnamurthy et al., and used a
   wavelet-based technique to spatially localize thermal emission produced
   by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs; Si and S) and iron. The spatial
   distribution of both IMEs and Fe is extremely asymmetric, with the
   strongest ejecta emission in the northern rim. Fe K alpha emission is
   particularly prominent there, and fits with thermalmodels indicate
   strongly oversolar Fe abundances. In a localized, outlying region in the
   northern rim, IMEs are less abundant than Fe, indicating that undiluted
   Fe-group elements (including Ni-56) with velocities > 18,000 km s(-1)
   were ejected by this SN. However, in the inner west rim, we find Si-and
   S-rich ejecta without any traces of Fe, so high-velocity products of
   O-burning were also ejected. G1.9+0.3 appears similar to energetic Type
   Ia SNe such as SN 2010jn where iron-group elements at such high
   free-expansion velocities have been recently detected. The pronounced
   asymmetry in the ejecta distribution and abundance inhomogeneities are
   best explained by a strongly asymmetric SN explosion, similar to those
   produced in some recent three-dimensional delayed-detonation Type Ia
   models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 3-D diffraction tomographic algorithm is proposed for
   real-time through-the-wall radar imaging (TWRI). The spectral expansion
   of the three-layered medium dyadic Green's function is employed to
   derive a linear relationship between the spatial Fourier transforms of
   the image and the scattered field under Born approximation. Then, the
   image can be efficiently reconstructed with inverse fast Fourier
   transform (IFFT). The linearization of the inversion scheme and the easy
   implementation of the algorithm with FFT/IFFT make the diffraction
   tomographic TWRI algorithm suitable for on-site applications. The 3-D
   polarimetric TWRI is investigated using the proposed algorithm for the
   enhanced target detection and feature extraction as well as mitigation
   of the wall effect in the cross-polarization. Numerical and experimental
   results are presented to show the effectiveness and high efficiency of
   the proposed algorithm for 3-D real-time TWRI.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular and molecular MRI trafficking studies using superparamagnetic
   iron oxide (SPIO) have greatly improved non-invasive investigations of
   disease progression and drug efficacy, but thus far, these studies have
   largely been restricted to qualitative assessment of hypo- or
   hyperintense areas near SPIO. In this work, SPIO quantification using
   inversion recovery balanced steady-state free precession (IR-bSSFP) was
   demonstrated at 3 T by extracting R-2 values from a monoexponential
   model (P. Schmitt et al., 2004). A low flip angle was shown to reduce
   the apparent recovery rate of the IR-bSSFP time course, thus extending
   the dynamic range of quantification. However, low flip angle
   acquisitions preclude the use of traditional methods for combining RF
   phase-cycled images to reduce banding artifacts arising from
   off-resonance due to B-0 inhomogeneity. To achieve R-2 quantification of
   SPIO, we present a new algorithm applicable to low flip angle IR-bSSFP
   acquisitions that is specifically designed to identify on-resonance
   acquisitions. We demonstrate in this work, using both theoretical and
   empirical methods, that the smallest estimated R-2 from multiple RF
   phase-cycled acquisitions correspond well to the on-resonance time
   course. Using this novel minimum R-2 algorithm, homogeneous R-2 maps and
   linear R-2 calibration curves were created up to 100 mu g(Fe)/mL with 20
   degrees flip angles, despite substantial B-0 inhomogeneity. In addition,
   we have shown this technique to be feasible for pre-clinical research:
   the minimum R-2 algorithm was resistant to off-resonance in a single
   slice mouse R-2 map, whereas maximum intensity projection resulted in
   banding artifacts and overestimated R-2 values. With the application of
   recent advances in accelerated acquisitions, IR-bSSFP has the potential
   to quantify SPIO in vivo, thus providing important information for
   oncology, immunology, and regenerative medicine MRI studies. Crown

   models based on the physiology of microorganisms. CUE determines energy
   and material flows to higher trophic levels, conversion of
   plant-produced carbon into microbial products and rates of ecosystem
   carbon storage. Thermodynamic calculations support a maximum CUE value
   of similar to 0.60 (CUE max). Kinetic and stoichiometric constraints on
   microbial growth suggest that CUE in multi-resource limited natural
   systems should approach similar to 0.3 (CUE max/2). However, the mean
   CUE values reported for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems differ by
   twofold (similar to 0.26 vs. similar to 0.55) because the methods used
   to estimate CUE in aquatic and terrestrial systems generally differ and
   soil estimates are less likely to capture the full maintenance costs of
   community metabolism given the difficulty of measurements in
   water-limited environments. Moreover, many simulation models lack
   adequate representation of energy spilling pathways and stoichiometric
   constraints on metabolism, which can also lead to overestimates of CUE.
   We recommend that broad-scale models use a CUE value of 0.30, unless
   there is evidence for lower values as a result of pervasive nutrient
   limitations. Ecosystem models operating at finer scales should consider
   resource composition, stoichiometric constraints and biomass
   composition, as well as environmental drivers, to predict the CUE of
   microbial communities.}},

Abstract = {{Scaffolds fabricated from cartilage extracellular matrix provide a
   chondroinductive environment that stimulates cartilaginous matrix
   synthesis in a variety of cell types. A limitation of these
   cartilage-derived matrix (CDM) scaffolds is that they contract during in
   vitro culture, which unpredictably alters their shape. The current study
   examined the hypothesis that collagen crosslinking techniques could
   inhibit cell-mediated contraction of CDM scaffolds. We analyzed the
   effects of dehydrothermal (DHT) treatment, ultraviolet light irradiation
   (UV), and the chemical crosslinker carbodiimide (CAR) on scaffold
   contraction and chondrogenic differentiation of adult human bone
   marrow-derived stem cells (MSCs). Both physical and chemical
   crosslinking treatments retained the original scaffold dimensions. DHT
   and UV treatments produced significantly higher glycosaminoglycan and
   collagen contents than CAR crosslinked and non-crosslinked constructs.
   Crosslinking treatments influenced the composition of newly synthesized
   matrix, and DHT treatment best matched the composition of native
   cartilage. DHT, UV, and non-crosslinked CDM films supported cell
   attachment, while CAR crosslinking inhibited cell adhesion. These
   results affirm that collagen crosslinking treatments can prevent
   cell-mediated contraction of CDM scaffolds. Interestingly, crosslinking
   treatments influence chondrogenic differentiation. These effects seem to
   be mediated by modifications to cell-matrix interactions between MSCs
   and the CDM; however, further work is necessary to elucidate the
   specific mechanisms involved in this process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) provide a
   promising source for cell therapy and drug screening. Several high-yield
   protocols exist for hESC-CM production; however, methods to
   significantly advance hESC-CM maturation are still lacking. Building on
   our previous experience with mouse ESC-CMs, we investigated the effects
   of 3-dimensional (3D) tissue-engineered culture environment and
   cardiomyocyte purity on structural and functional maturation of
   hESC-CMs. 2D monolayer and 3D fibrin-based cardiac patch cultures were
   generated using dissociated cells from differentiated Hes2 embryoid
   bodies containing varying percentage (48-90\%) of CD172a
   (SIRPA)-positive cardiornyocytes. hESC-CMs within the patch were aligned
   uniformly by locally controlling the direction of passive tension.
   Compared to hESC-CMs in age (2 weeks) and purity (48-65\%) matched 20
   monolayers, hESC-CMs in 3D patches exhibited significantly higher
   conduction velocities (CVs), longer sarcomeres (2.09 +/- 0.02 vs. 1.77
   +/- 0.01 mu m), and enhanced expression of genes involved in cardiac
   contractile function, including cTnT, alpha MHC, CASQ2 and SERCA2. The
   CVs in cardiac patches increased with cardiomyocyte purity, reaching
   25.1 cm/s in patches constructed with 90\% hESC-CMs. Maximum contractile
   force amplitudes and active stresses of cardiac patches averaged to 3.0
   +/- 1.1 mN and 11.8 +/- 4.5 mN/mm(2), respectively. Moreover,
   contractile force per input cardiomyocyte averaged to 5.7 +/- 1.1
   nN/cell and showed a negative correlation with hESC-CM purity. Finally,
   patches exhibited significant positive inotropy with isoproterenol
   administration (1.7 +/- 0.3-fold force increase, EC50 = 95.1 nm). These
   results demonstrate highly advanced levels of hESC-CM maturation after 2
   weeks of 3D cardiac patch culture and carry important implications for
   future drug development and cell therapy studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Optimization of direct fibroblast reprogramming to cardiomyocytes using

Abstract = {{Direct conversion of fibroblasts to induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) has
   great potential for regenerative medicine. Recent publications have
   reported significant progress, but the evaluation of reprogramming has
   relied upon non-functional measures such as flow cytometry for
   cardiomyocyte markers or GFP expression driven by a
   cardiomyocyte-specific promoter. The issue is one of practicality: the
   most stringent measures - electrophysiology to detect cell excitation
   and the presence of spontaneously contracting myocytes - are not readily
   quantifiable in the large numbers of cells screened in reprogramming
   experiments. However, excitation and contraction are linked by a third
   functional characteristic of cardiomyocytes: the rhythmic oscillation of
   intracellular calcium levels. We set out to optimize direct conversion
   of fibroblasts to iCMs with a quantifiable calcium reporter to rapidly
   assess functional transdifferentiation. We constructed a reporter system
   in which the calcium indicator GCaMP is driven by the
   cardiomyocyte-specific Troponin T promoter. Using calcium activity as
   our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations
   of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse
   embryonic fibroblasts. The most effective combination consisted of
   Hand2, Nkx2.5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT). This combination is
   >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with
   cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and
   spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of
   reprogramming factors. HNGMT is also significantly more effective than
   previously published factor combinations for the transdifferentiation of
   adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts to iCMs. Quantification of calcium
   function is a convenient and effective means for the identification and
   evaluation of cardiomyocytes generated by direct reprogramming. Using
   this stringent outcome measure, we conclude that HNGMT produces iCMs
   more efficiently than previously published methods. (C) 2013 The

   areas. The area shapes are viewed systematically such that the total
   heat transfer rate between ground and buried assemblies is maximum. For
   each shape of the large assembly, the best shape of each smaller
   assembly is the most slender that can be installed on its available
   territory. This feature of the neighborhood design does not change when

Abstract = {{We report on a study seeking an optimized contact configuration for
   organic transistors that minimizes contact effects but maintains
   smallest contact size. We begin with the bulk access resistance in
   staggered transistors which results from the charge transport through
   the organic semiconductor film. Bulk access resistance is an intrinsic
   contributor to the contact resistance which has been little understood
   due to lack of a reliable study tool. In this work, we utilize the inner
   transported power inside the semiconductor film as a medium to
   investigate the contact resistance and the relevant contact effects. We
   examine the influences of the organic film thickness (t(SC)), the
   channel length (L), the underlying charge transport and various organic
   semiconductor materials with variable carrier mobility. A roughly
   optimal contact length (L-C) of L-CO approximate to 6t(SC) is obtained.
   The results reveal that besides the device architecture the underlying
   charge transport should be also taken into account in designing organic
   transistors for practical application. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   nonspecific nature of treatment, prohibiting therapy that is aggressive
   and prolonged enough to eliminate all malignant cells. As an
   alternative, bispecific antibodies can redirect the immune system to
   eliminate malignant cells with exquisite potency and specificity. We
   have recently developed an EGF receptor variant III (EGFRvIII)-targeted
   bispecific antibody that redirects T cells to eliminate
   EGFRvIII-expressing GBM. The absolute tumor specificity of EGFRvIII and
   the lack of immunologic crossreactivity with healthy cells allow this
   therapeutic to overcome limitations associated with the nonspecific
   nature of the current standard of care for GBM. Evidence indicates that
   the molecule can exert therapeutically significant effects in the CNS
   following systemic administration. Additional advantages in terms of
   ease-of-production and off-the-shelf availability further the clinical
   utility of this class of therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{Cartilage degeneration with osteoarthritis (OA) is believed to involve
   the activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1), which exists as alpha and beta
   isoforms. The goal of this study was to measure the concentrations of
   both isoforms of IL-1 in the synovial fluid of normal and spontaneously
   osteoarthritic porcine knees, and to test the hypothesis that
   physiologic concentrations of IL-1 and IL-1 exhibit different potencies
   in activating calcium signaling, the production of matrix
   metalloproteinases and nitric oxide, and the loss of proteoglycans and
   tissue mechanical properties in cartilage and meniscus. Median
   concentrations of IL-1 were 0.043ng/ml with mild OA and 0.288ng/ml with
   moderate OA, whereas IL-1 concentrations were 0.109ng/ml with mild OA
   and 0.122ng/ml with moderate OA. Both isoforms induced calcium signaling
   in chondrocytes and meniscal cells at all concentrations. Overall,
   cartilage and meniscus catabolism was significantly more sensitive to
   IL-1 than IL-1 at concentrations of 1ng/ml or less, while few
   differences were observed between the two forms at 10ng/ml. These data
   provide a range of physiologic IL-1 concentrations that can serve as a
   framework for the comparison of various in vitro studies, as well as
   providing further insight for the development of anti-cytokine therapies

Abstract = {{Because of the limitations of surgical resection, thermal ablation is
   commonly used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver

   This review presents a novel approach for extending treatment out to the
   margins where temperatures do not provide complete treatment with
   ablation alone, by combining thermal ablation with drug-loaded
   thermosensitive liposomes. A history of the development of
   thermosensitive liposomes is presented. Clinical trials have shown that
   the combination of radiofrequency ablation and doxorubicin-loaded

Title = {{Elastomeric microparticles for acoustic mediated bioseparations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Acoustophoresis has been utilized successfully in
   applications including cell trapping, focusing, and purification. One
   current limitation of acoustophoresis for cell sorting is the reliance
   on the inherent physical properties of cells (e.g., compressibility,
   density) instead of selecting cells based upon biologically relevant
   surface-presenting antigens. Introducing an acoustophoretic cell sorting
   approach that allows biochemical specificity may overcome this
   limitation, thus advancing the value of acoustophoresis approaches for
   both the basic research and clinical fields.
   Results: The results presented herein demonstrate the ability for
   negative acoustic contrast particles (NACPs) to specifically capture and
   transport positive acoustic contrast particles (PACPs) to the antinode
   of an ultrasound standing wave. Emulsification and post curing of
   pre-polymers, either polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or
   polyvinylmethylsiloxane (PVMS), within aqueous surfactant solution
   results in the formation of stable NACPs that focus onto pressure
   antinodes. We used either photochemical reactions with
   biotin-tetrafluorophenyl azide (biotin-TFPA) or end-functionalization of
   Pluronic F108 surfactant to biofunctionalize NACPs. These biotinylated
   NACPs bind specifically to streptavidin polystyrene microparticles (as
   cell surrogates) and transport them to the pressure antinode within an
   acoustofluidic chip.
   Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   demonstration of using NACPs as carriers for transport of PACPs in an
   ultrasound standing wave. By using different silicones (i.e., PDMS,
   PVMS) and curing chemistries, we demonstrate versatility of silicone
   materials for NACPs and advance the understanding of useful approaches
   for preparing NACPs. This bioseparation scheme holds potential for
   applications requiring rapid, continuous separations such as sorting and
   analysis of cells and biomolecules.}},

   Oscillators with saddle-node, pitchfork and transcritical bifurcations
   are shown analytically to exhibit several interesting characteristics in
   the free decay response near a bifurcation. A simple mechanical
   oscillator with a transcritical bifurcation is used to experimentally
   verify the analytical results. A transcritical bifurcation was selected
   because it may be used to represent generic bifurcation behaviour. It is
   shown that the damping ratio can be used to predict a change in the
   stability with respect to changing system parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal and spatial development of sprite-producing lightning
   flashes is examined with coordinated observations over an asymmetric
   mesoscale convective system (MCS) on 29 June 2011 near the Oklahoma
   Lightning Mapping Array (LMA). Sprites produced by a total of 26
   lightning flashes were observed simultaneously on video from Bennett,
   Colorado and Hawley, Texas, enabling a triangulation of sprites in
   comparison with temporal development of parent lightning (in particular,
   negatively charged stepped leaders) in three-dimensional space. In
   general, prompt sprites produced within 20ms after the causative stroke
   are less horizontally displaced (typically <30km) from the ground stroke
   than delayed sprites, which usually occur over 40ms after the stroke
   with significant lateral offsets (>30km). However, both prompt and
   delayed sprites are usually centered within 30km of the geometric center
   of relevant LMA sources (with affinity to negative stepped leaders)
   during the prior 100ms interval. Multiple sprites appearing as
   dancing/jumping events associated with a single lightning flash could be
   produced either by distinct strokes of the flash, by a single stroke
   through a series of current surges superposed on an intense continuing
   current, or by both. Our observations imply that sprites elongated in
   one direction are sometimes linked to in-cloud leader structure with the
   same elongation, and sprites that were more symmetric were produced
   above the progression of multiple negative leaders. This suggests that
   the large-scale structure of sprites could be affected by the in-cloud
   geometry of positive charge removal. Based on an expanded dataset of 39
   sprite-parent flashes by including more sprites recorded by one single
   camera over the same MCS, the altitude (above mean sea level, MSL) of
   positively charged cloud region tapped by sprite-producing strokes
   declined gradually from similar to 10km MSL (-35 degrees C) to around
   6km MSL (-10 degrees C) as the MCS evolved through the mature stage. On
   average, the positive charge removal by causative strokes of sprites
   observed on 29 June is centered at 3.6km above the freezing level or at
   7.9km above ground level.}},

Abstract = {{Monodisperse high molar mass elastin-like polypeptide macromonomers
   comprising 20 pentasequences (M = 8332 g/mol) were radically polymerized
   to high degrees of polymerization P-w=590. Polymerization was conducted
   in water well above the lower phase transition temperature, i.e., in the
   phase separated regime. The resulting polymers adopt a cylindrical shape
   as demonstrated by AFM pictures of solutions spin-cast on mica. The
   directional persistence of the cylindrical brushes was determined by
   static light scattering to Kuhn statistical segments lengths l(k) = 120
   nm at 5 mM aqueous NaCl solution which decreased to l(k) = 54 nm at 0.65
   M NaCl. Upon polymerization the phase transition temperature drops
   significantly and the transition interval becomes sharper. The change of
   the hydrodynamic radius of the cylindrical brushes was monitored by
   dynamic light scattering as a function of temperature and revealed a
   continuous decrease from 20 to 36 degrees C, above of which aggregates
   of several hundred nm in size start to form prior to phase separation.}},

Pages = {{3134-3147}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the formulation of nonlinear feedback controllers
   for stochastically excited vibratory energy harvesters. Maximizing the
   average power generated from such systems requires the transducer
   current to be regulated using a bi-directional power electronic
   converter. There are many applications where the implementation of these
   types of converters is infeasible, due to the higher parasitic losses
   they must sustain. If instead the transducer current is regulated using
   a converter capable of single-directional power-flow, then these
   parasitic losses can be reduced significantly. However, the constraint
   on the power-flow directionality restricts the domain of feasible
   feedback laws. The only feasible linear feedback law imposes a static
   relationship between current and voltage, i.e., a static admittance. In
   stochastic response, the power generation performance can be enhanced
   significantly beyond that of the optimal static admittance, using
   nonlinear feedback. In this paper, a general approach to nonlinear
   control synthesis for power-flow-constrained energy harvesters is
   presented, which is analytically guaranteed to outperform the optimal
   static admittance in stationary stochastic response. Simulation results
   are presented for a single-degree-of-freedom resonant oscillator with an
   electromagnetic transducer, as well as for a piezoelectric bimorph
   cantilever beam. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{The computational complexity of the brain depends in part on a neuron's
   capacity to integrate electrochemical information from vast numbers of
   synaptic inputs. The measurements of synaptic activity that are crucial
   for mechanistic understanding of brain function are also challenging,
   because they require intracellular recording methods to detect and
   resolve millivolt-scale synaptic potentials. Although glass electrodes
   are widely used for intracellular recordings, novel electrodes with
   superior mechanical and electrical properties are desirable, because
   they could extend intracellular recording methods to challenging
   environments, including long term recordings in freely behaving animals.
   Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can theoretically deliver this advance, but the
   difficulty of assembling CNTs has limited their application to a coating
   layer or assembly on a planar substrate, resulting in electrodes that
   are more suitable for in vivo extracellular recording or extracellular
   recording from isolated cells. Here we show that a novel, yet remarkably
   simple, millimeter-long electrode with a sub-micron tip, fabricated from
   self-entangled pure CNTs can be used to obtain intracellular and
   extracellular recordings from vertebrate neurons in vitro and in vivo.
   This fabrication technology provides a new method for assembling
   intracellular electrodes from CNTs, affording a promising opportunity to
   harness nanotechnology for neuroscience applications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a robust tool for quantitative in situ pathology
   that allows visualization of heterogeneous tissue morphology and
   segmentation and quantification of image features.
   Materials and Methods: Tissue excised from a genetically engineered
   mouse model of sarcoma was imaged using a subcellular resolution
   microendoscope after topical application of a fluorescent anatomical
   contrast agent: acriflavine. An algorithm based on sparse component
   analysis (SCA) and the circle transform (CT) was developed for image
   segmentation and quantification of distinct tissue types. The accuracy
   of our approach was quantified through simulations of tumor and muscle
   images. Specifically, tumor, muscle, and tumor+muscle tissue images were
   simulated because these tissue types were most commonly observed in
   sarcoma margins. Simulations were based on tissue characteristics
   observed in pathology slides. The potential clinical utility of our
   approach was evaluated by imaging excised margins and the tumor bed in a
   cohort of mice after surgical resection of sarcoma.
   Results: Simulation experiments revealed that SCA+CT achieved the lowest
   errors for larger nuclear sizes and for higher contrast ratios (nuclei
   intensity/background intensity). For imaging of tumor margins, SCA+CT
   effectively isolated nuclei from tumor, muscle, adipose, and
   tumor+muscle tissue types. Differences in density were correctly
   identified with SCA+CT in a cohort of ex vivo and in vivo images, thus
   illustrating the diagnostic potential of our approach.
   Conclusion: The combination of a subcellular-resolution microendoscope,
   acriflavine staining, and SCA+CT can be used to accurately isolate
   nuclei and quantify their density in anatomical images of heterogeneous
   tissue.}},

Abstract = {{We report and analyze 3 years of lightning impulse charge moment change
   (iCMC) measurements obtained from an automated, real time lightning
   charge moment change network (CMCN). The CMCN combines U.S. National
   Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) lightning event geolocations with
   extremely low frequency (less than or similar to 1 kHz) data from two
   stations to provide iCMC measurements across the entire United States.
   Almost 14 million lightning events were measured in the 3 year period.
   We present the statistical distributions of iCMC versus polarity and
   NLDN-measured peak current, including corrections for the detection
   efficiency of the CMCN versus peak current. We find a broad distribution
   of iCMC for a given peak current, implying that these parameters are at
   best only weakly correlated. Curiously, the mean iCMC does not
   monotonically increase with peak current, and in fact, drops for
   positive CG strokes above +150 kA. For all positive strokes, there is a
   boundary near 20 C km that separates seemingly distinct populations of
   high and low iCMC strokes. We also explore the geographic distribution
   of high iCMC lightning strokes. High iCMC positive strokes occur
   predominantly in the northern midwest portion of the U.S., with a
   secondary peak over the gulf stream region just off the U.S. east coast.
   High iCMC negative strokes are also clustered in the midwest, although
   somewhat south of most of the high iCMC positive strokes. This is a
   region far from the locations of maximum occurrence of high peak current
   negative strokes. Based on assumed iCMC thresholds for sprite
   production, we estimate that approximately 35,000 positive polarity and
   350 negative polarity sprites occur per year over the U.S. land and
   near-coastal areas. Among other applications, this network is useful for
   the nowcasting of sprite-producing storms and storm regions.}},

Abstract = {{Oral tolerance is defined as the specific suppression of humoral and/or
   cellular immune responses to an antigen by administration of the same
   antigen through the oral route. Due to its absence of toxicity, easy
   administration, and antigen specificity, oral tolerance is a very
   attractive approach to prevent unwanted immune responses that cause a
   variety of diseases or that complicate treatment of a disease. Many
   researchers have induced oral tolerance to efficiently treat autoimmune
   and inflammatory diseases in different animal models. However, clinical
   trials yielded limited success. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of
   oral tolerance induction to therapeutic proteins is critical for paving
   the way for clinical development of oral tolerance protocols. This
   review will summarize progress on understanding the major underlying
   tolerance mechanisms and contributors, including antigen presenting
   cells, regulatory T cells, cytokines, and signaling pathways. Potential
   applications, examples for therapeutic proteins and disease targets, and
   recent developments in delivery methods are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Oral delivery is an attractive route to deliver therapeutics via
   nanoparticles due to its ease of administration and patient compliance.
   This review discusses laboratory techniques for studying oral delivery
   of nanoparticles, which offer protection of cargo through the
   gastrointestinal tract. Some of the difficulties in modeling oral
   delivery include the harsh acidic environment, variable pH, and the
   tight monolayer of endothelial cells present throughout the
   gastrointestinal tract. The use of in vitro techniques including the
   Transwell (R) system, simulated gastric/intestinal fluid, and diffusion
   chambers addresses these challenges. When studying effects after oral
   delivery in vivo, bioimaging of nanoparticle biodistribution using
   radioactive markers has been popular. Functional assays such as immune
   response and systemic protein concentration analysis can further define
   the merits of the oral delivery systems. As biologics become
   increasingly more important in chronic therapies, nanoparticle-mediated
   oral delivery will assume greater prominence, and more sophisticated in
   vitro and in vivo models will be required. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We present a dynamic finite element formulation for dielectric
   elastomers that significantly alleviates the problem of volumetric
   locking that occurs due to the incompressible nature of the elastomers.
   We accomplish this by modifying the Q1P0 formulation of Simo et al.
   {[}1], and adapting it to the electromechanical coupling that occurs in
   dielectric elastomers. We demonstrate that volumetric locking has a
   significant impact on the critical electric fields that are necessary to
   induce electromechanical instabilities such as creasing and cratering in
   dielectric elastomers, and that the locking effects are most severe in
   problems related to recent experiments that involve significant
   constraints upon the deformation of the elastomers. We then compare the
   results using the new Q1P0 formulation to that obtained using standard
   8-node linear and 27-node quadratic hexahedral elements to demonstrate
   the capability of the proposed approach. Finally, direct comparison to
   the recent experimental work on the creasing instability on dielectric
   polymer surface by Wang et al. {[}2] is presented. The present
   formulation demonstrates good agreement to experiment for not only the
   critical electric field for the onset of the creasing instability, but
   also the experimentally observed average spacing between the creases.

Abstract = {{Extensive research on organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) performed
   to date investigated separately the electronic contact and the gate
   dielectric interfaces but rarely probed the relation between the two. In
   this report, the strong impact of the gate dielectric on the contact
   resistance (R-c) is revealed. With the same semiconductor
   dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene (C8-BTBT) and the same device
   configuration, the R-c value varies greatly from 10 to 66 k Omega.m
   depending on the gate dielectric interfaces. Also, the gate-voltage
   dependency of R-c exhibits an unexpectedly large discrepancy when
   different dielectrics are used. Intuitive comprehension points to the
   possibility that the gate dielectric interface affects the morphology of
   semiconductor and thus the charge injection. However, from
   microstructure study, albeit the semiconductor film exhibits structural
   defects on certain dielectrics, the impact on the injection is not
   crucial. Instead, bias-stress test correlates well with the contact
   resistance on different dielectric interfaces. At a quantitative level,
   gate-voltage-dependent R-c can be described by taking into account the
   different charge trapping induced by the gate dielectrics. The origin of
   the varied R-c is thus attributed to the trapped charges, which screen
   the gate field and reduce the carrier mobility simultaneously. A general
   method is proposed to examine whether the charge injection is
   significantly influenced by the charge trapping effect due to the gate
   dielectrics.}},

Title = {{Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiac Progenitors Differentiate
   to Cardiomyocytes and Form Biosynthetic Tissues}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The mammalian heart has little capacity to regenerate, and following
   injury the myocardium is replaced by non-contractile scar tissue.
   Consequently, increased wall stress and workload on the remaining
   myocardium leads to chamber dilation, dysfunction, and heart failure.
   Cell-based therapy with an autologous, epigenetically reprogrammed, and
   cardiac-committed progenitor cell source could potentially reverse this
   process by replacing the damaged myocardium with functional tissue.
   However, it is unclear whether cardiac progenitor cell-derived
   cardiomyocytes are capable of attaining levels of structural and
   functional maturity comparable to that of terminally-fated
   cardiomyocytes. Here, we first describe the derivation of mouse induced
   pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which once differentiated allow for the
   enrichment of Nkx2-5(+) cardiac progenitors, and the
   cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the red fluorescent protein. We
   show that the cardiac progenitors are multipotent and capable of
   differentiating into endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and
   cardiomyocytes. Moreover, cardiac progenitor selection corresponds to
   cKit(+) cell enrichment, while cardiomyocyte cell-lineage commitment is
   concomitant with dual expression of either cKit/Flk1 or cKit/Sca-1. We
   proceed to show that the cardiac progenitor-derived cardiomyocytes are
   capable of forming electrically and mechanically coupled large-scale 2D
   cell cultures with mature electrophysiological properties. Finally, we
   examine the cell progenitors' ability to form electromechanically
   coherent macroscopic tissues, using a physiologically relevant 3D
   culture model and demonstrate that following long-term culture the
   cardiomyocytes align, and form robust electromechanical connections
   throughout the volume of the biosynthetic tissue construct. We conclude
   that the iPS cell-derived cardiac progenitors are a robust cell source
   for tissue engineering applications and a 3D culture platform for
   pharmacological screening and drug development studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the use of weighting matrices to improve the
   harmonic balance identification (HBID) method for identifying nonlinear
   oscillators. While the notation for adding weighting matrices has been
   previously introduced, typical strategies for developing weighting
   matrices cannot be applied to the HBID method since the variance
   structure of each observation is identical. A new approach is presented
   based on the signal to noise ratio of each harmonic. This new weighting
   strategy is shown to improve the accuracy of the estimated parameters
   from data with Gaussian, uniform, and Laplacian noise distributions.
   In addition, the paper explores the relationship between the accuracy of
   the estimated parameters and the range of phase space transversed by a
   steady-state response. It is shown that small oscillations in a double
   well oscillator can be used to accurately estimate the system
   parameters. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pristine silver nanopartides (AgNPs) are not chemically stable in the
   environment and react strongly with inorganic ligands such as sulfide
   and chloride once the silver is oxidized. Understanding the
   environmental transformations of AgNPs in the presence of specific
   inorganic ligands is crucial to determining their fate and toxicity in
   the environment. Chloride (Cl-) is a ubiquitous ligand with a strong
   affinity for oxidized silver and is often Present in natural waters and
   in bacterial growth media. Though chloride can strongly affect toxicity
   results for AgNPs, their interaction is rarely considered and is
   challenging to study because of the numerous soluble and solid Ag-Cl
   species that can form depending on the Cl/Ag ratio. Consequently, little
   is known about the stability and dissolution kinetics of AgNPs in the
   presence of chloride ions. Our study focuses on the dissolution behavior
   Of AgNPs in chloride-containing systems and also investigates the effect
   of chloride on the growth inhibition of E.coli (ATCC strain 33876)
   caused by Ag toxicity. Our results suggest that the kinetics of
   dissolution are strongly dependent on the Cl/Ag ratio and can be
   interpreted using the thermodynamically expected speciation of Ag in the
   presence of chloride. We also show that the toxicity of AgNPs to E.coli
   at;various Cl- concentrations is governed by the amount, of dissolved
   AgClx(x-1)- species suggesting an ion effect rather than a nanoparticle
   effect.}},

Abstract = {{Generation of functional cells from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs)
   through in vitro differentiation is a promising approach for drug
   screening and cell therapy. However, the observed large and unavoidable
   variation in the differentiation potential of different human embryonic
   stem cell (hESC)/induced PSC (iPSC) lines makes the selection of an
   appropriate cell line for the differentiation of a particular cell
   lineage difficult. Here, we report identification of WNT3 as a biomarker
   capable of predicting definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation potential
   of hESCs. We show that the mRNA level of WNT3 in hESCs correlates with
   their DE differentiation efficiency. In addition, manipulations of hESCs
   through WNT3 knockdown or overexpression can respectively inhibit or
   promote DE differentiation in a WNT3 level-dependent manner. Finally,
   analysis of several hESC lines based on their WNT3expression levels
   allowed accurate prediction of their DE differentiation potential.
   Collectively, our study supports the notion that WNT3 can serve as a
   biomarker for predicting DE differentiation potential of hESCs.}},

Abstract = {{We report the electronic structures of Ta-doped anatase TiO2 thin films
   grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with varying magnetization using
   a combination of first-principles calculations and near-edge x-ray
   absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The roles of Ta doping
   and Ti vacancies are clarified, and the observed room-temperature
   ferromagnetism is attributed to the localized magnetic moments at Ti
   vacancy sites ferromagnetically ordered by electron charge carriers. O
   K-edge spectra exhibit significant polarization dependence which is
   discussed and supported by first-principles calculations in relation to
   both the crystal symmetry and the formation of defects. In particular,
   anomalous spectral-weight transfer across the entire O K edge for the
   ferromagnetic thin film is associated exclusively with the occurrence of
   Ti vacancies and strong correlation effects, which result in the
   enhancement of the direct interaction between oxygen sites and of the
   anisotropy of the e(g)-p(sigma) hybridizations in the out-of-plane
   component. Our results show that O K-edge NEXAFS spectra can provide
   reliable experimental probes capable of revealing cationic defects that
   are intimately related to the ferromagnetism in transition metal oxides.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of radio frequency (RF) emissions by terrestrial gamma-ray
   flashes (TGFs) is developed. These radio emissions, which are separate
   from the emission caused by lightning, are produced by the electric
   currents generated by runaway electrons and resulting low-energy
   electrons and ions. It is found from theory that the radio frequency
   pulses produced by TGFs are large enough to measure. Features of these
   signals depend strongly on certain aspects of the runaway acceleration
   process and so should provide additional information about the source
   mechanism(s) of this interesting atmospheric phenomenon. The RF
   emissions from several TGF models are calculated and compared with
   measurements of TGF-associated radio pulses, and it is found that the
   measured energy densities at higher frequencies support a source
   mechanism that involves a very large (>10(4)) number of distinct seed
   particle injections. In particular, the results are consistent with the
   relativistic feedback discharge model of TGFs.}},

Abstract = {{Gaussian factor models have proven widely useful for parsimoniously
   characterizing dependence in multivariate data. There is rich literature
   on their extension to mixed categorical and continuous variables, using
   latent Gaussian variables or through generalized latent trait models
   accommodating measurements in the exponential family. However, when
   generalizing to non-Gaussian measured variables, the latent variables
   typically influence both the dependence structure and the form of the
   marginal distributions, complicating interpretation and introducing
   artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a novel class of Bayesian
   Gaussian copula factor models that decouple the latent factors from the
   marginal distributions. A semiparametric specification for the marginals
   based on the extended rank likelihood yields straightforward
   implementation and substantial computational gains. We provide new
   theoretical and empirical justifications for using this likelihood in
   Bayesian inference. We propose new default priors for the factor
   loadings and develop efficient parameter-expanded Gibbs sampling for
   posterior computation. The methods are evaluated through simulations and
   applied to a dataset in political science. The models in this article
   are implemented in the R package bfa (available from
   http://stat.duke.edu/jsm38/software/bfa). Supplementary materials for
   this article are available online.}},

Title = {{Choroid Development and Feasibility of Choroidal Imaging in the Preterm

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To determine whether choroidal imaging is feasible in preterm
   and term infants using an 840-nm portable spectral domain optical
   coherence tomography (SD-OCT) system without the use of enhanced-depth
   imaging techniques and to assess choroidal development by comparing
   choroidal thickness of preterm infants, term infants, and adults.
   METHODS. SD-OCT images were obtained from 86 preterm infants, 59 term
   infants, and nine adults using a portable SD-OCT system plus nine adults
   using a tabletop system. An unprocessed image across the macula from one
   randomly selected eye of each participant was selected for determination
   of whether the choroidal-scleral junction (CSJ) could be visualized and
   for measurement of choroidal thickness.
   RESULTS. Subfoveal CSJ was visualized in 96\% of young-preterm infants
   (imaged from 30-36 weeks postmenstrual age {[}PMA]); 78\% of term-aged
   preterm infants (imaged from 37-42 weeks PMA); 49\% of term infants; and
   39\% of adult subjects. Racial pigmentation did not affect CSJ
   visibility in young-preterm infants (P = 0.57). Subfoveal choroidal
   thickness (SFCT) in young-preterm infants, term-aged preterm infants,
   term infants, and adults was 176 +/- 53 mu m, 289 +/- 92 mu m, 329 +/-
   66 mu m, and 258 +/- 66 mu m, respectively, and these were all
   statistically significantly different from one another except term-aged
   preterms to adults.
   CONCLUSIONS. Infant choroid can be imaged with a portable SD-OCT system
   without enhanced depth imaging. Melanin in the RPE and choroid does not
   hinder outer choroidal imaging in young-preterm infants without advanced
   retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In preterm infants, choroidal
   thickness increased with age but was thinner when compared to term
   infants suggesting delayed development due to ROP.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well appreciated that programmed cell death (PCD) plays
   critical roles in the life cycle of diverse bacterial species. It is an
   apparently paradoxical behavior as it does not benefit the cells
   undergoing PCD. However, growing evidence suggests that PCD can be
   `altruistic': the dead cells may directly or indirectly benefit
   survivors through generation of public goods. This property provides a
   potential explanation on how PCD can evolve as an extreme form of
   cooperation, although many questions remain to be addressed. From
   another perspective, as PCD plays a critical role in bacterial
   pathogenesis, it has been proposed as a potential target for new
   antibacterial therapy. To this end, understanding the population and
   evolutionary dynamics resulting from PCD and public goods production may
   be a key to the success of designing effective antibiotic treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Phospholipid-based nanomaterials are of interest in several applications
   including drug delivery, sensing, energy harvesting, and as model
   systems in basic research. However, a general challenge in creating
   functional hybrid biomaterials from phospholipid assemblies is their
   fragility, instability in air, Insolubility in water, and the difficulty
   of integrating them into useful composites that retain or enhance the
   properties of interest, therefore limiting there use In integrated
   devices. We document the synthesis and characterization of highly
   ordered and stable phospholipid silica thin films that resemble
   multilamellar architectures present In nature such as the myelin sheath.
   We have used a near room temperature chemical vapor deposition method to
   synthesize these robust functional materials. Highly ordered lipid films
   are exposed to vapors of silica precursor resulting in the formation of
   nanostructured hybrid assemblies. This process Is simple, scalable, and
   offers advantages such as exclusion of ethanol and no (or minimal) need
   for exposure to mineral acids, which are generally required in
   conventional sol gel synthesis strategies. The structure of the
   phospholipid silica assemblies can be tuned to either lamellar or
   hexagonal organization depending on the synthesis conditions. The
   phospholipid silica films exhibit long-term structural stability in air
   as well as when placed in aqueous solutions and maintain their fluidity
   under aqueous or humid conditions. This platform provides a model for
   robust implementation of phospholipid multilayers and a means toward
   future applications of functional phospholipid supramolecular assemblies
   in device integration.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2381-2386}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This work demonstrates that metal nanowires in a percolating network can
   reversibly slide across one another. Reversible sliding allows networks
   of metal nanowires to maintain electrical contact while being stretched
   to strains greater than the fracture strain for individual nanowires.
   This phenomenon was demonstrated by using networks of nanowires as
   compliant electrodes for a dielectric elastomer actuator. Reversible
   nanowire sliding enabled actuation to a maximum area strain of 200\% and
   repetitive cycling of the actuator to an area strain of 25\% over 150
   times. During actuation, the transmittance of the network increased 4.5
   times, from 13\% to 58\%. Compared to carbon based compliant electrodes,
   networks of metal nanowires can actuate across a broader range of
   optical transmittance. The widely tunable transmittance of
   nanowire-based actuators allows for their use as a light valve.}},

Abstract = {{We present a reduced-dimension multiuser detector (RD-MUD) structure for
   synchronous systems that significantly decreases the number of required
   correlation branches at the receiver front end, while still achieving
   performance similar to that of the conventional matched-filter (MF)
   bank. RD-MUD exploits the fact that, in some wireless systems, the
   number of active users may be small relative to the total number of
   users in the system. Hence, the ideas of analog compressed sensing may
   be used to reduce the number of correlators. The correlating signals
   used by each correlator are chosen as an appropriate linear combination
   of the users' spreading waveforms. We derive the probability of symbol
   error when using two methods for recovery of active users and their
   transmitted symbols: the reduced-dimension decorrelating (RDD) detector,
   which combines subspace projection and thresholding to determine active
   users and sign detection for data recovery, and the reduced-dimension
   decision-feedback (RDDF) detector, which combines decision-feedback
   matching pursuit for active user detection and sign detection for data
   recovery. We derive probability of error bounds for both detectors, and
   show that the number of correlators needed to achieve a small
   probability of symbol error is on the order of the logarithm of the
   number of users in the system. The theoretical performance results are
   validated via numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{We present the application of a theranostic system combining Raman
   imaging and the photodynamic therapy (PDT) effect. The theranostic
   nanoplatform was created by loading the photosensitizer, protoporphyrin
   IX, onto a Raman-labeled gold nanostar. A cell-penetrating peptide, TAT,
   enhanced intracellular accumulation of the nanoparticles in order to
   improve their delivery and efficacy. The plasmonic gold nanostar
   platform was designed to increase the Raman signal via the surface
   enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) effect Theranostic SERS
   imaging and photodynamic therapy using this construct were demonstrated
   on BT-549 breast cancer cells. The TAT peptide allowed for effective
   Raman imaging and photosensitization with the nanoparticle construct
   after a I h incubation period. In the absence of the TAT peptide,
   nanoparticle accumulation in the cells was not sufficient to be observed
   by Raman imaging or to produce any photosensitization effect after this
   short incubation period. There was no cytotoxic effect observed after
   nanoparticle incubation, prior to light activation of the
   photosensitizer. This report shows the first application of combined
   SERS imaging and photosensitization from a theranostic nanoparticle
   construct.}},

Abstract = {{It is desirable to predict the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of
   extremely high-aspect ratio wings for high-altitude/long-endurance
   applications. Such results give insight into structural response and
   serve as a precursor to flutter and gust response calculations. The
   influence of rigid body modes has been shown to be significant for the
   aeroelastic response of these aircraft, but this effect is frequently
   not captured in a laboratory setting. Additionally, resonant frequencies
   can be difficult to predict when multiple discrete masses such as
   engines or mission pods are distributed along the span. In this work,
   the resonant frequencies of a high-altitude/long-endurance wing mounted
   on a spring of variable stiffness with both root and tip stores are
   determined analytically from classical beam theory. The model is then
   extended through a component-mode synthesis to incorporate multiple
   spanwise masses of any discrete distribution. Computational results are
   compared with an experiment, and good agreement is shown.}},

Abstract = {{Variance processing methods in Fourier domain optical coherence
   tomography (FD-OCT) have enabled depth-resolved visualization of the
   capillary beds in the retina due to the development of imaging systems
   capable of acquiring A-scan data in the 100 kHz regime. However,
   acquisition of volumetric variance data sets still requires several
   seconds of acquisition time, even with high speed systems. Movement of
   the subject during this time span is sufficient to corrupt visualization
   of the vasculature. We demonstrate a method to eliminate motion
   artifacts in speckle variance FD-OCT images of the retinal vasculature
   by creating a composite image from multiple volumes of data acquired
   sequentially. Slight changes in the orientation of the subject's eye
   relative to the optical system between acquired volumes may result in
   non-rigid warping of the image. Thus, we use a B-spline based free form
   deformation method to automatically register variance images from
   multiple volumes to obtain a motion-free composite image of the retinal
   vessels. We extend this technique to automatically mosaic individual
   vascular images into a widefield image of the retinal vasculature. (C)

Abstract = {{Finite element (FE) modelling is a popular tool for studying human body
   response to blast exposure. However, blast modelling is a complex
   problem owing to more numerous fluid-structure interactions (FSIs) and
   the high-frequency loading that accompanies blast exposures. This study
   investigates FE mesh design for blast modelling using a sphere in a
   closed-ended shock tube meshed with varying element sizes using both
   tetrahedral and hexahedral elements. FSI was consistent for
   sphere-to-fluid element ratios between 0.25 and 4, and acceleration
   response was similar for both element types (R-2=0.997). Tetrahedral
   elements were found to become increasingly volatile following shock
   loading, causing higher pressures and stresses than predicted with the
   hexahedral elements. Deviatoric stress response was dependent on the
   sphere mesh size (p<0.001), while the pressure response was dependent on
   the shock tube mesh size (p<0.001). The results of this study highlight
   the necessity for mesh sensitivity analysis in blast models.}},

Abstract = {{The population of small-delay defects (SDDs) in integrated circuits
   increases significantly as technology scales to 65 nm and below.
   Therefore, testing for SDDs is necessary to ensure the quality and
   reliability of high-performance integrated circuits fabricated with the
   latest technologies. Commercial timing-aware automatic test pattern
   generation (ATPG) tools have been developed for SDD detection. However,
   they only use static timing analysis reports in the form of standard
   delay format for path-length calculation and neglect important
   underlying causes, such as process variations, crosstalk, and
   power-supply noise, which can also induce small delays into the circuit
   and impact the timing of targeted paths. In this paper, we present an
   efficient pattern evaluation and selection procedure for screening SDDs
   that are caused by physical defects and by delays added to paths by
   process variations and crosstalk. In this procedure, the best patterns
   for SDDs are selected from a large repository test set. Experimental
   results demonstrate that our method sensitizes more LPs, detects more
   SDDs with a much smaller pattern count, and needs less CPU runtime
   compared with a commercial timing-aware ATPG tool.}},

Title = {{Model-based analysis and design of nerve cuff electrodes for restoring
   bladder function by selective stimulation of the pudendal nerve}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve (PN) is being
   developed as a means to restore bladder function in persons with spinal
   cord injury. A single nerve cuff electrode placed on the proximal PN
   trunk may enable selective stimulation of distinct fascicles to maintain
   continence or evoke micturition. The objective of this study was to
   design a nerve cuff that enabled selective stimulation of the PN.
   Approach. We evaluated the performance of both flat interface nerve
   electrode (FINE) cuff and round cuff designs, with a range of FINE cuff
   heights and number of contacts, as well as multiple contact
   orientations. This analysis was performed using a computational model,
   in which the nerve and fascicle cross-sectional positions from five
   human PN trunks were systematically reshaped within the nerve cuff.
   These cross-sections were used to create finite element models, with
   electric potentials calculated and applied to a cable model of a
   myelinated axon to evaluate stimulation selectivity for different PN
   targets. Subsequently, the model was coupled to a genetic algorithm (GA)
   to identify solutions that used multiple contact activation to maximize
   selectivity and minimize total stimulation voltage. Main results.
   Simulations did not identify any significant differences in selectivity
   between FINE and round cuffs, although the latter required smaller
   stimulation voltages for target activation due to preserved localization
   of targeted fascicle groups. Further, it was found that a ten contact
   nerve cuff generated sufficient selectivity for all PN targets, with the
   degree of selectivity dependent on the relative position of the target
   within the nerve. The GA identified solutions that increased fitness by
   0.7-45.5\% over single contact activation by decreasing stimulation of
   non-targeted fascicles. Significance. This study suggests that using an
   optimal nerve cuff design and multiple contact activation could enable
   selective stimulation of the human PN trunk for restoration of bladder
   function.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Epiretinal stimulation, which uses an array of electrodes
   implanted on the inner retinal surface to relay a representation of the
   visual scene to the neuronal elements of the retina, has seen
   considerable success. The objective of the present study was to quantify
   the effects of multi-electrode stimulation on the patterns of neural
   excitation in a computational model of epiretinal stimulation. Approach.
   A computational model of retinal ganglion cells was modified to
   represent the morphology of human retinal ganglion cells and validated
   against published experimental data. The ganglion cell model was then
   combined with a model of an axon of the nerve fiber layer to produce a
   population model of the inner retina. The response of the population of
   model neurons to epiretinal stimulation with a multi-electrode array was
   quantified across a range of electrode geometries using a novel means to
   quantify the model response-the minimum radius circle bounding the
   activated model neurons as a proxy for the evoked phosphene. Main
   results. Multi-electrode stimulation created unique phosphenes, such
   that the number of potential phosphenes can far exceed the number of
   electrode contacts. Significance. The ability to exploit the spatial and
   temporal interactions of stimulation may be critical to improvements in
   the performance of epiretinal prostheses.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the difference between analytic predictions, numerical
   simulations, and experiments measuring the transmission of energy
   through subwavelength, periodically arranged holes in a metal film. At
   normal incidence, theory predicts a sharp transmission minimum when the
   wavelength is equal to the periodicity, and sharp transmission maxima at
   one or more nearby wavelengths. In experiments, the sharpest maximum
   from the theory is not observed, while the others appear less sharp. In
   numerical simulations using commercial electromagnetic field solvers, we
   find that the sharpest maximum appears and approaches our predictions as
   the computational resources are increased. To determine possible origins
   of the destruction of the sharp maximum, we incorporate additional
   features in our model. Incorporating imperfect conductivity and
   imperfect periodicity in our model leaves the sharp maximum intact.
   Imperfect collimation, on the other hand, incorporated into the model
   causes the destruction of the sharp maximum as happens in experiments.
   We provide analytic support through an asymptotic calculation for both
   the existence of the sharp maximum and the destructive impact of
   imperfect collimation. (c) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Next generation telecommunication core networks are typically based on
   the Third Generation Partnership Project Internet protocol (IP)
   multimedia subsystem (IMS). Their planning and deployment must take into
   account the occurrence of random failures causing performance
   degradations, in order to assess and maintain a high level of quality of
   service. In particular, IMS signalling servers can be modelled as
   repairable multi-state elements where states correspond to different
   performance levels. This article provides an evaluation of IMS
   signalling network performance in long runs in terms of two metrics
   adopted in the practice, such as the number of call set-up sessions that
   the network can manage at the same time and the call set-up delay. A
   semi-Markov model has been adopted for the IMS servers, which allows as
   well for non-exponential probability distributions of sojourn times, as
   often observed in real networks. Furthermore, a redundancy optimization
   problem is solved in an IMS-based realistic scenario, to the aim of
   minimizing the deployment cost of a telecommunication network with a
   given availability requirement.}},

Title = {{Extended Remediation of Sleep Deprived-Induced Working Memory Deficits
   Using fMRI-guided Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation}},
Journal = {{SLEEP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{857-871}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: We attempted to prevent the development of working
   memory (WM) impairments caused by sleep deprivation using fMRI-guided
   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Novel aspects of
   our fMRI-guided rTMS paradigm included the use of sophisticated
   covariance methods to identify functional networks in imaging data, and
   the use of fMRI-targeted rTMS concurrent with task performance to
   modulate plasticity effects over a longer term.
   Design: Between-groups mixed model.
   Setting: TMS, MRI, and sleep laboratory study.
   Participants: 27 subjects (13 receiving Active rTMS, and 14 Sham)
   completed the sleep deprivation protocol, with another 21 (10 Active, 11
   Sham) non-sleep deprived subjects run in a second experiment.
   Interventions: Our previous covariance analysis had identified a
   network, including occipital cortex, which demonstrated individual
   differences in resilience to the deleterious effects of sleep
   deprivation on WM performance. Five Hz rTMS was applied to left lateral
   occipital cortex while subjects performed a WM task during 4 sessions
   over the course of 2 days of total sleep deprivation.
   Measurements and Results: At the end of the sleep deprivation period,
   Sham sleep deprived subjects exhibited degraded performance in the WM
   task. In contrast, those receiving Active rTMS did not show the slowing
   and lapsing typical in sleep deprivation, and instead performed
   similarly to non-sleep deprived subjects. Importantly, the Active sleep
   deprivation group showed rTMS-induced facilitation of WM performance a
   full 18 hours after the last rTMS session.
   Conclusions: Over the course of sleep deprivation, these results
   indicate that rTMS applied concurrently with WM task performance
   affected neural circuitry involved in WM to prevent its full impact.}},

Abstract = {{A chemo-mechanical model is used to capture the formation and evolution
   of microdomains on the deforming surface of giant unilamellar vesicles.
   The model is intended for the regime of vesicle dynamics characterized
   by a distinct difference in time scales between shape change and species
   transport. This is achieved by ensuring that shape equilibrium holds
   away from chemical equilibrium. Conventional descriptions are used to
   define the curvature and chemical contributions to the vesicle
   energetics. Both contributions are consistently non-dimensionalized. The
   phase-field framework is used to cast the coupled model in a
   diffuse-interface form. The resulting fourth-order nonlinear system of
   equations is discretized using the finite- element method with a uniform
   cubic spline basis, which satisfies global higher-order continuity.
   Two-dimensional and axisymmetric numerical examples of domain evolution
   coupled to vesicle shape deformation are presented. Curvature-dependent
   domain sorting and shape deformation dominated by line tension are also
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a comprehensive optimisation study culminating in a
   standardised and validated approach for the preparation of titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle dispersions in relevant biological media.
   This study utilises a TiO2 reference nanomaterial based on a
   commercially available powder that has been widely examined in both
   acute and chronic toxicity studies. The dispersion approach as presented
   here satisfies four key harmonisation requirements not previously
   addressed: (1) method transferability, based in part on the use of a
   sonication energy calibration method that allows for power measurement
   and reporting in a device-independent manner; (2) optimisation of
   sonication parameters and thorough method validation in terms of
   particle size distribution, pH, isoelectric point, concentration range
   and batch variability; (3) minimisation of sonolysis side effects by
   elimination of organics during sonication and (4) characterisation of
   nanoparticle agglomeration under various dispersion conditions by use of
   laser diffraction spectrometry, an in situ size characterisation
   technique that provides advantages over other techniques more commonly
   employed within the context of nanotoxicology (e. g. dynamic light
   scattering). The described procedure yields monomodal, nanoscale,
   protein-stabilised nanoparticle dispersions in biological media that
   remain stable for at least 48 h (acute testing timeframe) under typical
   incubation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{As the use of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) increases over
   time, so does the potential for environmental release. This research
   aimed to determine the toxicity, bioavailability, and bioaccumulation of
   SWNTs in marine benthic organisms at the base of the food chain. The
   toxicity of SWNTs was tested in a whole sediment exposure with the
   amphipod Ampelisca abdita and the mysid Americamysis bahia. In addition,
   SWNTs were amended to sediment and/or food matrices to determine their
   bioavailability and bioaccumulation through these routes in A. abdita,
   A. bahia, and the estuarine amphipod Leptocheirus plumulosus. No
   significant mortality to any species via sediment or food matrices was
   observed at concentrations up to 100ppm. A novel near-infrared
   fluorescence spectroscopic method was utilized to measure and
   characterize the body burdens of pristine SWNTs in nondepurated and
   depurated organisms. We did not detect SWNTs in depurated organisms but
   quantified them in nondepurated A. abdita fed SWNT-amended algae. After
   a 28-d exposure to {[}14C]SWNT-amended sediment (100 mu g/g) and algae
   (100 mu g/g), {[}14C]SWNT was detected in depurated and nondepurated L.
   plumulosus amphipods at 0.50 mu g/g and 5.38 mu g/g, respectively. The
   results indicate that SWNTs are bioaccessible to marine benthic
   organisms but do not appear to accumulate or cause toxicity. Environ

Abstract = {{High throughput cellular studies require small sample volume to reduce
   costs and enhance sensitivity. Microfluidics-generated water-in-oil
   (W/O) single emulsion droplet systems, in particular, provide uniform,
   well defined and discrete microenvironment for cell culture, screening,
   and sorting. However, these single emulsion droplets are incapable of
   continuous supply of nutrient molecule and are not compatible with
   aqueous phase-based analysis. A solution is to entrap W/O droplets in
   another aqueous phase, forming water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double
   emulsions. The external aqueous phase efficiently prevents desiccation
   and reduces the amount of organic component, and yet retaining the
   advantages of compartmentalization. The internal environment can also be
   programmed dynamically without the need of rupturing the droplets. In
   this study, we explore the potential application of W/O/W double
   emulsion droplets for cell cultivation, genetic activation and study of
   more complicated biological events such as bacteria quorum-sensing as an
   example. This study demonstrates the advantages and potential
   application of double emulsion for the study of complex biological
   processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In closed-loop phase-change systems, self-propelled jumping drops on a
   superhydrophobic condenser offer a new mechanism to return the working
   fluid to the evaporator, eliminating the requirement for either external
   forces or wick structures along the return path. Here, we report the
   heat transfer performance of a jumping-drop vapor chamber consisting of
   two parallel plates, a superhydrophobic condenser and a superhydrophilic
   evaporator. With proper removal of the non-condensable gases including
   those dissolved in the working fluid, the overall thermal resistance of
   the jumping-drop chamber is primarily governed by the conduction
   resistance of the wicked evaporator in series with the interfacial
   resistances at the phase-change interfaces. The lumped resistance model
   was verified by systematically varying the parameters of the chamber
   such as wick thickness, vapor spacing, vapor temperature, and heat flux.
   As an alternative mechanism to transport the working fluid, the jumping
   drops can enable novel phase-change heat transfer systems such as planar
   thermal diodes and heat spreaders, for which this work provides
   practical design guidelines. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the very first simultaneous detection from space of a

   By fortuitous coincidence, two independent satellites passed less than
   300 km from the thunderstorm system that produced a TGF that lasted 70
   s. Together with two independent measurements of radio emissions, we
   have an unprecedented coverage of the event. We find that the TGF was
   produced deep in the thundercloud at the initial stage of an intracloud
   (IC) lightning before the leader reached the cloud top and extended
   horizontally. A strong radio pulse was produced by the TGF itself. This
   is the first time the sequence of radio pulses, TGF, and optical
   emissions in an IC lightning flash has been identified.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Viral vectors remain the most efficient and popular in deriving induced
   pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). For translation, it is important to
   silence or remove the reprogramming factors after induction of
   pluripotency. In this study, we design an excisable loxP-flanked
   lentiviral construct that a) includes all the reprogramming elements in
   a single lentiviral vector expressed by a strong EF-1 alpha promoter; b)
   enables easy determination of lentiviral titer; c) enables transgene
   removal and cell enrichment using LoxP-site-specific Cre-recombinase
   excision and Herpes Simplex Virus-thymidine kinase/ganciclovir
   (HSV-tk/gan) negative selection; and d) allows for transgene excision in
   a colony format. A reprogramming efficiency comparable to that reported
   in the literature without boosting molecules can be consistently
   obtained. To further demonstrate the utility of this Cre-loxP/HSV-tk/gan
   strategy, we incorporate a non-viral therapeutic transgene (human blood
   coagulation Factor IX) in the iPSCs, whose expression can be controlled
   by a temporal pulse of Cre recombinase. The robustness of this platform
   enables the implementation of an efficacious and cost-effective protocol
   for iPSC generation and their subsequent transgenesis for downstream
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, uncertainty quantification is applied to molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations of concentration driven ionic flow through a
   silica nanopore. We consider a silica pore model connecting two
   reservoirs containing a solution of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions
   in water. An ad hoc concentration control algorithm is developed to
   simulate a concentration driven counter flow of ions through the pore,
   with the ionic flux being the main observable extracted from the MD
   system. We explore the sensitivity of the system to two physical
   parameters of the pore, namely, the pore diameter and the gating charge.
   First we conduct a quantitative analysis of the impact of the pore
   diameter on the ionic flux, and interpret the results in terms of the
   interplay between size effects and ion mobility. Second, we analyze the
   effect of gating charge by treating the charge density over the pore
   surface as an uncertain parameter in a forward propagation study.
   Polynomial chaos expansions and Bayesian inference are exploited to
   isolate the effect of intrinsic noise and quantify the impact of
   parametric uncertainty on the MD predictions. We highlight the
   challenges arising from the heterogeneous nature of the system, given
   the several components involved, and from the substantial effect of the
   intrinsic thermal noise. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{This article extends the uncertainty quantification analysis introduced
   in Paper I for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of concentration
   driven ionic flow through a silica nanopore. Attention is now focused on
   characterizing, for a fixed pore diameter of D = 21 angstrom, the
   sensitivity of the system to the Lennard-Jones energy parameters,
   Na-epsilon(+) and Cl-epsilon(-), defining the depth of the potential
   well for the two ions Na+ and Cl-, respectively. A forward propagation
   analysis is applied to map the uncertainty in these parameters to the MD
   predictions of the ionic fluxes. Polynomial chaos expansions and
   Bayesian inference are exploited to isolate the effect of the intrinsic
   noise, stemming from thermal fluctuations of the atoms, and properly
   quantify the impact of parametric uncertainty on the target MD
   predictions. A Bayes factor analysis is then used to determine the most
   suitable regression model to represent the MD noisy data. The study
   shows that the response surface of the Na+ conductance can be
   effectively inferred despite the substantial noise level, whereas the
   noise partially hides the underlying trend in the Cl- conductance data
   over the studied range. Finally, the dependence of the conductances on
   the uncertain potential parameters is analyzed in terms of correlations
   with key bulk transport coefficients, namely, viscosity and collective
   diffusivities, computed using Green-Kubo time correlations. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Transient overexpression of defined combinations of master regulator
   genes can effectively induce cellular reprogramming: the acquisition of
   an alternative predicted phenotype from a differentiated cell lineage.
   This can be of particular importance in cardiac regenerative medicine
   wherein the heart lacks the capacity to heal itself, but simultaneously
   contains a large pool of fibroblasts. In this study we determined the
   cardio-inducing capacity of ten transcription factors to actuate
   cellular reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into
   cardiomyocyte-like cells. Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD
   and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the
   basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported
   GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C. In particular, combinations of five or seven
   transcription factors enhanced the activation of cardiac reporter
   vectors, and induced an upregulation of cardiac-specific genes. Global
   gene expression analysis also demonstrated a significantly greater
   cardio-inducing effect when the transcription factors MYOCD and SRF were
   used. Detection of cross-striated cells was highly dependent on the cell
   culture conditions and was enhanced by the addition of valproic acid and
   JAK inhibitor. Although we detected Ca2+ transient oscillations in the
   reprogrammed cells, we did not detect significant changes in resting
   membrane potential or spontaneously contracting cells. This study
   further elucidates the cardio-inducing effect of the transcriptional
   networks involved in cardiac cellular reprogramming, contributing to the
   ongoing rational design of a robust protocol required for cardiac
   regenerative therapies.}},

   Designs with one or more slits are investigated. The drag force is
   maximum when the slit spacing matches the boundary layer thickness of
   the flow through the slit. Furthermore, the drag force is greater when
   the slit spacing is nonuniform: larger in the central slits than in the
   peripheral slits. The paddle with slits of one size performs almost as
   well as the best design with nonuniform spacings. The paddle design with
   slits achieves the same drag force and maximum stress with less material

Title = {{Partitioning ozone fluxes between canopy and forest floor by
   measurements and a multi-layer model}},

Abstract = {{Ozone uptake by plant leaves is essential to studies investigating
   atmospheric air pollution and plant injury. A major challenge to these
   investigations is the up-scaling of leaf-level stomatal processes to the
   ecosystem level, the accounting for forest floor ozone removal
   mechanics, and resolving the numerous pathways responsible for
   non-stomatal ozone removal within the canopy sublayer. To progress on
   the first two and offer constraints on the third, the O-3 fluxes above
   and within a boreal Scots pine forest in Southern Finland are explored
   using a combination of two-level eddy covariance fluxes and detailed
   within-canopy concentration profiles. The interpretation of the results
   is aided by a multi-layer canopy model (MLM), which couples radiation
   attenuation and turbulent transport within the canopy volume with
   leaf-level gas exchange, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance.
   Validation of the MLM against measured turbulent CO2 and H2O fluxes
   within and above the canopy, as well as their concomitant mean
   concentration profiles suggest that the stomatal pathway is reasonably
   quantified via the proposed MLM approach. The results show that the
   stomatal pathway alone can explain some 80\% of the daytime dry-canopy
   ecosystem uptake of O-3. The non-stomatal O-3 uptake is largest during
   nighttime and early morning hours when between one third and half of it
   seems to originate from below the overstory canopy. During daytime,
   almost all the non-stomatal uptake occurs in the sub-canopy region.
   Sub-canopy and/or understory processes contribute between 25-30\%
   (nighttime) and 35-45\% (daytime) ecosystem O-3 uptake. In sub-canopy,
   the non-stomatal component exceeds the stomatal by a factor of 2-4
   during daytime. Finally, the MLM was used to study some of the potential
   non-stomatal pathways, including cuticular and soil uptake, forest floor
   uptake and disequilibrium between photochemical O-3 production and a
   first-order kinetic chemical destruction mechanism. The results indicate
   that the likely location of the non-stomatal sink is in the lower
   trunk-space close the forest floor but the soil surface uptake is
   insignificant. According to the results, a bulk gas-phase disequilibrium
   between O-3 production (assumed to vary linearly with light at a given
   level inside the canopy) and destruction (assumed to vary exponentially
   with mean air temperature) is a plausible explanation for non-stomatal
   O-3 removal inside the canopy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The self-cleaning function of superhydrophobic surfaces is
   conventionally attributed to the removal of contaminating particles by
   impacting or rolling water droplets, which implies the action of
   external forces such as gravity. Here, we demonstrate a unique
   self-cleaning mechanism whereby the contaminated superhydrophobic
   surface is exposed to condensing water vapor, and the contaminants are
   autonomously removed by the self-propelled jumping motion of the
   resulting liquid condensate, which partially covers or fully encloses
   the contaminating particles. The jumping motion off the superhydrophobic
   surface is powered by the surface energy released upon coalescence of
   the condensed water phase around the contaminants. The
   jumping-condensate mechanism is shown to spontaneously clean
   superhydrophobic cicada wings, where the contaminating particles cannot
   be removed by gravity, wing vibration, or wind flow. Our findings offer
   insights for the development of self-cleaning materials.}},

Abstract = {{The high resolution and wide field of view (FOV) of the AWARE (Advanced
   Wide FOV Architectures for Image Reconstruction and Exploitation)
   gigapixel class cameras present new challenges in calibration,
   mechanical testing, and optical performance evaluation. The AWARE system
   integrates an array of micro-cameras in a multiscale design to achieve
   gigapixel sampling at video rates. Alignment and optical testing of the
   micro-cameras is vital in compositing engines, which require pixel-level
   accurate mappings over the entire array of cameras. A testbed has been
   developed to automatically calibrate and measure the optical performance
   of the entire camera array. This testbed utilizes translation and
   rotation stages to project a ray into any micro-camera of the AWARE
   system. A spatial light modulator is projected through a telescope to
   form an arbitrary object space pattern at infinity. This collimated
   source is then reflected by an elevation stage mirror for pointing
   through the aperture of the objective into the micro-optics and
   eventually the detector of the micro-camera. Different targets can be
   projected with the spatial light modulator for measuring the modulation
   transfer function (MTF) of the system, fiducials in the overlap regions
   for registration and compositing, distortion mapping, illumination
   profiles, thermal stability, and focus calibration. The mathematics of
   the testbed mechanics are derived for finding the positions of the
   stages to achieve a particular incident angle into the camera, along
   with calibration steps for alignment of the camera and testbed
   coordinate axes. Measurement results for the AWARE-2 gigapixel camera
   are presented for MTF, focus calibration, illumination profile, fiducial
   mapping across the micro-camera for registration and distortion
   correction, thermal stability, and alignment of the camera on the
   testbed. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are thermally sensitive peptide
   polymers that undergo thermally triggered phase separation and this
   behavior is imparted to soluble proteins when they are fused to an ELP.
   The transition temperature of the ELP fusion protein is observed to be
   different than that of a free ELP, indicating that the surface
   properties of the fused protein modulate the thermal behavior of ELPs.
   Understanding this effect is important for the rational design of
   applications that exploit the phase transition behavior of ELP fusion
   proteins. We had previously developed a biophysical model that explained
   the effect of hydrophobic proteins on depressing the transition
   temperature of ELP fusion proteins relative to free ELP. Here, we extend
   the model to elucidate the effect of hydrophilic proteins on the thermal
   behavior of ELP fusion proteins. A linear correlation was found between
   overall residue composition of accessible protein surface weighted by a
   characteristic transition temperature for each residue and the
   difference in transition temperatures between the ELP protein fusion and
   the corresponding free ELP. In breaking down the contribution of
   residues to polar, nonpolar, and charged, the model revealed that
   charged residues are the most important parameter in altering the
   transition temperature of an ELP fusion relative to the free ELP.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanisms of free-shrinkage strains of desiccating deformable initially
   saturated soils are studied. The role of the surface evaporation rate,
   surface tension and viscosity of pore fluid, and soil compressibility
   and permeability is investigated in experimental and numerical
   parametric studies. Two different geomaterials with three different pore
   fluids are tested and numerically simulated using a macroscale Biot
   theory model and a mesoscale vessel model. Evolution of shrinkage strain
   and fluid content is reported and evaluated. The total amount of
   shrinkage and shrinkage limit are found to correlate with both solid
   fraction compressibility and surface tension of the fluid fraction. Most
   of the strain occurs in the saturated stage of drying concomitant with a
   build-up of fluid suction. The macroscopic Biot model yields good
   results in the saturated stage of drying. However, the air-entry
   criteria are all formulated at meso- or microscale. Hence, a mesoscale
   deformable pore vessel model is adopted, with pore fluid suction limited
   by a fluid tensile stress threshold identified with fluid cavitation.
   Beyond cavitation, air entry occurs. Subsequently, partially
   fluid-filled pore vessels are considered with fluid evaporation across a
   migrating fluid-gas interface within the vessel. A mesoscale model
   parametric study confirms that the total drying shrinkage strain and the
   shrinkage limit depend on the solids' compressibility, as well as on the
   fluid surface tension.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel sparse modeling approach to non-rigid shape matching
   using only the ability to detect repeatable regions. As the input to our
   algorithm, we are given only two sets of regions in two shapes; no
   descriptors are provided so the correspondence between the regions is
   not know, nor we know how many regions correspond in the two shapes. We
   show that even with such scarce information, it is possible to establish
   very accurate correspondence between the shapes by using methods from
   the field of sparse modeling, being this, the first non-trivial use of
   sparse models in shape correspondence. We formulate the problem of
   permuted sparse coding, in which we solve simultaneously for an unknown
   permutation ordering the regions on two shapes and for an unknown
   correspondence in functional representation. We also propose a robust
   variant capable of handling incomplete matches. Numerically, the problem
   is solved efficiently by alternating the solution of a linear assignment
   and a sparse coding problem. The proposed methods are evaluated
   qualitatively and quantitatively on standard benchmarks containing both
   synthetic and scanned objects.}},

Abstract = {{P300 spellers provide a noninvasive method of communication for people
   who may not be able to use other communication aids due to severe
   neuromuscular disabilities. However, P300 spellers rely on event-related
   potentials (ERPs) which often have low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In
   order to improve detection of the ERPs, P300 spellers typically collect
   multiple measurements of the electroencephalography (EEG) response for
   each character. The amount of collected data can affect both the
   accuracy and the communication rate of the speller system. The goal of
   the present study was to develop an algorithm that would automatically
   determine the necessary amount of data to collect during operation.
   Dynamic data collection was controlled by a threshold on the
   probabilities that each possible character was the target character, and
   these probabilities were continually updated with each additional
   measurement. This Bayesian technique differs from other dynamic data
   collection techniques by relying on a participant-independent,
   probability-based metric as the stopping criterion. The accuracy and
   communication rate for dynamic and static data collection in P300
   spellers were compared for 26 users. Dynamic data collection resulted in
   a significant increase in accuracy and communication rate.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of the spatial distribution of soil properties has achieved
   considerable interest among soil scientists, both for testing hypotheses
   about soil formation processes and for predicting the properties of
   soils at nonsampled locations (mapping). In this paper, we provide a
   discussion of the various approaches to the modeling of spatial
   variates, and we propose a modeling framework that is able to
   incorporate the most important effects usually found in spatial
   variates, including fixed and random spatial effects, spatial trends,
   and heteroscedasticity. We provide a case study of the analysis of eight
   soil properties in a mountain catchment in the Spanish Pyrenees. As
   explanatory covariates, we use several topography parameters, which can
   be related to the pedogenetic processes active in the area. Several of
   them proved useful for explaining the variability of soil properties,
   explaining up to 77\% of their variance. We focus on the importance of
   model selection in order to determine which effects are relevant for
   modeling each soil parameter. We find that the full model is not
   necessarily optimal for all the variables tested and that the model
   should be adapted to the complexity of each individual case. This paper
   is a contribution to the discussion on the modeling of spatial variates
   and to the eventual development of a general theory of spatial variates.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors can measure
   object-specific signatures that can be used to discriminate landmines
   from harmless clutter. In a model-based signal processing paradigm, the
   object signatures can often be decomposed into a weighted sum of
   parameterized basis functions, such as the discrete spectrum of
   relaxation frequencies (DSRF), where the basis functions are intrinsic
   to the object under consideration and the associated weights are a
   function of the target-sensor orientation. The basis function parameters
   can then be used as features for classifying the target. One of the
   challenges associated with effectively utilizing a model-based signal
   processing paradigm such as this is determining the correct model order
   for the measured data, as the number of basis functions containing
   fundamental information regarding the target under consideration is not
   known a priori. In this paper, sparse Bayesian relevance vector machine
   (RVM) regression is applied to simultaneously determine both the number
   of parameterized basis functions and their relative contributions to the
   measured signal assuming a DSRF signal model. The target is then
   classified utilizing the basis function parameters as features within a
   statistical classifier. Results for data measured with a prototype
   frequency-domain EMI sensor at a standardized test site are presented,
   and indicate that RVM regression followed by distance-based statistical
   classifiers utilizing the resulting model-based features provides an
   effective approach for classifying and identifying landmine targets.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Drusen and migrating retinal pigment epithelium have been
   associated with hyperreflective foci (HF) detected by spectral-domain
   optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). This study sought to quantify the
   change in intraretinal HF distribution and its correlation with
   age-related macular degeneration (AMD) disease progression.
   Design: Prospective observational study from the multicenter Age-Related
   Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) Ancillary SD-OCT Study.
   Participants: Patients (n = 299) with 1 enrolled eye with intermediate
   AMD and baseline SD-OCT, followed by SD-OCT imaging at 1-year and 2-year
   visits.
   Methods: The number and location of HF were scored in SD-OCT scans of
   all 299 eyes. The change in transverse (horizontal) and axial (vertical)
   distribution of HF in the macula were evaluated with pairwise
   signed-rank tests. Two-year inner retinal HF migration was determined by
   the change in HF-weighted axial distribution (AxD) score calculated for
   each eye. The correlation of HF with SD-OCT features of AMD progression
   was evaluated with logistic regression analysis.
   Main Outcome Measures: The mean change in number of HF, transverse and
   axial distribution of HF in the macula, and AxD per eye.
   Results: In 299 study eyes, the 2-year increase in the number of HF
   (P<0.001) and the AxD (P<0.001) per eye represented longitudinal
   proliferation and shift to inner retinal layers, respectively. Eyes with
   geographic atrophy (GA) at 2 years were correlated with the presence of
   baseline HF (P<0.001; odds ratio {[}OR], 4.72; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 2.43-9.80), greater number of baseline HF (P<0.001; OR, 1.61 per
   HF; 95\% CI, 1.32-2.00), and greater baseline AxD (P<0.001; OR, 1.58 per
   AxD point; 95\% CI, 1.29-1.95).
   Conclusions: Proliferation and inner retinal migration of SD-OCT HF
   occurred during follow-up in eyes with intermediate AMD. These
   characteristics were associated with greater incidence of GA at year 2;
   therefore, SD-OCT HF proliferation and migration may serve as biomarkers
   for AMD progression.}},

Abstract = {{A new numerical technique for the stabilization of explicit
   computational-fluid-dynamic solvers is presented. When using
   computational-fluid-dynamic codes to solve practical problems one
   sometimes finds the solution fails to converge due to the presence of a
   small number of eigenvalues of the flow solver outside the unit circle.
   In this paper we use the proper orthogonal decomposition technique to
   estimate the unstable eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the flow solver as
   the solution diverges for linear problems or exhibits limit-cycle
   oscillations for nonlinear problems. We use the resulting
   eigeninformation to construct a preconditioner that repositions the
   unstable eigenvalues from outside the unit circle to a point inside the
   unit circle close to the origin resulting in a stable flow solver. In
   this work the proposed method is applied to a nonlinear steady cascade
   solver. However, the technique can be easily applied to external flow
   solvers and to unsteady frequency-domain (time-linearized and
   harmonic-balance) flow solvers.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of spatial patterns in surface fluxes from aircraft
   observations poses several challenges in the presence of heterogeneous
   land cover. In particular, the effects of turbulence on scalar transport
   and the different behaviour of passive (e.g. water vapour) versus active
   (e.g. temperature) scalars may lead to large uncertainties in the source
   area/flux-footprint estimation for sensible (H) and latent (LE)
   heat-flux fields. This study uses large-eddy simulation (LES) of the
   land-atmosphere interactions to investigate the atmospheric
   boundary-layer (ABL) processes that are likely to create differences in
   airborne-estimated H and LE footprints. We focus on 32 m altitude
   aircraft flux observations collected over a study site in central
   Oklahoma during the Southern Great Plains experiment in 1997 (SGP97).
   Comparison between the aircraft data and traditional model estimates
   provide evidence of a difference in source area for turbulent sensible
   and latent heat fluxes. The LES produces reasonable representations of
   the observed fluxes, and hence provides credible evidence and
   explanation of the observed differences in the H and LE footprints.
   Those differences can be quantified by analyzing the change in the sign
   of the spatial correlation of the H and LE fields provided by the LES
   model as a function of height. Dry patterns in relatively moist
   surroundings are able to generate strong, but localized, sensible
   heating. However, whereas H at the aircraft altitude is still in phase
   with the surface, LE presents a more complicated connection to the
   surface as the dry updrafts force a convergence of the surrounding moist
   air. Both the observational and LES model evidence support the concept
   that under strongly advective conditions, H and LE measured at the top
   of the surface layer (a parts per thousand 50 m) can be associated with
   very different upwind source areas, effectively contradicting
   surface-layer self-similarity theory for scalars. The results indicate
   that, under certain environmental conditions, footprint models will need
   to predict differing source area/footprint contributions between active
   (H) and passive (LE) scalar fluxes by considering land-surface
   heterogeneity and ABL dynamics.}},

Title = {{Precision of Iodine Quantification in Hepatic CT: Effects of Iterative
   Reconstruction With Various Imaging Parameters}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{200}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility
   of using iterative reconstructions in hepatic CT to improve the
   precision of Hounsfield unit quantification, which is the degree to
   which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions provide
   consistent results.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. An anthropomorphic liver phantom with iodinated
   lesions designed to simulate the enhancement of hypervascular tumors
   during the late hepatic arterial phase was imaged, and images were
   reconstructed with both filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative
   reconstructions, such as adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction
   (ASIR) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). This protocol
   was further expanded into various dose levels, tube voltages, and slice
   thicknesses to investigate the effect of iterative reconstructions under
   all these conditions. The iodine concentrations of the lesions were
   quantified, with their precision calculated in terms of repeatability
   coefficient.
   RESULTS. ASIR reduced image noise by approximately 35\%, and improved
   the quantitative precision by approximately 5\%, compared with FBP. MBIR
   reduced noise by more than 65\% and improved the precision by
   approximately 25\% compared with the routine protocol. MBIR consistently
   showed better precision across a thinner slice thickness, lower tube
   voltage, and larger patient, achieving the target precision level at a
   dose lower (>= 40\%) than that of FBP.
   CONCLUSION. ASIR blended with 50\% of FBP indicated a moderate gain in
   quantitative precision compared with FBP but could achieve more with a
   higher percentage. A higher gain was achieved by MBIR. These findings
   may be used to reduce the dose required for reliable quantification and
   may further serve as a basis for protocol optimization in terms of
   iodine quantification.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave-induced thermal acoustic tomography (MITAT) is an innovative
   technique to image biomedical tissues based on their electric
   properties. It has the advantages of both high contrast and high spatial
   resolution. Image reconstruction method in MITAT is always a critical
   issue. In this paper, a CS-MITAT (CS: compressive sensing) imaging
   method is proposed. Compressive sensing (CS) is a recently developed
   sparse signal representation and analysis framework which handles
   medical imaging measurements using low sampling rate or increasing
   imaging quality. The CS-MITAT imaging method applies CS theory to the
   MITAT for breast tumor imaging. In this method, an over-complete
   dictionary is established to make sparse measurements in the spatial
   domain. This treatment greatly saves measurement time. Simulations and
   experiments with real breast tumor tissues demonstrate the feasibility
   and effectiveness of the method. Compared with conventional time
   reversal mirror method which has been used in MITAT research, CS-MITAT
   provides the same peak signal-to-noise ratio imaging quality by using
   significantly fewer acoustic sensor positions or scanning times.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing integration densities and high operating speeds lead to
   subtle manifestation of defects at the board level. Functional fault
   diagnosis is, therefore, necessary for board-level product
   qualification. However, ambiguous diagnosis results lead to long debug
   times and even wrong repair actions, which significantly increase repair
   cost and adversely impact yield. Advanced machine-learning (ML)
   techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to increase the accuracy
   of board-level functional diagnosis and reduce high-volume manufacturing
   cost through successful repair. We propose a smart diagnosis method
   based on two ML classification models, namely, artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) and support-vector machines (SVMs) that can learn from
   repair history and accurately localize the root cause of a failure.
   Fine-grained fault syndromes extracted from failure logs and
   corresponding repair actions are used to train the classification
   models. We also propose a decision machine based on weighted-majority
   voting, which combines the benefits of ANNs and SVMs. Three complex
   boards from the industry, currently in volume production, and additional
   synthetic data, are used to validate the proposed methods in terms of
   diagnostic accuracy, resolution, and quantifiable improvement over
   current diagnostic software.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are chemically synthesized semiconductor
   nanoparticles with size-dependent wavelength tunability. Chemical
   synthesis of CQDs involves the attachment of long organic surface
   ligands to prevent aggregation; however, these ligands also impede
   charge transport. Therefore, it is beneficial to exchange longer surface
   ligands for shorter ones for optoelectronic devices. Typical
   characterization techniques used to analyze surface ligand exchange
   include Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction,
   transmission electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy, yet these techniques do not provide a simultaneously
   direct, quantitative, and sensitive method for evaluating surface
   ligands on CQDs. In contrast, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) can
   provide nanoscale sensitivity for quantitative analysis of CQD surface
   ligand exchange. A unique aspect of this work is that a fingerprint is
   identified for shorter surface ligands by resolving the regional XPS
   spectrum corresponding to different types of carbon bonds. In addition,
   a deposition technique known as resonant infrared matrix-assisted pulsed
   laser evaporation is used to improve the CQD film uniformity such that
   stronger XPS signals are obtained, enabling more accurate analysis of
   the ligand exchange process.}},

Abstract = {{In order to produce sufficiently low aberrations with a large aperture,
   telescopes have a limited field of view. Because of this narrow field,
   large areas of the sky at a given time are unobserved. We propose
   several telescopes based on monocentric reflective, catadioptric, and
   refractive objectives that may be scaled to wide fields of view and
   achieve 1 `'.1 resolution, which in most locations is the practical
   seeing limit of the atmosphere. The reflective and Schmidt catadioptric
   objectives have relatively simple configurations and enable large fields
   to be captured at the expense of the obscuration of the mirror by
   secondary optics, a defect that may be managed by image plane design.
   The refractive telescope design does not have an obscuration but the
   objective has substantial bulk. The refractive design is a 38 gigapixel
   camera which consists of a single monocentric objective and 4272
   microcameras. Monocentric multiscale telescopes, with their wide fields
   of view, may observe phenomena that might otherwise be unnoticed, such
   as supernovae, glint from orbital space debris, and near-earth objects.}},

   range communications (DSRC) system on highways. The generation and
   service of safety messages in each vehicle is modeled by a generalized
   M/G/1 queue. The overall model is a set of interacting M/G/1 queues, one
   queue for each vehicle. The interaction is that the server is shared as
   it is the contention medium. To make the model scalable, we use
   semi-Markov process (SMP) model to capture the shared server's behavior
   from one tagged vehicle's perspective, where the medium contention and
   back off behavior for this vehicle and influences from other vehicles
   are considered. Furthermore, this SMP interacts with the tagged
   vehicle's own M/G/1 queue through fixed-point iteration. The proof for
   the existence, uniqueness and convergence of the fixed point is
   provided. Based on the fixed-point solution, performance indices
   including mean transmission delay, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and
   packet reception ratio (PRR) are derived. Analytic-numeric results are
   verified through extensive simulations under various network parameters.
   Compared with the existing models, the proposed SMP model facilitates
   the impact analysis of hidden terminal problem on the PDR and PRR
   computation in a more precise manner.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we introduce a novel noise-robust modification method
   for Gaussian-based models to enhance the performance of radar
   high-resolution range profile (HRRP) recognition under the test
   condition of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and we develop an
   efficient scheme for its computation. This noise-robust modification
   method is implemented by revising the trained Gaussian-based model
   according to the estimated SNR of test HRRP. We apply the proposed
   method to adaptive Gaussian classifier and truncated stick-breaking
   hidden Markov model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   method can significantly improve the average recognition rate for noisy
   HRRP test samples while offering recognition performance comparable to
   that of original model for clean HRRP test samples. Moreover, even when
   the SNR of test HRRP samples is not precisely estimated, we can still
   obtain an acceptable result with the proposed method.}},

Title = {{Why solidification has an S-shaped history}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Here we show theoretically that the history of solid growth during
   ``rapid{''} solidification must be S-shaped, in accord with the
   constructal law of design in nature. In the beginning the rate of
   solidification increases and after reaching a maximum it decreases
   monotonically as the volume of solid tends toward a plateau. The
   S-history is a consequence of four configurations for the flow of heat
   from the solidification front to the subcooled surroundings, in this
   chronological order: solid spheres centered at nucleation sites, needles
   that invade longitudinally, radial growth by conduction, and finally
   radial lateral conduction to interstices that are warming up. The solid
   volume (B-s) vs time (t) is an S-curve because it is a power law of type
   B-s similar to t(n) where the exponent n first increases and then
   decreases in time (n = 3/2, 2, 1, ... ). The initial portion of the S
   curve is not an exponential.}},

Abstract = {{Pump-probe microscopy is an imaging technique that delivers molecular
   contrast of pigmented samples. Here, we introduce pump-probe nonlinear
   phase dispersion spectroscopy (PP-NLDS), a method that leverages
   pump-probe microscopy and spectral-domain interferometry to ascertain

   extends the information content to four dimensions (phase, amplitude,
   wavelength, and pump-probe time-delay) that yield unique insight into a
   wider range of nonlinear interactions compared to conventional methods.
   This results in the ability to provide highly specific molecular
   contrast of pigmented and non-pigmented samples. A theoretical framework
   is described, and experimental results and simulations illustrate the
   potential of this method. Implications for biomedical imaging are

Abstract = {{Axisymmetric radiating and scattering structures whose rotational
   invariance is broken by non-axisymmetric excitations present an
   important class of problems in electromagnetics. For such problems, a
   cylindrical wave decomposition formalism can be used to efficiently
   obtain numerical solutions to the full-wave frequency-domain problem.
   Often, the far-field, or Fraunhofer region is of particular interest in
   scattering cross-section and radiation pattern calculations; yet, it is
   usually impractical to compute full-wave solutions for this region.
   Here, we propose a generalization of the Stratton-Chu far-field integral
   adapted for 2.5D formalism. The integration over a closed, axially
   symmetric surface is analytically reduced to a line integral on a
   meridional plane. We benchmark this computational technique by comparing
   it with analytical Mie solutions for a plasmonic nanoparticle, and apply
   it to the design of a three-dimensional polarization-insensitive cloak.

Abstract = {{An analysis of thunderstorm environment, structure, and evolution
   associated with six gigantic jets (five negative polarity, one positive)
   was conducted. Three of these gigantic jets were observed within
   detection range of very high frequency lightning mapping networks. All
   six were within range of operational radars and two-dimensional
   lightning network coverage: five within the National Lightning Detection
   Network and one within the Global Lightning Detection (GLD360) network.
   Most of the storms producing the jets formed in moist tropical or
   tropical-like environments (precipitable water ranged from 37 to 62 kg
   m-2, and 0-6 km shear from 3.5 to 24.8 m s-1), featuring high convective
   available potential energy (1200-3500 J kg-1) and low lifted indices
   (-2.8 to -6.4). The storms had maximum radar reflectivity factors of 54
   to 62 dBZ, and 10 dBZ echo contours reached 14-17 km. Storms covered by
   three-dimensional lightning mappers were near peak altitude of lightning
   activity (modes of the vertical distributions of radio sources were at
   altitudes colder than -50 degrees C) and vertical reflectivity
   intensity, with overshooting echo tops around the times of their jets.
   Two of the other three jet-producing storms produced their jet around
   the time of a convective surge as indicated by radar data and likely
   featured overshooting tops. The observations suggest a link between
   convective surges, overshooting tops, and the occurrence of gigantic
   jets, similar to prior modeling studies.}},

Title = {{Wavelength Optimization for Quantitative Spectral Imaging of Breast
   Tumor Margins}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{A wavelength selection method that combines an inverse Monte Carlo model
   of reflectance and a genetic algorithm for global optimization was
   developed for the application of spectral imaging of breast tumor
   margins. The selection of wavelengths impacts system design in cost,
   size, and accuracy of tissue quantitation. The minimum number of
   wavelengths required for the accurate quantitation of tissue optical
   properties is 8, with diminishing gains for additional wavelengths. The
   resulting wavelength choices for the specific probe geometry used for
   the breast tumor margin spectral imaging application were tested in an
   independent pathology-confirmed ex vivo breast tissue data set and in
   tissue-mimicking phantoms. In breast tissue, the optical endpoints
   (hemoglobin, beta-carotene, and scattering) that provide the contrast
   between normal and malignant tissue specimens are extracted with the
   optimized 8-wavelength set with <9\% error compared to the full spectrum
   (450-600 nm). A multi-absorber liquid phantom study was also performed
   to show the improved extraction accuracy with optimization and without
   optimization. This technique for selecting wavelengths can be used for
   designing spectral imaging systems for other clinical applications.}},

   ultimate impact on nanoplasmonic systems. The hydrodynamic model
   captures much of the microscopic dynamics relating to the fundamental
   quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and reveals intrinsic
   limitations to the confinement and enhancement of light around nanoscale
   features. The presence of such limits is investigated numerically for
   different configurations of plasmonic nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{Successful surgical treatment of ocular astigmatism requires accurate
   characterization of both magnitude and axis of the astigmatism.
   Keratometry and topography are clinically widely used for this
   measurement; however, their analysis is limited to the anterior corneal
   surface. Unlike these techniques, optical coherence tomography (OCT)
   offers the advantage of measuring both the anterior and posterior
   corneal surface contributions. We present a technique to combine the
   local curvatures of both surfaces into a single pseudosurface suitable
   for clinical application. Building on prior work in distributed scanning
   OCT (DSOCT) to remove corrupting patient motion artifacts, we present
   the results of a pilot patient study where extracted values of clinical
   corneal astigmatic power magnitude and direction from DSOCT corneal
   volumes were comparable to standard clinical measures of corneal
   astigmatism. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Spatial and temporal variability of soil CO2 efflux in three proximate
   temperate forest ecosystems}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{256-269}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The magnitude of CO2 flux from soil (F-soil) varies with primary
   productivity and environmental drivers of respiration, soil temperature
   (T-soil) and moisture, all of which vary temporally and spatially. To
   quantify the sources of Fson variability, we first compared F-soil of
   three proximate forests within 30 km of one another, ranging in age,
   composition, soil, and environment and, thus, productivity. We collected
   data with automated soil respiration chambers during a 10-year period in
   a mid-rotation Pinus taeda plantation (PP), for three-years in a mature
   P. taeda stand (OP), and for five-years in a mature, mixed-species
   hardwood (HW) stand; PP and HW were on clay-loam soil and OP on a sandy
   soil. Among stands, Fsoil sensitivity to T-soil was lowest in OP and
   highest in PP, reflected in mean annual F-soil (+/- standard deviation)
   of 1033 +/- 226 (OP), 1206 +/- 99(11W), and 1383 +/- 152 (PP) g Cm-2;
   both F-soil sensitivity to T5011 and annual F-soil increased with leaf
   litterfall. For the second portion of our study, we established an
   additional three plots at PP for a six-year period to examine
   within-stand variability. Within PP, sensitivity of F-soil to T-soil was
   similar, yet higher leaf area was correlated with a combination of lower
   soil temperature and belowground carbon flux, resulting in lower F-soil.
   Temporally, diurnal to seasonal F-soil followed T-soil whereas annual
   values were driven by soil moisture. Spatially, among the three stands
   F-soil increased with leaf production, whereas within a stand (PP)
   F-soil decreased with increasing leaf production. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Ferroelectric surfaces can have very high surface charge densities that
   can be harnessed for manipulation of charged colloidal particles and
   soft matter in aqueous environments. Here, we report on the electrical
   double layer (EDL) formed by polarized ultrasmooth lead zirconium
   titanate (US-PZT) thin films in dilute electrolyte solutions. Using
   colloidal probe force microscopy (CPFM) measurements, we show that the
   ion distribution within the double layer can be changed by reversing the
   ferroelectric polarization state of US-PZT. The interaction force in
   dilute 1:1 electrolyte solution between the negatively charged probe and
   a positive surface charge (upward polarized) US-PZT thin film is
   attractive, while the interaction force is repulsive for a negative
   surface charge (downward polarized) film. We modeled these interactions
   with a constant-potential EDL model between dissimilar surfaces with the
   inclusion of a Stern layer. We report the surface potentials at the
   inner and outer-Helmholtz planes both for polarization states and for a
   range of ionic strength solutions. Effects of free-charge carriers,
   limitations of the analytical model, and effects of surface roughness
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated printed circuit board (PCB) based array sensing chip was
   developed to simultaneously detect lactate and glucose in mouse serum.
   The novelty of the chip relies on a concept demonstration of inexpensive

   chitosan/redox polymer Polyvinylimidazole-Os (PVI-Os)/carbon nanotube
   (CNT) composite sensing platform, in which the positively charged
   chitosan/PVI-Os is mediator and electrostatically immobilizes the
   negatively charged enzyme, while CNTs function as an essential
   cross-linker to network PVI-Os and chitosan due to its negative charged
   nature. Additional electrodes on the chip with the same sensing layer
   but without enzymes were prepared to correct the interferences for high
   specificity. Low detection limits of 0.6 mu M and 5 mu M were achieved
   for lactate and glucose, respectively. This work could be extended to
   inexpensive array sensing chips with high sensitivity, good specificity

Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{We describe the design of a temporal imaging system that simultaneously
   reshapes the temporal profile and converts the frequency of a photonic
   wave packet, while preserving its quantum state. A field lens, which
   imparts a temporal quadratic phase modulation, is used to correct for
   the residual phase caused by field curvature in the image, thus enabling
   temporal imaging for phase-sensitive quantum applications. We show how
   this system can be used for temporal imaging of time-bin entangled
   photonic wave packets and compare the field lens correction technique to
   systems based on a temporal telescope and far-field imaging. The
   field-lens approach removes the residual phase using four dispersive
   elements. The group delay dispersion D is constrained by the available
   bandwidth Delta v by D > t/Delta v, where t is the temporal width of the
   wave form associated with the dispersion D. This is compared to the much
   larger dispersion D >> pi t(2)/8 required to satisfy the Fraunhofer
   condition in the far-field approach. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.87.043808}},

Abstract = {{Exceptional mechanical and electrical properties of carbon nanotubes
   (CNT) have attracted neuroscientists and neural tissue engineers aiming
   to develop novel devices that interface with nervous tissues. In the
   central nervous system (CNS), the perinatal chloride shift represents a
   dynamic change that forms the basis for physiological actions of
   -aminobutyric acid (GABA) as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, a process
   of fundamental relevance for normal functioning of the CNS. Low
   intra-neuronal chloride concentrations are maintained by a
   chloride-extruding transporter, potassium chloride cotransporter 2
   (KCC2). KCC2's increasing developmental expression underlies the
   chloride shift. In neural injury, repressed KCC2 expression plays a
   co-contributory role by corrupting inhibitory neurotransmission.
   Mechanisms of Kcc2 up-regulation are thus pertinent because of their
   medical relevance, yet they remain elusive. Here, it is shown that
   primary CNS neurons originating from the cerebral cortex, cultured on
   highly-conductive few-walled-CNT (fwCNT) have a strikingly accelerated
   chloride shift caused by increased KCC2 expression. KCC2 upregulation is
   dependent on neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) and,
   furthermore, on calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, which is linked
   to VGCC-mediated calcium-influx. It is also demonstrated that
   accelerated Kcc2 transcription in brain-slices prepared from
   genetically-engineered reporter mice, in which Kcc2 promoter drives
   luciferase, when the cerebral cortex of these mice is exposed to
   fwCNT-coated devices. Based on these findings, whether fwCNT can enhance
   neural engineering devices for the benefit of neural injury conditions
   associated with elevated neuronal intracellular chloride
   concentrationsuch as pain, epilepsy, traumatic neural injury and
   ischemiacan now be addressed. Taken together, our novel insights
   illustrate how fwCNTs can promote low neuronal chloride in individual
   neurons and thus inhibitory transmission in neural circuits.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a mixture procedure to monitor parallel streams of data for a
   change-point that affects only a subset of them, without assuming a
   spatial structure relating the data streams to one another. Observations
   are assumed initially to be independent standard normal random variables
   After a change-point the observations in a subset of the streams of data
   have nonzero mean values. The subset and the post-change means are
   unknown. The procedure we study uses stream specific generalized
   likelihood ratio statistics, which are combined to form an overall
   detection statistic in a mixture model that hypothesizes an assumed
   fraction pp of affected data streams. An analytic expression is obtained
   for the average run length (ARL) when there is no change and is shown by
   simulations to be very accurate. Similarly, an approximation for the
   expected detection delay (EDD) after a change-point is also obtained.
   Numerical examples are given to compare the suggested procedure to other
   procedures for unstructured problems and in one case where the problem
   is assumed to have a well-defined geometric structure. Finally we
   discuss sensitivity of the procedure to the assumed value of p(0) and

Abstract = {{Aim. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship
   between inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease (IL-6 and
   acute-phase reactants) and VO(2)peak in asymptomatic females.
   Methods. Study subjects were females not affected by coronary heart
   diseases. Forty healthy female subjects (age, 45 +/- 4.2 years; height,
   161 +/- 3.5 cm; weight, 65 +/- 3.1 kg; history of regular physical
   activity, 5.2 +/- 0.45 years) participated in this study
   Results. Analysis of data was carried out by Pearson's correlation.
   Statistical analysis of data indicated a negative significant
   relationship between IL-6 and VO2peak (r=-0.48, r2=0.23, P<0.048), CRP
   and VO(2)peak (r=-0.40, r2=0.16, P<0.002), fibrinogen and VO(2)peak
   (r=-0.42, r2=0.17, P<0.001), and WBC and VO(2)peak (r=-0.22, r2=0.04,
   P<0.044).
   Conclusion. In conclusion higher circulating levels of IL-6, CRP and
   fibrinogen are associated with lower VO(2)peak in females.}},

Title = {{Responses of soil heterotrophic respiration to moisture availability: An
   exploration of processes and models}},

Abstract = {{Soil moisture strongly affects the dynamics of soil organic matter and
   is an important environmental variable in all models predicting changes
   in soil carbon stocks from site to global scales. Despite this, the
   mechanisms determining the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to
   soil moisture remain poorly quantified, being represented in most
   current carbon cycle models as simple empirical functions. With the aim
   of providing an overview and new insights into the mechanisms involved,
   here we review the observations and theory behind the
   respiration-moisture relationship. We start by calculating best
   estimates of average empirical relationships using published data and
   comparing the results for contrasting soil types. The theoretical
   linkages between substrate and gas diffusivity in soil pores and
   heterotrophic respiration are then explored as a function of temperature
   and textural properties. Based on this theoretical model we interpret
   the variability of moisture effects observed in previous empirical
   studies. Transient CO2 efflux moisture relationships are discussed next,
   reviewing the theory and models developed in the last years with
   particular emphasis on the `Birch effect'. We continue by giving an
   overview of recent pore-scale models and consider how these can be used
   to gain a more mechanistic understanding of carbon storage and
   stabilization in variably saturated soils. From this review we conclude
   that current empirical models are useful but limited approximations,
   with questionable predictive capacity. Significant efforts are still
   necessary to represent the full range of soil moisture responses in a
   unifying model with a sound theoretical basis that can help identify
   common underlying processes. Equations present here, combining
   diffusion, texture and substrate to model respiration, are a step
   forward in this direction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We carry out a comprehensive study of the resource cost of averaging
   consensus in wireless networks. Most previous approaches suppose a
   graphical network, which abstracts away crucial features of the wireless
   medium, and measure resource consumption only in terms of the total
   number of transmissions required to achieve consensus. Under a path-loss
   model, we study the resource requirements of consensus with respect to
   three wireless-appropriate metrics: total transmit energy, elapsed time,
   and time-bandwidth product. First, we characterize the performance of
   several popular gossip algorithms, showing that they may be
   order-optimal with respect to transmit energy but are strictly
   suboptimal with respect to elapsed time and time-bandwidth product.
   Further, we propose a new consensus scheme, termed hierarchical
   averaging, and show that it is nearly order-optimal with respect to all
   three metrics. Finally, we examine the effects of quantization, showing
   that hierarchical averaging provides a nearly order-optimal tradeoff
   between resource consumption and quantization error.}},

Title = {{Generation of a suite of 3D computer-generated breast phantoms from a
   limited set of human subject data}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The authors previously reported on a three-dimensional
   computer-generated breast phantom, based on empirical human image data,
   including a realistic finite-element based compression model that was
   capable of simulating multimodality imaging data. The computerized
   breast phantoms are a hybrid of two phantom generation techniques,
   combining empirical breast CT (bCT) data with flexible computer graphics
   techniques. However, to date, these phantoms have been based on single
   human subjects. In this paper, the authors report on a new method to
   generate multiple phantoms, simulating additional subjects from the
   limited set of original dedicated breast CT data. The authors developed
   an image morphing technique to construct new phantoms by gradually
   transitioning between two human subject datasets, with the potential to
   generate hundreds of additional pseudoindependent phantoms from the
   limited bCT cases. The authors conducted a preliminary subjective
   assessment with a limited number of observers (n = 4) to illustrate how
   realistic the simulated images generated with the pseudoindependent
   phantoms appeared.
   Methods: Several mesh-based geometric transformations were developed to
   generate distorted breast datasets from the original human subject data.
   Segmented bCT data from two different human subjects were used as the
   ``base{''} and ``target{''} for morphing. Several combinations of
   transformations were applied to morph between the ``base' and
   ``target{''} datasets such as changing the breast shape, rotating the
   glandular data, and changing the distribution of the glandular tissue.
   Following the morphing, regions of skin and fat were assigned to the
   morphed dataset in order to appropriately assign mechanical properties
   during the compression simulation. The resulting morphed breast was
   compressed using a finite element algorithm and simulated mammograms
   were generated using techniques described previously. Sixty-two
   simulated mammograms, generated from morphing three human subject
   datasets, were used in a preliminary observer evaluation where four
   board certified breast radiologists with varying amounts of experience
   ranked the level of realism (from 1 = ``fake{''} to 10 = ``real{''}) of
   the simulated images.
   Results: The morphing technique was able to successfully generate new
   and unique morphed datasets from the original human subject data. The
   radiologists evaluated the realism of simulated mammograms generated
   from the morphed and unmorphed human subject datasets and scored the
   realism with an average ranking of 5.87 +/- 1.99, confirming that
   overall the phantom image datasets appeared more ``real{''} than
   ``fake.{''} Moreover, there was not a significant difference (p > 0.1)
   between the realism of the unmorphed datasets (6.0 +/- 1.95) compared to
   the morphed datasets (5.86 +/- 1.99). Three of the four observers had
   overall average rankings of 6.89 +/- 0.89, 6.9 +/- 1.24, 6.76 +/- 1.22,
   whereas the fourth observer ranked them noticeably lower at 2.94 +/-
   0.7.
   Conclusions: This work presents a technique that can be used to generate
   a suite of realistic computerized breast phantoms from a limited number
   of human subjects. This suite of flexible breast phantoms can be used
   for multimodality imaging research to provide a known truth while
   concurrently producing realistic simulated imaging data. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Wastewater effluent and sewage sludge are predicted to be important
   release pathways for nanomaterials used in many consumer products. The
   uncertainty and variability of potential nanomaterial inputs,
   nanomaterial properties, and the operation of the wastewater treatment
   plant contribute to the difficulty of predicting sludge and effluent
   nanomaterial concentration. With a model parsimony approach, we
   developed a mass-balance representation of engineered nanomaterial (ENM)
   behavior based on a minimal number of input variables to describe
   release quantities to the environment. Our simulations show that
   significant differences in the removal of silver nanoparticles (nano-Ag)
   can be expected based on the type of engineered coatings used to
   stabilize these materials in suspension. At current production
   estimates, 95\% of the estimated effluent concentrations of the nano-Ag
   considered to be least well-removed by the average wastewater treatment
   plant are calculated to fall below 0.12 mu g/L, while 95\% of the
   estimated sludge concentrations of nano-Ag with coatings that increase
   their likelihood of being present in biosolids, fall below 0.35 mu g/L.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are protein polymers that reversibly
   phase separate in response to increased temperature, pressure,
   concentration, ionic strength, and molecular weight. If it were possible
   to engineer their phase separation to respond to specific molecular
   substrates, ELP fusion proteins might be engineered as biosensors, smart
   biomaterials, diagnostic imaging agents, and targeted therapies. What
   has been lacking is a strategy to design ELPs to respond to specific
   substrates. To address this deficiency, we report that ELP fusion
   proteins phase separate in response to chemical inducers of dimerization
   (CID). The rationale is that ELP phase separation depends on molecular
   weight, concentration, and local hydrophobicity; therefore, processes
   that affect these properties, including noncovalent dimerization, can be
   tuned to produce isothermal phase separation. To test this hypothesis,
   constructs were evaluated consisting of an immunophilin: human FK-506
   binding protein 12 (FKBP) attached to an ELP. Under stoichiometric
   binding of a CID, the fusion protein homodimerizes and triggers phase
   separation. This dimerization is reversible upon saturation with excess
   CID or competitive binding of a small lipophilic macrolide to FKBP. By
   modulating the ELP molecular weight, phase separation was tuned for
   isothermal response to CID at physiological ionic strength and
   temperature (37 degrees C). To interpret the relationship between
   transition temperature and equilibrium binding constants, an empirical
   mathematical model was employed. To the best of our knowledge, this
   report is the first demonstration of reversible ELP switching in
   response to controlled dimerization. Due to its simplicity, this
   strategy may be useful to design ELP fusion proteins that respond to
   specific dimeric biological entities.}},

Abstract = {{The Delsarte-Goethals frame (DGF) has been proposed for deterministic
   compressive sensing of sparse and compressible signals. Results in
   compressive sensing theory show that the DGF enables successful recovery
   of an overwhelming majority of sufficiently sparse signals. However,
   these results do not give a characterization of the sparse vectors for
   which the recovery procedure fails. In this paper, we present a formal
   analysis of the DGF that highlights the presence of clustered sparse
   vectors within its null space. This in turn implies that sparse recovery
   performance is diminished for sparse vectors that have their nonzero
   entries clustered together. Such clustered structure is present in
   compressive imaging applications, where commonly-used raster scannings
   of 2-D discrete wavelet transform representations yield clustered sparse
   representations for natural images. Prior work leverages this structure
   by proposing specially tailored sparse recovery algorithms that
   partition the recovery of the input vector into known clustered and
   unclustered portions. Alternatively, we propose new randomized and
   deterministic raster scannings for clustered coefficient vectors that
   improve recovery performance. Experimental results verify the
   aforementioned analysis and confirm the predicted improvements for both
   noiseless and noisy measurement regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Au/alpha-Fe2O3 catalyst was synthesized using a modified
   co-precipitation method to generate an inverse catalyst model. The
   effects of introducing CO2 and H2O during preferential oxidation (PROX)
   of CO were investigated. The goal of this work was >= 99.8\% CO
   conversion at 80 degrees C. There was an increase in the conversion at
   all temperatures with the introduction of CO2 and 100\% of the CO was
   converted at the target temperature of 80 degrees C for any amount of
   CO2. Furthermore, there was an increase in conversion to 100\% for water
   fractions ranging from 3\% to 10\%. Finally, for realistic conditions of
   (bio-)fuel reforming, 24\% CO2 and 10\% water, 99.85\% conversion was
   achieved. A long-term test of 200 h showed no significant deactivation
   of the catalyst at a temperature of 80 degrees C in presence of 24\% CO2
   and 3\% water. The mechanism for PROX is not known definitively;
   however, current literature believes the gold particle size is the key.
   In contrast, we emphasize the tremendous role of the support particle
   size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   2129-2144, 2013. First published January 30, 2013;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00906.2011.-The caudal dentate nucleus (DN) in lateral
   cerebellum is connected with two visual/oculomotor areas of the
   cerebrum: the frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal cortex. Many
   neurons in frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal cortex produce
   ``delay activity{''} between stimulus and response that correlates with
   processes such as motor planning. Our hypothesis was that caudal DN
   neurons would have prominent delay activity as well. From lesion
   studies, we predicted that this activity would be related to
   self-timing, i.e., the triggering of saccades based on the internal
   monitoring of time. We recorded from neurons in the caudal DN of monkeys
   (Macaca mulatta) that made delayed saccades with or without a
   self-timing requirement. Most (84\%) of the caudal DN neurons had delay
   activity. These neurons conveyed at least three types of information.
   First, their activity was often correlated, trial by trial, with saccade
   initiation. Correlations were found more frequently in a task that
   required self-timing of saccades (53\% of neurons) than in a task that
   did not (27\% of neurons). Second, the delay activity was often tuned
   for saccade direction (in 65\% of neurons). This tuning emerged
   continuously during a trial. Third, the time course of delay activity
   associated with self-timed saccades differed significantly from that
   associated with visually guided saccades (in 71\% of neurons). A
   minority of neurons had sensory-related activity. None had presaccadic
   bursts, in contrast to DN neurons recorded more rostrally. We conclude
   that caudal DN neurons convey saccade-related delay activity that may
   contribute to the motor preparation of when and where to move.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and solar fuels hold great
   promise for harvesting solar energy. TiO2-based photoelectrodes for
   water splitting have been intensively investigated since 1972. However,
   solar-to-fuel conversion efficiencies of TiO2 photoelectrodes are still
   far lower than theoretical values. This is partially due to the dilemma
   of a short minority carrier diffusion length, and long optical
   penetration depth, as well as inefficient electron collection. We report
   here the synthesis of TiO2 PEC electrodes by coating solution-processed
   antimony-doped tin oxide nanoparticle films (nanoATO) on FTO glass with
   TiO2 through atomic layer deposition. The conductive, porous nanoATO
   film-supported TiO2 electrodes, yielded a highest photocurrent density
   of 0.58 mA/cm(2) under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight of 100 mW/cm(2). This
   is approximately 3x the maximum photocurrent density of planar TiO2 PEC
   electrodes on FTO glass. The enhancement is ascribed to the conductive
   interconnected porous nanoATO film, which decouples the dimensions for
   light absorption and charge carrier diffusion while maintaining
   efficient electron collection. Transient photocurrent measurements
   showed that nanoATO films reduce charge recombination by accelerating
   transport of photoelectrons through the less defined conductive porous
   nanoATO network. Owing to the large band gap, scalable solution
   processed porous nanoATO films are promising as a framework to replace
   other conductive scaffolds for PEC electrodes.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{109}},

Abstract = {{The mouse eye has physiological and genetic advantages to study
   conventional outflow function. However, its small size and shallow
   anterior chamber presents technical challenges to efficient intracameral
   delivery of genetic material to conventional outflow cells. The goal of
   this study was to optimize methods to overcome this technical hurdle,
   without damaging ocular structures or compromising outflow function.
   Gene targeting was monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy after
   transduction of adenovirus encoding green fluorescent protein driven by
   a CMV promoter. Guided by a micromanipulator and stereomicroscope, virus
   was delivered intracamerally to anesthetized mice by bolus injection
   using a 33 gauge needle attached to Hamilton syringe or infusion with
   glass micropipette connected to syringe pump. The total number of
   particles introduced remained constant, while volume of injected virus
   solution (3-10 mu l) was varied for each method and time of infusion
   (3-40 min) tested. Outflow facility and intraocular pressure were
   monitored invasively using established techniques. Unlike bolus
   injections or slow infusions, introduction of virus intracamerally
   during rapid infusions (3 min) at any volume tested preferentially
   targeted trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal cells, with minimal
   transduction of neighboring cells. While infusions resulted in transient
   intraocular pressure spikes (commensurate with volume infused, Delta
   40-70 mmHg), eyes typically recovered within 60 min. Transduced eyes
   displayed normal outflow facility and tissue morphology 3-6 days after
   infusions. Taken together, fast infusion of virus solution in small
   volumes intracamerally is a novel and effective method to selectively
   deliver agents to conventional outflow cells in living mice. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The development of ultrasound-based elasticity imaging methods has been
   the focus of intense research activity since the mid-1990s. In
   characterizing the mechanical properties of soft tissues, these
   techniques image an entirely new subset of tissue properties that cannot
   be derived with conventional ultrasound techniques. Clinically, tissue
   elasticity is known to be associated with pathological condition and
   with the ability to image these features in vivo; elasticity imaging
   methods may prove to be invaluable tools for the diagnosis and/or
   monitoring of disease. This review focuses on ultrasound-based
   elasticity imaging methods that generate an acoustic radiation force to
   induce tissue displacements. These methods can be performed
   noninvasively during routine exams to provide either qualitative or
   quantitative metrics of tissue elasticity. A brief overview of soft
   tissue mechanics relevant to elasticity imaging is provided, including a
   derivation of acoustic radiation force, and an overview of the various
   acoustic radiation force elasticity imaging methods.}},

Abstract = {{A system capable of tracking radiation-force-induced shear wave
   propagation in a 3-D volume using ultrasound is presented. In contrast
   to existing systems, which use 1-D array transducers, a 2-D matrix array
   is used for tracking shear wave displacements. A separate single-element
   transducer is used for radiation force excitation. This system allows
   shear wave propagation in all directions away from the push to be
   observed. It is shown that for a limit of 64 tracking beams, by placing
   the beams at the edges of the measurement region of interest (ROI) at
   multiple directions from the push, time-of-flight (TOF) shear wave speed
   (SWS) measurement uncertainty can theoretically be reduced by 40\%
   compared with equally spacing the tracking beams within the ROI along a
   single plane, as is typical when using a 1-D array for tracking. This
   was verified by simulation, and a reduction of 30\% was experimentally
   observed on a homogeneous phantom. Analytical expressions are presented
   for the relationship between TOF SWS measurement uncertainty and various
   shear wave imaging parameters. It is shown that TOF SWS uncertainty is
   inversely proportional to ROI size, and inversely proportional to the
   square root of the number of tracking locations for a given distribution
   of beam locations relative to the push. TOF SWS uncertainty is shown to
   increase with the square of the SWS, indicating that TOF SWS
   measurements are intrinsically less precise for stiffer materials.}},

Abstract = {{Crumpled graphene films are widely used, for instance in electronics(1),
   energy storage(2,3), composites(4,5) and biomedicine(6). Although it is
   known that the degree of crumpling affects graphene's properties and the
   performance of graphene-based devices and materials(3'5'7), the
   controlled folding and unfolding of crumpled graphene films has not been
   demonstrated. Here we report an approach to reversibly control the
   crumpling and unfolding of large-area graphene sheets. We show with
   experiments, atomistic simulations and theory that, by harnessing the
   mechanical instabilities of graphene adhered on a biaxially
   pre-stretched polymer substrate and by controlling the relaxation of the
   pre-strains in a particular order, graphene films can be crumpled into
   tailored self-organized hierarchical structures that mimic
   superhydrophobic leaves. The approach enables us to fabricate large-area
   conductive coatings and electrodes showing superhydrophobicity, high
   transparency, and tunable wettability and transmittance. We also
   demonstrate that crumpled graphene-polymer laminates can be used as
   artificial-muscle actuators.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Liver is a common site for distal metastases
   in colon and rectal cancer. Numerous clinical studies have analyzed the
   relative merits of different imaging modalities for detection of liver
   metastases. Several exciting new therapies are being investigated in
   preclinical models. But, technical challenges in preclinical imaging
   make it difficult to translate conclusions from clinical studies to the
   preclinical environment. This study addresses the technical challenges
   of preclinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro-computed
   tomography (CT) to enable comparison of state-of-the-art methods for
   following metastatic liver disease.
   Materials and Methods: We optimized two promising preclinical protocols
   to enable a parallel longitudinal study tracking metastatic human colon
   carcinoma growth in a mouse model: T-2-weighted MRI using two-shot
   PROPELLER (Periodically Rotated Overlapping ParallEL Lines with Enhanced
   Reconstruction) and contrast-enhanced micro-CT using a liposomal
   contrast agent. Both methods were tailored for high throughput with
   attention to animal support and anesthesia to limit biological stress.
   Results and Conclusions: Each modality has its strengths. Micro-CT
   permitted more rapid acquisition (<10 minutes) with the highest spatial
   resolution (88-micron isotropic resolution). But detection of metastatic
   lesions requires the use of a blood pool contrast agent, which could
   introduce a confound in the evaluation of new therapies. MRI was slower
   (30 minutes) and had lower anisotropic spatial resolution. But MRI
   eliminates the need for a contrast agent and the contrast-to-noise
   between tumor and normal parenchyma was higher, making earlier detection
   of small lesions possible. Both methods supported a relatively
   high-throughput, longitudinal study of the development of metastatic
   lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue engineered replacement heart valves may be capable of overcoming
   the lack of growth potential intrinsic to current non-viable
   prosthetics, and thus could potentially serve as permanent replacements
   in the surgical repair of pediatric valvular lesions. However, the
   evaluation of candidate combinations of cells and scaffolds lacks a
   biomimetic in vitro model with broadly tunable, anisotropic and
   elastomeric structural-mechanical properties. Toward establishing such
   an in vitro model, in the current study, porcine aortic and pulmonary
   valvular interstitial cells (i.e. biomimetic cells) were cultivated on
   anisotropic, micromolded poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds (i.e.
   biomimetic scaffolds). Following 14 and 28 days of static culture,
   cell-seeded scaffolds and unseeded controls were assessed for their
   mechanical properties, and cell-seeded scaffolds were further
   characterized by confocal fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy,
   and by collagen and DNA assays. Poly(glycerol sebacate) micromolding
   yielded scaffolds with anisotropic stiffnesses resembling those of
   native valvular tissues in the low stress-strain ranges characteristic
   of physiologic valvular function. Scaffold anisotropy was largely
   retained upon cultivation with valvular interstitial cells; while the
   mechanical properties of unseeded scaffolds progressively diminished,
   cell-seeded scaffolds either retained or exceeded initial mechanical
   properties. Retention of mechanical properties in cell-seeded scaffolds
   paralleled the accretion of collagen, which increased significantly from
   14 to 28 days. This study demonstrates that valvular interstitial cells
   can be cultivated on anisotropic poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds to
   yield biomimetic in vitro models with which clinically relevant cells
   and future scaffold designs can be evaluated. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{The study of cell lineage commitment is critical for improving our
   understanding of tissue development and regeneration, and for realizing
   stem cell-based therapies and engineered tissue replacements. Recently,
   the discovery of an unanticipated degree of variability in fundamental
   biological processes, including divergent responses of genetically
   identical cells to various stimuli, has provided mechanistic insight
   into cellular decision making and the collective behavior of cell
   populations. Therefore, the study of lineage commitment with single-cell
   resolution could provide greater knowledge of cellular differentiation
   mechanisms and the influence of noise on cellular processes. This will
   require the adoption of new technologies for single-cell analysis as
   traditional methods typically measure average values of bulk population
   behavior. This review discusses the recent developments in methods for
   analyzing the behavior of individual cells, and how these approaches are
   leading to a deeper understanding and better control of cellular

Abstract = {{Through-silicon via (TSV)-based 3-D stacked ICs are becoming
   increasingly important in the semiconductor industry, yet pre-bond
   testing of TSVs continues to be difficult with current technologies. In
   this paper, we present a test and discrete Fourier transform method for
   pre-bond testing of TSVs using probe technology. We describe the on-die
   test architecture and probe technique needed for TSV testing, in which
   individual probe needles make contact with multiple TSVs at a time. We
   also describe methods for capacitance and resistance measurements, as
   well as stuck-at and leakage tests. Simulation results using HSPICE are
   presented for a TSV network. We demonstrate that we can achieve high
   resolution in these measurements, and therefore high accuracy in defect
   detection when we target one or multiple TSVs at a time. We also show
   that the test outcome is reliable even in the presence of process
   variations or multiple defective TSVs.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Not fully understanding the type of axons activated during
   vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is one of several factors that limit the
   clinical efficacy of VNS therapies. The main goal of this study was to
   characterize the electrical recruitment of both myelinated and
   unmyelinated fibers within the cervical vagus nerve. Approach. In
   anesthetized dogs, recording nerve cuff electrodes were implanted on the
   vagus nerve following surgical excision of the epineurium. Both the
   vagal electroneurogram (ENG) and laryngeal muscle activity were recorded
   in response to stimulation of the right vagus nerve. Main results.
   Desheathing the nerve significantly increased the signal-to-noise ratio
   of the ENG by 1.2 to 9.9 dB, depending on the nerve fiber type. Repeated
   VNS following nerve transection or neuromuscular block (1) enabled the
   characterization of A-fibers, two sub-types of B-fibers, and
   unmyelinated C-fibers, (2) confirmed the absence of stimulation-evoked
   reflex compound nerve action potentials in both the ipsilateral and
   contralateral vagus nerves, and (3) provided evidence of stimulus
   spillover into muscle tissue surrounding the stimulating electrode.
   Significance. Given the anatomical similarities between the canine and
   human vagus nerves, the results of this study provide a template for
   better understanding the nerve fiber recruitment patterns associated
   with VNS therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound imaging has been proposed as a rapid, portable alternative
   imaging modality to examine stroke patients in pre-hospital or emergency
   room settings. However, in performing transcranial ultrasound
   examinations, 8\%-29\% of patients in a general population may present
   with window failure, in which case it is not possible to acquire
   clinically useful sonographic information through the temporal bone
   acoustic window. In this work, we describe the technical considerations,
   design and fabrication of low-frequency (1.2 MHz), large aperture (25.3
   mm) sparse matrix array transducers for 3-D imaging in the event of
   window failure. These transducers are integrated into a system for
   real-time 3-D bilateral transcranial imaging-the ultrasound brain
   helmet-and color flow imaging capabilities at 1.2 MHz are directly
   compared with arrays operating at 1.8 MHz in a flow phantom with
   attenuation comparable to the in vivo case. Contrast-enhanced imaging
   allowed visualization of arteries of the Circle of Willis in 5 of 5
   subjects and 8 of 10 sides of the head despite probe placement outside
   of the acoustic window. Results suggest that this type of transducer may
   allow acquisition of useful images either in individuals with poor
   windows or outside of the temporal acoustic window in the field.

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-221}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Soils, as well as most of deformable multiphase porous materials, are
   likely to suffer from desiccation cracking, leading to the formation of
   regular crack patterns affecting their permeability. The ensuing crack
   spacing has often been related to a concept sometimes called
   ``sequential infilling{''}: it is assumed that desiccation cracks are
   formed by successive generations. However, such a concept does not
   consider the pattern of a simultaneous crack formation at a given
   moment. Using our desiccation cracking test results and their numerical
   simulation, we propose a consistent explanation for the formation of
   desiccation crack patterns in soils. We show that the ``sequential
   infilling{''} concept is suitable only when the position of the crack(s)
   clearly stems from the stress field. To derive an estimate of the
   desiccation crack spacing, the overall energy of the system needs to be
   considered. Statistical variability should be superimposed on the mean
   deterministic conditions discussed here.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Signaling often involves complex suites of behaviors that incorporate
   different sensory modalities. Whatever modality is used to establish
   that a signal functions in communication researchers must demonstrate
   that receivers respond to it. The territory defense response of male
   swamp sparrows involves a variety of behaviors that includes both vocal
   and visual displays. One of these, the ``wing wave{''} display, is a
   distinctive movement that predicts physical attack. Here, we use robotic
   taxidermic mounts paired with song to test the hypothesis that wing
   waving is a signal and, specifically, that male receivers respond to
   wing waving as a signal of aggressive intent. As predicted, subjects
   responded more aggressively to the mount during wing waving trials than
   during stationary trials. A second experiment demonstrated that this
   effect cannot be attributed simply to increased attention to movement.
   Less expectedly, subjects did not alter their own display behavior in
   response to wing waving as compared to a static mount. We conclude that
   the wing wave display in the context of singing is a signal that
   functions in male-male aggressive communication. Questions remain,
   including whether wing waving functions as a signal in the absence of
   singing and whether wing waving and song are redundant signals or
   communicate different information.}},

Abstract = {{We present a formulation of the discontinuous Galerkin method aimed for
   simulations of gravity-driven viscous fingering instabilities occurring
   in porous media flow. Specifically, we are targeting applications
   characterized by complex geometrical features. Viscous fingering
   instabilities play a very important role in carbon sequestration in
   brine aquifers. The proposed method has the ability to preserve high
   order of accuracy on completely unstructured meshes, a feature that
   makes it ideal for high-fidelity computations of the challenging
   fingering flow patterns and very complex geometries of actual reservoirs

Abstract = {{In this study, hyperpolarized 129Xe MR ventilation and 1H anatomical
   images were obtained from three subject groups: young healthy volunteers
   (HVs), subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and
   age-matched controls (AMCs). Ventilation images were quantified by two
   methods: an expert reader-based ventilation defect score percentage
   (VDS\%) and a semi-automated segmentation-based ventilation defect
   percentage (VDP). Reader-based values were assigned by two experienced
   radiologists and resolved by consensus. In the semi-automated analysis,
   1H anatomical images and 129Xe ventilation images were both segmented
   following registration to obtain the thoracic cavity volume and
   ventilated volume, respectively, which were then expressed as a ratio to
   obtain the VDP. Ventilation images were also characterized by generating
   signal intensity histograms from voxels within the thoracic cavity
   volume, and heterogeneity was analyzed using the coefficient of
   variation (CV). The reader-based VDS\% correlated strongly with the
   semi-automatically generated VDP (r=0.97, p<0.0001) and with CV (r=0.82,
   p<0.0001). Both 129Xe ventilation defect scoring metrics readily
   separated the three groups from one another and correlated significantly
   with the forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) (VDS\%: r=0.78, p=0.0002;
   VDP: r=0.79, p=0.0003; CV: r=0.66, p=0.0059) and other pulmonary
   function tests. In the healthy subject groups (HVs and AMCs), the
   prevalence of ventilation defects also increased with age (VDS\%:
   r=0.61, p=0.0002; VDP: r=0.63, p=0.0002). Moreover, ventilation
   histograms and their associated CVs distinguished between subjects with
   COPD with similar ventilation defect scores, but visibly different
   ventilation patterns. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},
